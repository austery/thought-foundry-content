### 嵊泗教育改革：人口困境下的普高入学新模式

在教育领域，人口结构的变化正驱动着前所未有的改革。浙江省嵊泗县近期因一项教育政策引发了广泛关注：该县宣布将取消高中入学选拔功能，实现普通高中教育的“零门槛”入学。具体而言，从2025年秋季学期开始，嵊泗县将全面取消普通高中最低录取分数线，确保所有报名参加普通高中录取的初中毕业生都能被录取，从而实现全员升学。此举旨在解决当地教育资源分配不均，特别是针对岛屿人口的教育难题。

然而，这一政策的初衷和实际执行细节引发了讨论。最初的报道被解读为“取消中考”，但随后县教育局澄清，政策并非取消考试本身，而是取消其“选拔功能”。这意味着初中毕业生仍需参加考试，但所有人都将进入普通高中。不过，学生在进入高中一年级后，将有机会进行分流，并可根据自身情况选择进入职业高中。对于无法跟上普通高中课程进度的学生，职业高中将成为一个选择。尽管许多网民呼吁在全国推广此模式，但嵊泗县的决策是基于其独特的本地人口趋势。

嵊泗县地处舟山群岛最东端，是一个由631个岛屿组成的县域。根据2015年的统计，其户籍人口为7.75万人，而到2024年，常住人口仅为6.4万人。更值得注意的是，该县已连续三年出现人口负增长，自然增长率高达-6.6‰。去年，新生儿数量仅为148人，远低于初中毕业生人数（266人）。目前，嵊泗县仅有一所普通高中（容纳256名学生）和一所职业学校（容纳125名学生）。通过普及职业教育，有助于留住原本可能外流的学生。2025年秋季学期起，在外地就读的学生已有9人选择回乡就读，初高中生本地就读率达到93.99%，学生外流情况相比五年前已减少近10个百分点。如果继续依赖竞争性考试进行选拔，家长可能会选择将孩子送往学业标准更严格的地区；但若孩子能直接在家乡升学，他们则可能选择回流。在人口稀少地区，解决学位问题相对容易，但对于人口大县而言则难度倍增。

从全国范围看，初中生数量在今年达到顶峰，高中生数量预计将在2029年达到峰值。未来几年是教育系统面临的严峻挑战期。然而，从出生率趋势来看，嵊泗的现状或许预示着全国的未来。自2022年起，出生人口已低于大学毕业生数量。去年，新生儿为792万，而大学毕业生高达1159万。若大学扩招规模保持不变，18年后，不仅人人能直升高中，甚至可能直升大学。人口趋势正驱动教育改革，这或许将成为未来考试的考题之一。高考的本质是为了就业，但高等教育的投资回报率正在导致就业机会的同质化，个体应如何选择，成为一个值得深思的问题。

Hello everyone . I'm, your substitute anchor Xoong, and welcome to the 55 9 th episode of reference information In. This county , 100 % of junior high school graduates with local household registration and their children have been admitted to regular senior high schools . This has sparked widespread public discussion about a reform of the high school entrance examination in Xingxi County. On January 2 2x i County education Bureau issued a document st. Thatingxi County will abolish the selection function of the high school entrance examination, achieving universal access to regular senior schools. It introduced measures to address the difficulties in allocating educational resources for the island population, an innovative mechanisms to establish universal access to senior high school within the county, starting from the fall semester of 202 5 The minimum score threshold for admission to regular senior high schools will be completely abolished . All 2 66 junior high school graduates, who applied for regular senior high school will be admitted . achieving universal access to education. The article was interpreted as abolishing the high school entrance examination, but a single county cannot decide whether to abolish the examination or not Later. The article was taken down, and a staff member of the county education. Bureau responded that some wording in the article needed to be revised and the article was temporarily withdrawn. They stated that abolishing the selection function of the high school entrance examination is not the same as abolishing the examination itself . we have not abolish the high school entrance examination . thehan Un education Bureau to whichingxi. Belonglongs also stated that after S hank xi . A boli shes, the selection function of the high school entrance examination , junior high school graduates will still need to participate in the examination , and they can all enter regular senior high schools . H owever , students will have the opportunity to be streamed in the first year of senior school, and they can choose to go to vocational high school based on their actual situation . Some students who cannot keep up with the regular senior high school curriculum will choose vocational high school. Many netizen suggested that this should be promoted nationwide , but this is a choice made by Shengxi based on local population trends. Shengxi is located in the easternmost part of Xjoan province in the northernmost part of the Zshan Islands with 63 1 islands. It has three towns and four townships in 2015. It had a registered population of 77 500 and in 202 4, the permanent population with 6400 with a natural population growth rate of- 6. 6, a negative growth for nearly 3 consecutive years. The number of birth to net year was 148, which is only 15, more than half of the 2 66 junior high school graduates. Shangxi currently has one regular senior high school with 256 students and one vocational school with 12 5 students. Uni access to vocational education helps to retain students who would otherwise leave the area in the fall semester of 202 59 students who were studying outside the area, return the retention rate of students from primary to junior high school reach 93 . 99 %, and the outflow of students decreased by nearly 10 percentage points compared to five years ago. If selection is based on competitive exams . parents might send their children to other regions with stricter academic standards H owever , if their children can directly enter high school. H ome town, they might send them back. However, , in areas with small populations , the problem of school places is easily solved while it's much more difficult than areas with large populations. Nationwide , the number of junior high school students peak this year, and the number of high school students is expected to peak in 202 9. These next few years are the most challenging. However, , looking at the birth rate trends, What is happening today might be possible nationwide tomorrow. Since 202 2, the number of births has been less than the number of university graduates. Last year, there were 7. 92 million newborns and 1.2 2 million university graduates. If universities maintain their current skill in 18 years, not only will everyone be able to go directly to high school, but also directly to university population trends are driving education reform, and it is expected to become a question on the entrance exam. The college entrance exam is for employment, but the return on investment in higher education is leading to less differentiation in employment opportunities. How should one choose

### “寒门状元”的职业反思与网络回响

这种对职业选择的迷茫和对人生道路的追问，并非个例，而是许多人在快速变化的社会中所面临的共同挑战。近期，一位毕业于**武汉大学（Wuhan University of Technology）**的毕业生因其职业选择——成为一名保安——而引发了母校的关注和网络上的热烈讨论。有人认为这是个人博眼球、抹黑母校的行为，也有人认为其职业生涯中的“失误”能为他人提供宝贵教训，还有人则认为校方的回应显得缺乏自信。

这位名叫尚某的先生，41岁，来自湖北省大冶县。他曾是村里第一个考上重点大学的学生。2008年，他放弃了攻读硕士的机会，选择进入一家当时鲜为人知的汽车制造公司。他的父亲误以为是国营大厂，是个“铁饭碗”，但他本人却感到一丝失望。他的女友去了另一家公司，月薪600元。尚某工作两个月后便辞职，计划去别处赚更多钱。然而，那些留在他原公司的同学，如今已成为公司中高层管理人员。

辞职后，他前往宁波一家外贸公司工作。一年后，公司仅将他的薪资提高了300元，年终奖不足1000元。他熟悉了行业，但觉得公司业务过于细分，未来发展有限，于是跳槽到一家外贸服装公司。两年间，他经历了行业的起伏，也面临了各种诱惑和机会。在宁波期间，他拒绝了一位公司老板让他做女婿的提议；在淘宝网店刚刚兴起时，他也婉拒了朋友的创业邀请。

回到武汉后，他进入了另一家外贸公司，经历了行业从高峰到低谷的过山车式起伏。大约在2020年，他因各种原因创业失败，之后失业三年，直到2025年底，经朋友介绍才成为一名保安。在此之前，他的社交账号曾发布过一些辅导孩子英语的内容。成为保安后，有了更多空闲时间，他才开始分享自己的工作经历，其中几段视频获得了数百万的观看量。

尚先生表示，他最初的意图是与网友分享经验，帮助年轻学生“避坑”，但没想到这些经历能引起如此广泛的共鸣。他总结道，许多来自农村的学生视野相对狭窄，对考研和求职感到迷茫。评论区也有许多网友分享了类似的感受：“我当年特别渴望有过来人告诉我某个专业或行业的发展前景，但可惜没有。”尚先生提到，视频走红后，武汉大学的宣传部通过辅导员联系了他，询问了他的经历和遇到的困难，但并未干涉其发布的内容。他认为，他的妻子也是一所大学的副教授，并不觉得他发布的关于“大批中成药企业退出市场”的内容是什么大事。

### 中成药市场洗牌：监管收紧与健康中国战略

在关注个体职业发展的同时，关乎国民健康的产业也正经历深刻的变革。根据《21世纪经济报道》，国家药监局发布的《传统药管理办法》征求意见稿中的一项条款，被称为“生死条款”，正对中成药市场产生巨大影响。该规定要求，自2023年7月1日实施之日起三年内，若药品说明书中关于禁忌、不良反应或注意事项的内容仍不明确，该药品将无法获得批准上市。据行业估计，这可能导致约70%以上、存在安全信息和标签问题的现有批准文号被淘汰。

然而，现实情况可能更为复杂。最受影响的是所谓的“僵尸药”——即拥有批准文号但长期未生产销售、缺乏上市后不良反应监测数据的药品。一些企业在权衡经济效益后，可能会选择主动放弃注册。部分药企表示，自2023年政策出台后，他们已着手改进产品说明，该政策对他们影响不大。

《人民日报》也发文支持中医药发展，认为此举将更好地保障公众安全用药。但长期以来，中成药的高价和不良反应问题屡受关注。2018年国家基本药物目录中，465个中成药说明书里，不良反应、禁忌和药物相互作用的标示率仅分别为2.64%、30.1%和1.07%。2022年国家中药监管蓝皮书显示，中国约有2400家中成药生产企业，9000多个中药品种，但存在大量低水平重复和临床价值不明的问题，导致批准数量与行业质量严重不匹配。

今年2月，国务院发布了关于提升中药质量、促进中药产业高质量发展的意见，提出要完善中药批准文号的退出机制，实现“有进有出”，标志着过去那种“1+N”的中药批准文号堆积时代即将结束。预计未来三到五年，将有30%-40%的中成药退出市场。

一项发表在《中国经济问题》的研究质疑了取消药品加成能否降低医疗费用。研究利用多城市县级公立医院门诊数据，分析了2013-2017年间3000多名患者的医疗服务成本数据，发现自2010年实施药品加成政策后，门诊药费、非药费及总费用均显著增加。其原因在于中成药成本的大幅上涨以及诊疗服务费用的提升。中成药价格易被操纵，利润空间巨大，药品注册的返利甚至可达70%。加之医保支付改革中对中成药的某种偏好，一些医院乐于接受。

今年实施的最新医保药品目录，共包含3253种药品，其中中成药1335种。目录中仍包含49种含有穿山甲鳞片、虎骨、海马等八种濒危野生动物成分的药品。国家医保局在2020年发布的《基本医疗保险药品管理暂行规定》中明确，不予纳入医保目录的药品包括含有贵重、濒危野生动植物成分的药品。目前的做法与此前的规定存在矛盾。

1月26日，国家卫健委举行新闻发布会，介绍“三医联动”改革促进中医药新发展的情况。国家中医药管理局医政司司长表示，中医药已全面融入“健康中国”战略，目前已实现全国三级公立医院中医科室全覆盖，并开展了针对儿童青少年近视、斜视、近视的干预试点。去年6月，国家中医药管理局已披露相关进展：23个地区开展了儿童青少年肥胖中医干预试点，26个地区和三个省份开展了脊柱侧弯中医试点。首批60项儿童青少年近视防治中医技术已取得积极进展。在基本公共卫生服务方面，截至2024年，共有2597万名0-36个月的儿童接受了中医药健康服务，包括饮食调养和活动指导。

2022年，中国儿童青少年总体近视率达到51.9%，其中小学为4.7%，初中71.4%，高中81.2%。总体近视率较2021年的52.6%有所下降，但未来三年的数据尚未公布，下降趋势能否维持尚需持续关注。

关于中医药能否预防和治疗近视，全国儿童青少年近视防控中心主任表示，在养成良好用眼习惯、改善用眼环境、科学验配眼镜的基础上，通过眼保健操、穴位按摩、针灸、拔罐及口服中药等中医技术，可以有效预防和控制近视的发生发展。眼保健操自上世纪60年代起广泛应用，是一种依据中医理论，通过刺激神经、放松眼部肌肉、促进眼周血液循环、缓解眼疲劳的眼部穴位按摩法。然而，大规模国际研究表明，唯一有效的近视预防方法是增加户外活动时间，保证每天至少两小时。但对许多学生而言，每天两小时的户外时间几乎是一种奢侈。校园内学生户外时间常被挤占，课外辅导“双减”后转入地下，各种辅导机构，尤其是线上平台，填满了儿童青少年的课余时间。

国家卫健委等13部门近期发布了《儿童青少年健康行动计划（2022-2025年）》，近视防控目标是到2030年，0-6岁儿童和中小学生视力筛查率将逐步提高，6岁儿童近视率控制在5%左右，小学生近视率下降到32%以下，初中生降至60%以下，高中生近视率进一步降低。

of a large number of traditional Chinese medicine companies withdrawing from the market should be a big deal . The 75 th article of its special Reg on the Reg management of traditional Chinese medicine issued by the state administration of traditional Chinese medicine in 202 3 is about to be implemented with only six months remaining in the grace period. The regulation states that starting three years after its implementation on July 1202 3 If. Any of the contraindications adverse reactions or precautions in the instructions are still unclear, Reg will be impossible. And thus, the product cannot be marketed according to 21 st. Century business herald. This is known in the industry as of life or death clause , meaning that more than 70 % of the approximately 5 700 0 existing valid approval numbers for traditional Chinese medicine products, which have safety information, labeling issues face elimination . however, , the reality is not so optimistic. The most effect are the so-called zombie drug approvals, , drugs that have registration certificates, but have not been produced or sold for a long time, lacking postmarketing, adversere monitoring data, etc. Some companies after weighing the economic benefits will abandon their registration . I . S ever al drug manufacturers have indicated that after the policy was introduced in 202 3, they have begun to improve their product descriptions , and the policy has had little impact on them. The People's Daily also expressed support for traditional Chinese medicine TC, stating that this will better ensure the safe use of TCM by the public. The high prices and adverse reactions of TCM have repeatedly attracted attention in the 2018 edition of the nationalEssential medicines list among the 46 5 instructions for 8 types of TCM. The labeling rates for adverse reactions, , countryindations and drug interactions were only 2. 64 % 30 . 1 % and 1. 07 %, respectively. , the 202 2 national TCm supervision blue book shows that there are approximately 2400 TCM manufacturers, and more than 900 0 Tcm varieties in C hina , but there is a large amount of low- level duplication and unclear clinical value , resulting in a serious mismatch between the number of approvals and the quality of the industry. In February of this year, , the state council issued an opinion on improving the quality of TCM and promoting the high- quality development of the TCM industry. , proposing to improve the withdrawal mechanism for TCM approval numbers , I, some any eliminate others. , marking the end of the era of 1 hn der 0 TCM approval accumulation in the next three to five years. , 3t o4 out of 10 T c. W ill exit the market . A study published on economic issues in China question, whether canceling drug price markups can reduce medical expenses research using outpatient data from countylevel public hospitals in multiple cities. , studying the medical service costs data of more than 300 00 patients in five cities from 2013 to 201 7 showed that after the drug markup policy was implemented in 2010, outpatient drug costs, non-drug costs and total costs increase significantly. The reason is the substantial increase in TCM costs and the rise in diagnosis and treatment service fees. Tcm prices are easily manipulated due to huge profit margins and drug registration rebates can even reach 70 %, coupled with a certain bias towards TCM in the DP payment reform. Some hospitals are happy to accept this. The latest medical insurance catalog implemented this year includes 325 3 types of drugs, including 13, 35 types of traditional Chinese medicine TC. It still includes 49 drugs containing ingredients from eight endangered animal species such as pangolin scales, , tiger, bones and seahorses, the national health security administration NHSA stipulated in its . 202 0 regulations on basic medical insurance drug management that drugs containing precious and endangered wild animal and plant components will not be included in the medical insurance catalog . This current practice and regulation contradict the previous statement on January 26. The National Health Commission held a press conference to introduce the experience of promoting the three reforms in one innovation initiative in promoting the new development of traditional Chinese medicineine The, director of the Department of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine integration and minority medicine of the national administration of Tra Chinese. Mediine mentioned the TCM has been fully integrated into the Healthy China A, and currently it has achieved full coverage of all departments in tertiary public hospitals, nationwide carrying out TCM intervention pilot programs for children and adolescents with myopia, Ob and scoliosis In fact , in June. Last year, , the national administration of traditional Chinese medicine, specifically disclosed related progress 23 regions, conducted TCM intervention pilot programs for Child and adolescent obesity 26 regions, and three provinces conducted TCM pilot programs for scoliosis and the first batch of 60 TCM intervention techniques for preventing and controlling myopia in children and adolescents, achieve positive progress in basic public health services by 202 4, a total of 25 . 97 million children aged 0. 36 months have received TCM health services , including dietary guidance and activity guidance, In 202 2 ,. The overall myopia rate among Chinese children and adolescents reached 5 1. 9 % , including 4.7 % in primary school, , 7 1.4 % in junior high school and 8 1.2 % in senior high school. The overall myopia rate decrease from 52 . 6 % in 202 1, but data for the following three years has not yet been released, whether the downward trend can be maintained, requires continuous attention, can TCM prevent and treat myopia Kong Zong, director of the national traditional Chinese medicine center for prevention and treatment of myopia in children and adolescents stated that on the basis of developing good eye habits, improving the eye environmentron and scientifically fitting glasses ,. The application of TCM techniques such as eye exercises, a regular accupressure acupuncture, cupping and oral TCM can effectively prevent and control the occurrence and development of myopia. The eye exercise widely used since the 19 60s is a massage technique for accuup pointss around the eyes guided by traditional Chinese medicine theory. It relaxes eye muscles by stimulating nerves, promotes blood circulation around the eyes and relieves eye fatigue . H owever , large - scale international studies have shown that the only effective method to prevent myopia is to increase outdoor activity time , ensuring at least two hours per day , but for many students, , two hours of outdoor time daily is almost a luxury on campus. Students. Outdoor time is often squeezed out and after the crackdown on afterchool tutoring, tutoring has moved underground various tutoring institutions, especially online platforms, fill children and teenagers leisure time.

Children will be controlled at around 3 %. The myopia rate for primary school students will decrease to below 32 % for junior high school students to below 60 % and for senior high school students to a lower level

### 数字时代的反官僚主义：政务App瘦身记

当政府服务走向数字化，新的挑战也随之而来，尤其是在如何避免形式主义和减轻基层负担方面。近期，随着江苏省无锡市“锡山教育通”App的关停，全省市县级政府服务类App被全部取消，剩余的政务服务应用均迁移至“苏服办”App。这种现象是数字时代官僚主义的一种变体，也是基层负担加重的主要表现之一。

2024年8月，两部门联合发布了《关于进一步优化政务服务提升效能 持续减轻基层负担的若干措施》，要求清理整合面向基层、重复建设的政务服务App。9月，江苏省上线了“苏服办”App，实现了综合性注册管理。2025年6月，明确要求不得再开发省级以下政务服务App，现有应用需在年底前迁移至“苏服办”。这仅仅是全国政务服务App集中清理的冰山一角。

截至2025年9月，广东省已完成233个政务App和179个政务小程序备案，并关停了52个低效政务App和32个政务小程序。1月下旬，广西政务App全面停止更新，并同步启动账号注销流程，所有原有App内容和服务将整合迁移至“桂政通”App。截至11月，浙江湖州已关停135个低效App，合并转运1个功能类似App，节约CPU核心3200余个，释放内存8400余GB，腾出存储空间220余TB，相当于数百台服务器的工作内存，预计节省政府资金1600万元。截至12月，四川省已整合超过10000个政务移动互联网应用，较集中整治前（2024年）减少14%，政府移动应用数量减少32%。

近期，国务院印发了《政府移动互联网应用程序标准管理办法》，要求不得出现以下情形：1.随意重复要求基层单位填报表格、报送数据、提供材料；2.设置强制性打卡、签到、定位、在线时长计算等功能（涉及安全保密等特殊场景规定除外）；3.强制推广使用、考核用户安装使用率、强制定期登录，并将政务App作为日常工作考核的主要载体；4.在线监管检查中，以点赞、网络投票、分享、学习时长等作为评价标准；5.在非必要情况下，强制要求下级和基层单位通过政务App上传工作照片、视频、轨迹等。该办法还要求各地各部门要整治数据过度采集、排名滥用、多头报送等问题。目前，使用频率低、用户体验差的政务App正逐步关停，功能雷同、重复建设的则进行整合迁移。

Recently, with the closure of the Chiishhan education payment app in Wusi Cityhgsu province, , all provincial and subprovincial government service apps were canceled totaling . T. He remaining government service applications were all migrated to the Suhuan app . T. His formalism is a variation of bureaucracy in the digital context, and one of the main manifestations of increased burden on grassroots levels.

### 地方财政承压：新能源项目退补贴潮

地方政府债务、财政改革以及政府投资是当前地方财政的三个重要主题。在土地财政难以为继的背景下，许多地方接手了大量剩余的新能源项目。如今，在地方财政压力和相关产业产能过剩的双重挤压下，一些地方开始向企业追缴补贴和建设资金。

近期，**ST 穆 邦（ST Mu Bang）**宣布，广西梧州 municipal government ordered the company to return 510 million yuan in financial subsidies and construction funds to the Wuzhou Gaoxing district Management Committee and the Wuzhou Management Committee of the Yiguang Special Economic Zone Finance and Financial Bureau, and to pay 51 million yuan in liquidated damages. 该项目涉及投资52亿元，建设一个年产能超10吉瓦的太阳能电池生产基地，项目时间早于2022年7月。梧州 municipal government dispersed 510 million yuan to ST Mu Bang and its subsidiaries at the end of 2023. But the project repeatedly failed to start production after construction. Last July, the company was ordered to return the funds and bear the liability for breach of contract.

**英联汽车电子（Yijing Auto Electronics）**，作为光伏行业首家上市公司，去年底公告称其在徐州的项目收到合作方函件后，终止了投资协议，并追回了1.4亿元投资款。**邦吉公司（Bangji Company Limited）**也公告称，收到法院裁定，启动了对公司的预重整程序。重整申请人苏州集优企业管理有限公司（Washou Lakesu Wang）于2023年向邦吉公司的一家子公司投资了3亿元。后因邦吉公司未能按时完成股份回购，赔偿了3260万元。此外，邦吉公司2023年与扬州江都区签订的光伏合作项目，也因2025年市场环境变化而终止，公司被要求赔偿1500万元。

上述项目大多起源于2022年——光伏产业的快速增长年。彼时，传统企业大规模扩张产能，许多跨界企业也涌入行业追逐热点、赚取利润。上述三家光伏企业中，有两家是跨界企业：ST 穆邦是玩具公司，被称为“中国乐高”；邦吉公司主要从事服装制造。ST 穆邦在协议中曾明确表示，公司当时并未从事太阳能电池业务，缺乏相关人才和技术储备。英联汽车电子也曾预警称，其投资的光伏电池组件产品尚未大规模生产，也未经过客户验证，后续销售存在不确定性。

然而，在行业爆发期，地方政府高度重视光伏产业的招商引资。例如，广州县政府成立了专项小组，协调处理某光电公司的审批、建设和运营事宜，提供了100亩土地的供应保障以及政府承担厂区内变电站建设等多种低成本生产要素。而梧州 municipal government 则提出投资建设厂房及配套设施，给予ST 6年免租金使用权，并提供实质性融资支持。

自2023年下半年起，光伏行业产能过剩问题爆发，导致行业内持续的减产和产能控制。部分地区过度招商引资的负面效应正逐渐显现，是时候进行问责了。
