## The Importance of Communication Skills

PATRICK WINSTON: The Uniform Code of Military Justice specifies court martial for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon.
帕特里克·温斯顿: **统一军事司法法典**（Uniform Code of Military Justice: 美国军事法律的基础，规定了所有现役军人的行为准则）规定，任何军官若将未携带武器的士兵送入战场，将受到军事法庭的审判。

There ought to be a similar protection for students because students shouldn't go out into life without the ability to communicate, and that's because your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas, in that order.
学生也应该受到类似的保护，因为学生不应该在不具备沟通能力的情况下去面对生活。这是因为你在生活中的成功将主要取决于你的口语表达能力、写作能力以及你想法的质量，且顺序正是如此。

I know that I can be successful in this because the quality of communication, your speaking, your writing, is largely determined by this formula.
我知道我可以在这方面取得成功，因为沟通的质量，即你的演讲和写作，很大程度上取决于这个公式。

It's a matter of how much knowledge you have, how much you practice with that knowledge, and your inherent talent, and notice that the T is very small.
这取决于你拥有多少知识，你对这些知识进行了多少练习，以及你与生俱来的天赋，请注意，T（天赋）在这个公式中占比很小。

What really matters is what you know.
真正重要的是你知道什么。

This point came to me suddenly a few decades ago when I was skiing at Sun Valley.
几十年前，当我在太阳谷滑雪时，我突然意识到了这一点。

I had heard that it was Celebrity Weekend, and one of the celebrities was Mary Lou Retton, famous Olympic gymnast, perfect 10s in the vault.
我听说那是“名人周末”，其中一位名人是 Mary Lou Retton，著名的奥林匹克体操运动员，曾在跳马项目中获得满分 10 分。

And I heard that she was a novice at skiing, so when the opportune moment arrived, I looked over on the novice slope and saw this young woman who, when she became unbalanced, went like that.
我听说她是滑雪新手，所以当时机成熟时，我看向初学者坡道，看到这位年轻女士在失去平衡时，动作是那样的。

And I said that's got to be her. That must be the gymnast.
我说那就是她。那肯定是那位体操运动员。

But then, it occurred to me, I'm a much better skier than she is, and she's an Olympic athlete-- not only an ordinary Olympic athlete, an outstanding one.
但紧接着我意识到，我是一个比她好得多的滑雪者，而她是一名奥林匹克运动员——不仅仅是一名普通的奥林匹克运动员，而是一名杰出的运动员。

And I was a better skier because I had the K, and I had the P, and all she had was the T.
我之所以滑雪比她好，是因为我有 K（知识）和 P（练习），而她只有 T（天赋）。

So you can get a lot better than people who may have inherent talents if you have the right amount of knowledge.
所以，如果你拥有适量的知识，你可以比那些可能有天赋的人做得好得多。

## The Empowerment Promise

So that's what my objective is today, and here's my promise.
这就是我今天的目标，这是我的承诺。

Today, you will see some examples of what you can put in your armamentarium of speaking techniques, and it will be the case that some one of those examples, some heuristic, some technique, maybe only one, will make-- will be the one that gets you the job.
今天，你将看到一些可以放入你演讲**技能库**（Armamentarium: 医生或机构可用的药物、设备或技术的集合，此处指演讲技巧的集合）中的例子。事实将是，这些例子中的某一个，某种**启发式方法**（Heuristic: 基于经验的解决问题或学习的方法），某种技巧，也许只有一个，将成为帮你获得工作的那一个。

And so this is a very non-linear process.
所以这是一个非常非线性的过程。

You never know when it's going to happen, but that is my promise.
你永远不知道它什么时候会发生，但这就是我的承诺。

By the end of the next 60 minutes, you'll have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you'll incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.
在接下来的 60 分钟结束时，你将接触到很多想法，你会将其中一些融入你自己的技能库中，它们将确保你有最大的机会让你交流的对象重视并接受你的想法。

Now, in order to do that, we have to have a rule of engagement, and that is no laptops, no cell phones.
现在，为了做到这一点，我们必须有一条参与规则，那就是不使用笔记本电脑，不使用手机。

So if you could close those, I'll start up as soon as you're done.
所以如果你们能把这些合上，你们一合上我就开始。

Some people ask why that is a rule of engagement, and the answer is, we humans only have one language processor.
有些人问为什么这是参与规则，答案是，我们人类只有一个语言处理器。

And if your language processor is enga-- could you shut the laptop, please?
如果你的语言处理器正在——你能合上笔记本电脑吗，拜托了？

If your language processor is engaged browsing the web or reading your email, you're distracted.
如果你的语言处理器正忙于浏览网页或阅读电子邮件，你就分心了。

And worse yet, you distract all of the people around you. Studies have shown that.
更糟糕的是，你会让你周围的所有人都分心。研究已经表明了这一点。

And worse yet, if I see a open laptop somewhere back there or up here, it drives me nuts, and I do a worse job.
再糟糕一点，如果我看到后面或者前面有打开的笔记本电脑，我会抓狂，我的表现就会变差。

And so that ensures that all of your friends who are paying attention don't get the performance that they came to have.
这就导致你所有正在集中注意力的朋友都无法获得他们本该获得的演讲效果。

So that's it for preamble. Let's get started.
开场白就到这里。让我们开始吧。

## How to Start a Presentation

First thing we talk about, of course, is how to start.
当然，我们要谈的第一件事是如何开始。

Some people think the right thing to do is to start a talk with a joke.
有些人认为正确的做法是以一个笑话开始演讲。

I don't recommend it, and the reason is that, in the beginning of a talk, people are still putting their laptops away.
我不推荐这样做，原因是在演讲开始时，人们还在收起他们的笔记本电脑。

They're becoming adjusted to your speaking parameters, to your vocal parameters, and they're not ready for a joke.
他们正在适应你的说话参数，你的声音参数，他们还没有准备好听笑话。

So it doesn't work very well. They usually fall flat.
所以效果通常不好。笑话通常会冷场。

What you want to do instead is start with empowerment promise.
相反，你想做的是以一个赋能承诺开始。

You want to tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour.
你要告诉人们，在这一小时结束时，他们会知道哪些他们在这一小时开始时不知道的事情。

It's an empowerment promise. It's the reason for being here.
这是一个赋能承诺。这就是大家在这里的原因。

What would be an example? Oh, I see.
什么是一个例子？噢，我明白了。

At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don't know now, and something among those things you know will make a difference in your life.
在这 60 分钟结束时，你将知道一些你现在不知道的关于演讲的事情，而你知道的这些事情中的某一件将会给你的生活带来改变。

Yeah, that's an empowerment promise, so that's the best way to start.
是的，那就是一个赋能承诺，所以那是最好的开始方式。

## Heuristics for Speaking

So now that I've talked a little bit about how to start, what I want to do is give you some samples of heuristics that are always on my mind when I give a talk, and first of these heuristics is that it's a good idea to cycle on the subject.
既然我已经谈了一些关于如何开始的内容，我想做的是给你们一些我在演讲时总是记在心里的**启发式方法**的例子，第一个启发式方法是：循环论述主题是一个好主意。

Go around it. Go round it again. Go round it again.
围绕它讲。再围绕它讲一遍。再讲一遍。

Some people say, tell him what you want to tell him. Tell him again, and then tell him a third time, as if people weren't intelligent.
有些人说，告诉他你想告诉他的。再告诉他一遍，然后再告诉他第三遍，好像人们不聪明似的。

But the point is-- the reason is-- well, there are many reasons, one of which is, at any given moment, about 20% of you will be fogged out no matter what the lecture is.
但重点是——原因是——嗯，有很多原因，其中之一是，在任何给定的时刻，无论讲座内容是什么，你们中大约 20% 的人都会走神。

So if you want to ensure that the probability that everybody gets it is high, you need to say it three times.
所以，如果你想确保每个人都理解的概率很高，你需要说三遍。

So cycling is one of the things that I always think about when I give a talk.
所以循环是我演讲时总是考虑的事情之一。

Another thing I think about is, in explaining my idea, I want to build a fence around it so that it's not confused with somebody else's idea.
我想到的另一件事是，在解释我的想法时，我想给它建一道围栏，以免它与别人的想法混淆。

So if you were from Mars, and I was teaching you about what an arch is, I might say to you, well, that's an arch.
如果你来自火星，而我在教你什么是拱门，我可能会对你说，嗯，那是一个拱门。

And that's not to be confused with some other things that other people might think is-- this is not an arch.
这不能和其他人可能认为是——这不被认为是拱门的东西混淆。

That's not an arch.
那不是拱门。

I'm building a fence around my idea so that it can be distinguished from somebody else's idea.
我在给我的想法建一道围栏，以便它能与别人的想法区分开来。

So in a more technical sense, I might say, well, my algorithm might similar-- might seem similar to Jones's algorithm, except his is exponential, and mine's linear.
所以在更专业的层面上，我可能会说，嗯，我的算法可能看起来与 Jones 的算法相似，除了他是指数级的，而我是线性的。

That's putting a fence around your idea so that people can not be confused about how it might relate to something else.
这就是给你的想法建一道围栏，这样人们就不会对它与其他事物的关系感到困惑。

The third thing on this list of samples is the idea of verbal punctuation.
这个例子清单上的第三件事是口头标点符号的想法。

And the idea here is that, because people will occasionally fog out and need to get back on the bus, you need to provide some landmark places where you're announcing that it's a good time to get back on.
这里的想法是，因为人们偶尔会走神，需要重新回到“车”上，你需要提供一些标志性的地方，宣布现在是重新上车的好时机。

So I might, in this talk, say something about this being my outline.
所以，在这次演讲中，我可能会说这是我的大纲。

The first thing we're going to do is talk about how to start.
我们要做的第一件事是谈论如何开始。

Then we're going to deal with these four samples, and among these four samples, I've talked about the first idea-- that's cycling.
然后我们要处理这四个样本，在这四个样本中，我已经谈到了第一个想法——那就是循环。

The second idea, building-- and now, the third idea is verbal punctuation.
第二个想法，构建围栏——现在，第三个想法是口头标点符号。

So I'm enumerating and providing numbers.
所以我正在枚举并提供数字。

I'm giving you a sense that there's a seam in the talk, and you can get back on.
我给你们一种感觉，演讲中有个接缝，你们可以重新跟上。

So now, we're on a roll, and since we're on a roll, can you guess what fourth idea might be here-- an idea that helps people get back on the bus?
所以现在，我们进展顺利，既然我们进展顺利，你能猜到第四个想法可能是什么吗——一个帮助人们重新上车的想法？

AUDIENCE: Ask a question.
观众: 提问。

PATRICK WINSTON: Yes?
帕特里克·温斯顿: 什么？

AUDIENCE: Ask a question.
观众: 提问。

PATRICK WINSTON: Ask a question, yes. Thank you.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 提问，是的。谢谢。

So ask a question.
所以提一个问题。

And so I will ask a question-- how much dead air can there be?
所以我将问一个问题——可以有多少死寂时间（沉默时间）？

How long can I pause? I counted seven seconds.
我可以停顿多久？我数了七秒钟。

It seemed like an eternity to me to wait and not say anything for seven seconds, but that's the standard amount of time you can wait for an answer.
对我来说，等待且七秒钟不说话似乎像是一个世纪，但这正是你可以等待答案的标准时间。

And of course, the question has to be carefully chosen.
当然，问题必须精心选择。

It can't be too obvious because then people will be embarrassed to say it, but the answers can't be too hard because then nobody will have anything to say.
它不能太明显，因为那样人们会不好意思说出来，但答案也不能太难，因为那样就没有人能说什么了。

So here are some sample heuristics you can put in your armamentarium and build up your repertoire of ideas about presentation.
所以这是一些你可以放入你的技能库并建立你的演讲理念储备的启发式方法样本。

And now, if this persuades you that there is something to know, that there is knowledge, then I've already succeeded because what I want to convince you of, is if you watch the speakers you admire and feel are effective, and ask yourselves why they're successful, then you can build up your own personal repertoire and develop your own personal style.
现在，如果这能说服你有一些东西需要了解，有一些知识存在，那么我已经成功了，因为我想让你相信的是，如果你观察那些你钦佩并觉得有效的演讲者，并问自己他们为什么成功，那么你就可以建立你自己的个人储备并发展你自己的个人风格。

And that's my fundamental objective, and the rest of this talk is about some of the things that are in my armamentarium that I think are effective.
这是我的根本目标，这次演讲的其余部分是关于我认为有效的、在我技能库中的一些东西。

## Time and Place Selection

So next thing on our agenda, as we start to discuss these other things, is a discussion of time and place.
所以我们议程上的下一件事，当我们开始讨论这些其他事情时，是对时间和地点的讨论。

So what do you think is a good time to have a lecture?
所以你们认为什么时候是举办讲座的好时间？

11 AM? Yeah.
上午 11 点？是的。

And the reason is most people at MIT are awake by then, and hardly anyone has gone back to sleep.
原因是 **MIT**（麻省理工学院）的大多数人那时已经醒了，而且几乎没有人回去睡觉。

It's not right after a meal. People aren't fatigued from this or that.
这不是在饭后。人们不会因为这样或那样的事情而疲劳。

It's a great time to have a lecture.
这是举办讲座的好时间。

So that brings me, next, to the question of what about the place?
这让我接下来想到关于地点的问题？

And the most important thing about the place is that it be well lit.
关于地点最重要的是光线充足。

This room is well lit.
这个房间光线充足。

Problem with other kinds of rooms is that we humans, whenever the lights go down, or whenever the room is dimly lighted, it signals that we should go to sleep.
其他类型房间的问题在于，我们人类，每当灯光变暗，或者每当房间光线昏暗时，这就是在发出信号，表明我们应该睡觉了。

So whenever I go somewhere to give a talk, even today, the first thing I do when I speak to the audio-visual people is say, keep the lights full up.
所以每我去某个地方演讲，即使是今天，我和视听工作人员说话时做的第一件事就是说，把灯全开着。

Oh, they might reply, people will see the slides better if we turn the lights off, and then I reply, it's extremely hard to see slides through closed eyelids.
噢，他们可能会回答，如果我们关掉灯，人们会更清楚地看到幻灯片，然后我回答，透过闭着的眼皮看幻灯片是非常困难的。

What else can you say about the place?
关于地点你还能说什么？

Well, the place should be cased, and I mean that in a colloquial sense, of like if you're robbing a bank, you would go to the bank some occasions before to see what it's like, so there are no surprises when you do your robbery.
嗯，地点应该被“踩点”（cased），我是在口语意义上说的，就像如果你要抢银行，你会提前去银行几次看看它是什么样子的，这样当你抢劫时就不会有意外。

So whenever I go somewhere to speak, the first thing I ask my host to do is to take me to the place where I'll be speaking so that if there are any weirdnesses, I'll be able to deal with it.
所以每我去某个地方演讲，我要求我的接待人做的第一件事就是带我去我要演讲的地方，这样如果有任何奇怪的地方，我就能处理它。

Sometimes, it might require some intervention. Sometimes, it just might require me to understand what the challenges are.
有时，这可能需要一些干预。有时，这可能只需要我了解挑战是什么。

So when I came here this morning, I did what I typically do.
所以今天早上我来这里时，我做了我通常做的事。

I imagined that all the seats were filled with disinterested farm animals, and that way, I knew that, no matter how bad it was, it wouldn't be as bad as that.
我想象所有的座位都坐满了不感兴趣的农场动物，那样，我就知道，无论情况多糟，都不会比那更糟。

So finally, it should be reasonably-- it should be reasonably populated.
最后，它应该合理地——它应该有合理的人数。

It should be the case that-- if there were 10 people in this hall, everyone would be wondering, what's going on that's so much more interesting that nobody's here.
情况应该是这样——如果这个大厅里有 10 个人，每个人都会想，发生了什么更有趣的事情，以至于这里没有人。

So you want to get a right sized place that's-- doesn't have to be packed, but it has to be more than half full.
所以你想找一个大小合适的地方——不一定要挤满人，但必须超过半满。

So those are some thoughts about a time and place.
这就是关于时间和地点的一些想法。

## Tools of the Trade: Boards and Props

Next thing I want to talk about is a subject of boards and props and slides.
接下来我想谈的是黑板、道具和幻灯片的主题。

Well, these are the tools of the trade.
嗯，这些是行业的工具。

I believe that this is the right tool for speaking when your purpose is informing.
我相信当你目的是告知时，这是演讲的正确工具。

The slides are good when your purpose is exposing, but this is what I use when I'm informing, teaching, lecturing, and there's several reasons why I use it.
当你的目的是展示时，幻灯片很好，但当我告知、教学、讲课时，我使用这个（黑板），我使用它有几个原因。

For one thing, when you use the board, you have a graphic quality.
首先，当你使用黑板时，你有图形质量。

It's the case that, when you have a board, then you can easily exploit the fact that you can use graphics in your presentation.
事实是，当你有一块黑板时，你可以很容易地利用你可以在演讲中使用图形这一事实。

So that's the graphic quality that I like, and the next thing I like is the speed property.
所以那就是我喜欢的图形质量，我喜欢的下一件事是速度属性。

The speed with which you write on the blackboard is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas.
你在黑板上书写的速度大约是人们吸收想法的速度。

If you go flipping through a bunch of slides, nobody can go that fast.
如果你翻阅一堆幻灯片，没有人能跟上那么快。

Finally, one great property of a board is that it can be a target.
最后，黑板的一个很棒的属性是它可以作为一个目标。

Many people who are novices at speaking find themselves suddenly aware of their hands.
许多演讲新手发现自己突然意识到了自己的手。

It's as if their hands were private parts that shouldn't be exposed in public, so right away, they go into the pockets, and this is considered insulting in some parts of the world.
就好像他们的手是不应该在公共场合暴露的私密部位，所以他们立刻把手插进口袋，这在世界上的一些地方被认为是侮辱性的。

Or alternatively, maybe the hands will go in back like this.
或者，也许手会像这样背在后面。

I was once in a convent in Serbia, and my host-- as soon as we entered, a nun came up to us and offered us a refreshment.
我曾经在塞尔维亚的一个修道院里，我的主人——我们要进去时，一位修女走过来给我们提供茶点。

And I was about to say, no, thank you, and he said, eat that stuff or die.
我正要说，不，谢谢，他说，吃了那东西，否则就死定了。

It's a question of local custom and politeness.
这是一个当地习俗和礼貌的问题。

But then before anything happened there, the nun pulled my hands out like this because it was extraordinarily insulting in that culture to have your hands behind your back.
但在那里发生任何事情之前，修女像这样把我的手拉了出来，因为在那种文化中，把手背在身后是非常侮辱人的。

So why is that?
那是为什么呢？

Well, it's usually supposed that that's that it has to do with whether you're concealing a weapon.
嗯，通常认为这与你是否隐藏武器有关。

So if your hands are in your pockets or behind your back, then it looks like you might have a weapon, and that's what I mean by the virtue-- one of these virtues of the board.
所以如果你的手在口袋里或背后，那么看起来你可能有武器，这就是我所说的黑板的优点——优点之一。

Now, you have something to do with your hands. You can point out the stuff.
现在，你的手有事可做了。你可以指点东西。

I was once watching Seymour Papert give a lecture, and I thought it was terrific.
我曾经看 Seymour Papert 做讲座，我觉得非常棒。

So I went a second time-- first time to absorb the content, second time to note style.
所以我去了第二次——第一次是为了吸收内容，第二次是为了记录风格。

And what I discovered is that Papert was constantly pointing at the board.
我发现 Papert 不断地指着黑板。

And then I thought about it a little while, and I noted that none of the stuff he was pointing to had anything to do with what he was saying.
然后我想了一会儿，我注意到他指的东西和他说的内容没有任何关系。

Nevertheless, it was an effective technique.
尽管如此，这是一种有效的技巧。

So that's just a little bit about the virtue of blackboards.
这只是关于黑板优点的一点点内容。

Now, I want to talk about props.
现在，我想谈谈道具。

The custodians of knowledge about props are the playwrights.
道具知识的保管人是剧作家。

Many decades ago, I saw a play by Henrik Ibsen. It was 《Hedda Gabler》.
几十年前，我看了一部 Henrik Ibsen 的戏。是**《Hedda Gabler》**。

I remember vaguely that it was about a woman in an unhappy marriage, and her husband was in competition for an academic job with somebody else.
我依稀记得那是关于一个婚姻不幸福的女人，她的丈夫正在与别人竞争一个学术职位。

And he was going to lose partly because he was boring, and partly because the competitor had just written a magnificent book.
他将会失败，部分原因是他很无聊，部分原因是竞争对手刚刚写了一本宏伟的书。

By the way, this is back in the days before there were copying machines and computers.
顺便说一句，这是在复印机和电脑出现之前的日子。

Anyhow, as the play opens, there's a potbellied stove, and in the beginning of the play, the potbelly stove, with its open door, just has some slightly glowing embers.
不管怎样，随着戏剧开场，有一个大肚炉，在戏的开始，开着门的炉子里只有一些微弱发光的余烬。

But the potbellied stove is always there, and as tension mounts in the play, and you see this manuscript, this prop that Ibsen so artfully used, you just know that something's going to happen, because as the play goes on, the fire gets bigger and hotter and finally all consuming, and you just know that that manuscript is going to go into that fire.
但大肚炉一直都在那里，随着剧中紧张局势加剧，你看到这份手稿，Ibsen 如此巧妙使用的这个道具，你就知道会发生什么事情，因为随着戏剧的进行，火变得越来越大，越来越热，最后吞噬一切，你就知道那份手稿将会被扔进火里。

This memorable thing is what I remember about the play.
这个难忘的事情就是我记得的关于这部戏的内容。

So playwrights have got this all figured out, but on the other hand, they're not the only people who can use props.
所以剧作家们已经完全弄明白了这一点，但另一方面，他们并不是唯一可以使用道具的人。

Here's an example of the use of a prop, also due to Seymour Papert.
这是一个使用道具的例子，也归功于 Seymour Papert。

He was talking about how it's important to look at the problem in the right way, and here's an example that not only teaches that, but makes it possible for you to embarrass your friends in mechanical engineering.
他当时在谈论以正确的方式看待问题是多么重要，这是一个例子，不仅教导了这一点，还让你有可能让你的机械工程朋友难堪。

So here's what you do. Take a bicycle wheel, and you start it spinning.
所以你是这样做的。拿一个自行车轮子，让它开始旋转。

And then you put some torque on the axle, or equivalently, you blow on the edge.
然后你在轴上施加一些扭矩，或者等效地，你在边缘吹气。

And the issue is, does it go that way, or does it go that way?
问题是，它是往那边走，还是往那边走？

Now, the mechanical engineers will immediately say, oh, yes, I see-- right hand screw wheel.
现在，机械工程师会立刻说，噢，是的，我明白了——右手螺旋法则。

And they'll put their fingers in this position, but forget exactly how to align their fingers with the various aspects of the problem.
他们会把手指放在这个位置，但忘了究竟如何将手指与问题的各个方面对齐。

And so it's usually the case that they get it right with about a 50% probability.
所以通常情况下，他们大约有 50% 的概率做对。

So their very fancy education gets them up to the point where they're equivalent to flipping a coin.
所以他们非常花哨的教育让他们达到了相当于抛硬币的水平。

But it doesn't have to be that way because you can think about the problem a little differently.
但不一定是那样的，因为你可以稍微不同地思考这个问题。

So here's what you do. You take some duct tape, and you put it around the part of the wheel like that.
所以你是这样做的。你拿一些强力胶带，像那样把它贴在轮子的一部分周围。

And now, you start to think about, not the whole wheel, but just a little piece that's underneath the duct tape.
现在，你开始思考，不是整个轮子，而只是胶带下面的那一小块。

So here, that piece comes rolling over the top, and at this point, you blow on it with a puff of air.
所以在这里，那一块滚到顶部，此时，你对它吹一口气。

Forgetting about the rest of the wheel, what happens to that little piece that's under the duct tape?
忘掉轮子的其余部分，胶带下的那一小块会发生什么？

It must want to go that way because you banged on it like that.
它肯定想往那边走，因为你那样撞击它。

It's already going down like that.
它已经像那样往下了。

And what about the next piece? Same thing.
下一块呢？一样。

Next piece? Same thing.
下一块？一样。

So the only thing that can happen is that the wheel goes over like that.
所以唯一可能发生的事情就是轮子像那样翻过去。

And so now, you'll never wonder again because you're thinking about the problem in the right way, and it's demonstrated by the use of a prop.
所以现在，你再也不会疑惑了，因为你在以正确的方式思考问题，这是通过使用道具来演示的。

Another example I like to remember is one from when I was taking 8.01.
另一个我喜欢记住的例子是我上 8.01 课程时的例子。

Alan Lazarus was the instructor at the time, and he was talking about the conservation of energy, kinetic and potential.
Alan Lazarus 是当时的讲师，他在讲能量守恒，动能和势能。

And there was a long wire in a ceiling in 26-100 attached to a much bigger steel ball, but one-- not one like this.
在 26-100 教室的天花板上有一根长长的金属丝，连接着一个大得多的钢球，但不是像这个这样的。

And Lazarus took the ball up against the wall like this.
Lazarus 像这样把球拉到墙边。

He put his head flat against the wall to steady himself, and then he let go, and the pendulum takes many seconds to go over and back, and then gently kisses Lazarus's nose.
他把头平贴在墙上稳住自己，然后他松手，钟摆花了好几秒钟摆过去又摆回来，然后轻轻地吻了一下 Lazarus 的鼻子。

And so you have many seconds to think, this guy really believes in the conservation of energy.
所以你有好几秒钟的时间去思考，这家伙真的相信能量守恒。

Do not try this at home.
不要在家里尝试这个。

The problem is that, the first time you do this, you may not just let go.
问题是，第一次做这个时，你可能不只是松手。

There's a natural human tendency to push.
人类有一种自然的推的倾向。

So that's a little bit on a subject of props.
所以那是关于道具主题的一点内容。

## Empathetic Mirroring

It's interesting. Whenever surveys are taken, students always say more chalk, less PowerPoint.
这很有趣。每当进行调查时，学生总是说多用粉笔，少用 PowerPoint。

And why would that be? Props are also very effective. Why would that be?
那会是为什么呢？道具也非常有效。那是为什么呢？

I'll give you my lunatic fringe view on this. It has to do with what I would call empathetic mirroring.
我会给你我关于这个的极端看法。这与我所说的移情镜像有关。

When you're sitting up there watching me write on the board, all those little mirror neurons in your head, I believe, become actuated, and you can feel yourself writing on the blackboard.
当你坐在那里看我在黑板上写字时，我相信你脑子里所有的镜像神经元都会被激活，你能感觉到自己在黑板上写字。

And even more so, when I talk about this steel ball going that way and this way, you can feel the ball as if you were me, and you can't do that with a slide.
更重要的是，当我谈论这个钢球往那边走又往这边走时，你能感觉到那个球，就好像你是我一样，而你用幻灯片做不到这一点。

You can't do it with a picture. You need to see it in the physical world.
你用图片做不到。你需要在物理世界中看到它。

That's why I think that-- oh, yes, of course, it's-- there are speed questions involved, too, that have to be separated out.
这就是为什么我认为——噢，是的，当然，这——也有速度问题涉及其中，必须分开讨论。

But I think the empathetic mirroring is why props and the use of a blackboard are so effective.
但我认为移情镜像是道具和黑板使用如此有效的原因。

## Slides: Crimes and Best Practices

Well, let's see-- oh, yes, there is one more thing by way of the tools, and that has to do with the use of slides.
嗯，让我们看看——噢，是的，关于工具还有一件事，这与幻灯片的使用有关。

I repeat, I think they're for exposing ideas, not for teaching ideas, but that's what we do in a job talk or conference talk-- expose ideas.
我重复一遍，我认为它们是为了展示想法，而不是为了教授想法，但那是我们在**求职演讲**（Job Talk: 学术界求职过程中，候选人向招聘委员会展示其研究成果的演讲）或会议演讲中所做的——展示想法。

We don't teach them.
我们不教授它们。

So let me tell you a little bit about my views on that.
所以让我告诉你们一点我对此的看法。

I remember, once, I was in Terminal A at Logan Airport.
我记得，有一次，我在洛根机场的 A 航站楼。

I'd just come back from a really miserable conference, and the flight was really horrible.
我刚从一个非常糟糕的会议回来，飞行也非常糟糕。

It was one of those that feels like an unbalanced washing machine.
那是那种感觉像不平衡的洗衣机一样的飞行。

And for the only time in my life, I decided to stop on my way to my car and have a cup of coffee and relax a little bit.
我一生中唯一一次，决定在去车的路上停下来喝杯咖啡，稍微放松一下。

And as I was there for a few minutes, someone came up to me and said, are you Professor Winston?
当我在那里待了几分钟后，有人走过来对我说，你是温斯顿教授吗？

I think so, I said. I don't know.
我想是吧，我说。我不知道。

I guess I was trying to be funny.
我猜我想表现得幽默一点。

In any event, he said, I'm on my way to Europe to give a job talk. Would you mine critiquing my slides?
不管怎样，他说，我要去欧洲做一个求职演讲。你介意评价一下我的幻灯片吗？

Not at all, I said. You have too many, and they have too many words.
一点也不，我说。你幻灯片太多了，而且字太多了。

How did you know, he said, thinking perhaps I had seen a talk of his before.
你怎么知道的，他说，以为我以前看过他的演讲。

I hadn't. My reply was, because it's always true.
我没有。我的回答是，因为这总是真的。

There are always too many slides, always too many words.
总是有太多的幻灯片，总是有太多的文字。

So let me show you some extreme examples of how not to use slides.
所以让我给你们看一些极端的关于如何不使用幻灯片的例子。

Well, for this demonstration, I need to be way over here and when I get over here, then I can start to say things like, one of the things you shouldn't do is read your transparencies.
嗯，为了这个演示，我需要站到这儿来，当我到了这里，我就可以开始说这样的话，你不应该做的事情之一就是读你的透明胶片（幻灯片）。

People in your audience know how to read, and reading will just annoy them.
你观众席里的人知道怎么阅读，朗读只会让他们恼火。

Also, you should be sure that you have only a few words on each transparency, and that the words are easy to read.
此外，你应该确保每张胶片上只有几个字，而且字很容易阅读。

And I hope I'm driving you crazy because I'm committing all kinds of crimes, the first of which is that there are too many words on the slide.
我希望我快把你们逼疯了，因为我正在犯各种罪行，第一个就是幻灯片上的字太多了。

Second of which is, I'm way over there, and the slide's way over there.
第二个是，我站在这儿，而幻灯片在那儿。

So you get into this tennis match feeling of shifting back and forth between the slide and the speaker.
所以你会有一种在幻灯片和演讲者之间来回切换的网球比赛的感觉。

You want the slides to be condiments to what you're saying, not the main event or the opposite way around.
你希望幻灯片是你所说内容的调味品，而不是主要事件，反之亦然。

So how can we fix this?
那我们怎么解决这个问题呢？

Step number one is to get rid of the background junk. That's always distraction.
第一步是去掉背景垃圾。那总是干扰。

Step number two is to get rid of the words.
第二步是去掉文字。

When I reduced the words to these, then everything I read a previous time, I'm not licensed to say, because it's not on the slide.
当我把文字减少到这些时，那么我之前读的所有内容，我现在都可以说了，因为它不在幻灯片上。

I'm not reading my slides anymore, but I'm saying what was written on the slides in a previous example.
我不再读我的幻灯片了，但我是在说之前那个例子中写在幻灯片上的内容。

So what else can we do to simplify this?
所以我们还能做什么来简化这个？

Well, we can get rid of the logos. We don't need them. Simplification.
嗯，我们可以去掉标志。我们不需要它们。简化。

What else can we do? Get rid of the title.
我们还能做什么？去掉标题。

Now, I want to talk to you about some rules for slide preparation. I'm telling you the title.
现在，我想和你们谈谈幻灯片准备的一些规则。我在告诉你们标题。

It doesn't have to be up there.
它不必在上面。

By reducing the number of words on the slide, I'm allowing you to pay more attention to me and less to what's written on the slide.
通过减少幻灯片上的字数，我让你们更多地关注我，而不是写在幻灯片上的东西。

I mentioned it before-- we-- have only one language processor, and we can either use it to read stuff or to listen to the speaker.
我之前提到过——我们——只有一个语言处理器，我们要么用它来读东西，要么用来听演讲者说话。

And so if we have too many words on the slide, it forces people in the audience to read this stuff and not listen.
所以如果我们在幻灯片上有太多的文字，它迫使观众去读这些东西而不是听。

A student of mine did an experiment a few years ago. He taught some students some web-based programming ideas.
我的一位学生几年前做了一个实验。他教一些学生一些基于网络的编程理念。

Half the information was on slides, he said the other half, and then for a control group, he reversed it.
一半的信息在幻灯片上，他说出另一半，然后对于对照组，他反转了它。

And the question was, what did the subjects-- that is to say, freshmen at his fraternity-- what did the subjects remember best, what he said, or what they read on the slide?
问题是，受试者——也就是说，他兄弟会的新生——受试者记得最清楚的是什么，是他说的，还是他们在幻灯片上读到的？

And the answer is, what they read on the slide.
答案是，他们在幻灯片上读到的。

When their slides have a lot of material on it, they don't pay attention to the speaker.
当他们的幻灯片上有很多材料时，他们就不注意演讲者了。

In fact, in the after action report, one of the subjects said, I wish you hadn't talked so much. It was distracting.
事实上，在事后报告中，一名受试者说，我希望你别说那么多话。太让人分心了。

Well, the last item is eliminate clutter. Here's some clutter.
嗯，最后一项是消除混乱。这是一些混乱。

No reason even for those bullets.
甚至没有理由用那些项目符号。

So the too many words problem is a consequence of a crime Microsoft has committed by allowing you to use fonts that are too small.
所以字太多的问题是 **Microsoft PowerPoint**（隐含的软件：微软开发的演示文稿程序）犯下的罪行的后果，因为它允许你使用太小的字体。

So you should all have a sample slide like this that you can use to determine what the minimum font size is that's easily legible.
所以你们都应该有一张像这样的样本幻灯片，你们可以用它来确定易于阅读的最小字体大小是多少。

[INAUDIBLE],, what do you think of those?
[听不清]，你觉得那些怎么样？

AUDIENCE: Which size is right?
观众: 哪个尺寸是对的？

PATRICK WINSTON: What's that?
帕特里克·温斯顿: 什么？

AUDIENCE: Did you ask me what size is right?
观众: 你是问我哪个尺寸是对的吗？

PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, minimum, maybe.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 是的，最小尺寸，也许。

AUDIENCE: 40 or 50.
观众: 40 或 50。

PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, he says 40 or 50. I think that's about right.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 是的，他说 40 或 50。我认为大概是对的。

35 is beginning to get too small, not necessarily because you can't read it, but because you're probably using it to get too many words on the slide.
35 开始变得太小了，不一定是因为你看不清，而是因为你可能用它在幻灯片上塞进了太多的字。

What other crimes do we have? Well, we have the laser pointer crime.
我们还有什么其他罪行？嗯，我们有激光笔罪行。

And for that-- in the old days, when we didn't have laser pointers, we used wooden ones, and people would go waving these things around.
对此——在过去，当我们没有激光笔时，我们使用木制的，人们会挥舞这些东西。

And pretty soon it became almost like a baton twirling contest, so here's what I recommended in the old days for dealing with this kind of pointer.
很快这几乎变成了一场指挥棒旋转比赛，所以我以前推荐这样处理这种教鞭。

This is an example of use of a prop.
这是一个使用道具的例子。

[Patrick breaks the wooden pointer]
[帕特里克折断了木教鞭]

Jim Glass up there saw this talk about 20 years ago, and said, oh, yeah, I remember that talk. That's the one where you broke the pointer.
那边的 Jim Glass 大约 20 年前看过这个演讲，说，噢，是的，我记得那个演讲。就是你折断教鞭的那一次。

It's amazing how props tend to be the things that are remembered.
道具往往是被记住的东西，这很神奇。

Well, now, we don't have physical pointers anymore. We've got laser pointers.
嗯，现在，我们不再有实物教鞭了。我们有了激光笔。

It's a wonder more people aren't driven into epileptic fits over this sort of stuff.
奇怪的是竟然没多少人因为这种东西而癫痫发作。

Well, here's what tends to happen. Look at that.
嗯，这通常会发生。看那个。

It's a lovely recursive picture, and I can become part of it by putting that laser beam right on the back of my head up there.
这是一幅可爱的递归图片，我可以把激光束正好打在我上面的后脑勺上，成为它的一部分。

Then what do you see? You see the back of my head.
然后你看到了什么？你看到了我的后脑勺。

I have no eye contact, no engagement, nothing.
我没有眼神交流，没有互动，什么都没有。

I was sitting with a student watching a talk one day, and she said, you know what, we could all leave, and he wouldn't know.
有一天我和一个学生坐在一起看演讲，她说，你知道吗，我们都可以离开，而他不会知道。

So what happens when you use a laser pointer?
所以当你使用激光笔时会发生什么？

You can't use a laser pointer without turning your head and pointing it at something, and when you do that, you lose contact with the audience.
你不可能在使用激光笔时不转头指向某物，当你这样做时，你就失去了与观众的联系。

You don't want to do it.
你不想这样做。

So what do you do if you need to identify something in your image, and you don't want to point at it with a laser?
那么，如果你需要在图像中标识某物，而你又不想用激光指它，你该怎么办？

This is what you do. Put a little arrow on there and say, now, look at that guy at the end of arrow number one.
这就是你做的。在那放一个小箭头，然后说，现在，看一号箭头末端的那个家伙。

You don't need to have laser pointer to do that.
你不需要激光笔就能做到。

The too-heavy crime-- when people ask me to review a presentation, I ask them to print it out and lay it out on a table.
太厚重的罪行——当人们让我审查一个演示文稿时，我让他们把它打印出来并平铺在桌子上。

When they do that, it's easy to see whether the talk is too heavy, too much text, not enough air, not enough white space, not enough imagery.
当他们这样做时，很容易看出演讲是否太厚重，文字太多，空气不够，留白不够，图像不够。

This is a good example of such a talk-- way too heavy.
这是一个这种演讲的好例子——太厚重了。

The presenter has taken advantage of a small font sizes to get as much on the slide as he wanted.
演示者利用小字体想在幻灯片上放多少就放多少。

Lots of other crimes here, but the too-heavy-- the fact that it's too heavy is what I wanted to illustrate.
这儿有很多其他罪行，但太厚重——它太厚重这个事实是我想说明的。

So here, by contrast, another talk-- one I gave a few years ago.
所以这里，相比之下，另一个演讲——我几年前做的一个。

It's not-- it wasn't a deeply technical talk, but I show it to you because there's air in it.
这不——这不是一个深度技术的演讲，但我给你们看是因为它里面有空气。

It's mostly pictures of things.
主要是事物的图片。

There are three or four slides that have text on them, but when I come to those, I give the audience time to read them.
有三四张幻灯片上有文字，但当我讲到那些时，我给观众时间去阅读。

And they're there because they might have some historical significance.
它们在那里是因为它们可能有一些历史意义。

The first slide with a lot of text on it is an extraction from the 1957-- from the proposal for the 1957 AI conference at Dartmouth.
第一张有很多文字的幻灯片是摘录自 1957 年——摘录自 1957 年达特茅斯人工智能会议的提案。

Extraordinarily interesting event, and that historical extraction from the proposal helps drive that point home.
非常有意思的事件，那个提案的历史摘录有助于阐明这一点。

What else have we got here? Oh, yeah, your vocabulary word for the day.
我们这里还有什么？噢，是的，你们今天的词汇。

This is an **hapax legomenon** (孤证：在语料库或文本中只出现过一次的单词或表达).
这是一个 **hapax legomenon**（孤证）。

What that means is, this is the kind of slide you can get away with exactly once in your presentation.
那意味着，这是你在演讲中只能侥幸使用一次的幻灯片。

This is a slide that got some currency some years ago because it shows the complexity of governing in Afghanistan by showing how impossibly complex it is.
这是几年前流行的一张幻灯片，因为它通过展示它是多么不可思议地复杂，来展示阿富汗治理的复杂性。

It's something you in the audience can't understand, and that's the point, but you can't have many of these.
这是你们观众无法理解的东西，这正是重点，但你不能有很多这样的东西。

You can have one per work, one per presentation, one per paper, one per book.
你可以每部作品有一个，每个演讲有一个，每篇论文有一个，每本书有一个。

That's what hapax legomenon is, and this is an example of it.
那就是 hapax legomenon，这就是它的一个例子。

## Inspiring and Persuading

Now, I want to talk about some special cases.
现在，我想谈谈一些特殊情况。

We could talk a little bit about the informing or to say another way, doing what I'm doing now.
我们可以谈谈关于告知，或者换句话说，做我现在正在做的事情。

But I'll just say a few words about that.
但我只说几句。

In that kind of presentation, you want to start with a promise like I did for this hour that we're going through now.
在那类演讲中，你要像我为我们现在正在进行的这一小时所做的那样，以一个承诺开始。

And then it comes to the question of how do you inspire people?
然后就到了你如何激励人们的问题？

I've given this talk for a long time, and a few years ago, our department chairman said, would you please give this talk to a new faculty, and be sure to emphasize what it takes to inspire students.
我做这个演讲很久了，几年前，我们的系主任说，你能给新教师做这个演讲吗，并确保强调激发学生需要什么。

And strangely, I hadn't thought about that question before. So I started a survey.
奇怪的是，我以前没想过这个问题。所以我开始了一项调查。

I'd talked to some of my incoming freshmen advisees, and I talked to senior faculty and everything in between about how they've been inspired.
我和我的一些新生被指导者谈过，我和资深教师谈过，以及介于两者之间的所有人，谈论他们是如何被激励的。

What I found from the incoming freshmen is that they were inspired by some high school teacher who told them they could do it.
我从新生那里发现的是，他们是被某位告诉他们“你能做到”的高中老师激励的。

What I found in the senior faculty, they were inspired by someone who helped them see a problem in a new way.
我在资深教师那里发现的是，他们是被某位帮助他们以新方式看待问题的人激励的。

And what I saw from everyone is that they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing, exhibited passion about what they were doing.
我从每个人那里看到的是，当某人对他们正在做的事情表现出激情，对他们正在做的事情表现出激情时，他们受到了激励。

So that's one way to be inspiring.
所以那是激励人心的一种方式。

It's easy for me because I do artificial intelligence. And how can you not be interested in artificial intelligence?
这对我来说很容易，因为我是做人工智能的。你怎么能对人工智能不感兴趣呢？

I mean, if you're not interested in artificial intelligence, you're probably not interested in interesting things.
我的意思是，如果你对人工智能不感兴趣，你可能对有趣的事情都不感兴趣。

So when I'm lecturing in my AI class, it's natural for me to talk about what I think is cool and how exciting some new idea is.
所以当我在我的 AI 课上讲课时，我很自然地会谈论我认为很酷的东西，以及某个新想法是多么令人兴奋。

So that's the kind of expression of passion that makes a difference while informing with respect to this question of inspiring.
所以，这是一种激情的表达，在告知的同时，对激励这个问题产生影响。

Oh, yeah and of course, during this promise phase, you can also express how cool stuff is.
噢，是的，当然，在这个承诺阶段，你也可以表达东西有多酷。

Let me give you an example of a lecture that starts this way.
让我给你们举一个以这种方式开始的讲座的例子。

I'm talking about resource allocation.
我在谈论资源分配。

It's the same sort of stuff you would think of when your-- it's the same sort of ideas you would need if you're allocating aircraft to a flight schedule or trying to schedule a factory or something like that.
这和你分配飞机到航班时刻表或试图安排工厂日程或类似事情时需要的想法是一样的。

But the example is putting colors on the states in the United States without any bordering states having the same color.
但例子是给美国的州上色，要求没有任何相邻的州有相同的颜色。

So here it goes. This is what I show at the beginning of the class. This is a way of doing that coloring.
所以开始了。这是我在上课开始时展示的。这是一种上色的方法。

And you might say, well, why don't we wait till it finishes? Would you like to do that?
你可能会说，嗯，我们为什么不等它完成呢？你想那样做吗？

No? Well, we're not going to wait till it finishes because the sun will have exploded and consumed the earth before this program finishes.
不？好吧，我们不会等它完成，因为在这个程序完成之前，太阳早就爆炸并吞噬地球了。

But with a slight adjustment to how the program works, which I tell my students you will understand in the next 50 minutes, this is what you get.
但是通过对程序工作方式的微调，我告诉我的学生你们在接下来的 50 分钟内会明白，这就是你们得到的结果。

Isn't that cool?
那不是很酷吗？

You got to be amazed by stuff that takes a computation from longer than the lifetime of the solar system into a few seconds.
你必须对那些把计算时间从超过太阳系寿命缩短到几秒钟的东西感到惊讶。

So that's what I mean by providing a promise upfront and expressing some passion about what you're talking about.
这就是我所说的预先提供承诺并表达对你所谈论内容的激情的意思。

## Teaching How to Think

Well, the last item in this little block here is it has to do with what people think that they do it at MIT.
嗯，这个小板块的最后一项与人们认为他们在 MIT 做什么有关。

You ask faculty what the most important purpose is, and they'll say, well, the most important thing I do is teach people how to think.
你问教员最重要的目的是什么，他们会说，嗯，我做的最重要的事情是教人们如何思考。

And then you say oh, that's great. How do you teach people how to think?
然后你说噢，那太棒了。你是怎么教人们如何思考的？

Blank stare.
眼神呆滞。

No one can quite respond to that part, that natural next question.
没有人能很好地回答那部分，那个自然的下一个问题。

So how do you teach people how to think?
那么你是怎么教人们如何思考的呢？

Well, I believe that we are storytelling animals.
嗯，我相信我们是讲故事的动物。

And that we start developing our story, understanding and manipulating skills with fairy tales in childhood and continue on through professional schools like law, business, medicine, everything.
我们从童年的童话故事开始发展我们的故事、理解和操作技能，并一直持续到法律、商业、医学等专业学校，所有一切。

And we continue doing that throughout life.
我们在这一生中都在继续这样做。

So if that is what thinking is all about.
所以如果这就是思考的全部。

And we want to teach people how to think, you provide them with the stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is.
如果我们想教人们如何思考，你就给他们提供他们需要知道的故事，他们需要问的关于这些故事的问题，分析这些故事的机制，将故事组合在一起的方法，评估故事可靠性的方法。

And that's what I think you need to do when you teach people how to think.
这就是我认为你在教人们如何思考时需要做的。

## Job Talks and Getting Famous

But that's all about education. And many of you here are not necessarily for that, but rather for this part, for persuading, which breaks down into several categories, oral exams, not shown, shop talks, getting famous.
但这都是关于教育的。你们这里的许多人不一定是为了那个，而是为了这一部分，为了说服，这分为几个类别，口试，未显示的，技术讲座，成名。

I won't say much about oral exams other than the fact that they used to be a lot scarier than they are today.
关于口试我不会多说，只是说它们过去比现在可怕得多。

In the old days, reading the literature in a foreign language was a part of that. And there was a high failure rate.
在过去，阅读外语文献是其中的一部分。而且失败率很高。

And when you look back on those failures, the most usual reason for people failing an oral exam is failure to situate and a failure to practice.
当你回顾那些失败时，人们未通过口试的最常见原因是未能定位和未能练习。

By situate, I mean, it's important to talk about your research in context.
通过定位，我的意思是，在语境中谈论你的研究很重要。

This is a problem that's being pursued all over the world. There hasn't been any progress before me in the past 30 years.
这是一个全世界都在研究的问题。在我之前的 30 年里没有任何进展。

Everyone is looking for a solution because it will have impact on so many other things, such situating and time and place and feel.
每个人都在寻找解决方案，因为它会对很多其他事情产生影响，这就是定位、时间和地点以及感觉。

And then as far as practice is concerned, yes, practice is important.
然后就练习而言，是的，练习很重要。

But that doesn't mean showing your slides to the people you share an with.
但这并不意味着向和你合住的人展示你的幻灯片。

The problem with that is that if people know what you're doing, they will hallucinate that there's material in your presentation that isn't there if it isn't there.
那个的问题在于，如果人们知道你在做什么，如果不那里没有材料，他们会产生幻觉，认为你的演示文稿中有材料。

A variation on the scene, by the way, is your faculty supervisor is not a very good person to help you debug a talk because they, in fact, know what you're doing.
顺便说一句，这个场景的一个变体是你的导师不是帮你调试演讲的好人选，因为事实上，他们知道你在做什么。

And they will, in fact, hallucinate there's material in your presentation that isn't there.
事实上，他们会产生幻觉，认为你的演示文稿中有那些并不存在的材料。

So you need to get together with some friends who don't know what you're doing and have them-- well, you start the practice session by saying, if you can't make me cry, I won't value as a friend anymore.
所以你需要和一些不知道你在做什么的朋友聚在一起，让他们——嗯，你以这样的话开始练习环节：如果你不能让我哭，我就不再把你当朋友了。

And then when you get to the faculty on a oral exam, it will be easy.
然后当你面对口试的教师时，就会很容易。

You see, difficulty-- the amount of flak you'll get from somebody is proportional to age.
你看，难度——你从某人那里得到的抨击量与年龄成正比。

The older somebody is, the more they understand where they are in the world.
一个人越老，他们越明白自己在世界上的位置。

But the young people are trying to show the old people how smart they are, so it's subtly vicious.
但年轻人试图向老年人展示他们有多聪明，所以这有些微妙的恶毒。

So whenever you have an opportunity to have an examining committee that's full of people with gray hair, that's what you want.
所以只要你有机会拥有一个全是白发人的审查委员会，那就是你想要的。

Well, that's just a word or two about something I haven't listed here. Let's get into the subject of job talks.
嗯，这只是关于我这里没列出的一些事情的一两句话。让我们进入求职演讲的主题。

So I was sitting in a bar many years ago in San Diego.
很多年前，我坐在圣地亚哥的一个酒吧里。

I was a member of the Navy Science Board, and I was sitting with a couple of my colleagues on the board Delores Etter from the University of Colorado.
我是海军科学委员会的成员，我和我委员会的几位同事坐在一起，来自科罗拉多大学的 Delores Etter。

She made me so jealous I could spit because she'd written 21 books, and I'd only written 17.
她让我嫉妒得想吐口水，因为她写了 21 本书，而我只写了 17 本。

And then the other one was Bill Weldon from the University of Texas.
然后另一位是来自德克萨斯大学的 Bill Weldon。

He was an electromagnetism guy, and he knew how to use rail guns to drive steel rods through tank armor.
他是一个电磁学专家，他知道如何使用轨道炮将钢棒射穿坦克装甲。

These were interesting people. So I said, what do you look for in a faculty candidate?
这些是有趣的人。所以我说，你们在教师候选人身上寻找什么？

And within one microsecond, Delores said, they have to show us they've got some kind of vision, quickly followed by Bill who said, they have to show us that they've done something.
在一微秒内，Delores 说，他们必须向我们展示他们有某种愿景，Bill 紧随其后说，他们必须向我们展示他们做了一些事情。

Oh, that sounds good, I said.
噢，听起来不错，我说。

And then I said to them, how long does a candidate have to establish these two things? What do you think?
然后我对他们说，候选人需要多长时间来确立这两件事？你们觉得呢？

Well, compare your answer to theirs. Five minutes.
嗯，把你们的答案和他们的比较一下。五分钟。

So if you haven't expressed your vision, if you haven't told people that you've done something in five minutes, you've already lost.
所以如果你没有表达你的愿景，如果你没有在五分钟内告诉人们你做了一些事情，你就已经输了。

So you have to be able to do that. And let me just mention a couple of things in that connection.
所以你必须能够做到这一点。让我顺便提几件事。

Here, the vision is in part, a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach.
在这里，愿景部分是一个有人关心的问题和你方法中的新东西。

So the problem is understanding the nature of human intelligence.
所以问题是理解人类智能的本质。

And the approach is asking questions about what makes us different from chimpanzees and Neanderthals.
这种方法是询问是什么让我们与黑猩猩和尼安德特人不同。

Is it merely a matter of quantity, or we're just a little bit smarter in some continuous way?
这仅仅是一个数量问题，还是我们在某种连续的方式上只是稍微聪明一点？

Or do we have something that's fundamentally different that chimpanzees don't have and Neanderthals either?
还是我们拥有某种黑猩猩和尼安德特人都没有的根本不同的东西？

And the answer is yes, we do have something different. We are symbolic creatures.
答案是肯定的，我们确实有不同的东西。我们是符号生物。

And because we're symbolic creatures, we can build symbolic descriptions of relations and events.
因为我们是符号生物，我们可以构建关系和事件的符号描述。

We can string them together and make stories. And because we can make stories, that's what makes us different.
我们可以把它们串在一起编故事。因为我们可以编故事，这就是让我们与众不同的原因。

So that's my stump speech. That's how I start most of my talks on my own personal research.
那是我的竞选演说（核心演讲）。那就是我如何开始大多数关于我自己个人研究的演讲。

How do you express the notion that you've done something?
你如何表达你已经做了一些事情的概念？

By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem.
通过列出为了实现该问题的解决方案需要采取的步骤。

You don't have to have done all of those steps. But you can say here's what needs to be done.
你不必做完所有这些步骤。但你可以说这是需要做的。

An example, here's what needs to be done. We need to specify some behavior.
一个例子，这是需要做的。我们需要指定一些行为。

We need to enumerate the constraints that make it possible to deal with that behavior.
我们需要枚举使处理该行为成为可能的约束条件。

We have to implement a system because we're engineers, and we don't think that we've understood something unless we can build it.
我们必须实现一个系统，因为我们是工程师，我们要能造出它才认为我们已经理解了它。

And we've built such a system, and we're about to demonstrate it to you today.
我们已经建立了这样一个系统，我们今天要向你们展示它。

That would be an example of enumerating a series of steps needed to realize the vision.
那将是枚举实现愿景所需的一系列步骤的例子。

So then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
然后等等，等等。

And then you conclude by-- you conclude by enumerating your contributions.
然后你通过——你通过枚举你的贡献来结束。

It's kind of mirror of these steps. And it helps to establish that you've done something.
这是这些步骤的一种镜像。它有助于确定你已经做了一些事情。

So that's a kind of general purpose framework for doing a technical talk.
所以那是做技术演讲的一种通用框架。

Now, only a few more things left to do today.
现在，今天只剩下几件事要做了。

Getting famous is the next item on our agenda because once you've got the job, you need to think a little bit about how you're going to be recognized for what you do.
成名是我们议程上的下一项，因为一旦你得到了工作，你需要稍微思考一下如何让你所做的事情得到认可。

So oh, first of all, why should you care about getting famous?
所以噢，首先，你为什么要关心成名？

I thought about this in connection with a fundraising event I attended once, a fundraising event for raising money to save Venice from going under water and having all of its art destroyed.
我有一次参加一个筹款活动时想到了这一点，那个筹款活动是为了筹集资金拯救威尼斯免于被水淹没和所有艺术品被毁。

Anyway, I was sitting here, and JC was sitting here. That was Julia, the late Julia Child.
不管怎样，我坐在这里，JC 坐在这里。那是 Julia，已故的 Julia Child。

And as the evening wore on, more and more people would come up and ask Julia to autograph something or express a feeling that she had changed their life.
随着夜幕降临，越来越多的人走过来请 Julia 签名，或者表达她改变了他们生活的感受。

And it just happened over and over again.
这发生了一次又一次。

So eventually, I turned to Julia, and I said, Ms. Child, is it fun to be famous?
所以最后，我转向 Julia，我说，Child 女士，成名有趣吗？

And she thought about it for a second. And she said, you get used to it.
她想了一秒钟。她说，你会习惯的。

But you know what occured to me? You never get used to being ignored.
但你知道我意识到了什么吗？你永远不会习惯被忽视。

So it's-- here's a way to think about it.
所以它是——这是一种思考方式。

Your ideas are like your children. And you don't want them to go into the world in rags.
你的想法就像你的孩子。你不想让他们衣衫褴褛地进入这个世界。

So what you want to do is to be sure that you have these techniques, these mechanisms, these thoughts about how to present ideas that you have so that they're recognized for the value that is in them.
所以你想做的是确保你拥有这些技巧，这些机制，这些关于如何展示你想法的思考，以便它们的价值得到认可。

So that's why it's a legitimate thing to concern yourself with packaging.
这就是为什么关注包装是一件正当的事情。

Now, how do you get remembered?
现在，你如何被记住？

Well, there's something I like to call Winston's star.
嗯，我喜欢称之为 **Winston's Star**（温斯顿之星：让演讲被记住的五个要素）。

And every one of the items I'm about to articulate starts with an S.
我要阐述的每一项都以 S 开头。

So if you want your presentation ideas to be remembered, one of the things you need to do is to make sure that you have some kind of symbol associated with your work.
所以如果你想让你的演讲想法被记住，你需要做的事情之一是确保有某种与你的工作相关的符号。

So this arch example is actually from my PhD thesis many, many years ago.
所以这个拱门的例子实际上来自我很多很多年前的博士论文。

And in the course of my work at that time, this work on arch learning became mildly famous, and I didn't know why.
当时在我的工作中，这项关于拱门学习的工作变得有点名气，我不知道为什么。

It was only many years later that I realized that that work accidentally had all of the elements on this star.
直到许多年后，我才意识到那项工作意外地拥有这颗星上的所有元素。

So the first element is that there was a kind of symbol. It's the arch itself.
所以第一个元素是有一种符号。就是拱门本身。

Next thing you need is some kind of slogan, a kind of phrase that provides a handle on the work.
接下来你需要的是某种口号，一种为工作提供抓手的短语。

And in this case, the phrase was one shot learning.
在这个案例中，短语是“单次学习”。

And it was one shot because the program I wrote learned something definite from every example that was presented to us.
它是单次的，因为我写的程序从呈现给我们的每个例子中学到了一些确定的东西。

So in going from a model based on this configuration to something that isn't an arch base on that configuration, the program learned that it has to be on top, one shot learning.
所以从基于这种配置的模型到基于那种配置的非拱门的东西，程序学到了它必须在上面，单次学习。

So that's a symbol, slogan. And now we need a surprise.
所以那是符号，口号。现在我们需要一个惊喜。

Yeah, the surprise is you don't need a million examples of something to learn.
是的，惊喜是你不需要一百万个例子来学习。

You can do it with one example if you're smart enough to make use of that example appropriately.
如果你够聪明，能够恰当地利用那个例子，你可以用一个例子做到。

So that was the surprise. You can learn something definite from each example.
所以那是惊喜。你可以从每个例子中学到一些确定的东西。

Next item was a salient idea.
下一项是一个突出的想法。

Now, when I say salient idea, I don't mean important. What I mean is an idea that sticks out.
现在，当我说突出想法时，我不是指重要。我的意思是一个突显出来的想法。

Some theses, funnily enough, have too many good ideas, and you don't know what it's all about because which one is it?
有些论文，有趣的是，好主意太多了，你不知道它到底是关于什么的，因为是哪一个呢？

So you need an idea that sticks out. And the idea that stuck out here was the notion of a near miss.
所以你需要一个突出的想法。在这里突出的想法是“近似未中”（Near miss）的概念。

You see, this is not an arch, but it doesn't miss by much. So it's a near miss.
你看，这不是拱门，但差得不多。所以它是一个近似未中。

And finally, you need to tell the story of how you did it, how it works, why it's important.
最后，你需要讲述你是如何做到的、它是如何工作的、为什么它很重要的故事。

So that's a bit on how to not so much get famous, but how to ensure that your work is recognized.
所以这是关于如何——与其说是成名，不如说是如何确保你的工作得到认可的一点内容。

## How to Stop

Well, we're almost finished because now we're down to this last item, which is how to stop.
嗯，我们要结束了，因为现在我们到了最后一项，就是如何停止。

And when we come to that, there's a question of all right, well, what is the final slide? And what are the final words?
当我们谈到这一点时，有一个问题，好吧，最后的幻灯片是什么？最后的话是什么？

So for the final slide, let me give you some examples of possibilities.
关于最后的幻灯片，让我给你们一些可能性的例子。

How about this one?
这个怎么样？

[Slide with many names]
[显示许多名字的幻灯片]

Well, you might see that slide and think to yourself, there are 1,000 faculty at MIT.
嗯，你可能看到那张幻灯片并想，MIT 有 1000 名教员。

Nice piece of work, but not so much, but it's only a tiny piece of work if you divide by 1,000.
不错的工作，但没那么好，如果你除以 1000，那只是一小部分工作。

So when you show a whole gigantic list of collaborators at the end of a talk, it's a kind of let down because it suggests that nobody knows.
所以当你在演讲结束时展示一长串合作者名单时，这是一种失望，因为它暗示没人知道。

Well, did you do anything significant?
嗯，你做了什么重要的事情吗？

Now, you've got to recognize your collaborators, right? So where do you do that?
现在，你必须认可你的合作者，对吧？那么你在哪里做呢？

Not on the last slide, on the first slide.
不是在最后一张幻灯片，是在第一张幻灯片。

All this was on the first slide. These are the collaborators, so you don't want to put them at the end.
所有这些都在第一张幻灯片上。这些是合作者，所以你不想把他们放在最后。

You don't want a slide like this.
你不想要像这样的幻灯片。

[Slide saying "Questions?"]
[写着“Questions?”的幻灯片]

How about this one? This is the worst possible way to end a talk.
这个怎么样？这是结束演讲最糟糕的方式。

Because this slide can be up there for 20 minutes.
因为这张幻灯片可能会在上面停留 20 分钟。

I've seen it happen. It squanders real estate.
我看过这种情况发生。它浪费了空间。

It squanders an opportunity to tell people who you are.
它浪费了告诉人们你是谁的机会。

What about this one?
这个怎么样？

[Slide saying "The End"]
[写着“The End”的幻灯片]

I often see it. I never see anybody write it down. Also, it wastes opportunity.
我经常看到。我从未见过有人把它写下来。这也浪费了机会。

Oh my God, even worse.
噢，天哪，更糟。

[Slide saying "Thank you"]
[写着“Thank you”的幻灯片]

All of these lines do nothing for you. They waste an opportunity for you to tell people-- to leave people with what you-- with who you are.
所有这些对你没有任何帮助。它们浪费了你告诉人们——给人们留下你是谁——的机会。

Well, what about this? Is this a good one?
嗯，这个怎么样？这是个好的吗？

[Slide listing conclusions]
[列出结论的幻灯片]

It might seem so at first, but here's the problem.
乍一看可能觉得是，但问题在这里。

If you say these are my conclusions, these are perfectly legitimate conclusions that nobody cares about.
如果你说这些是我的结论，这些是完全合法的结论，但没人关心。

What they care about is what you have done.
他们关心的是你做了什么。

And that's why your final slide should have this label, contributions.
这就是为什么你的最后一张幻灯片应该有这个标签：贡献。

It's a mirror of what I said over there about how job talks ought to be like a sandwich.
这是我对那边所说的关于求职演讲应该像三明治一样的镜像。

And the final slide, the one that's up there while people are asking questions and filing out, it ought to be the one that has your contributions on it.
最后一张幻灯片，当人们提问和离场时显示的那张，应该是写着你贡献的那张。

Here's an example from my own stump speech.
这是我自己核心演讲的一个例子。

Yeah, this is what I talk about a lot. Yes, here are the things that I typically demonstrate.
是的，这是我经常谈论的内容。是的，这些是我通常演示的东西。

And I wait for people to read it.
我等人们读完它。

And the final element there is this is what we get out of it, so that's an example of a contribution slide.
那里的最后一个元素是我们从中得到了什么，所以那是一个贡献幻灯片的例子。

All right, now, what about the other part?
好了，现在，另一部分呢？

You got your final slide up there. It's a contribution slide. Somehow you have to tell people you're finished.
你最后一张幻灯片在那儿了。它是贡献幻灯片。无论如何你得告诉人们你讲完了。

So let's see it, check out a few possibilities.
所以让我们看看，检查几个可能性。

One thing you could do in the final words is you could tell a joke.
在最后的话语中你可以做的一件事是讲一个笑话。

It's OK. By the time you're done, people have adjusted themselves to your voice parameters. They're ready for a joke.
没关系。当你讲完时，人们已经适应了你的声音参数。他们准备好听笑话了。

I was sitting in another bar, this time in Austin, Texas with a colleague of mine named Doug Lenat.
我坐在另一个酒吧，这次是在德克萨斯州的奥斯汀，和我的同事 Doug Lenat 在一起。

And Doug's a fantastic speaker.
Doug 是个出色的演讲者。

And so I said to Doug, Doug, you're a fantastic speaker, what's your secret?
所以我对 Doug 说，Doug，你是个出色的演讲者，你的秘密是什么？

And he said, oh, I always finish with a joke, and that way, people think they've had fun the whole time.
他说，噢，我总是以笑话结束，那样，人们会认为他们全程都很开心。

So yeah, a joke will work down there.
所以是的，笑话在那时候会管用。

How about this one?
这个怎么样？

"Thank you."
“谢谢。”

I don't recommend it. It's a weak move.
我不推荐它。这是一个软弱的举动。

You will not go to hell if you conclude your talk by saying thank you, but it's a weak move, and here's why.
如果你以说谢谢结束演讲，你不会下地狱，但这只是一个软弱的举动，原因如下。

When you say thank you, even worse, thank you for listening, it suggests that everybody has stayed that long out of politeness and that they had a profound desire to be somewhere else.
当你说谢谢，更糟糕的是，谢谢你的倾听，这暗示每个人都是出于礼貌才待了这么久，他们其实非常想去别的地方。

But they're so polite, they stuck it out. And that's what you're thanking them for.
但他们太有礼貌了，坚持到了最后。这就是你在感谢他们的原因。

So once wild applause has started, you can mouth a thank you, and there's nothing wrong with that.
所以一旦热烈的掌声开始，你可以用口型说谢谢，那没什么错。

But the last thing you do should not be saying thank you.
但你做的最后一件事不应该是说谢谢。

Now, you say to me, well, doesn't everybody say thank you?
现在，你对我说，嗯，不是每个人都说谢谢吗？

Well, what everybody does is not necessarily the right thing.
嗯，每个人都做的事情不一定是正确的事情。

And I like to illustrate how some talks can end without saying thank you.
我喜欢说明有些演讲如何在不说谢谢的情况下结束。

I like to draw from political speeches, but the ones that I've heard recently aren't so good, so-- So I'm going to have to go go back a little bit.
我喜欢借鉴政治演讲，但我最近听到的那些不太好，所以——所以我得稍微回顾一下。

So here is Governor Christie. He gave the Republican keynote address one year.
这是州长 Christie。他有一年做了共和党的主题演讲。

This is the end of his talk. Let's see what he does.
这是他演讲的结尾。让我们看看他做了什么。

CHRIS CHRISTIE: And together, everybody, together. We will stand up once again for American greatness for our children and grandchildren. God bless you, and God bless America.
克里斯·克里斯蒂: 所有人一起，所有人一起。为了我们的子孙后代，我们将再次为美国的伟大挺身而出。上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。

PATRICK WINSTON: So that's a classic **benediction** (祝福：宗教仪式结束时的赐福祷告) ending. God bless you, God bless America.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 那是一个经典的 **benediction**（祝福）结尾。上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。

Now, I don't want to be partisan about this. So I think I'd better switch to the keynote address in the Democratic Convention.
现在，我不想在这方面有党派之争。所以我最好切换到民主党大会的主题演讲。

It was delivered that year by Bill Clinton, who knows something about how to speak.
那年是由 Bill Clinton 发表的，他知道怎么演讲。

BILL CLINTON: If that is what you want, if that is what you believe, you must vote, and you must re-elect President Barack Obama. God bless you, and God bless America.
比尔·克林顿: 如果那是你想要的，如果那是你相信的，你就必须投票，而且你必须连任总统贝拉克·奥巴马。上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。

PATRICK WINSTON: Now, watch this. Let's go back a little bit and redo it.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 现在，看着这个。让我们倒回去一点重来。

What I want you to see is that at one point, he seems to be almost pressing his lips together, forcing himself not to say thank you.
我想让你们看到的是，在某一刻，他似乎几乎在抿紧嘴唇，强迫自己不说谢谢。

Then there's another place where he does a little salute. So watch for those this time around.
然后还有另一个地方，他做了一个小小的敬礼。所以这次注意看那些。

[Replay of Bill Clinton]
[重播 Bill Clinton]

PATRICK WINSTON: That's where he's pursing his lips. There's the salute.
帕特里克·温斯顿: 那就是他抿嘴的地方。那是敬礼。

Yeah, I think that's pretty good. Now, what are we gonna take away from this?
是的，我认为那相当不错。现在，我们要从中学到什么？

Well, I suppose I could conclude this talk by saying God bless you, and God bless the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it might not work so well.
嗯，我想我可以用说“上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑麻省理工学院”来结束这次演讲，但效果可能没那么好。

But what you can get out of this is you don't have to say thank you. There are other things you can do.
但你能从中得到的是，你不必说谢谢。你可以做其他事情。

And it's interesting that over time, people figure this out, and there's some stock ways of ending things.
有趣的是，随着时间的推移，人们弄明白了这一点，有一些结束事情的惯用方式。

So in the Catholic church, and the good old Latin mass, it ended with ite missa est, which translates approximately to OK, the mass is over, you can go home now.
所以在天主教会，以及古老的拉丁弥撒中，它以 ite missa est 结束，大致翻译为“好了，弥撒结束了，你们可以回家了”。

And of course, at musical concerts, you know that it's time to clap not at the end of the song, but rather when the conductor goes over and shakes hands with the concert master.
当然，在音乐会上，你知道不是在歌曲结束时鼓掌，而是在指挥走过去和首席小提琴手握手时鼓掌。

Those are conventions that tell you that the event is over.
那些是告诉你活动结束的惯例。

So those are all possibilities for here.
所以这些都是这里的可能性。

But one more possibility, and that is that you can salute the audience.
但还有一种可能性，那就是你可以向观众致敬。

And by that, I mean, you can say something about how much you value your time at a place.
我的意思是，你可以说一些关于你多么重视你在某个地方的时间的话。

So I could say, well, it's been great fun being here.
所以我可以说，嗯，在这里非常有趣。

It's been fascinating to see what you folks are doing here at MIT.
看到你们在 MIT 做的事情真是太迷人了。

I've been much stimulated and provoked by the kinds of questions you've been asking, it's been really great.
我被你们问的问题极大地激发和触动了，真的太棒了。

And I look forward to coming back on many occasions in the future.
我期待着将来在许多场合再来。

So that salutes the audience. You can do that.
所以那是向观众致敬。你可以那样做。

Well, there it is.
好了，就是这样。

You know what? I'm glad you're here.
你知道吗？我很高兴你们在这里。

And the reason is by being here, I think you have demonstrated an understanding that how you present and how you package your ideas is an important thing.
原因是，通过在这里，我认为你们已经证明了你们理解如何展示和如何包装你们的想法是一件重要的事情。

And I salute you for that.
我为此向你们致敬。

And I suggest that you come back again and bring your friends.
我建议你们再来，并带上你们的朋友。
