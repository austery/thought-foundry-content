### 两分钟法则与身份认同

**James Clear**: “**两分钟法则**”是什么？就是把你想要培养的任何习惯，缩小到两分钟或更短时间就能完成的事情。我有个读者，他开始去健身房锻炼，减掉了100多磅。现在已经保持了十多年了。但他刚开始去的时候，有个规定，就是不允许在健身房待超过五分钟，对吧？这听起来有点荒谬。显然这不会让他达到想要的效果。但你意识到的是，他正在掌握“**坚持出现**”的艺术。一个习惯必须先建立起来，才能得到改善。你需要先标准化，然后才能优化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: What's the **two-minute rule**? Take whatever habit you're trying to focus on and scale it down to something that takes 2 minutes or less to do. I have this reader. He started going to the gym and he lost over 100 lbs. It's kept off for more than a decade now. But when he first started to go, he had a rule where he wasn't allowed to stay at the gym for longer than 5 minutes, right? It sounds kind of ridiculous. Clearly this is not going to get the guy the results he wants. What you realize is he was mastering the art of **showing up**. A habit must be established before it can be improved. You need to standardize before you optimize.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，一旦我们确定了想要替换或消除的习惯，我们通过什么机制来实现呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then once we've identified a habit that we want to replace or eliminate, what is the mechanism by which we can do that?

</details>

**James Clear**: 广义上讲，我认为如果你想养成一个习惯，有四件事你应该做。我认为你早期能做的最好的事情之一，如果我能给**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）这本书里没有的东西再添加一个，可能就是这个：身份在习惯养成中扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Broadly speaking, I think there are four things that you should do if you want to build a habit. And I think one of the best things you can do early on, this is if I could actually add one thing to **Atomic Habits** that wasn't in it, it would probably be this: What is the role that identity plays in terms of habit formation?

</details>

**James Clear**: 归根结底，我觉得身份可能是习惯最重要的部分。你的习惯是你体现特定身份的方式。所以，当你整理床铺时，你体现的是一个整洁有序的人的身份。如果你周二晚上学习生物20分钟，你体现的是一个勤奋好学的人的身份。做这件事本身就是你属于那种人的证明。最终，你开始为自己是那样的人积累证据。你完全有理由相信这一点。所以**《原子习惯》**的核心教训之一是，你采取的每一个行动，都像是在为你希望成为的那种人投上一票。所以，当你今天去健身房时，你就是在为成为一个不缺席锻炼的人投上一票。当你坐下来打一个销售电话时，你就是在为成为一个销售员投上一票。当你写一个句子时，你就是在为成为一个作家投上一票。当然，做一次俯卧撑并不能改变你的身体，但它确实为那个身份投了一票。它确实提供了你属于那种人的证据。最终，当你积累了足够的证据，你就会开始为自己是那样的人而感到自豪。我认为这就是你在养成习惯方面达到真正有韧性的地方。当你开始为自己是那样的人而感到自豪时，你就会努力保持这个习惯。你知道，情况会变得相反。现在，你不再是强迫自己去做，而是努力保持它，因为它是你所相信并希望保持的身份的一部分。你知道，如果你为自己的二头肌大小感到自豪，你绝不会跳过健身房的练手臂日。如果你为自己的发型感到自豪，你就会有很长的护发程序，每天都做。我们可能不知道，但你知道，就是这样。所以，目标不是读一本书，目标是成为一个读者。目标不是跑马拉松，而是成为一个跑步者。目标不是参加静默冥想静修，而是成为一个冥想者。它是要建立并采纳这种“我就是这种人”的身份。我认为最终这就是为什么小习惯如此重要。行为和信念就像一条双向街。你所相信的会影响你采取的行动，但你采取的行动也可以影响你对自己的信念。你知道，每次你以某种小方式出现并做这件事时，你都会一点点地向自己证明，嘿，也许我就是那种人。所以，我的鼓励，我的建议是让行为引领方向。从小行动开始，然后在那个时刻向自己证明你就是那种人。当你开始培养和建立那种身份时，坚持习惯就会变得更容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Ultimately, I feel like identity may be the most important thing with habits. Your habits are how you embody a particular identity. So, when you make your bed, you embody the identity of someone who is clean and organized. If you study biology for 20 minutes on Tuesday night, you embody the identity of someone who is studious. The act of doing it is proof that you are that type of person. And eventually you start to build up this body of evidence for being that way. You have every reason in the world to believe it. So one of the core lessons of **Atomic Habits** is that every action you take is like a vote for the type of person you wish to become. So, when you show up at the gym today, you are casting a vote for being the type of person who doesn't miss workouts. When you sit down and make one sales call, you are casting a vote for being a salesperson. When you write one sentence, you are casting a vote for being a writer. And no, doing one push-up does not transform your body, but it does cast a vote for that identity. It does provide evidence for being that type of person. And eventually, as you build up that body of evidence, you start to take pride in being that way. And I think that's where you get to this really resilient place in terms of building your habits. When you start to take pride in being that type of person, you will fight to maintain the habit. You know, it becomes the opposite situation. Now, instead of trying to force yourself to do it, you're trying to maintain it because it's a part of your identity that you believe in and that you want to keep. You know, if you take pride in the size of your biceps, you never skip arm day at the gym. Now, if you take pride in how your hair looks, you have this long hair care routine, you do it every day. We wouldn't know, but you know, it's like. And so, really the goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. You know, the goal is not to run a marathon, it's to become a runner. The goal is not to do some silent meditation retreat, it's to become a meditator. It's to install and adopt this identity that this is the type of person that I am. And I think ultimately that's why small habits matter so much. You know, behavior and belief is like two-way street. What you believe will influence the actions that you take, but the actions that you take can also influence what you believe about yourself. And you know, every time you show up and do it in some small way, you prove to yourself a little bit, hey, maybe I am that kind of person. And so, my encouragement, my suggestion is to let the behavior lead the way. To start with some small action and then prove to yourself in that moment that you were that kind of person. And as you start to foster and build that identity, sticking with the habit becomes easier.

### 耐心与积累

**主持人**: 我喜欢小改变这个想法，你的书里也有“**每天进步1%**”这个概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I I like the idea of the small, you had **1% better** in your book, too.

</details>

**James Clear**: 这些小改变会带来大结果。我认为人们走弯路的地方在于缺乏耐心，这会改变结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: These small changes leading to big results. I think where people go astray is the lack of patience sort of changes the outcome.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道我想要更健康，但我也知道这需要大量的工作和时间。如果我吃得更健康，去健身房更多，我只是过上更健康的生活方式。这就是我们遇到麻烦的地方，但我们对所有事情都这样。不仅仅是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: is the lack of patience sort of changes the outcome. So, I know I want to be healthier, but I know it's a lot of work and a lot of time. If I eat healthier, I go to the gym more. I I just live a healthier lifestyle. And that's where we get in trouble, but we do it with everything. It's not just

</details>

**James Clear**: 缺乏耐心会改变结果。这是一个很好的说法。嗯，这绝对是真的。我认为人们走弯路有两种方式。所以，有一种是你刚才提到的，就是不够耐心，无法坚持下去。我们稍后会谈到这一点。另一种是，小改变确实很重要，但前提是它们的方向正确。你知道，我们都知道有些人把时间花在琐碎无聊的事情上。你知道，你有点浪费时间在不重要的小事上。我认为其中一个区别是，你的小行动是在积累还是在蒸发？你知道，你每天做的小事是朝着一个更大的目标前进，还是只是一些一次性的、没有真正累积起来的小事？在很多方面，我觉得人生中最重要的两个时间框架是十年和一小时，你知道吗？所以，十年只是你人生中想要做的那些有意义的大事的简称。十年后你想在哪里？你知道，我有时喜欢鼓励人们不要让一天过去，而不做一些能在十年后让你受益的事情。嗯，而一小时是，我今天现在能做些什么，是朝着我十年后想达到的目标前进的。如果你能同时生活在这两种思维模式中，如果你能既考虑长远又采取短期行动，那么你就会开始寻找那些确实会累积、确实有意义、而不是琐碎无聊的小改变、小调整。所以，我认为人们走弯路的一种方式是，他们的小行动没有朝着更大的目标前进。它们没有积累。他们走弯路的第二种方式就是你刚才提到的，即缺乏耐心会改变结果。我在**《原子习惯》**中举的一个例子是关于冰块的。你知道，你走进一个房间，很冷，你都能看到自己的呼吸，冰块放在桌子上，你开始把房间加热一度，再一度，再一度，冰块还在那里，最终你会达到一个**临界点**，一个**相变**。冰块开始融化。这就像一度的转变，与之前的转变没有什么不同，但你达到了这个转变点，事情就改变了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Lack of patience changes the outcome. That's a good phrase. Um, it's definitely true. I think there are two ways people can go astray. So there's there's what you just mentioned, which is not being patient enough and sticking with it. We'll talk about that in a minute. The other one is um small changes can really matter, but only if they're oriented in the right way. You know, we we know we all know people who spend time on minutia and trivial things. You know, you kind of waste time on small stuff that doesn't really matter. And I think one of the distinctions is are your small actions accumulating or are they evaporating? You know, are you doing small things each day that are oriented toward a larger outcome or are you doing small things each day that are just kind of like one-offs and don't really add up? In a lot of ways, I feel like the two time frames that matter most in life are 10 years and 1 hour, you know? So, like 10 years is just shorthand for the big meaningful things that you want to do in life. Where do you want to be in a decade? You know, I sometimes I like to encourage people to don't let a day pass without doing something that will benefit you in a decade. Um, and one hour is how can I do something today right now that is oriented toward where I want to be in 10 years. And if you can kind of live in that simultaneously in those two modes of thought, if you can both be thinking long term but acting short term, then you start looking for little changes, little adjustments that do add up, that do accumulate, that are not trivial and, you know, um, meaningless. So, um, I think that's one way people go astray is their their small actions are not oriented toward the larger outcome. They're not accumulating. The second way that they go astray is what you just mentioned, which is um lack of patience changes the outcome. I one of the examples I give in **Atomic Habits** is thinking about an ice cube, you know. So you walk into a room, it's cold, you can see your breath, and the ice cube sitting on the table, you start heating the room up one degree, another degree, another degree, ice cube's still there, and eventually you get to this **tipping point**, this **phase transition**. The ice cube starts to melt. It's this like one-degree shift, no different than the shifts that had come before, but you hit this transition and things change.

</details>

**主持人**: 习惯很多时候就是这样。你知道，你会听到人们说：“我跑步一个月了，身体没看到变化。”或者“我们每周五开会六个月了，这个功能还没发布。”这就像，是的，那些工作并没有浪费。它只是被储存起来了。你知道，这有点像抱怨加热冰块一点点，但它还没融化。这就像，你只是还没达到**相变**。但人们就是在那时放弃的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And habits are like that a lot of the time. You know, you'll hear people say things like, you know, I've been running for a month. I can't see a change in my body. Or, we've been meeting every Friday for 6 months and we still haven't shipped this feature yet. And it's like, yeah, that work is not being wasted. It's just being stored. You know, it's kind of like complaining about heating an ice cube up a little bit and it not melting yet. It's like, well, you just haven't hit the **phase transition**. So, but that's where people give up.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的，是的。**圣安东尼奥马刺队**（*San Antonio Spurs*）的更衣室里挂着一句话，他们赢得了五次NBA总冠军，上面写着：“当我想到放弃时，我会想到那个石匠，他用锤子敲打石头一百次，石头都没有裂开。而在第101次敲击时，它裂开了。我知道不是第101次敲击做到了，而是之前的一百次。”生活中的很多事情都是如此。你知道，让你变得健康的不是最后一次锻炼，而是之前的一百次。完成小说的不是最后一句话，而是之前的一百句话。促成销售的不是最后一次谈话，而是之前的一百次。这是一种愿意不断出现、不断敲打石头的意愿，并且知道在某个时刻你会达到那个**相变**。你会达到那个新的水平，但你需要足够的毅力来坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yes. Yes. The **San Antonio Spurs** have a quote hanging in their locker room where it says, you know, they've won five NBA championships. And it says, "When I think about giving up, I think about the stone cutter who takes his hammer and bangs on the rock a hundred times without it splitting in two. And at the 101st blow, it cracks. And I know that it wasn't the 101st that did it, but all the hundred that came before." And so many in things in life are like that. You know, it's not the last workout that got you fit. It's all the hundred that came before. It's not the last sentence that finishes the novel. It's all the hundred that came before. It's not the last conversation that closes the sale. It's all the hundred that came before. It's this willingness to keep showing up and hammering on the rock and knowing that at some point you are going to hit that **phase transition**. You are going to hit that, you know, that new um level, but you need enough persistence to keep doing it.

### 应对不确定性

**主持人**: 你有什么技巧或窍门吗？因为当我锻炼时，我确实在进步，但这种进步是内在的。我就是看不到。它不是可见的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Are there tips or tricks you have? Because like when I'm working out, I'm getting better, but I'm getting better internally. I just don't I can't visual. It's not visible,

</details>

**James Clear**: 但它确实在发生。是的。你有什么技巧或窍门可以让我们在心理上或实践上运用吗？这是关于习惯的重要一课，那就是仅仅因为进步不明显，并不意味着没有进步。你知道，你不会每次锻炼都看到体重秤上的数字变化。你不会每次发布一集节目或进行其他工作时都看到订阅人数的变化。这需要时间。但棘手的部分是，如果某件事不起作用，它也需要时间。你知道，你只是不断地碰壁。那么，你如何知道何时需要耐心，何时需要尝试不同的方法呢？有时你会听到人们说“再试一次”。我实际上认为它应该被改写为“**尝试不同的方法**”。你需要不断尝试，但你需要不断尝试不同的攻击路线。我认为**纳瓦尔**（*Naval Ravikant*）说过类似的话，他说这不是一万次尝试，而是一万次迭代。迭代是做事情的不同方式。所以你需要对方法进行一些调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: but it is in like I can't see it, but it's happening. Yes. Are there tips or tricks you have that we can uh use either psychologically or practically speaking? This is one of the big lessons for habits, which is just because improvements aren't noticeable. Doesn't mean improvement isn't happening. You know, you're not going to see a change on the scale every time you work out. You're not going to see a change in the number of subscribers every time you publish an episode or whatever. Like, it's, you know, it takes a while. Um, but the tricky part is if something's not working, it also takes a while. You know, you just keep banging your head against the wall. So, how do you know when you need to be patient and how do you know when you need to try something different? And um sometimes you'll hear people say like try try again. I actually think it should be rephrased to **try try differently**. You need to keep trying, but you need to keep trying different lines of attack. This is I think **Naval** has something where he says you know it's not 10,000 attempts it's 10,000 iterations. You know an iteration is a different way of doing it. So you need you need some adjustment to the approach.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我不认为你需要做一万次。通常，尝试五种或十种不同的方法就足以看出哪一种比另一种效果更好。所以这是第二种见解，那就是当事情进展顺利时，通常从一开始就进展得相当顺利。这并不意味着你总是会立即得到你想要的结果，或者你马上就能达到你期望的成果。但它的确意味着你应该这样做，这是我在创业初期得到的最好建议之一。有人告诉我，你应该不断尝试，直到某件事变得轻松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And um I don't think you need to do it 10,000 times. Usually just doing it five different ways or 10 different ways is enough to see oh one of these is working better than the other. So this is the this is the second kind of insight which is when something goes well usually it goes pretty well from the beginning. It's not. Now, that does not what that does not mean is that you'll always have the results you want right away or that you will immediately get the outcome that you're you're hoping for. But what it does mean is that you should this was one of the best pieces of advice given to me early in my entrepreneurial career. Somebody told me you should try things until something comes easily.

</details>

**James Clear**: 这并不意味着它会很容易，但它确实意味着结果会比你尝试的其他事情更容易出现。所以在很多方面，我认为人生的一大追求就是充分尝试，找到对你来说容易的事情，然后努力去做那些容易的事情，因为如果你努力去做你具备某种技能、某种优势、某种天赋的事情，那么你就很难被超越。所以这只是经典的**探索-利用权衡**（*explore-exploit trade-off*）。你知道，在过程的早期，你需要更多地探索和实验。然后最终你会发现，好的，在我尝试过的十件事中，这两种效果最好。现在你需要加倍努力去做那些有效的事情，并开始利用那些真正能给你带来结果的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Now, that doesn't mean that it will be easy, but it does mean that it results will come easier than the other things that you have been trying. And so in a lot of ways I think what you kind of one of the big quests for life is to experiment enough to find what comes easy for you and then work really hard on what comes easy because if you work hard on the thing that you have some skill set for some strength for some natural aptitude for then you're very hard to compete with. So it's just your classic **explore exploit trade-off**. You know, early in the process, you need to explore more and experiment more. And then eventually you start to discover, okay, of the 10 things I've tried, these are the two that work best. Now you need to double down on what's working and start exploiting some of the things that um that are actually getting you results.

</details>

**主持人**: **彼得·蒂尔**（*Peter Thiel*）前段时间做了一次演讲，其中一句话让我印象深刻，他说我们低估了当某件事奏效时，它能持续多久以及它能有多强大。所以我们经常改变那些对我们有效的习惯，我们也会修修补补那些正在奏效的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **Peter Thiel** gave a talk a while ago and one of the things he said that really stood out to me was we underestimate when something's working, we underestimate how long it can go for and how powerful it can be. So often we change habits that are working for us too where we change we tinker with things that are working.

</details>

**James Clear**: 天哪，生活中太多地方都是如此。我举两个例子，一个是在健身房。我有个朋友非常强壮，是个非常优秀的举重运动员，他深蹲超过500磅。我们一起训练，他当时在做一个深蹲计划，效果非常好。他在大约三个月的时间里取得了很大的进步。然后我不得不出差什么的，有一段时间没见到他。我大约六个月后再次见到他，我说：“嘿，你还在做那个深蹲计划吗？”他说：“没有。”我说：“哦，是不是停滞不前了？”他说：“没有，我只是觉得无聊了。”嗯，你就会想，天哪，这种事总是发生，到处都在发生。人们只是，嗯，对新奇的渴望，你知道，它会压倒对结果的渴望。我们就是无法坚持下去。所以，嗯，**加倍投入有效的事情**。在很多方面，我觉得这个过程实际上相当简单。尝试很多事情，对吧？所以，尝试很多事情。进行很多小实验。一旦你找到有效的方法，就加倍投入，然后一直做下去，直到它不再有效，这是很多人跳过的一个步骤。嗯，然后一旦它不再有效，就回到起点，再次尝试很多小实验。它真的不需要比这更复杂。但人们会跳过每个步骤。他们要么没有尝试足够的实验。他们尝试一两件事，然后说：“嗯，这对我不起作用。”你就会想：“嗯，尝试两件事是不够的。也许你需要尝试二十件事，你知道。”嗯，然后一旦他们找到有效的方法，他们可能没有足够地加倍投入。这似乎是，一旦你尝试了很多事情，你就会有点分散。加倍投入感觉有点冒险，你知道，就是全力以赴做一件事。但你需要能够切换那个开关，并完全投入。然后一旦你完全投入，人们就会感到无聊，所以他们不会坚持下去，直到它不再有效。如果它不起作用，就继续做。这也是我还没有出版另一本书的部分原因。嗯，**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）卖得很好。所以我正在努力听从自己的建议，在它停止有效之前不要停止。嗯，所以……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Man, there's so many places in life where this is true. Like I so um two examples, one in the gym. I have a friend who was very strong, really good lifter, um squatted over 500 lb and we were training together and he was doing this squat program and it went great. He made a lot of progress over like this three-month span and then I had to travel or something. I didn't see him for a little while, whatever. I I came back maybe I saw him like 6 months later and I said oh hey are you still doing that squat program? He's like no. I was like oh did it like did you stall out or something? He was like no I just got bored. Um and you're like man it like all the time you know it happens everywhere. People just um the quest the desire for novelty um overpowers the you know the desire to get results. It's like we just can't keep sticking with it. So, um, **doubling down on what's working**. In a lot of ways, I feel like the process is actually quite simple. Try a number of things, right? So, experiment with a number of things. Run a number of small experiments. Once you find something that works, double down on it and then keep doing it until it stops working, which is the step that a lot of people skip. Um, and then once it stops working, go back to the start and try a lot of small experiments again. And it's really it's really not more it doesn't need to be more complicated than that. But people shortcut each step. They either don't try enough experiments. They try one or two things and they say, "Well, this didn't work for me." You're like, "Well, it's not enough to try two. Like maybe you need to try 20, you know." Um and then once they find something that's working, they maybe they don't double down on it enough. That seems once you've tried a lot of things, you're kind of diversified. Doubling down feels kind of risky, you know, to just go all in on something. But you need to be able to flip that switch and fully commit. And then once you're fully committed, people get bored and so they don't stick with it until it stops working. Keep doing it if it doesn't work. This is part of the reason why I have not published another book yet. Um, **Atomic Habits** is working really well. And so I'm trying to take my own advice and don't stop until it stops working. Um, and so

</details>

**主持人**: 伙计，那可能永远都不会停止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: dude, that might be forever.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。最终，你意识到这不仅仅是关于结果，对吧？它也关乎你想要如何生活？你想要把时间花在什么上面？嗯，但，是的，所以我认为这三个步骤可能应该比现在更认真地对待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah. Eventually, eventually you realize that it's not just about results, right? It's also about how do you want to live your life? What do you want to spend your time on? Um but uh but yeah, so I think those those three steps probably should be taken more seriously than they are.

</details>

### 环境设计与行为改变

**主持人**: 我们如何创造一个让行为改变不可避免的环境？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do we create an environment that makes behavior change inevitable?

</details>

**James Clear**: 我认为这是最好的问题之一。我如何为成功创造条件？你知道，我如何设计一个环境，让我想做的改变变得容易？在很多方面，这是**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）的驱动问题之一，那就是我在写这本书时，偶然发现了一系列关于意志力和自控力的研究。很多关于习惯的表面对话都围绕着纪律和意志力。你知道，人们会看着一个职业运动员，然后说：“天哪，如果我像他们一样有纪律就好了。”但我，你知道，我采访了一个曾为**费城老鹰队**（*Philadelphia Eagles*）效力的球员，他说：“你知道，在我的职业生涯中，一切都是为我们设计的。我们去体育场，有专业的教练和营养师。食物为我们准备好。所有的训练都经过设计，教练每天都督促我们以正确的顺序进行正确的训练。你知道，一切都存在于这样一个环境中，成功的条件已经完全创造好了。”他说：“我退役后，那是我最难坚持的时候。”人们会把我当作职业运动员，然后想：“哇，你真有纪律！”但实际上，你知道，我所做的就是受益于我的环境，我们所有人都是这样。所以，我认为你可以环顾自己的环境，然后问自己：“我如何更好地为成功创造条件？”让我们忘记我是一个更有纪律的人，或者是一个拥有超人意志力的人，让我们努力让每天做我想做的事情变得尽可能容易。所以，我认为有几个问题很有帮助。第一个是，走进你每天花大部分时间的房间，你的办公室、客厅、厨房、卧室，然后环顾四周，问自己：“这个空间是为鼓励什么而设计的？”你知道，这里有什么行为是显而易见的？这里有什么行为是容易的？你就会开始注意到，它是为某些事情而设计的。嗯，你知道，很多人觉得他们看太多电视，但走进任何一个客厅，你知道，所有的沙发和椅子都朝向哪里？这个房间是为让你做什么而设计的？我不是说你需要重新布置整个房子，但你知道，你可以注意到，如果你把健康食品放在台面上，让它可见，你吃它的可能性就会大得多。我在书中的一个例子是，我以前买苹果，然后把它们放在冰箱底部的保鲜盒里，我就会有点忘记它们在那里。它们只是藏在抽屉里，然后我会在大约一周后找到它们，其中两个已经坏了，我就会想，我是在浪费食物和浪费钱。所以，我只是买了一个小展示碗，把它们放在台面上，让它们可见，现在你每次走进来都会拿一个，它们两天内就吃完了。所以这只是环境的改变。什么东西是显而易见的？你知道，你是否在创造条件，让你想要的改变或你想要的行为是显而易见的、有吸引力的、容易的、令人满意的？你做得越多，你就越有可能坚持下去。你想要能够走进你每天所在的房间，而好习惯是**阻力最小的路径**。它是最容易做的事情。而很多时候，你走进房间，那些让你分心的事情更容易做，你就会觉得自己在逆流而上，努力与环境抗争才能实现改变。所以那是一个问题。你还有关于环境的另一个问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I think that's one of the best questions. How can I create the conditions for success? You know, how can I how can I design an environment where my desired change is easy? In a lot of ways, that's one of the driving questions of **Atomic Habits** is to say there's this I came across this body of research when I was working on the book about willpower and self-control. And a lot of the surface level conversations about habits that people have are about discipline and willpower. You know, people will look at a professional athlete and they'll say, "Man, if I was just as disciplined as them, but I, you know, I talked to one guy who played for the **Philadelphia Eagles** and um he said, you know, during my career, everything was designed for us. You know, we went, we would go to the stadium and we have professional trainers and nutritionists. The food is prepared for us. The you know all the workouts are designed coaches are on us every day to do the right drills in the right order and to you know like everything is there's this environment where the conditions for success have been fully created and he's like after I retired that was the hardest time for me to stick to it like people would look at me as a professional athlete and think wow how disciplined are you but in fact you know what I was is I was benefiting from my environment and all of us are like that and so I I think you can look around your own environment and say how can I do a better job of creating the conditions for success. Let's forget about me being a more disciplined f person or being, you know, someone with superhuman willpower and let's try to make it as easy as possible for me to do the things I want to do each day. So, a couple questions I think are helpful. One is walk into the rooms where you spend most of your time each day, your office, your living room, your kitchen, bedroom, and just look around and ask yourself, what is this space designed to encourage? You know, what behaviors are obvious here? What behaviors are easy here? And you'll start to notice that it's designed for certain things. Um, you know, a lot of people feel like they watch too much TV, but walk into any living room, you know, like where do all the couches and chairs face? What is this room designed to get you to do? And I'm not saying you need to rearrange your entire house, but you know, you can notice that if you put the healthy food out on the counter and it's visible, you're much more likely to eat it. Like I one of the examples in the book is that I used to buy apples and I would put them in the crisper in the bottom of the fridge and I would kind of like forget that they were there. They were just tucked away in the drawer and then I'd find them in like a week and like two of them had gone bad and I'm like I'm wasting food and I'm wasting money. So instead I just bought this little display bowl and I put them in the counter uh on the counter just visible and now you grab one whenever you walk in and they're like gone in two days. And so it's just a change in the environment. What is obvious? You know, are you creating conditions where the change that you want or the behavior that you want is obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying? And the more that you can do that, the more likely it is that you'll follow through. You want to you want to be able to walk into the rooms that you're in each day, and the good habit is the **path of least resistance**. It's the easiest thing to do. And a lot of the time you walk into rooms and it's the distractions that are easier to do and you feel like you're swimming upstream and trying to fight your environment to make a change happen. So that was one question. What's the other one you had around environment?

**主持人**: 我喜欢“我是否正在为成功创造必要的条件？”“这个房间是为鼓励什么而设计的？”嗯，然后“我如何让这种行为更明显？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I like am I creating the conditions required for success? What is this room designed to encourage? Um and then how can I make this behavior more obvious?

</details>

**James Clear**: 有很多方法可以做到这一点。比如，如果你想跑步，前一天晚上就把跑鞋和衣服准备好。我有一个朋友，他睡觉时就穿着跑裤，所以他起床后，只需要穿上鞋和T恤，就能出门了。你知道，他只是想让它尽可能地**无摩擦**。我发现，再给你举个例子，如果我买了一打啤酒，把它放在我一开门就能看到的架子上，我每晚都会拿一瓶，晚餐时喝一瓶，就因为它们在那里。但如果我把它藏在最低的架子后面，我得弯腰才能看到。有时我甚至会忘记它们在那里，它们可能会在那里放上两周。你知道，这只是关于什么东西是显而易见的。嗯，什么东西在你面前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And there are there are a number of ways that you can do that. Like some of it is just, you know, uh if you want to go for a run, take your running shoes and your clothes, set them out the night before. I have I have one guy who um he sleeps in his running shorts, so he just gets up, all he has to do is put his shoes and a shirt on, then he's out the door. You know, he's just trying to make it as **frictionless** as possible. I found that uh to give you like another example, if I buy a six-pack of beer and I put it on the, you know, shelf where I can just see it as soon as I open up the door, I'll grab one each night and have one at dinner just cuz it's there. But if I tuck it down on the lowest shelf and like put it in the back, I gotta like bend down to see it. Sometimes I'll forget that it's there. It'll be there for like two weeks, you know, and it's just about what is obvious. Um what is in front of you,

</details>

**主持人**: 就像苹果一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: just like the apples.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。对。这只是它的反面。嗯，所以，我不是说这足以改变上瘾行为之类的，但如果你让很多行为不那么明显，不那么容易接触到，它们可能会在一定程度上自我抑制，达到你期望的程度。我遵循的另一个小规则是，我每天把手机放在另一个房间，直到午餐时间。这样，从早上9点到中午左右，我就可以专注于自己的日程，而不是回应别人的日程。你知道，我不会被打扰。如果我的手机在我旁边，我就会像其他人一样，每三分钟就查看一次，就因为它在那里，对吧？但我有一个家庭办公室，所以我把它放在另一个房间。它就在走廊尽头，只有大约30秒的路程，但我从不去拿它。很多行为都是这样。这就像，你到底想要它还是不想要？你知道，从某种意义上说，你非常想要它，以至于它在你旁边时你每三分钟就会查看一次，但从另一种意义上说，你从来没有那么想要它，以至于愿意走30秒的路去拿它。所以，一点点**摩擦**有时可以在塑造行为方面发挥很大作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yes. Right. And yeah, it's just the inverse of that. Um and so, uh I'm not saying that that's enough to change like an addicted behavior or anything like that, but so many of your behaviors will curtail themselves possibly to the desired degree if it is less obvious. If it's not as accessible. Another little rule that I follow is I take my phone and I try to leave it uh in another room until lunch each day. So that just gives me from like 9 to noonish where I can work on my own agenda and not respond to everybody else's agenda. You know, I'm not interrupted. And if if I have my phone next to me, I'm like everybody else. I'll check it every 3 minutes just cuz it's there, right? But I have a home office and so I put it in a different room. It's just down the hall. It's only like 30 seconds away, but I never go get it. And so many behaviors are like that. It's like, well, did you want it or not? You know, like in the one sense, you wanted it so bad that you would check it every 3 minutes when it was next to you, but in another sense, you never wanted it bad enough that you would work for 30 seconds and walk down the hall to get it. And so, a little bit of **friction** can sometimes go a long way in shaping a behavior.

### 培养处理不确定性的心态

**主持人**: 对于那些没有信心开始的人，你会说什么？任何时候你做新事情，从定义上讲，你都在做一些你没有资格做的事情。如果已经做过，那就不是新事物了。如果你已经具备某种资格、技能或经验，那么你就有资格做。它就不是新事物了。它只是你在重复以前做过的事情。所以，你必须认识到，任何新事物都伴随着一定程度的不确定性。所以，我认为接受这一点是一个很好的开始。第二点是，你不需要今天就弄清楚所有事情。我喜欢的一个框架，我想我最初是从**肖恩·普里**（*Sean Puri*）那里听到的。他说ABC。好的，A是对你当前情况的诚实评估。努力用清晰的眼光看待你当前的现实。Z是你最终想要达到的目标。B是你的下一步。你只需要知道A、B和Z。你不需要知道C到Y的步骤。但人们常常会说服自己：“嗯，我不知道C到Y的步骤是什么。”或者即使他们意识到自己不会全部计划好，他们也会说：“是的，但我有点想知道C、D和E是什么。”你知道，他们想能够看得更远一点。但你必须习惯一定程度的不确定性。有句话，我最近在我的时事通讯中分享过。我想是**伊恩·威尔逊**（*Ian Wilson*）说的，他是**通用电气**（*GE*）的一位高管，他说：“再多的信息也无法消除这样一个事实：你所有的知识都关乎过去，而你所有的决定都关乎未来。”这只是生活的一个基本现实。知识纯粹关乎过去和所学到的东西，而决定纯粹关乎未来和无法预测的东西。所以你必须接受这个现实。在很多方面，我实际上认为最强大的**心理韧性**形式，最强大或最有弹性的准备形式，是一种能够处理不确定性的心态。你知道，我们都试图抵制这一点，我们试图控制现实。我们试图预测情景和结果。我们试图提前弄清楚会发生什么。但实际上，你所需要的一切并不是预测未来。你所需要的是能够处理不确定性的信心。无论发生什么，我都能想办法解决。我想，如果我用一句话概括创业，我会说它是你能够想办法解决问题的信任和意愿。嗯，在你的事业发展过程中，总会有某个时刻你会觉得：“嗯，我们不太确定未来会带来什么。”你知道，我有一个播客，谁知道人工智能会如何改变它，但如果你相信自己能想办法解决，那就太好了。你就可以成为一个创业者。你会，你知道，你会在过程中想办法解决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: What would you say to somebody who doesn't have the confidence to start? Anytime you do something new, by definition, you are doing something you're unqualified for. It can't it can't be if you've already done it. If you already have some type of qualification or skill set or experience, then you're qualified for it. It can't be new. It's just something you're repeating that you've done before. So, you have to realize that there is some level of uncertainty that comes with anything that is new. So, I think just accepting that is a good starting place. The the second thing is that you don't need to figure it all out today. Like one of the frameworks that I like, I think I heard this originally from **Sean Puri**. He said ABC. Okay, so A is an honest assessment of your current situation. Look, try to look at your current reality with clear eyes. Z is where you ultimately want to end up. And B is your next step. And all you need to know is A, B, and Z. You don't need to know steps C through Y. But so often people will convince themselves, well, I don't know what steps C through Y are. Or even if they realize they're not going to plan it all out, they're like, "Yeah, but I kind of want to know what C, D, and E are." You know, they want to be able to see a little bit further into the future. But you have to become comfortable with some level of uncertainty. There's that quote, I just shared it in my newsletter recently. I think it's from **Ian Wilson**. He was a **GE** executive where he said, "No amount of information is going to allay the fact that all of your knowledge is about the past and all of your decisions are about the future." It's just a fundamental reality of life. Knowledge is purely about the past and what has been learned and decisions are purely about the future and what cannot be predicted. And so you have to become okay with with that reality. In a lot of ways, I actually think the most powerful form of **mental toughness**, the most powerful or resilient form of preparation is a mindset that can handle uncertainty. You know, it's the we all we all try to resist this, you know, we try to control reality. We try to predict scenarios and outcomes. We try to figure out what's going to happen ahead of time. But really all you need is not to predict the future. What you need is the confidence that you can handle uncertainty. That that whatever happens, I will be able to figure it out. I think if I was going to encapsulate entrepreneurship in a nutshell, I would say it is the trust and the willingness that you can figure it out. Um, it's the it's there's always going to be some point on the curve with your business where you're like, well, we're not quite sure what the future's going to bring. You know, I have a podcast and who knows how AI is going to change that, but if you're if you trust that you can figure it out, great. You can be an entrepreneur. You'll make, you know, you'll figure it out along the way.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们如何在实践中培养这种心态？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do we develop that mindset practically? Like

</details>

**James Clear**: 我认为它是通过小方式练习，然后随着时间的推移而积累的。所以，嗯，我不认为运动是唯一的方法，但这是我做到的方式。所以，我将用它作为一个例子。有很多方法可以做到。嗯，运动的一个好处是，你必须公开失败。嗯，你知道，所以我打了17年的棒球，一直打到大学。嗯，你知道，早年你在T球或少年棒球联盟什么的，你打球，然后你犯了一个错误。那感觉不好，对吧？你让整个团队失望了，但你意识到生活还在继续。你公开失败了，然后你继续前进。嗯，后来我在大学时，你知道，我们不仅一起打比赛，还在健身房一起训练。你出现在健身房，看着旁边的人，你意识到他比你强壮一点。那感觉不好。你看到了吗？然后你就会想：“嗯，让我试试创造一个新的个人纪录。我会在杠铃上再加五磅。”你在所有人面前失败了。你没有举起那个重量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I think that it's practiced in small ways and then it accumulates over time. So, um, I don't think sports is the only way to do this, but it's the way that I did it. So, I'll use it as an example. There are many ways you could do it. Um, one thing that's great about sports is that you have to fail publicly. Um, you know, so you I played I played baseball all the way through college, played it for 17 years of my life and um, you know, the early years you're in T-ball or little league or whatever and you're playing and then you make an error. That does not feel good, right? Like you let the whole team down, but you realize that life goes on. You failed publicly and you move forward. Um later when I was in college, you know, we're not only playing games together, we're also training together in the gym. You show up in the gym, you look at the guy next to you, you realize he's a little bit stronger than you. That doesn't feel great. You see that? Then you're like, "Well, let me try to set a new PR. I'll throw five more pounds on the bar." You fail in front of everybody. You miss that lift.

</details>

**主持人**: 那感觉不好。但是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That doesn't feel good. But

</details>

**James Clear**: 你继续前进。30秒后，你又回到它身边，然后去做下一件事。它以小方式一次又一次地发生。但公开失败会训练你的思维。它教导你，最重要的不是你总是赢，而是你总是不断努力，不断奋斗。在很多方面，真正重要的问题不是我能成功什么或我能实现什么，而是什么值得我为之努力，你知道，这才是你真正想要的，就是不断努力，不断奋斗。当你训练这个肌肉，并以所有这些小方式发展它时，最终你会达到一个能够以大方式处理它的地步。你知道，我记得我大四那年，我的最后一个赛季，我当时说，我不想我们输，但如果我们要输，我希望我是那个在场上的人，你知道，就像让我上场。我能承受，我能接受失败，你知道，我不想输，但我能承受。嗯，我现在对我的工作也是这种感觉，你知道，在商业上。我把所有的一切都投入到**《原子习惯》**的发布中，你知道，我们提前15个月就开始计划那个发布。嗯，在生活的很多地方，足够好就是足够好，但偶尔你会发现一个领域，足够好是不够的，你想要做到最好。我决定对我来说，那是我要尽力做到最好的事情之一。这伴随着风险。这伴随着脆弱性。你知道，你将花费接下来的一年半时间来推广、推动和谈论你投入了三到五年生命的东西。如果人们讨厌它怎么办？如果评论不好怎么办？你知道，如果你获得了重要的采访，上了早间节目，然后书却失败了，卖不出去怎么办？嗯，如果出版商因为他们预付了版税或者他们期望它卖得好但它却没有表现好而生我的气怎么办？你就会带着所有这些问题，我的想法，我想部分是因为我随着时间的推移训练了那个肌肉，是“我能处理好”，你知道，如果它失败了，我会处理好的，你知道，你会没事的。嗯，但你必须，我认为一旦你有了那种信心，你就有信心全力以赴。你知道，问题是如果你没有那种信心，你就会开始说服自己放弃。你会把它冲淡。你知道，你不会全力推广它。你不会做所有你能做的事情，因为你有点害怕结果会是什么。如果它进展不顺利怎么办？所以我就不会全力以赴，然后它就会变成一个**自我实现的预言**，因为它如果你不付出你拥有的一切，它肯定不会那么顺利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: You move on. 30 seconds later, you get back to it and you go do the next thing. And it happens again and again in small ways. But failing publicly trains your mind. It teaches you that what matters most is not that you always win, but that you always keep reaching, that you always keep striving. In a lot of ways, the real important question to ask is not what can I succeed on or what can I achieve, but what is worth reaching for, you know, and that's really what you want is to keep reaching, to keep striving. And as you train that muscle and develop it in all those little small ways, eventually you get to a point where you can handle it in big ways. You know, I remember my senior year, my my final season, um I said like, I don't want us to lose, but if we're going to lose, I want to be the one who's playing, you know, like put me out there. I can handle I can take the loss, you know, I don't want to lose, but I can handle it. Um and I feel that way now, too, about stuff that I do, you know, in business. I put everything that I had into the **Atomic Habits** launch, you know, like I I we started planning that launch 15 months ahead of time. Um, and I in a lot of places in life, good enough is good enough, but every now and then you find an area where good enough is not good enough and you want to do it the best you can do it. And I decided that for me, that was one of those things that I was going to try to do as good as I could possibly do it. And that comes with risk. That comes with vulnerability. You know, you're going to spend your next year and a half promoting and pushing and talking about this thing that you poured three to five years of your life into. What if people hate it? What if the reviews aren't any good? You know, what if you secure big interviews and you go on morning shows and then the book flops and it doesn't sell? Um, what if the publisher is mad at me because they paid me in advance or they were expecting it to do well and then it doesn't perform? And like you sit with all those questions and my thought I think partially because I had trained that muscle uh over time was I can handle it you know like if it if we lose I'll I'll deal with it you know and you'll be fine. Um but you have I think once you have that confidence then you have the confidence to go for it fully you know the problem is if you don't have that confidence you start talking yourself out of it. You water it down. You know you don't promote it all the way. You don't do all the things you could do because you're kind of scared of what the result could be. What if it doesn't go well? So then I don't go all the way in and then it kind of becomes a **self-fulfilling prophecy** because it for sure isn't going to work that well if you don't give it everything you have.

</details>

**主持人**: 当你这么说的时候，我想到的是“**为赢而战**”和“**为不输而战**”之间的区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: As you're saying that, the thing that comes to mind is like the difference between **playing to win** and **playing not to lose**

</details>

**主持人**: 以及“为不输而战”所带来的犹豫，与“全力以赴”之间的区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and the hesitation that comes with playing not to lose versus like just going for it.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。几年前的女足世界杯决赛，美国队击败了日本队，**卡莉·劳埃德**（*Carly Lloyd*）在那场比赛中进了三个球。嗯，我想她的第三个球是从中场踢进的。那是一个超远射门，但那次进攻最酷的地方在于，她看到了机会，并立刻抓住了它。她从未说服自己放弃。那是一个你在大多数情况下绝不会尝试的射门。那不是一个好射门。那不是一个高命中率的射门。嗯，但她看到了一个空档，她就去做了。没有丝毫犹豫。嗯，类似地，完全不同的领域。有一次我和我妻子，我妻子，我一点都不懂音乐，但我妻子懂，我们当时在听**扎克·布朗乐队**（*Zack Brown Band*）唱一首歌，她说：“我喜欢听他唱歌的一点是，他的声音里没有丝毫犹豫。当他该唱歌词的时候，他会全身心投入。嗯，他不会自我怀疑或犹豫不决。他唱歌充满信心。”所以在所有这些不同的领域，体育、音乐、商业，你都不能有那种犹豫。你知道，你不想成为那个说服自己放弃的人。我想，对我来说，我努力不成为自己的**瓶颈**。你知道，我不想成为第一个对自己说“不”的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah. There's in the World Cup final, women's World Cup a couple years ago, uh the US beat Japan and **Carly Lloyd** scored like three goals in that game. Um and I think the third of her goal she kicked from midfield. It was like just super long, but she the cool thing about that play is that she saw the opportunity to go for it and she went for it right away. She never talked herself out of it. It was a shot that you would never take in most circumstances. It's not a good shot. It's not a high percentage shot. Um, but she saw an opening and she went for it. There was no hesitation. Um, similarly, totally different domain. Uh, one time my wife and I, my wife's, I'm not very musical at all, but my wife is, and we were listening to **Zack Brown Band** play a song, and she was like, "One thing I love about listening to him sing is that there's no hesitation in his voice. When he when it comes time to sing the lyric, he's like fully in it. Um, he's not like second-guessing himself or doubting himself. There's like singing with confidence." And so in all these different domains, sports, music, business, you can't have that hesitation. You know, you don't want to be the one talking yourself out of it. I think uh for me, I try to not be my own **bottleneck**. You know, I I don't want to have I don't want to be the first person to tell myself no.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我希望世界先对我说“不”，然后我再根据得到的反馈进行调整，但我不想说服自己放弃。我内心的一个小格言是，我尝试**从魔法倒推**（*work backwards from magic*）。所以，神奇的结果会是什么？然后让我尝试找出几种不同的路径，可能能让我达到那里，我会开始向前迈进，然后我会从世界那里得到反馈。你知道，我不会对自己说“不”。也许世界会告诉我“不”，我需要调整方向。但我从神奇的结果开始，然后从那里出发。你发现，我的意思是，我在家人和朋友身上都看到了这一点。我周围的很多人，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: You know, I want the world to tell me no first and then I'll and then I'll adjust based on the feedback that I get, but I don't want to talk myself out of it. One of my little sayings internally is like I try to **work backwards from magic**. So what would the magical outcome be and then let me try to figure out a couple different paths that could potentially get me there and I'll start to take steps forward and then I'll get feedback from the world. You know, I don't tell myself no. Maybe the world will tell me no and I need to adjust the course. But I start with the magical outcome and then go from there. And what you find, I mean, I see it with family. I see it with friends. Like so many people that I'm around,

</details>

**James Clear**: 几乎总是，你会在世界真正阻止你做某事之前就说服自己放弃。你很少会真正遇到世界上的硬性阻碍，他们会说：“抱歉，这不可能。你正在尝试做的事情，它不可能发生。”几乎总是还有其他人你可以交谈，还有其他方法你可以采取，还有其他尝试你可以去做，而你是那个说服自己放弃的人，而不是世界。所以，我努力不成为那样的人。我努力，你知道，允许自己去尝试，然后边走边调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: almost always you talk yourself out of it before the world actually prevents you from doing it there. It's very rare that you truly run up against a hard stop in the world where they say, "Sorry, this isn't possible. What you're trying to do is it can't happen. There's almost always somebody else you could have talked to, another approach you could have taken, another attempt you could have gone for, and you're the one who talks yourself out of doing it. Um, not the world." And so I try to not be that person. I try to, you know, give myself permission to go for it and then adjust along the way.

</details>

**主持人**: 我喜欢你这些小格言。“**像雷霆般行动**”（*move like thunder*），你知道，**从魔法倒推**。你还有哪些内心格言，此刻让你深有共鸣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love these little sayings you have. You **move like thunder**, you know, **work backwards from magic**. What other internal sayings do you have that really resonate with you in this moment?

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，我从祖父那里学到的最重要的事情之一是他的小格言是**PMA**，即**积极心态**（*Positive Mental Attitude*）。所以，在任何情况下，你都尝试保持积极的心态，无论当前情况如何。这听起来有时有点玄乎，或者说总是积极思考什么的，但我一直在努力更好地实践它，并教我的孩子们如何实践它。所以，一种方法是，当你遇到一些感觉困难或让你不自信的事情时，你尝试在视觉上进行排练，并强调可能发生的好的一面。这可以追溯性地发生，也可以在事情发生前的**预想**（*previsualization*）中发生。所以，我给你举两个例子。回顾过去，当我打棒球时，我大概10岁、12岁或14岁，每个赛季结束后，我们都会坐在我父母家的后院露台上，我和爸爸会谈论这一年，我们会谈论这一年中的好球，我打得最好的比赛，我们赢的比赛。我们会努力强调——当时我不知道，但他所做的就是帮助我强调上个赛季的大小胜利。嗯，我记得我们的一些对话，比如我上高中时，我从来都不是我所在任何球队中最好的球员。但他会说：“听着，如果你坚持下去，你会发现每年都会有人掉队，你知道，所以仅仅通过**坚持不懈**（*longevity*）的力量，留在比赛中，你就会受益。”他是对的。我每年都变得更好。嗯，所以那是一个回顾性的例子。你是否在强调你的胜利？然后展望未来，如果你做的是预想版本。所以，我有几个孩子。嗯，其中一个三岁，开始上幼儿园。嗯，他第一天去幼儿园时，送别时很难过。他不喜欢。别，你知道，别离开我。我不知道这是什么地方。感觉，你知道，很可怕，等等。所以，他第一次送别时很难过。第二天来了，同样的事情。有点哭。送别时又很难过。所以，第三天，嗯，我早上叫他们起床，给他们准备好，给他们做早餐什么的。所以我在厨房里。我说：“好了，孩子们。今天是幼儿园日。”他立刻就想哭，我就说：“等等，等等，等等。嗯，你喜欢你的老师，对吧？杰伦老师，凯特琳老师，你不喜欢她们吗？”他说：“喜欢。”我说：“好的。嗯，你们昨天做了什么？你们玩了蜡笔和胶棒。那很有趣，不是吗？”他说：“是的。”嗯，我说：“你们有零食时间，还有午餐。那些都是好事。”他说：“是的。”然后我说：“放学后，你们去操场玩。你们可以滑滑梯什么的。”他说：“是的，是的。”我只说了这些，你知道，但我试图做的是让他强调即将到来的积极部分，想象这一天会是多么美好。嗯，他去了——我不知道，也许我们只是运气好，但他那天送别时非常顺利，你知道，从那以后他每天都喜欢幼儿园，他一直都很好。所以你可以看到这种技能如何应用于生活中。你知道，他们四年级了，准备做第一次演讲，他们对在班级前面讲话感到紧张。太好了。让我们回顾一下，强调哪些部分会是好的。嗯，或者，你知道，他们八年级了，要去参加第一次学校舞会，他们觉得很奇怪和尴尬。让我们谈谈一个美好的夜晚会是什么样子。所以，生活中很多问题都来自于你的大脑过度强调次要细节，错误的次要细节。而我试图对自己、我的孩子以及我周围的人做的，就是鼓励他们强调好的次要细节。嗯，你知道，你关注一天中的哪个部分，你给自己讲的是什么故事？所以你做得越多，它就像一块肌肉，你做得越多，你就会做得越好，这最终又回到了我祖父教我的**PMA**，**积极心态**。嗯，所以这是我的另一个小格言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um, one of the biggest things I learned from my grandfather was he his little saying was **PMA**, **positive mental attitude**. So in any scenario you try to have a positive outlook regardless of the current circumstances. And that sounds a little kind of woo wooey sometimes or you know always think positive or whatever but I have tried to become better at practicing it and teaching my kids how to practice it. So, one way that you can do it is when you run up against something that feels kind of difficult or feels like um you don't feel confident about it, you try to rehearse it visually and you emphasize the good portions of what could happen. And this can this can happen either in retrospect or it can happen uh **previsualization** before the thing happens. So, I'll give you two examples. In retrospect, when I played baseball and I was like 10 or 12 or 14, after each season, we would go sit on the back deck at my parents house and my dad and I would talk about the g the year and we would talk about the good plays from the year, my best plays, my best games, the games that we won. We would we would try to highlight I didn't know this at the time, but what he was doing was he was helping me highlight the wins from, you know, small and big from that last season. And uh I can remember some of the conversations that we had like one I I got into high school and I was never the best player on any team that I was on. But he was like, "Look, if you just keep sticking with it, what you're going to find is that guys will drop off each year, you know, and so by just by there's this power of **longevity** of staying in the game that will benefit you." And he was right. I I became a better player every year that I played. Um so that's like a retrospective one. You are you emphasizing your wins and then the looking forward if you do like a previsualization version of it. So, I have a couple kids. Um, one of them is three and starting preschool. And, uh, he went to preschool on the first day. He had a hard drop off. He he didn't like it. Don't, you know, don't leave me. I don't know what this place is. It feels, you know, scary, whatever. So, he had a tough day getting dropped off the first time. Second day comes, same thing. Kind of cries a little bit. Has a tough day when he gets dropped off. So, the third day, um, I get them up in the morning and I get get them ready and get them breakfast and stuff. So, I'm in the kitchen. I said, "All right, guys. Today's a preschool day." And immediately he was like and I was like hold on hold on hold on. Um you like your teachers, right? Miss Jaylen, Miss Caitlyn, don't you like them? He's like, "Yeah." And I was like, "Okay. Um what did you guys do yesterday? You got to play with the crayons and the glue sticks. Like that was fun, wasn't it?" He was like, "Yeah." Um I said, "You have snack time and lunch. Like that those are good things." He's like, "Yeah." And then I said, "After school, you go play on the playground. You get to go down the slides and everything." He's like, "Yeah, yeah." And that was all I said, you know, but what I'm trying to do is is to get him to emphasize the positive portions of what's about to come, to imagine what it would be like for the day to be good. And um he went I don't know, maybe we just got lucky, but he went and he had a great drop off that day, you know, and he's he's loved it every day since. He's he's been fine. And so you can see how that skill can be applied throughout life. You know, they're in fourth grade and they're getting ready to give their first presentation and they feel nervous about talking in front of the class. Great. Let's walk through this and emphasize what the good parts are going to be. Um or you know they're getting they're in eighth grade and they're going to go to their first school dance and they feel weird and awkward about it. Like let's talk about what a good night would look like. And so so many of your problems in life come from your brain overemphasizing minor details, the wrong minor details. And what I'm trying to do with both myself and my kids and the people around me is to encourage them to emphasize good minor details. Um you know to what what portion of the day are you latching on to and what story are you telling yourself and so the more that you can do that I it's kind of like a muscle the more that you do it the better you get at it and that's ultimately that goes back to that **PMA** **positive mental attitude** that you know my grandpa taught me um and so that's another one of my little

### 声誉与定位

**主持人**: 我喜欢。我想谈谈声誉。我想听听，也许我就说这个词，然后你可以谈几分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love that I want to talk about reputation I want to hear maybe I'll just say the word and like you can riff on it for a few minutes

</details>

**James Clear**: 声誉。比如我的声誉，或者我如何看待它，我如何看待声誉。我其实不太在意它。嗯，我不太担心。嗯，我想我主要考虑声誉的方式是，我希望被认为是一个有用的人。你知道，**有用**（*useful*）是我经常回想的一个词。如果你，嗯，**乔什·考夫曼**（*Josh Kaufman*）有一个很好的框架。它有三点。我认为是真实、有用和清晰。嗯，你知道，你想要写真实准确的东西。你想要写有用且可操作的东西。你想要清晰易懂地做到这一点。我认为这确实描述了我的很多方法，以及我如何努力专注于，你知道，把工作投入到世界中。嗯，好吧。所以，我想我不太在意我的声誉，但这是我通常如何看待声誉、地位、品牌之类的。最终，你的声誉将是你所做工作的质量。所以，我认为**布伦特·贝霍尔**（*Brent Behore*）曾说过，这就像你可以从一个品牌那里期望的结果范围。嗯，所以你做的东西质量越高，越有用，越有价值，越可操作，你就越会因此而闻名。现在，确实有一些**预设**（*priming*）可以发挥作用。所以，比如在我的时事通讯321的顶部，它写着“网络上每字智慧含量最高的时事通讯”。我试图在那里设定一个期望，对吧？当有人注册订阅并阅读它时。现在你看到它，你就会想：“好的，我即将阅读一些充满智慧、内容密集且信息量大的东西。信号多，噪音少。”这就是我试图设定的基调。现在，反过来说，你必须兑现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: reputation like my reputation or how I think about it how I think about reputation I don't really think about it that much. Um I'm not I'm not that worried about it. Um I guess the main way that I think about it is I want to be known as someone who is **useful**. You know, like useful is a word that I come back to a lot. If you if you uh **Josh Kaufman** has a good framework. It's like three things. I think it's true, useful, and clear. Um you know, it's like you want to write things that are true and accurate. You want to write things that are useful and actionable. And you want to be clear and understandable in how you do it. I think that that does describe a lot of my approach and how I'm trying to focus on, you know, putting work into the world. Um, all right. So, I guess I don't think about my reputation that much, but this is how I generally think about reputation, status, brand, whatever. Ultimately, your reputation will be the work, the quality of the work that you do. So, it is, I think **Brent Behore** said at one point, it's like the range of outcomes that you can expect from a brand. Um, and so the more that you do things that are high quality and useful and valuable and actionable, the more that you will become known for that. Now, there is a little bit of **priming** that can go on. So, like at the top of 321, my newsletter, it says uh the most wisdom per word of any newsletter on the web. I'm trying to set an expectation there, right? Like it's when somebody signs up and subscribes and they read that. Now you see that and you're like, "Okay, I'm about to read something that has a lot of wisdom and is like dense and informative. There's a lot of signal and very little noise." That's the the tone I'm trying to set. Now, the flip side of that is you have to deliver.

</details>

**James Clear**: 所以，如果你设定了那个期望，但你没有真正兑现，那么结果就不会很好。所以我也把责任放在自己身上一点。你知道，没有什么可以躲藏的。我用我的**Instagram**账号也是如此。那是一个非常奇怪的Instagram账号。你知道，上面没有我的照片。只有文字。嗯，但它有点像孔雀的尾巴，你知道，从某种意义上说，它是一个非常有用的障碍。它非常视觉化，它展示了哪些孔雀足够强壮，拥有这种多余的尾巴，仍然能够生存并逃脱捕食者。那些是拥有优秀基因的孔雀。嗯，当你在Instagram账号上无法隐藏在任何其他东西后面，只有文字时，思想就必须足够好。你知道，这是一个有用的障碍。它是一个有用的，嗯，阻碍人们注意力的东西。所以我就想，嗯，如果只有文字，那它们最好写得很好。所以，嗯，我考虑设定这些**预设**，设定这些标准，然后也努力达到它们。但最终，这只是关于你所做工作的质量。所以，你越是提供有价值和有用的想法，你就越会因此而闻名。嗯，我想我也，这有点与声誉相关，但我不太考虑如何塑造它，但视角应该主要集中在读者身上，而不是你自己。我认为如果你过分关注声誉，并试图培养这种形象，那么精力就集中在错误的方向上。嗯，如果你专注于读者，那么你就会开始问不同的问题。我如何创造一些对某人来说非常有用的东西？我如何让它更具可操作性？我如何让它更容易理解和更简单？我如何让它足够容易，以至于我能够教授它？嗯，现在所有这些问题都集中在读者身上，你知道，从他们的角度来看。然后还有一些问题，比如人们现在需要什么？你知道，比如什么，人们在寻求什么？嗯，并努力关注这一点。所以，在大多数情况下，我认为如果你努力关心他人，声誉就会自己解决。嗯，如果你的视角集中在他们身上，那么最终，你知道，它对你来说就会运作得很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And so if you if you set that expectation and you don't actually deliver, well, it's not going to go very well. And so I'm also putting the responsibility on me a little bit. You know, there's like nothing to hide behind. I do this with my **Instagram** account. It's like a very weird Instagram account. You know, there's no photos of me. It's just text. Um, but it's kind of like a peacock's tail, you know, in the sense that it's a very useful hindrance. Like, it's very visual visual and it shows which peacocks are uh strong enough to have this kind of superfluous tail to still survive and escape predators. Those are the ones that have great genes. Well, when you can't hide behind anything else on your Instagram account and it's just words, the ideas have to be good enough. You know, it's a it's a useful uh hindrance. It's a useful um blockage to getting people's attention. And so I'm like, well, if it's just going to be words, they better be pretty good. So, um I think about setting those priming those expectations and setting those standards and then also trying to reach them. But ultimately, it's just about the quality of the work that you do. And so, the more that you show up with value and useful ideas, uh the more you become known for that. Um, I think I also, this is kind of connected to reputation, but I I don't think about shaping it for me that much, but the lens should be mostly focused on the reader, not on yourself. I think if you if you think a lot about reputation and you're trying to like cultivate this image, that's the energy is focused in the wrong direction. Um, if you're focused on the reader, then you start asking different questions. How can I create something that's incredibly useful for somebody? How can I make it more actionable? How can I make it easier to understand and simpler? How can I make it easy enough that I can teach it? Um, now all those questions are focused on the reader, you know, view or their from their position. And then there's also just questions like what do people need right now? You know, like what what is what does somebody what would Yeah, what are people asking for? Um, and trying to pay attention to that. So, for the most part, I think reputation takes care of itself if you try to take care of other people. Um, and if your if your lens is focused on them, then it ends up, you know, working just fine for you.

</details>

**主持人**: 我喜欢。谢谢。那定位呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love that. Thanks. What about positioning?

</details>

**James Clear**: **定位**（*Positioning*）至关重要。嗯，定位是我思考很多的事情。我还不认为我已经完全弄明白了，但我已经看到了它有多么强大。嗯，所以让我给你举几个例子。我将从书籍的定位开始，然后谈论生活的定位。所以任何产品，它的定位和包装可能占其成功的一半。嗯，举几个书籍的例子。**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）后面有一个章节，我谈到了**刻意练习**（*deliberate practice*）。它本可以是一本关于刻意练习的书，我在其中谈论习惯，但相反，它是一本关于习惯的书，我在其中谈论刻意练习。我认为这两本书的销售方式，差异是巨大的。嗯，如果你不知道刻意练习是什么，你需要30秒来解释和描述它。它与常规练习有何不同等等。当有人考虑买书时，你没有30秒的时间。你不在书店向他们解释。所以，书的包装，书的定位，我将其描述为你在封面上看到的几乎所有东西，必须在7秒内自我推销。嗯，仅仅因为在社会中成长并成为世界的一部分，你就知道拥有好习惯是有利的，拥有坏习惯是不利的。我不需要向任何人推销这一点。我只需要向你推销的是，嘿，如果你只读一本关于习惯的书，那么**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）应该是那一本。这是一个非常不同的推销方式。嗯，所以定位和包装会产生很大的影响。另一个例子，嗯，**作者股权**（*Author's Equity*）是我帮助共同创立的这家图书出版商。我们有一本书即将出版，叫做**《过度思考者的决策指南》**（*The Overthinker's Guide to Making Decisions*），这本书基本上是关于选择的。它是一本关于选择和做决定的书。它本可以叫做别的名字，你知道，它可以叫做《决策指南》或《选择的力量》之类的。但**《过度思考者的决策指南》**（*The Overthinker's Guide to Making Decisions*）是一个很棒的包装。它是一个很棒的框架。我向很多人介绍过它，他们的回复是：“哦，我需要那本书。”嗯，这通常是一个迹象，表明你的包装做得很好，就是人们对这种方式感兴趣。所以，嗯，这些是产品定位的两个例子，我认为任何产品，定位和包装都是成功的关键部分。嗯，在我继续谈论生活定位之前，我只想提几点，它们有助于良好的定位。所以，这很多都来自于**直接响应文案**（*direct response copywriting*）的原则。这是一个很好的研究领域，或者说是一个寻找好例子的地方。但直接响应文案的核心原则之一是，你应该努力解决或满足人们**永恒而持久的渴望**（*timeless and enduring desire*）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: **Positioning** is critical. Um, positioning is something that I think a lot about. I don't think I have it figured out yet, but I have seen how powerful it can be. Um, so let me give you a couple examples. I'll start with positioning for books and then I'll start talking about positioning for life. So any product, the way that it is positioned and packaged is probably 50% of its success. Um, a couple examples from books. **Atomic Habits** has a chapter later in it where I talk about **deliberate practice**. It could have been a book about deliberate practice where I talk about habits, but instead it's a book about habits where I talk about deliberate practice. And I think the way those two books would sell, the difference is enormous. Um, if you don't know what deliberate practice is, it takes 30 seconds to unpack it and describe it. How is it different than regular practice and so on. You don't get 30 seconds when somebody's thinking about buying a book. You're not there at the store to explain it to them. So, the packaging, the positioning of the book, which I would describe as pretty much anything that you see on the cover, has to sell itself in 7 seconds, you know. Um, and just by virtue of growing up in society and being part of the world, you know that having good habits is favorable and having bad habits is unfavorable. And I don't need to sell anybody on that. All I need to sell you on is, hey, if you only read one book about habits, **Atomic Habits** should be the one. And that's a much different pitch. Um, and so the positioning and packaging makes a big difference. Another example, one that, um, so **Author's Equity** is this book publisher that I helped co-found. We have a book coming out uh called **The Overthinker's Guide to Making Decisions** and that is basically a book about choices. It's a book about choosing and making decisions. It could have been called something else you know it could have been called the decision guide or the power of choice or something you know it could have been called that. But **The Overthinker's Guide to Making Decisions** is a great package. It's a great frame. I have told multiple people about it and they the reply to me has been oh I need that. Um and that's usually a sign that you got the packaging right is that you know people are interested in that way. So um those are two examples of positioning for products and I think any any product the positioning and packaging is a critical part of the success. Um before I go on to positioning about life I just want to mention a few things that make uh for good positioning. So a lot of this is are principles from **direct response copywriting**. It's a good domain to study or good a good place to look for examples. But one of the core principles of direct response copywriting is that you should try to solve or address a **timeless and enduring desire** that people have.

</details>

**James Clear**: 很多书籍和其他产品，但我经常思考书籍。很多书籍，嗯，都与人们的渴望有点沾边。它们不是真正的渴望。然后你就会陷入一场逆风之战，你试图说服某人关注他们并不真正关心的事情。但你想要满足一个**永恒而持久的渴望**。所以，嗯，很多构成一个真正好的书名的因素，也是构成良好包装的一部分。所以，好的书名通常有三到四个特点。第一个特点是它满足了一个**永恒或持久的渴望**。第二个特点是它告诉你这本书实际上是关于什么的，这听起来有点显而易见，但很多时候人们会像关键词堆砌标题一样，你知道，他们会说“如何赚取数百万，快乐生活，实现梦想”。你就会想，这本书根本不是关于这个的，但不管怎样。嗯，他们做的第二件事或者第三件事是，它们是一个**明确无误或可拥有**的短语。所以，这通常意味着当你第一次听到它时，它会有点奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And so many books and other products, but I I think a lot about books. So many books um are kind of adjacent to a desire people have. They're not the actual desire. And then you're kind of in this uphill battle where you're trying to convince somebody to pay attention to something that they don't actually care about. But you want to address a **timeless and enduring desire**. So, um, a lot of what makes for a really good book title is part of what makes for good packaging. So, good book titles usually have three or four qualities. The first quality is it addresses a timeless or enduring desire. The second quality is it tells you what the book is actually about, which sounds kind of obvious, but a lot of the time people kind of like keyword stuff titles, you know, they say like how to make millions, be happy, and live the dream. And you're like, that's not even what this book is about, but whatever. Um, the second thing that or the third thing that they do is that they are an **unmistakable or an ownable phrase**. So, what that usually means is that it's a little bit weird when you first hear it.

</details>

**James Clear**: 很多真正标志性的书名，它们都是你在生活中其他地方听不到的短语。所以，嗯，**《人类寻找意义》**（*Man's Search for Meaning*）基本上你只在书名中听到。没有人会在日常生活中使用这个短语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: a lot of the really iconic book titles they are phrases that you do not hear elsewhere in life. So um **Man's Search for Meaning** basically you only hear that in the book title. Nobody uses that phrase in daily life.

</details>

**James Clear**: **《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》**（*How to Win Friends and Influence People*），即使是现在，把它描述为“赢得朋友”听起来也有些奇怪，你知道，但它足够奇怪，以至于你不会误解你在说什么。它们可以在读者心中占据一席之地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: **How to Win Friends and Influence People** even to even now describing it as winning friends sounds kind of odd you know but it's it's odd enough that there's no mistaking what you're talking about. They can own the real estate in the reader's mind.

</details>

**James Clear**: **《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）。在书出版之前，你不会把一个习惯描述为“原子”的。你可能会说它是小的、微小的或微不足道的，但你不会说“原子”。用“原子”来描述一个小习惯是很奇怪的，但这很好，因为你可以拥有这个短语。所以，嗯，**明确无误**，嗯，满足**永恒或持久的渴望**，告诉你这本书实际上是关于什么的。最后一个特点是，通常会有一个**对比**（*contrast*）元素，一些**惊喜**（*surprise*）元素。所以，**《富爸爸穷爸爸》**（*Rich Dad, Poor Dad*），或者，嗯，**《怦然心动的人生整理魔法》**（*The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*）。我以为整理是一件小事。现在你告诉我它是**改变人生**的。嗯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: **Atomic Habits**. Before the book came out, you would not describe a habit as atomic. You might have said it was little or small or tiny or something like that, but you wouldn't say atomic. It It's a weird way to describe a small habit, but that's good because you can own that phrase. So, um, unmistakable uh, addresses a timeless or enduring desire, tells you what the book is actually about. And the final piece is that usually there's an element of **contrast**, some element of **surprise**. So, **Rich Dad, Poor Dad**, or um **The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up**. I thought tidying up was a small thing. Now you're telling me it's life-changing. Um

</details>

**James Clear**: **《原子习惯》**，微小改变，惊人结果。你知道，你想要某种对比，有时是从小到大，有时是你可以做到的简单事情，以完成困难的事情。但需要某种形式的对比。一个很好的例子，不是自助书或商业书，是**尼尔·德格拉斯·泰森**（*Neil deGrasse Tyson*）的**《给忙碌者的天体物理学》**（*Astrophysics for People in a Hurry*）。我以为天体物理学是需要七年博士学位才能学的东西。不，实际上你只需要一个半小时就能读完这本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: **Atomic Habits**, tiny changes, remarkable results. You know, you want some kind of contrast between sometimes it's small to big, sometimes it's the easy thing, the easy thing you can do to accomplish the hard thing. But there needs to be some form of contrast. A good example that's not like a self-help book or a business book is um **Astrophysics for People in a Hurry** by **Neil deGrasse Tyson**. I thought astrophysics was something that was going to take seven years in a PhD. No, actually just read this book in an hour and a half.

</details>

**James Clear**: 所以这种对比是，嗯，很有吸引力的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And so the contrast is um is something that's compelling.

</details>

**James Clear**: 所以如果你有这四个要素，通常会带来良好的定位和包装。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: So if you have those four elements that usually leads to good positioning and packaging.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。那只是产品方面。另外还有一个关于定位的讨论，那就是**人生定位**（*life positioning*）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: All right. So that's just on the product side. Separately there's a whole other discussion about positioning which is like **life positioning**.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。你如何让自己处于有利位置，让事情发生？有很多方法可以做到这一点。我相信你也能想到很多。嗯，有时这只是关于让自己处于有利位置，让好事发生。所以，我们之前谈到了公开分享你的工作。你发布的每一集节目，你发表的每一篇博客文章，你发布的每一条社交媒体帖子，都是一个小的**表面积**（*surface area*），别人可以通过它发现你，你就可以，你知道，进行一些有趣的互动。嗯，**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）发布当天。我在**哥伦比亚广播公司**（*CBS This Morning*）接受了采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah. How can you put yourself in good positions for things to happen? And there are so many ways that you could do this. I'm sure that you can think of many, too. Um, sometimes it's just about putting yourself in positions for good things to happen. So, we talked earlier about sharing your work publicly. Every episode that you publish, every blog post that you put out, every social media post that you put up is a little bit of **surface area** that somebody could discover and you could, you know, have some interesting interaction. Um for **Atomic Habits** on launch day. I had an interview on **CBS This Morning** and um

</details>

**主持人**: 我记得。是的，那是一个重要的时刻，因为它改变了这本书的发布，从“嘿，有人出了一本书”变成了“这是一件大事”，你知道，这是一篇全国性的媒体报道，人们都在关注。基本上，它让这本书感觉可信和真实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I remember that. Yeah, it was it was a big um it was a big moment for me because it changed the launch of the book from hey some guy is releasing a book to this is a thing you know here's a piece of national media it's people are paying attention basically it made it feel credible and real and the way that it happened is I wrote an article blog post on my site four years earlier uh called the physics of productivity and it was just me trying to be clever taking Newton's three laws and applying them to productivity

</details>

**James Clear**: 它的发生方式是，我四年前在我的网站上写了一篇博客文章，叫做《生产力物理学》，那只是我试图巧妙地运用牛顿三定律并将其应用于生产力。它在那里放了四年，它很好。那是一篇普通的文章。它没有像病毒一样传播，但它表现不错。然后，在**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）出版前一年，**《纽约时报》**（*New York Times*）的一位记者偶然发现了我的网站，很喜欢，并在他们的一篇文章中链接了它。嗯，**哥伦比亚广播公司**（*CBS*）的一位制片人读了那篇文章，然后说：“嘿，我们能请你来谈谈那些生产力原则吗？”所以，我去了，在书出版前大约一年，我为CBS做了一个节目。大概是十个月左右。嗯，我做了那个大约三分钟的节目，只是一个小采访。节目一结束，我就去找**盖尔·金**（*Gail King*），我说：“我有一本书将在十个月后出版，我想等它准备好后回来上节目谈谈它。”她说：“当然，我们会请你回来。你只需要确保我们是你的第一次采访。我们希望是第一次发布。”我说：“成交。你的电子邮件地址是什么？”嗯，所以我拿到了她的电子邮件，然后发给了我的出版商，我们把一切都联系起来了。所以，当我四年前写那篇文章时，我根本不知道它会那样发展，你知道，但那只是一个小的**表面积**。我通过努力创造有价值的、持久形式的东西，让自己处于有利位置，让好事发生。你知道，我们又谈到了什么具有长**半衰期**（*half-life*）。那篇博客文章的半衰期至少有四年。嗯，我让自己处于一个好位置，让事情对我有利。你不知道它会如何发生，但你知道，如果你每次都尽力而为，并不断创造一些**表面积**，你总会在某个时候抓住一个机会。所以那是一个商业例子。嗯，有很多关于**安全边际**（*margin of safety*）的例子，尤其是在财务方面。你知道，如果你给自己留有很大的安全边际，换句话说，你的生活开支远低于你的收入，你就能应对很多突如其来的事情。所以这让你很好地应对生活中意想不到的元素。嗯，你知道，我们有一个家庭，嗯，有些医疗方面的情况，你知道，有人因为他们正在处理的问题需要一些定制的医疗设备，费用是20万美元，这笔费用很大。嗯，但如果你给自己留有巨大的安全边际，并且你已经存了好几年钱，你不知道那会是什么，对吧？它可能是那个。它也可能是——所以我的一个小习惯是，我有时会说，生活会找上你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And it sat there for four years and it it was fine. It was an average article. It didn't go viral or anything, but it did fine. And then a year before **Atomic Habits** came out, a reporter at the **New York Times** stumbled across my website and liked it and they linked to it in an article. Well, some producer at **CBS** read that article and was like, "Hey, can we have you come on and talk about those productivity principles?" So, I went on and I did a segment for CBS about a year before the book came out. It was it was maybe like 10 months or something. And um I did that segment for like three minutes, just a little interview. And as soon as it got done, I went to **Gail King** and I said, "I have a book coming out in 10 months, and I want to come back on the show and talk about it when it's ready." And she said, "Sure, we'll have you back on. You just need to be make sure that we're your first interview. Like, we want to have the first, you know, release." I said, "Deal. What's your email address?" Um and so I got her email and I sent it to um my publisher and we got it all linked up. So when I wrote that article four years earlier, I had no idea that that was going to work out like that, you know, but it was a little bit of **surface area**. I was putting myself in a position for good things to happen by trying to create something of value in an enduring format. You know, again, we talked about what has a long **half-life**. That blog post had a half-life of at least four years. Um and um I put myself in a good position for things to break my way. You don't know how it's going to happen, but you know if you try your best each time and you keep creating some surface area, you're going to catch a break at some point. So that's like a business example. Um there are tons of examples with **margin of safety**, especially with finances. You know, if you give yourself a large margin of safety, in other words, your expenses for your life are much less than what you're taking in, you can handle a lot of things coming your way. And so that is positioning yourself well for the unexpected elements of life. Um you know we have a family um situation with some medical stuff and there were you know there was some customized medical equipment that somebody needed because of what they were dealing with and it's $200,000 and it's like it's a huge expense. Um but if you give yourself a huge margin of safety and you've been saving for years, you don't know what that's going to be, right? It could be that. It could be I so one of my little things that I'll say sometimes is like life is going to come for you.

</details>

**James Clear**: 你只是不知道什么时候，你不知道什么时候轮到你，但它会找上你。总会有一些事情。嗯，所以那笔开销不是我们的“轮到”。但几年后，我妻子摔倒了，膝盖摔成了四块，我不得不休假六个月。我非常感谢过去的**詹姆斯**（*James*），对吧？就像十年前的詹姆斯，他建立了这个生意，让我可以真正休假六个月来照顾她和孩子们，因为如果我没有那个**安全边际**，我该怎么办？但我把自己放在了一个能够实现这一目标的位置。所以每年我都会审视我的状况，包括灵活性和财务方面，我只是不太关心我们的净资产。我关心的是，我今年是否处于更强的地位？你知道，只要每年都变得更强一点，安全边际更大一点，嗯，处理压力或不确定性的能力更好一点，那么，你知道，你每年都在更好地定位自己。所以有很多方法可以应用这个定位概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: You just don't know when you don't know when it will be your turn, but it will come for you. There will be something. Um so that that expense was not our turn. But a couple years later, my wife fell and broke her knee into four pieces and I had to take six months off of work. I'm like super thankful to previous **James**, right? Like James from 10 years earlier that built this business where I could actually take six months off of work to take care of her and the kids because what was I going to do if I didn't have that **margin of safety**? But I put myself in a position where I was able to make that happen. And so each year I look at my position both in terms of like flexibility and in terms of finances and I just I don't really even care about our net worth that much. What I care about is is am I in a stronger position this year? You know, like as long as each year it's getting a little bit stronger, the margin of safety gets a little bit larger, um the ability to handle stress or uncertainty gets a little bit better, then you know, you're positioning yourself better each year. And so there are lots of ways to apply that positioning concept.

### 投资哲学与时间管理

**主持人**: 稍微跑题一下。嗯，你现在是如何投资这些钱的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Just a slight off track here. Um how are you investing that money these days?

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，是的，我不知道，嗯，我不想谈论我的个人投资，但我会谈论我的个人哲学。我想我会这么说。是的，我最终意识到，嗯，你可以跑赢市场，但你会失去你的生活。嗯，我的意思是，获得超额回报是可能的，但你必须把所有时间都花在上面。我不想成为风险投资家或投资顾问，或者，你知道，像那些试图成为下一个**巴菲特**（*Buffett*）或**芒格**（*Munger*）的人。这不是我想花时间的方式。你知道，你只有一次宝贵的生命，我想把它花在其他事情上。我主要想把它花在创造上，你知道，努力创造以前不存在的东西，嗯，以及与家人共度时光。所以我正在为此优化。所以如果你能接受这一点，那么你就会意识到，嗯，也许有非常不同的或更简单的方式来投资你的钱。比如，嗯，我是**J.柯林斯**（*J. Collins*）和他的书**《通往财富的简单之路》**（*The Simple Path to Wealth*）的忠实拥护者。他的方法我认为很棒，那就是基本上把它投入**Vanguard**（**先锋集团**）的基金，然后让它增长。嗯，但它非常简单，我能把所有时间都拿回来。如果我每年赚12%，而不是15%，谁在乎呢？嗯，你知道，我宁愿放弃每年3%的回报，把我的时间花在我想要的方式上。所以，嗯，我的很多方法都围绕着这一点，围绕着简化，并努力确保我保护我的时间，而不是试图挤出超出市场回报的额外百分点。你知道，我曾经听过另一句话，那就是记住，目标不是跑赢市场。目标是最终变得富有。嗯，你知道，很多人都专注于跑赢市场，以至于他们失去了所有时间，嗯，而且，嗯，最终，我不知道，在很多情况下甚至没有跑赢市场。是的。所以，嗯，它只是给你一种不同的方法。而且我认为，嗯，投资**Vanguard**（**先锋集团**）的基金非常多元化，因为你拥有每家公司的一小部分。我意识到我没有能力预测什么会成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um yeah, I don't know that uh I don't know that I want to talk about my personal investments, but I will talk about my personal philosophy. I guess I'll say that. Yeah, I um eventually I realized uh that you can beat the market but you will lose your life. Um and so what I mean is that it is possible to get outsized returns but you have to spend all your time doing it. And I don't want to be a VC or an investment advisor or you know like somebody who's I don't know trying to be the next **Buffett** or **Munger** or whatever. It's not how I want to spend my time. You know you only get one precious life and I want to spend it on other things. I want mostly I want to spend it creating, you know, trying to make things that didn't exist before um and spending time with family. And so I'm kind of optimizing for that. So if you can be okay with that, then you realize, well, maybe there's very different ways or simpler ways to invest your money. Like um I'm a huge advocate of **J. Collins** and **The Simple Path to Wealth** that that book um he his approach I think is great, which is mostly just like dump it in **Vanguard** and let it ride. Um, but it's incredibly simple and I get all my time back. And if I'm making 12% a year rather than 15% a year, who cares? Um, you know, like I'd rather trade the 3% a year and get to spend my hours the way that I want. So, um, a lot of my a lot of my approach is based around that, around simplifying and trying to make sure that I protect my time more than trying to squeeze out um, additional percentage points beyond what the market makes. You know there I heard this other phrase once which is remember that the goal is not to beat the market. The goal is to end up wealthy. Um you know like so many people are focused on beating the market that they lose all their time um and uh end up I don't know in many cases not even beating the market. Yeah. So um it just gives you gives you a little bit of a different approach. And I think also I investing in **Vanguard** is incredibly diversified because you got a slice of every company. I have realized that I do not have the ability to predict what is going to go well.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我现在比一两年前更强烈地感觉到这一点。事情发展得太快了。**人工智能**（*AI*）的崛起，等等。我真的无法告诉你哪些公司会在三年或十年后位列《财富》500强榜首。我对此毫无信心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And I feel even more that way now than I did a year or two ago. Things are moving so fast. The rise of **AI**, whatever. Like I really I cannot tell you what companies are going to be at the top of the Fortune 500 in three years or 10 years. Like I I have no confidence in

</details>

**主持人**: 它们可能甚至不存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: they may not even exist.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。我对此毫无信心。所以，嗯，我宁愿不试图挑选赢家，而是顺应大趋势。我想问你关于你的阅读习惯，以及你如何将你阅读的内容融入到你正在做或思考的事情中，或者让它成为你最关注的事情。阅读完一些东西然后放下并忘记它太容易了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah. I I I have no confidence in it. So um I I would rather not try to pick the winners and instead just play the general trend. I wanted to ask you about your reading habit and how you take what you're reading and incorporate it into what you're doing or thinking about or make it top of mind. It's so easy to read something and sort of put it down and then forget about it.

</details>

### 阅读、写作与学习方法

**James Clear**: 我刚开始时，每周写两篇文章，持续了三年，每周一和周四。大约一年后，我达到了10万订阅者，我与自己进行了这次对话。我不知道为什么，但我有点被那个数字冲昏了头脑，我觉得现在很多人都在关注，所以它需要写得非常好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I wrote two articles a week for three years when I started out um every Monday and Thursday. And about a year in I hit 100,000 subscribers and I had this conversation with myself. I don't know why but I got kind of in my head about that number and I thought well now a lot of people are paying attention so it needs to be really good.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我本应该说的是，事情进展得很顺利。继续做你正在做的事情。对。但是，嗯，但我当时想，嗯，如果我真的想把它写好，那么我应该花更多时间来写作，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: What I should have just said was things are going very well. Just keep doing what you're doing. Right. But um but I thought, well, if I really want to make it good, then I should spend more time writing it, right?

</details>

**James Clear**: 结果是事情变得更糟，而不是更好。最终我意识到，嗯，如果我想成为一个更好的作家，我需要的不是写更多，而是读更多。这有点像给汽车加油。你知道，阅读就像给汽车加油。写作就像开车去旅行。两者都需要。你知道，就像重点不是整天坐在加油站不断给汽车加油。油箱已经满了。是的。你应该出去看看。但如果你只是不断开车，你最终会抛锚在路边。所以对我来说，阅读是我产生灵感和想法的主要方式。你几乎所有的想法都源于你所消费的东西。这太罕见了。神经科学家之间甚至还在争论，是否有可能产生一个自发的想法，一个真正自发的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And what happened is things got worse, not better. And eventually what I realized is that um if I want to be a better writer, what I needed was not to write more, but to read more. And it's kind of like uh filling a car up with gas. You know, reading is like filling the car up. Writing is like driving and going on a journey. And you need both. You know, like the point is not just to sit at the gas station all day and keep filling the car up. Like the tank is already full. Yeah. You should go go out and see something. But if you just keep driving, you end up stranded on the side of the road. And so for me, reading is the primary way that I generate inspiration and ideas. Almost every thought that you have is downstream from what you consume. It's so rare. There's there's even a debate among neuroscientists whether it's even possible to have a spontaneous thought, truly spontaneous thought.

</details>

**James Clear**: 你知道，你对我说些什么或者问我一个问题，这会激发一个想法，或者有人在交通中插队，这让你有某种感觉，等等。但这只是你对一天中遇到的情况和输入做出回应的无尽链条。所以，我们通常不会给予它如此多的重视，但当你选择在**社交媒体**（*social media*）上关注谁，当你选择听哪些播客，当你选择读哪些书时，你就是在选择你未来的思想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: You know, you say something to me or ask me a question and that sparks a thought or somebody cuts you off in traffic and that makes you feel a certain way or whatever. But it's just an endless string of you responding to the situations and inputs that come to you throughout the day. So, we don't usually give it this amount of weight, but when you choose who you follow on **social media**, when you choose what podcasts to listen to, when you choose what books to read, you are choosing your future thoughts.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**James Clear**: 如果你想要更好、更高效、更有创造性的思想，你需要更好、更高效、更有创造性的输入。所以，嗯，选择读什么，或者选择听什么，或者订阅谁，实际上是一个非常重要的决定。嗯，我发现我的阅读习惯现在，**爱默生**（*Emerson*）有句话，我想他说他读书就像老鹰在田野上空盘旋寻找猎物。嗯，我很多时候都觉得我就是这样读书的。我几乎是在寻找想法或章节，而不是寻找整本书。你知道，我正在寻找与我当时正在写的东西或我当时正在学习的东西相关的部分。嗯，我不是坐下来然后说，嗯，让我读一读并为了乐趣而剖析这个论点。也许当我这样做时，如果我人生某个阶段写作较少，也许我会更多地那样读书，你知道，只是为了享受，或者为了知识本身而获取知识，但现在我更多地是为了一个结果而读书，那就是为了我能提炼它并以某种可操作的方式应用它，然后与世界分享。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And if you want better, more productive, more creative thoughts, you need better, more productive, more creative inputs. And so, uh, choosing what to read or choosing what to listen to or who to subscribe to is actually a very weighty decision. And it's a very important decision. Um I I find that my reading habit now there's there's some quote about **Emerson** I think where he says he reads like a hawk flying over a field scanning for prey. Um and I kind of feel like that's how I read a lot of the time. I'm almost reading for like ideas or for chapters, not for books. You know, I'm looking for the piece that is relevant to what I'm writing about at the time or what I'm trying to learn at the time. Uh I'm not just sitting down and saying well let me read and unpack this argument for fun. I maybe when I do if I am at a stage in my life at some point where I'm doing less writing maybe I will read for that that way more you know just for enjoyment or for uh knowledge for knowledge's sake but right now I'm kind of reading more for knowledge uh for an outcome which is for me to distill it and apply it in some actionable way and then share it with the world.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么样子？比如你在读书，你会划重点吗？你会把划重点的内容放到像**Word**文档里吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So what does that look like? Like you're reading a book, are you highlighting? Are you taking that highlight and putting it into like a word document?

</details>

**James Clear**: 如果我读到一本非常好的书，并且与我当时正在做的工作相关，我很难在上面取得进展。我可能会，我可能会认真地花——我的意思是，现在我因为有很多孩子，所以工作没有那么多。但是，嗯，我可能需要四个小时才能读完三页，因为我读到书中的某个点，它正好触及了我一直在思考和琢磨的事情，它激发了我的想法。所以我会读一句话或一段话，然后我想，我得写点什么。然后，你知道，我可能会写两页，然后我再回去读一些，然后再写一些。嗯，当它没有那么紧张时，嗯，我更多地会这样做，我更喜欢读实体书。**有声书**（*audio*）对我也很有帮助，尤其是我经常开车或什么的。这只是，你知道，显然这是一种更好的方式，但是，嗯，它对我也很有帮助，尤其是一本书有点密集时。我发现有声书更好，因为它不会——如果书真的很密集，我读纸质版时会放慢速度太多，但有声书会一直播放，我仍然能理解其思想，但不会因为写作而放慢速度。所以，我发现有些作者更适合我听有声书。但是，嗯，我的偏好是读实体书。当我读完时，我会找到我感兴趣的段落，并在段落开头加一个左括号，结尾加一个右括号，然后在页边空白处加一个星号，这样如果我翻阅这本书，我就会找到星号，很容易识别这些段落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Like if I read a book that's really good and relevant to what I'm working on at the time, it's very hard for me to make progress on it. I will it might take me like seriously I might spend I mean at this point I'm I'm not working as much cuz we have all these kids. But um uh but I like it might take me four hours to get through three pages like because there's I'm reading I'm at a point in the book where it's just really hitting on what I've been like kind of stewing on and thinking about and it's sparking ideas. So I'll read a sentence or a paragraph and I'm like I got to write about this for a second and then I you know I I may end up writing two pages and then I go back and I read some more and then I you know write some more. Um when it's not as intense as that uh then it'll be more what I do is I I prefer to read physical books. I also **audio** can also be helpful for me especially if I'm in the car a lot or something. It's just a you know obviously it's a better way to do that but um it can be helpful for me especially if a book is kind of dense. I find audio is better because it doesn't if the book is really dense, I will slow myself down too much as I'm reading it in print, but audio just keeps rolling and I still get the idea, but I don't slow myself down through the writing. So, I find some authors to be better for me in audio. But, um, my preference is to read the physical book as I roll through. I find passages that interest me and I put a parenthesy open parenthesis at the beginning of the passage, close it at the end and then I put a star in the margin so that if I just leaf through the book, I find the stars and I can easily identify those passages.

</details>

**James Clear**: 然后一旦我读完这本书，我就会回去拍下每个段落的照片，并在我的**iPhone**上高亮显示照片，然后复制粘贴到**Evernote**文件或**Google Doc**或我存储这些东西的任何地方。所以，嗯，这是我的典型方法。所以，我最终通常会得到，如果我读一本我划了很多重点的书，它可能有50个左右的段落，所有这些都会在最后被导入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And then once I finish the book, I will go back through and take photos of each of those and highlight the photo uh on my **iPhone** and just copy and paste it into uh like an **Evernote** file or you know, **Google Doc** or wherever I'm storing that stuff at. So, um, that's my typical approach. So, I that's how I end up with like usually if I read a book that I highlight a lot on, maybe it'll have 50 or something passages and all those get dumped in at the end.

</details>

**主持人**: 我必须问一个后续问题，那就是然后呢？所以它进入了**Evernote**。现在很多人都这样做。他们捕捉这些笔记，但他们从不，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I just have to ask one follow-up to that, which is and then what? So, it goes into **Evernote**. Now, a lot of people do this. They capture these notes, but then they never Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 回顾它们。他们从不利用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: revisit them. They never do anything with them.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我不喜欢有，我尝试过一段时间。我，我的意思是，你知道，我一直在用**Evernote**。我一直在用它很长时间了。嗯，它已经有12年历史了。嗯，当我刚开始时，**Notion**甚至还没有出现。但是，嗯，所以我现在里面有很多东西。但是，嗯，我尝试过一段时间，根据书来做。所以我会读完一本书，然后我会把所有的重点都放到书的文档中，你知道，这样我就把那本书的所有笔记都放在一个地方。嗯，但结果就是你刚才描述的，它就一直放在那里，我从来没有真正看过它。偶尔我会写一篇文章，我会在**Evernote**中搜索关键词，然后找到书中的一段话，也许会把它拉进来什么的，但这很少发生。相反，我现在发现更有用的是，我有一个正在进行的项目，以及一个项目的文档。所以，比如我正在写的下一本书，然后我读与那个项目相关的书，我把段落放到那个文档中适当的位置。所以通常我开始写一本书的方式是，我一开始就确定了概念，大局概念。比如我从一开始就知道**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）会是一本关于习惯的书。它会是一本关于培养好习惯和戒除坏习惯的书。所以这可以放在文档的顶部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I don't like having I I tried this for a while. I've I mean, you know, I've been **Evernote**. I've been well I've been doing it for a long time. Um it's just it's just 12 years old, you know. Um **Notion** wasn't even around when I was getting started. But um so I just have a lot of stuff in there now. But um I tried for a little while doing it based on the book. So I would I would finish a book and then I would put all the highlights into the book dock, you know, and so I just have all the notes from that book in one place. Um, but what happened was what you just described, which is then it would just sit there and I would never really look at it. Occasionally I would work on an article and I would like search for terms in **Evernote** and then find a passage from a book and maybe pull it in or something, but it was pretty rare that that would happen. Instead, what I find more useful now is to have a project that I'm working on and a um a dock for the project. So like the next book I'm writing for example and then I'm reading books that are relevant to that project and I take the passages and I drop them into the appropriate place in that doc. So usually the way that I start writing a book I try to have the concept the big picture concept nailed at the start. Like I knew **Atomic Habits** was going to be a habits book from the beginning. It was going to be a book about building good habits and breaking bad ones. So that can go at the top of the dock.

</details>

**James Clear**: 然后我首先，在一开始，我只是收集笔记和想法。它只是，也许有20或30页，只是一堆随机的东西。但最终，一旦你收集到足够的材料，我就开始按章节分组，最终这些章节就变成了书中的章节。这通常是大部分过程中文档的样子，它只是一种松散结构的章节。这是一个关于杠杆的章节。这是一个关于顺风的章节。这是一个，你知道，随便什么。当我阅读时，如果我发现一些与某个章节相关的东西，它就会被复制粘贴到那里。所以章节最终会变成——我的过程的那个部分非常有趣。我刚才向你描述的，对我来说就是乐趣。我喜欢阅读。我对此很兴奋。我把所有东西都倒进去。它被组织起来。那部分可以很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Then I start at first at the very very beginning I just collect notes and ideas. It's just and maybe it gets to be 20 or 30 pages and it's just a bunch of random stuff. But eventually once you get enough material in there, I start grouping it by section and eventually those sections become chapter chapters. And that's usually for most of the process that's usually what the doc looks like is it's just sort of a loosely structured chapter. This is a chapter about leverage. This is a chapter about tailwinds. This is, you know, whatever. And when I read and I have something that's relevant to a chapter, it gets copied and pasted into there. So it starts to the chapters end up the part of my process that's that part is just a lot of fun. What I just described to you that that's just fun to me. I get to read. I'm excited about it. I dump it all in. It gets organized. That that part can be great.

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，我现在有两份手稿。一份是500页，一份是600页。就是这样。它只是一堆我读过的东西，围绕着书的概念组织起来。非常无趣的部分是，将600页大致组织的笔记变成可读的章节。嗯，它在过程中会从600页压缩到200页。所以这需要更多的工作，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um I have two manuscripts right now. One is 500 pages, one is 600 pages. That is just that. It's just a bunch of stuff that I've read that is organized around the book concept. The very unfun part is taking it from 600 pages of roughly organized notes and turning it into chapters that can be readable. Um, and it gets compressed along the way from 600 pages down to 200. And so that takes a lot more work,

</details>

**主持人**: 但正是这项工作让读者读起来如此轻松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but that work is what makes it so easy for the reader to read.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。是的。这就是它之所以好的原因。嗯，那也是困难的地方。我的意思是，有时人们会抱怨说：“哦，你知道，写作很难。”就像，是的，写作很难，但这也是重点，你知道，就像举重一样。这就像抱怨举重时杠铃很重。你就会说，是的，杠铃很重，而这正是让你变得更强壮的原因。你知道，写作很难，因为它让你成为一个更好的思考者。写作的行为迫使你澄清你的思想。举起重量的行为迫使你的肌肉变得更强壮。所以，它之所以有效，正是因为它很难。如果它很容易，就不需要太多思考，这意味着它也不需要太多思维重组，你学到的东西或澄清的东西也不会太多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah. Yeah. That's what makes it good. Um, and that's that's also what's hard. I mean, sometimes people will complain and say, "Oh, you know, writing is hard." And like, yeah, writing is hard, but also that's kind of the point, you know, like it's it's also like lifting. It'd be like complaining about lifting weights and the weights being heavy. You're like, yes, the weights are heavy and that's what's getting you stronger. You know, like writing is hard because it's making you a better thinker. It is forcing you, the act of writing is forcing you to clarify your thoughts. The act of lifting the weight is forcing your muscles to get stronger. And so, it only works because it is hard. If it was easy, it would not require much thought, which means it also doesn't require much reorganization in your mind, and you're not learning very much or clarifying very much.

</details>

### 专注与优先级

**主持人**: 在**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）成功之后，涌入的机会一定很多。你如何在这种情况下保持对你想要做的事情的专注？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: After the success of **Atomic Habits**, the inbound must be crazy. How do you maintain the focus on the things that you want with all these opportunities available to you?

</details>

**James Clear**: 说实话，我有点**学习迟缓**（*slow learner*）。我花了一段时间才弄明白，而且我不知道我现在是否完全弄明白了。感觉标准一直在变或在移动。你知道，部分原因我认为是好事。如果你真的很成功，事情进展顺利，那么每年你的**机会成本**（*opportunity cost*）都应该增加。但这也意味着，每年你应该对前一年说“是”的事情说“不”。所以我感觉我总是比我应该说“不”的事情晚三到六个月。嗯，当这本书出版时，它从一开始就卖得很好，但直到大约一年后才真正起飞。所以，它第一周就上了畅销书榜，然后就没什么了，直到新年那周，然后又沉寂了大约六个月。直到第二年夏天，它才开始每周都出现在榜单上。嗯，所以2019年是那一年，2018年它出版，2019年是所有事情都改变的一年。嗯，在2019年和2020年初有一段时间，我只是觉得我被所有这些我本应该拒绝的事情束缚住了。嗯，最终我不得不做一些更难的事情，比如把电子邮件收件箱设置为自动回复，这有点违背我最初的意愿，你知道，比如我为前1万名订阅我电子邮件列表的人，我都会单独给他们发邮件，说：“嘿，非常感谢你的加入，你知道，我很乐意你加入这个社区。我会写关于这个的，你知道，等等。”然后，你知道，当你达到10万或100万，或者，你知道，你再也不能做那些事情了。所以，嗯，是的，这就像最好的结果，对吧？你不想抱怨它。它本可以更好。但是，嗯，它也需要大量的学习，并不断提醒自己，你必须继续提高那个**过滤器**（*filter*）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I'm kind of a **slow learner**, honestly. Like, I it took me a while to figure it out, and I don't know that I have it fully figured out now. It seems like the bar keeps changing or moving. You know, partially I think it's a good thing. If you're really successful and things are going well, then every year your **opportunity cost** should increase. But what that also means is every year you should be saying no to things that you were saying yes to the previous year. And so I feel like I'm always 3 to 6 months behind on what I should be saying no to. Um, when the book came out, it it did well from the start, but it really didn't take off till about a year in. So, it it hit the bestseller list the first week, then nothing um until New Year's week, and then nothing for like six more months. And it wasn't really till like the summer of the second year that it started appearing every week. Um, so 2019 was the year, 2018 it came out, 2019 was the year that like everything changed. And um there was a stretch in like 2019 and early 2020 where I just felt like I'm on the hook for all these things that I should have said no to. Um eventually I had to do like harder things like put the email inbox on an autoresponder and like uh like that runs like kind of counter to what I wanted to do, you know, like I for the first 10,000 people who signed up to my email list, I emailed each of them individually and said like hey thanks so much for joining, you know, I'd love to have you in the community. I'll be writing about this, you know, whatever. And then, you know, you get to 100,000 or a million or, you know, you just can't do that stuff anymore. So, um, yeah, it's like best possible outcome, right? Like, you don't want to complain about it. It's what could be better. But, um, also it just takes a lot of learning and reminding yourself that you have to continue to increase that **filter**.

</details>

**主持人**: 关于筛选或选择机会，你有什么经验教训是你希望早点知道的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Are there any lessons that you took away that you wish you would have known sooner about filtering or selecting opportunities?

</details>

**James Clear**: 我现在战略性地思考很多事情，关于我想专注于什么，而当时我并没有一个明确的说法。你有点像跟着感觉走，或者跟着你的直觉走，但我给你举几个例子。嗯，你所做的并非所有事情都能符合我即将涵盖的所有条件，但我会思考这些条件中的每一个，以及它们如何相互交织。所以，比如一件事是**杠杆**（*leverage*）。我如何从每个单位的努力中获得更多的产出？所以有些事情比其他事情具有更高的杠杆作用。你知道，比如写作，就拿写作来说。写日记或日记很好。它对你很有用。它可能帮助你思考更清晰。写作有很多好处。但如果你选择把你写的东西公开分享，那么突然之间你就有了更多的杠杆作用。其他人可以找到它。它就变成了一个**蜜罐**（*honeypot*），吸引志同道合的人。你知道，我喜欢说公开分享你的作品就像一块磁铁，它会吸引其他对同样事情感兴趣的人。这可能是你进行**人脉拓展**（*networking*）最有效的方法之一，它实际上不是人脉拓展。它只是分享你的知识，并努力在公共场合发挥作用。嗯，所以杠杆是需要考虑的一件事。我如何从我投入的时间中获得更多的产出？嗯，我非常喜欢的一个问题是，什么工作一旦完成，就能持续为我工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: There are lots of things that I think about now strategically for what I want to focus on that I didn't really have a language for at the time. You kind of like follow your gut or you your intuition, but so I'll give you a couple. Um, not everything that you do can match all the qualities that check all the boxes that I'm about to cover, but I think about each of these boxes and how do they weave together? So like one thing is **leverage**. How can I get more output out of each unit of effort? And so some things are much higher leverage than others. You know, like writing, let's just take writing as an example. Writing in a journal or a diary is fine. It's very useful for you. It might help you think more clearly. Like writing has lots of benefits. But if you choose to take what you write and share it publicly, well, now all of a sudden you have a lot more leverage with that. Other people can find it. It becomes this kind of like **honeypot** that attracts like-minded people. You know, I I like to say that that sharing your work publicly is like a magnet and it just draws other people to you who are interested in the same thing. It's probably one of the most useful things you can do for **networking** is it's not actually networking. It's just sharing your knowledge and trying to be useful in public. Um so leverage is one thing to think about. How can I get more output out of the hours that I'm putting in? Um one question that I really like is what is the work that keeps working for me once it's done?

**James Clear**: 所以，比如做这个播客采访就是一个很好的例子。当**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）出版时，我在大约六个月内做了200次采访，其中一些是播客，一些是广播。我现在不再做广播采访了。这并不是因为我个人对广播有什么意见。只是因为一旦我们完成了那个五分钟或十分钟的节目，我们就不再播出了，那项工作就不再为我工作了。你知道，我刚刚投入的时间就蒸发了。但这个会被录下来，你知道，今天会有人看，然后一个月后会有人看。你知道，这就像，嗯，外面有两个版本的**詹姆斯**（*James*）。你知道，有一个版本正在过他的日常生活，然后有一个版本现在被录下来了，它可以在完成后的每个小时持续工作。所以那是一个过滤器。我思考的另一件事是**排序**（*sequencing*）。所以，以正确的顺序做事，或者以一种能够为你积累的方式做事。我曾为**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）是选择自出版还是传统出版争论了一年半。我当时非常接近尝试自出版。嗯，最终在当时，现在稍微容易一点，但自出版仍然很难登上畅销书榜。我决定，嗯，如果我真的要全力以赴，努力登上**《纽约时报》**（*New York Times*）的榜单，我不如用我的第一本书来做，因为那样我就可以在我的职业生涯余生中成为**《纽约时报》畅销书作家**。嗯，我不能保证我会做到，但就像，如果你要尝试，你不如早点尝试，然后你就可以在接下来的50年里获得那个**地位标志**（*status marker*）的好处，而不是自出版你的前五本书，然后在20年后才去做。所以，那只是，你知道，一个排序的事情。我经常思考的另一件事是，我喜欢我正在做的工作，我接触的每一个项目都能以某种方式相互滋养。它们有点像**交叉授粉**（*cross-pollinate*）。嗯，所以举几个例子，你知道，我正在写作，嗯，这几乎是**分形**（*fractal*）的，你可以这样思考。所以，比如小版本是，我写了一个想法，那个想法可以发布到**推特**（*Twitter*）上作为一条推文。它可以在我每周发布的时事通讯中。它可以被重新利用到**Instagram**上，作为一张引语卡或什么的。也许如果它足够好，它就可以成为一本书中一个章节的种子，或者随便什么。但它以多种方式被重新利用。所以那一小时，又有点像杠杆，它以更多的方式为你工作。它如何积累？它如何交叉授粉？你也可以用平台来做。所以，我所有的商业平台都相互指向，你知道，比如我在Instagram上发帖时，每条帖子底部都会写着：“想了解更多类似的想法吗？请在**jamesclair.com/321**订阅时事通讯，或者访问**jamesclair.com**了解更多。”嗯，书会指向一些东西。你知道，你读完**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*），然后在每个部分的末尾，它会说：“如果你想获得一份总结这些关键思想的PDF指南，请访问**atomichabits.com**，然后，你知道，你可以下载它或什么的。”所以，书指向网站，网站指向书，时事通讯指向社交媒体，社交媒体指向时事通讯。它就像一个网络，所有东西都在**交叉授粉**。我认为有些人会理解这一点，他们会做一两次或七次，但你需要每次都这样做，你知道，就像你正在建立一个非常紧密的网络。你正在建立一个相互积累的事物网络。然后你可以在更大的层面上做到这一点。所以，比如我们有写作的想法，推文的想法，你有平台想法，这仍然在同一个业务中，但你甚至可以跨业务做到这一点。就像我有一个作为作家的业务，你知道，我是一个作者，我有我的平台，但我也共同创立了一家出版公司，**作者股权**（*Author's Equity*）。所以现在我作为作者的品牌帮助我结识其他作者并与他们交流。如果合适，他们就可以来和我们一起出版。所以这两件事相互滋养。我通过**作者股权**（*Author's Equity*）出版我的书。你知道，这是这两个业务相互帮助的方式。嗯，然后我还有一个，我甚至还有一个副项目，就是我在树林里建造的这个小木屋。你知道，正在建造这个小木屋，它可以成为一个作者静修中心，你知道，我们可以把作者带到那里，我们可以开两三天的会，谈论如何写书和发布书，以及如何建立你的平台，其中一些人可以与**作者股权**（*Author's Equity*）合作出版，你可以看到所有东西都相互滋养。所以，它并不总是每次都完美地协同工作，但我喜欢当事情能够同时满足多个条件时。然后我要提到的另一个，然后我休息一下，是**顺风**（*tailwinds*）。所以，我总是想到电子邮件列表。我不知道，我们，你知道，你和我都认识很多有电子邮件列表的朋友，人们以不同的速度增长，但基本上我认识的每个人的列表都在变大。我不知道我认识谁的列表在缩小。嗯，除非他们是故意，你知道，修剪订阅者什么的。但是，嗯，每天都有越来越多的人上网。世界上仍然有大约十亿人需要互联网接入，并且正在上网。所以读者有一个巨大的**顺风**，互联网持续增长，人们持续订阅各种东西。所以这是一个很好的领域，嗯，因为有很多力量在为你工作。所以如果你把所有这些事情放在一起，你就会想，好的，互联网和建立受众有一个巨大的**顺风**。如果你公开分享你的作品，你就能获得**杠杆**，你可以吸引更多的人关注你的作品，你就可以，你知道，变得更出名，或者你的作品可以传播出去。嗯，如果你的平台**交叉授粉**，它们就可以相互促进增长。电子邮件列表的**顺风**效应，对社交媒体和，你知道，其他在线平台也是如此。如果你在年轻时就这样做，并早早建立起受众，那么你就会有很大的灵活性，可以利用它，可以引导注意力，或者，你知道，你想建立什么业务，或者你想做什么项目。所以所有这些加在一起，就会让人觉得，好的，如果你正在做那些领域的事情，那么这可能是一种非常高杠杆地利用时间的方式。我不是说这是你唯一应该花时间的方式。可能我们还没有谈到的最重要的一点是，你对此感到兴奋吗？你知道，你感兴趣吗？你对此充满热情吗？但是，嗯，这些是我思考专注和优先级以及选择的一些方式，当事情爆发时，你知道，我们把所有这些都整合在一起，**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）做得非常好。然后当事情爆发，我的时间变得紧张时，你就会想：“好的，你拥有所有这些。”感觉就像十年来我一直在敲每一扇门和窗户，说：“嘿，请注意一下好吗？也许你可以读一下这个？”然后突然之间，一夜之间，就像，哇，太多人关注了。嗯，所以现在我必须更严格地筛选哪些事情符合这些条件，以及我将时间和注意力投入到哪里。

**James Clear**: There are lots of things that I think about now strategically for what I want to focus on that I didn't really have a language for at the time. You kind of like follow your gut or you your intuition, but so I'll give you a couple. Um, not everything that you do can match all the qualities that check all the boxes that I'm about to cover, but I think about each of these boxes and how do they weave together? So like one thing is **leverage**. How can I get more output out of each unit of effort? And so some things are much higher leverage than others. You know, like writing, let's just take writing as an example. Writing in a journal or a diary is fine. It's very useful for you. It might help you think more clearly. Like writing has lots of benefits. But if you choose to take what you write and share it publicly, well, now all of a sudden you have a lot more leverage with that. Other people can find it. It becomes this kind of like **honeypot** that attracts like-minded people. You know, I I like to say that sharing your work publicly is like a magnet and it just draws other people to you who are interested in the same thing. It's probably one of the most useful things you can do for **networking** is it's not actually networking. It's just sharing your knowledge and trying to be useful in public. Um so leverage is one thing to think about. How can I get more output out of the hours that I'm putting in? Um one question that I really like is what is the work that keeps working for me once it's done? So like doing this podcast interview is a good example. I when **Atomic Habits** came out I did like 200 interviews in like 6 months and um some were podcast and some are radio and I don't really do radio interviews anymore. And it's not really cuz I have something personal against radio. It's just that once we get done with that 5 minute segment or 10-minute segment, we're off the air and that work is not working for me anymore. You know, the the time I just put in evaporated. But this will get recorded, you know, and somebody will watch it today and then somebody will watch it in a month. And you know, it's um it's almost like there's two versions of **James** out there. You know, there's like the version that's out there living his daily life and then there's the one that got recorded right now that can keep working each hour after it's done. So that's that's one filter. Another thing that I think about is **sequencing**. So doing things in the right order or doing things in an order where it accumulates for you. I debated about whether to self-publish **Atomic Habits** or traditionally publish for like a year, year and a half. I I was like really close to trying to self-publish. Um, and ultimately at the time, it's a little bit easier now, but still quite hard to hit a bestseller list as if you're self-published. And I decided, well, if I'm really going to go for it and try to hit the **New York Times** list, I might as well do it with my first book because then I can be a **New York Times bestselling author** for the rest of my career. Um, there's no guarantee I was going to do it, but it's like if you're going to try, you might as well try early and then you can get the benefit of that **status marker** for the next 50 years rather than self-publishing your first like five books and then doing it, you know, in 20 years. So, that's just kind of a, you know, a sequencing thing. The other thing that I think about a lot is how do I like it when the work that I'm doing, every project that I'm touching feeds each other in some way. They kind of like **cross-pollinate**. Um so a few examples I you know I'm writing there's there's uh it's almost **fractal** the way that you can think about this. So like the small version is I write an idea that idea could go on **Twitter** and be used as a tweet. It could be in a newsletter that I publish each week. It could get repurposed onto **Instagram** as like a quote card or something. Maybe if it's good it could become the seed of something that's a chapter in a book or whatever. But it gets repurposed in lots of ways. So that one hour again kind of like leverage it's working for you in more ways. How does it how does it accumulate? How does it cross-pollinate? You can also do it with platforms. So like all of the platforms that I have for my business point to each other, you know, like when I post on Instagram, at the bottom of each post says, you know, want to learn more ideas like this? Sign up for the newsletter at **jamesclair.com/321** or go to **jamesclair.com** for more. Um the book points to things. You know, you read **Atomic Habits** and then at the end of each section it says, you know, if you want to get a PDF guide that summarizes these key ideas, go to **atomichabits.com** and, you know, you can download it or whatever. So, the book's pointing to the website, the website's pointing to the book, the newsletter is pointing to social media, social media is pointing to the newsletter. It's all like this web where everything is kind of **cross-pollinating**. I think some people that people get that and they do it like once or twice or seven times, but like you need to do it every time, you know, like you're building this very tight web. It's you're building this network of things that all accumulate together. And then you can do it at an even larger level. So like we we have the the writing idea, the tweet idea, you have the platform idea that's still within one business, but you can even do it across businesses. It's like I have my business as a writer, you know, I'm an author and I have my platforms, but I also co-founded a publishing company, **Author's Equity**. And so now the brand that I have as an author helps me meet other authors and talk to them. And if it's a good fit, they can come and publish with us. And so those two things feed each other. I publish my books through **Author's Equity**. Like it's, you know, it's a way for those two businesses to help each other. Um, and then I have a I even have like a side project which is this cabin in the woods that I I built. You know, are building this cabin and it can be a retreat center for authors, you know, like we can bring authors out there and we can meet for two or three days and talk about how to write books and launch books and build your platform and some of those people can publish with **Author's Equity** and you can like see how everything kind of feeds each each other. So, it doesn't all work perfectly together like that every time, but I like when things can kind of check multiple boxes. And then one of the one of the other ones that I'll mention and then I'll take a break for a second is um **tailwinds**. So like I always think about email lists. I don't we you know you and I both have lots of friends who have email lists and people are growing at different rates, but basically everybody I know's list is getting bigger. I don't I don't know that I know anybody whose list is shrinking. Um unless it's like they're intentionally, you know, trimming subscribers or something. But uh more and more people come online each day. More there still are like you know a billion people in the world that need internet access and are coming on. So there's just this huge tailwind of readers that and the internet continues to grow and people continue to subscribe to things. And so it's just a good like place to play um because there are lots of forces working for you. So if you put all of those things together you're like all right there's a big tailwind on the internet and building an audience. If you share your work publicly, you gain leverage and you can attract more people to your work and you can, you know, become more known or your work can get out there. Um, if your platforms cross-pollinate, they can kind of grow each other. That same dynamic of a tailwind for, you know, email list is also true for social media and, you know, other platforms online. And if you do this early in your life and you build an audience early, then you have tons of flexibility and how you can use that and where you can direct the attention or what you know what businesses you want to build or what projects you want to work on. So all of that collectively just makes it feel like all right, if you're doing things that are in that zone, then it's probably a really high leverage way to spend your time. And I'm not saying that's the only way you should spend your time. Probably the the single biggest thing that we haven't talked about is are you excited about it? You know, are you interested? Are you passionate about it? But um those are some of the ways that I think about focus and prioritization and selecting and when things blew up, you know, we put all this together and **Atomic Habits** did really well. And then when things blew up and my time got tight, you're like, "Okay, you have all these." It felt like for 10 years it was me trying to knock on every door and window and be like, "Hey, will you please pay attention? Maybe like can you read this?" And then all of a sudden overnight it was like, whoa, way too many people are paying attention. Um, and so now I have to be more strict about which things check those boxes and where where I direct my time and attention.

**主持人**: 我喜欢我们谈论的几个主题。我想回到**内容的持久性**（*longevity of content*）这个话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love a couple of the themes we talked about. I just want to circle back to **longevity of content**.

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，我们今年夏天发布了一次采访，重新发布了一次六年前录制的采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um, we published an interview this summer, republished an interview that was recorded six years ago

</details>

**主持人**: 没人知道。所以当你想到内容及其**长尾效应**（*long tail*）时，这真的很吸引人。我们不谈政治。我们不谈任何时事。我们这样做的一个原因是我们内容的持久性很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and nobody had any idea. So when you think of like content and the **long tail** of it, it's really fascinating. We don't talk politics. We don't talk anything topical. One of the reasons we do that is we have great longevity of content.

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为那真的很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think that that's really important.

</details>

**James Clear**: 所以那是我没有提到但经常思考的一点。我认为这更符合我的个人风格和兴趣，但它确实，你知道，你可以用一些方法来应用它，无论你关注什么，那就是这个想法的**半衰期**（*half-life*）是多久。你知道，我喜欢做那些半衰期很长的事情。它们会持续存在。我甚至喜欢用半衰期长的形式来工作。比如社交媒体的半衰期很短。这没关系。它可以在业务中发挥作用，但我永远不会把它作为我的核心，因为像博客文章这样的东西半衰期会稍微长一点，但一本书的半衰期真的很长。所以，嗯，我喜欢那种持久耐用的形式。所以，你可以，是的。你开始把所有这些不同的元素放在一起，我认为你最终会得到一些非常**常青**（*evergreen*）的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: So that's one that I didn't mention, but I do think about a lot. This I think this is a little bit more my style and what I'm interested in personally, but it does, you know, there are ways that you could apply it probably whatever you're focused on, which is what's the **half-life** of this idea. You know, you want I like to work on things that have a very long half-life. They they just persist. And I even like to work in formats that have a long half-life. Like social media has a very short half-life. And that's fine. It can serve a role in the business, but I'm never going to make it my central thing because something like a blog post has a little bit longer half-life, but a book really has a long half-life. And so, um, I like formats that are durable and persist in that way. And so, you can Yeah. you start to put all those different elements together and I think you can end up with something that's pretty **evergreen**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你提到的一点我觉得很有趣，那就是“**排序**”（*sequencing*）这个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: One thing you mentioned that I thought was really interesting was the word **sequencing**

</details>

**主持人**: 我想知道你是如何思考它在实现目标方面的作用，以及在人生的不同阶段（比如20多岁、30多岁、40多岁和50多岁）的差异。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and I'm wondering how you think about that in terms of accomplishing your goals but also in terms of like different eras of your life. Are your 20s different than your 30s, your 30s and your 40s and your 40s and your 50s?

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的，这是一个很好的问题。我不知道为什么，但我最近一直在思考这个问题。我想你可以称之为**人生策略**（*life strategy*）之类的，但想想你生活中大多数真正有意义的大事，你知道，比如，嗯，养育一个让你骄傲的家庭，建立一段美好的婚姻，创办一家成功的公司，达到你一生中最好的体型，你知道，开始一些新的倡议，或者，你知道，以某种重要的方式回馈社会。无论是什么，它可能都是一个多年的事情。你知道，生活中所有那些真正有意义的大动作都是三年、五年、十年，有时甚至更长。你知道，这需要很多年。如果你只是大致看看你的成年生活，你就会想，嗯，如果我幸运地活到80岁，我可能只有五六个这样的十年周期。嗯，所以你会把这五六个周期花在什么上面？你知道，它们是有限的，无论是什么。有些事情，仅仅五六个就是有限的，但它比你一开始意识到的还要有限，因为有些事情在某些十年里没有意义，你知道，比如如果你想环游世界一段时间，在签证中狂欢，你可能不会在七十多岁时做，你知道，它可能更适合你的二十多岁或三十多岁。嗯，所以事情的**排序**（*sequencing*）也开始变得重要。嗯，我认为创办公司是另一个例子。你想什么时候做都可以，你知道，就像没有规则，但天哪，早点做真的很好，然后你就能从中获得一些优势，嗯，随着时间的推移。似乎责任和义务在人的一生中往往会增加。每一天过去都是一个机会，让责任出现，或者一个你没有预料到的障碍出现。所以，如果你等到四五十岁才开始创业，再说一次，没有规则。你可以在那时做。只是你玩的游戏模式会稍微困难一点。我总是说，我24岁时创办了我的第一家公司，我没有孩子，也没有结婚。那是我能做到的最简单的时候，但仍然非常困难。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah, that's a great question. I I don't know why, but I've been thinking a lot about this recently. I guess you could call it like **life strategy** or something, but think about most of the big really meaningful things in your life, you know, like um raising a family that you're proud of, building a great marriage, creating a successful company, getting in the best shape of your life, you know, starting some new initiative, or you know, giving back in some big way. Like whatever it is, it's probably a multi-year thing. You know, all the those really big meaningful movements in life are three, five, 10, sometimes longer. You know, it's like it's a lot of years. And if you just look broadly at your adult life, you're like, well, if I'm lucky enough to get to live to say 80, I've got maybe five or six of those, you know, 10-year movements in there. Um, so what are you going to spend those five or six on? You know, they it's a limited number, whatever it is. Some things five or six alone is limited, but it's even more limited than I think you realize at the beginning because certain things don't make sense in certain decades, you know, like if you want to travel around the world for a while and party in a visa, like you probably aren't going to do that in your 70s, you know, like it's probably better for your 20s or 30s. And um so the **sequencing** of things starts to to matter, too. Um building a company, I think, is another one. You can do it whenever you want, you know, like there's no there are no rules, but man, it sure is nice to like do it early and then you get some of the advantages of that uh as you go on. It seems that responsibilities uh and obligations tend to increase throughout life. Each day that goes by is an opportunity for a responsibility to come into play or an obligation or an obstacle that you didn't foresee to come up. And so, if you're waiting till your 40s or 50s to start a company, again, there are no rules. You can do it then. It's just that you're playing the game on hard mode a little bit uh or a harder mode. I always say like I started my first business when I was 24 and I had no kids and I wasn't married. It was as easy as it could be and it was still really hard. Yeah.

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，你知道，所以无论如何，我就是这样思考**排序**（*sequencing*）的。嗯，我喜欢问的一些问题，有两个问题与此非常相关。第一个是，我现在处于什么**季节**（*season*）？你知道，生活有不同的季节，嗯，有时你想专注于赚钱。有时你想专注于与家人共度时光。有时你想专注于创造力或者，你知道，创作自由，选择你想要从事的项目的能力。有时你只是想让它成为一个个人季节，你知道，与工作无关。但无论答案是什么，它可能都非常具体。嗯，弄清楚你现在处于什么季节很有帮助，因为当你的季节改变时，你的习惯通常也需要改变。你知道，你关注的重点通常也需要改变。所以，我认为与此密切相关的一个问题，来自**德里克·西弗斯**（*Derek Sivers*）的一个好问题是：我现在正在为**优化什么**（*optimizing for*）？所以，你知道，如果我不知道要优化什么，我觉得优化热情是好的。什么能点燃我？但无论现在这个问题的答案是什么，你正在优化什么？它有助于你确定你处于什么季节。我发现很多时候当我挣扎或面临某种摩擦时，那是因为我试图将旧习惯强行适应新季节。你知道，我一直在努力按照以前的方式做事，然后最终我意识到，哦，好吧，别再傻了。你现在处于一个新季节了。所以，我认为排序始于**自我意识**。它始于了解你处于什么季节，以及你正在优化什么，在你人生的这个阶段什么对你很重要。然后一旦你意识到这一点，你就可以开始弄清楚，你知道，接下来我应该关注哪些部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um you know so anyway that's I I think about **sequencing** in that way. Um and some of the questions I like to ask to there are two that really feel relevant to this. The first is what **season** am I in right now? You know, life has different seasons and um sometimes you want to focus on earning money. Sometimes you want to focus on time with family. Sometimes you want to focus on creativity or you know creative freedom, the ability to choose what projects you work on. Sometimes you just want it to be a personal season, you know, and it's less about work. But whatever the answer is, it's probably really specific to you. And um it helps to figure out what season you're in right now because when your seasons change, your habits often need to change. You know, what you focus on often needs to change. And so the the question that I think is closely tied to this, which is a a good one from **Derek Sivers**, is what am I **optimizing for** right now? And so I, you know, if I don't know what to optimize for, I feel like it's good to optimize for enthusiasm. What lights me up? But whatever that answer is right now, what are you optimizing for? It helps you determine what season you're in. And I found that a lot of the time when I'm struggling or I'm facing some sort of uh I feel like I'm facing a lot of friction, it's because I'm trying to force fit old habits into a new season. You know, I keep I keep trying to do things the way I was doing it and then eventually I realize, oh, okay, stop being a dummy about this. Like you're in a new season now. So, I think sequencing um starts with **self-awareness**. It starts with knowing what season you're in and what you're optimizing for, what's important to you at this stage of your life. And then once you realize that, you can start to figure out, you know, which pieces should I focus on next.

### 习惯的定义与“四条法则”

**主持人**: 让我们深入探讨一下习惯。嗯，习惯到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Let's explore habits a little. Um, what exactly is a habit?

</details>

**James Clear**: 我喜欢的一个定义是，习惯是环境中**反复出现问题的反复解决方案**。所以，有些事情反复出现，你的大脑试图解决它。另一种描述方式是，它就像一种**自动的或无意识的行为**。如果我们与研究人员或学者交谈，他们可能会说习惯就像刷牙、系鞋带或咬指甲，你知道，你做得很快、无意识，甚至根本不用思考。但如果我问你，嘿，**沙恩**（*Shane*），你正在努力培养哪些习惯？你可能会说，哦，你知道，我每周去健身房四天，或者我想每天写作，或者我想冥想十分钟之类的。我知道你这么说是什么意思。你知道，你的意思是你希望它成为一种常规练习，一种仪式。现在，从技术上讲，在某种学术意义上，也许那不是，你知道，一种习惯性的自动行为。但在文化意义上，当我们谈论习惯时，这正是我们的意思，我们希望它们是可靠的重复性例行公事。然后你可以定义它的第三种方式，我认为这种方式非常有用，那就是它是一种**与环境中特定情境相关的行为**。与特定情境相关的行为。所以，比如你晚上7点看**Netflix**的习惯，就与你家里的情境、你的沙发以及一天中的那个时间相关联。所以，嗯，我们开始看到，行为与环境和情境之间有着非常强的联系。这是调整行为的好方法。但我认为所有这些都是定义习惯的潜在方式。归根结底，它实际上只是你的大脑试图自动化生活中的问题和解决方案，并更高效地做事。你提到了季节以及它与习惯的联系。我想知道我们如何知道一个习惯是为我们服务还是阻碍我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: The one one that I like is that a habit is a **recurring solution to a recurring problem** in your environment. So something comes up again and again and your brain is trying to solve it. Another way to describe it is that it's like an **automatic or a mindless behavior**. If we were talking to a researcher or an academic, they would probably say a habit is like brushing your teeth or tying your shoes or biting your nails, you know, something you do really fast and mindlessly and you don't even really think about it. But if I were to ask you, hey **Shane**, what are some habits you're trying to build? Like you're probably going to say, oh, you know, I'm trying to go to the gym four days a week or I want to write every day or I'm trying to meditate for 10 minutes or something like that. And I know what you mean when you say that. You know, you mean you want it to be this regular practice, this ritual. Now, technically, in some kind of academic sense, maybe that's not, you know, a habitual automatic behavior. But in a cultural sense, that's exactly what we mean when we talk about habits is we want them to be reliable repeated routines. And then the third way you could define it, and this one I think is quite useful, is that it's a **behavior that is tied to a context** in your environment. Behavior that's tied to a particular context. So like your habit of watching **Netflix** at 7 p.m. is tied to the context of your house and your couch at that time of day. And so um what we start to see is that behaviors have a very strong link between environment and context. And that's a good way to adjust behaviors. But I think all of those are are potential ways to define what a habit is. Ultimately, it's really just your brain trying to automate the problems and solutions of life and do things with more efficiency. You mentioned seasons and tying that to habits. I'm wondering how do we know if a habit is working for us or if it's working against us.

**James Clear**: 研究人员之间有一些争论，是否存在“好习惯”或“坏习惯”这种东西？就像所有习惯都在某种程度上为你服务。你知道，你吸烟是因为它满足或解决了你某种需求。嗯，我理解他们在说什么，但我认为我们都知道当我们说“好习惯”或“坏习惯”时是什么意思。我喜欢这样定义它：**好习惯的代价在当下，坏习惯的代价在未来**。所以你会发现，很多通常被归类为坏习惯的事情，比如吃太多甜甜圈或吸烟，在当下感觉很好，但会在未来产生某种代价或后果。嗯，而很多好习惯，比如现在去健身房，它需要汗水和努力，而且很辛苦。它会在未来带来回报。我认为判断一个习惯是否为你服务的一种方式是：它是否在未来给我更多我想要的东西，还是更少我想要的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: There's some debate among researchers about is there even such a thing as a good habit or a bad habit? Like all habits serve you in some way. You know, you smoke a cigarette because it serves or resolves some, you know, need that you have. Uh, and I understand what they're saying, but I think that we all know what we mean when we say a good habit or a bad habit. And the way that I like to define it is that the **cost of your good habits is in the present. The cost of your bad habits is in the future**. And so what you find is that a lot of things that typically get categorized as a bad habit, eating too many donuts or smoking a cigarette or something like that feels good in the moment, but it creates some kind of cost or consequence in the future. Um whereas a lot of good habits, going to the gym right now, it requires sweat and effort and it's hard. It has a payoff in the future. I think one way to determine whether a habit is serving you or not is is it giving me more of what I want in the future or less of what I want.

</details>

**主持人**: 这几乎就像是**一级负面，二级正面**，如果它是一个好习惯，反之亦然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's almost like it's **first order negative, second order positive** if it's a good habit and then the inverse is true.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我认为作为一般规则，这可能是真的。真正的诀窍是弄清楚如何让它**一级正面，二级正面**。你知道，**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）的很多内容都是关于这个的，那就是努力让习惯尽可能容易做到，这样你在当下就不会感到太多摩擦，同时也将它们与你的身份和你想要成为的那种人对齐。所以锻炼是一个经典的例子，但每个人都想锻炼，这样他们就能在镜子里看起来更好，这样他们就能变得健康。他们想要它的结果，这很好。二级结果会很棒，但当下很困难，你并不总是想去，有时它，你知道，很困难或什么的。真正的诀窍，以及我经过10或15年的训练后最终达到的境界是，我喜欢我锻炼时的感觉。所以它甚至不是——是的，我想要和别人一样的结果。但它也关乎成为一个不缺席锻炼的人。我知道如果我正在做一组动作，我可以为自己是那样的人，为我现在的样子而感到高兴。所以现在我所要做的就是做这件事，我不需要等待结果。结果在未来也会很好，但更多的是关于**坚持出现**和成为那样的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I I think as a general rule that probably can be true. The real trick is to figure out how to make it **first order positive and second order positive**. And you know, a lot of **Atomic Habits** is about this, which is trying to make habits as easy as possible to do so you don't feel as much friction in the moment while also aligning them with your identity and the type of person that you want to be. And so working out is like a classic example, but everybody wants to work out so that they look better in the mirror and so that they get fit. They want the the results of it, which is fine. The second order outcome is going to be great, but it's hard in the moment and you don't always feel like going and sometimes it's, you know, difficult or whatever. The real trick and where I have eventually gotten to myself after 10 or 15 years of training is is I like how I feel when I'm working out. And so it's not even I yeah, I want the same results everybody else does. But it's also about being the type of person who doesn't miss workouts. And I know that if I'm in the middle of a set, I can feel good about being that person and being who I am. So now all I have to do is do the thing and I don't have to wait for the outcome. The outcomes are also good further down the line, but it's more about **showing up** and being that type of person.

</details>

**主持人**: 你有没有一个特定的框架来评估一个习惯是否为你服务或阻碍你，然后你应该用不同的习惯来取代它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is there like a specific framework that you use to evaluate if this habit is serving you or getting in your way and then you should replace it with a different habit?

</details>

**James Clear**: 我之前说过，习惯是环境中**反复出现问题的反复解决方案**。对吗？所以，假设你上班，度过了漫长的一天。你回到家，大概是下午5点半或6点，你筋疲力尽。这种情况反复发生，漫长的一天工作后你感到疲惫。所以这是一个反复出现的问题，人们对这个问题有不同的解决方案。你知道，一个人可能会玩30分钟的**视频游戏**（*video games*），另一个人可能会去跑步，第三个人可能会吸烟，但你可以看到其中一些，它们都在解决同一个反复出现的问题，但有些解决方案比其他更好。你会发现，在你的早期生活中，你提出的很多解决方案只是你从父母那里继承的，或者看到别人模仿并开始重复的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I said earlier that habits are the **repeated solutions to recurring problems** in your environment. Right? So, let's say that you go to work and it's a long day. You get home, it's like 5:30 or 6:00 and you're exhausted. That happens again and again and you feel tired after a long day of work. So that is a recurring problem that's resurfacing and people have different solutions to that problem. You know, one person might play **video games** for 30 minutes, somebody else might go for a run, a third person might smoke a cigarette, but you can see some of these, they're all solving the same recurring problem, but some solutions are better than others. And what you find is that like early in your life, a lot of the solutions that you come up with are just things that you either inherited from your parents or saw modeled and started to repeat.

</details>

**James Clear**: 你到了22岁或25岁左右，你当前的解决方案是最佳解决方案的几率有多大？从数学上讲，你现在解决生活中重复问题的方式是最佳方式的可能性非常小。所以一旦你有了这个认识，尝试找出更好的方法就成了你的责任。我认为你早期能做的最好的事情之一，如果我能给**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）里没有的东西再添加一个，可能就是这个，那就是问：“如果这很有趣，它会是什么样子？”你知道，对于你正在努力培养的任何习惯，坐下来问：“如果这很有趣，它会是什么样子？”然后尝试集思广益10、20或50种不同的解决方案。嗯，并非所有事情总有上千种方法，但几乎总是有不止一种方法。所以，很多人，最常见的新年决心是去健身房锻炼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And you get to be about 22 or 25 or something like that. And what are the odds that your current solution is the best solution? Just mathematically, it's very unlikely that the way that you're solving the repeated problems in your life right now is the optimal way to do it. So as soon as you have that realization, it becomes your responsibility to try to figure out a better way. And I think one of the best things you can do early on, this is if I could actually add one thing to **Atomic Habits** that wasn't in it, it would probably be this, which is to ask, what would this look like if it was fun? You know, like for any habit that you're trying to build, just sit down and ask, "What would it look like if it was fun?" And try to brainstorm 10 or 20 or 50 different solutions to it. Um, there's not always a thousand ways to do everything, but there is almost always more than one way. And so, a lot of people, the most common New Year's resolution is to go to the gym and work out.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我觉得很多人在一月份去健身房只是因为他们觉得他们应该去健身房，或者社会希望他们去健身房之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And I kind of feel like a lot of people are in the gym in January just cuz they feel like they should be in the gym or society wants them to be in the gym or something like that.

</details>

**James Clear**: 但我们可以列出很长一串积极生活方式的样子。你可以攀岩或划皮划艇，或者，你知道，做各种各样的事情。嗯，我认为花20分钟来列出这个清单，然后看看它，问自己：“这些听起来哪一个对我来说最有趣？”这很有价值。这有助于你更接近对你来说的最佳答案。因为如果它不好玩，如果它不吸引人或不有趣，如果它感觉不好，那么当它变得困难时，你就不会坚持下去。我的意思是，这可能是人生中最重要的教训之一，那就是如果你玩得开心，那么你就是危险的，对吧？那么你就很难被超越。你不想，你不想与一个玩得很开心的人竞争，因为如果它感觉像是一种麻烦或苦差事，那个人在困难时就会放弃。但那些一开始就玩得很开心的人，在困难时更有可能坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: But we can come up with a long list of what it looks like to live an active lifestyle. You can rock climb or kayak or, you know, do all kinds of stuff. Um, and I think it's worth it to spend 20 minutes and try to come up with that list and then look at it and say, "Which one of these sounds like the most fun to me?" And so that helps I think that helps you get closer to what the optimal answer is for you. Because if it's not fun, if it's not engaging or interesting, if it doesn't feel good, you're not going to stick with it when it gets tough. I mean, this is probably one of the great lessons for life, which is if you're having fun, then then you're dangerous, right? Then you're hard to compete with. You don't want to you don't want to go up against the person who's having a good time doing it because if it feels like a hassle or a chore, that's the person who gives up when it gets difficult. But the person who's having a great time at the start, they're much more likely to stick with it when it gets hard.

</details>

**主持人**: 你认为乐趣是二元的吗？还是说我如何让锻炼变得更有趣，而不是仅仅是乐趣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think of fun as binary or is it how do I make I want to work out? So like how do I make working out more fun versus like fun?

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的，所以，嗯，你生活中的所有事情都不会像去听音乐会那样，对吧？它永远不会是——它可能不是你一天中最有趣的事情，但任何事情都可以比默认情况更吸引人或更有趣。所以我更多地是这样思考的。我如何努力让它更令人愉快？不一定说它会是我一天中最有趣的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah, it's so Well, everything in your life is not going to feel like going to a concert or something, right? Like it's never going to be it may not be the most fun thing in your day or something like that, but anything can be more engaging or more fun than maybe the default would be. And so I think about it more like that. How can I try to make this more enjoyable? Not necessarily saying it's going to be the most fun part of my day.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，一旦我们确定了想要替换或消除的习惯，我们通过什么机制来实现呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then once we've identified a habit that we want to replace or eliminate, what is the mechanism by which we can do that?

</details>

**James Clear**: 广义上讲，我认为如果你想养成一个习惯，有四件事你应该做。如果你想，你知道，替换旧习惯并建立新习惯，这也是真的。所以，粗略地说，你希望你的习惯是**显而易见的**。所以，你希望它容易看到，容易注意到，容易，嗯，吸引你的注意力。你希望它**有吸引力**。所以，对你来说有吸引力或有趣的东西，就像我们刚才说的。嗯，你希望它**容易**，简单，无摩擦，你知道，容易应用和，嗯，建立。你希望它**令人满意**。一个习惯越令人愉快或令人满意，你将来就越有可能坚持下去。所以我称之为**行为改变的四条法则**（*four laws of behavior change*）。让它显而易见，让它有吸引力，让它容易，让它令人满意。你不需要在一天中的每个时刻或你养成的每个习惯中都拥有这四条法则。但你拥有这四种力量为你工作得越多，你就越有可能坚持下去。事实上，我们可以通过观察我们常称之为坏习惯或浪费时间的行为，来了解一些关于我们习惯的非常引人注目的事情。你会看到这些事情有什么共同点？它们通常非常**显而易见、有吸引力、容易且令人满意**。这些是让它们坚持下去的原因。嗯，你知道，比如，如果你以刷社交媒体为例，它之所以显而易见，是因为你的手机一直都在你身边。它通常是你拇指最先滑向并点击打开的应用程序。它之所以有吸引力，是因为算法已经为你最感兴趣的内容进行了策划。嗯，它如此容易，以至于几年前，**Instagram**当你滑动时，如果有人发布了一个相册，如果你五分钟后回到Instagram，如果你已经看过那个帖子，它会自动滑动到第二张幻灯片。所以你甚至不需要再用拇指了，对吧？他们会不断为你展示新内容。他们试图让它变得如此容易消费。然后它之所以令人满意，是因为它满足了你的兴趣等等。嗯，获得**多巴胺**（*dopamine*）的刺激等等。所以，嗯，我不是想过多批评Instagram之类的，我只是说如果你想知道为什么我做这件事如此容易，你知道，没有人会坐着说：“我如何才能找到意志力和动力来更多地查看Instagram？”你知道，但很多人都在说：“哦，我希望我能有意志力和纪律去健身房之类的。”嗯，你知道，其中一个习惯是显而易见、有吸引力、容易且令人满意的，而另一个则不是。所以你需要努力找到方法，让你的习惯更**显而易见、有吸引力、容易且令人满意**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Broadly speaking, I think there are four things that you should do if you want to build a habit. And this is true if you want to, you know, replace an old one and install a new one. So, roughly speaking, what you want is your habit to be **obvious**. So, you want it to be easy to see, easy to notice, easy to um, you know, get your attention. You want it to be **attractive**. So, something that's appealing or fun to you, as we were just saying. Um, you want it to be **easy**, simple, frictionless, you know, easy to apply and uh, install. And you want it to be **satisfying**. The more enjoyable or satisfying a habit is, the more likely you are to stick with it in the future. So, I call these the **four laws of behavior change**. Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying. And you don't need all four every single moment of the day or every habit that you build. But the more that you have those four forces working for you, the more likely you are to stick with it. And in fact, we can actually learn something very compelling about our habits by looking at behaviors that we often call bad or like that we waste time on. And you see what do those things have in common? They often are very **obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying**. Those are the things that get them to stick. Um, you know, like if you just take scrolling **social media** for example, it's obvious because your phone is on you all the time. It's often the first app that your thumb gravitates to and you tap open. It's attractive because the algorithm has curated content for your very interests. Um, it's e it's so easy that like a couple years ago, **Instagram** when you would scroll and somebody put up an album, they and if you came back to Instagram like five minutes later, if you had already seen that post, they would auto swipe to the second slide. So, you don't you don't even need to use your thumb anymore, right? They would just keep showing you new content for you. They were trying to make it that easy to consume. And then it's satisfying because it kind of satisfies the interest that you have and so on. Um, get that **dopamine** hit and whatever. So, uh, I'm not trying to like criticize Instagram too much or anything, but I'm just saying if you wonder why is it so easy for me to do that, you know, nobody's sitting around saying, "How can I just find the willpower and the motivation to check Instagram more?" You know, but a lot of people are saying, "Oh, I wish I just had the willpower and the discipline to go to the gym or something like that." Well, you know, one of these is obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying, and one of them is not. And so you need to try to find ways to make your habits more **obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying**.

**主持人**: 那么反过来，就是让你不想要的习惯变得更难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then the opposite being make the ones that you don't want harder.

</details>

**James Clear**: 你只需将这四条法则反转。所以，与其让它显而易见，不如让它**隐形**。所以，取消订阅电子邮件。家里不要放垃圾食品。对于社交媒体的例子，我过去一年就是这样做的。我把手机上所有的社交媒体应用都删除了。我告诉自己，如果你真的想用它们，你可以下载并登录。我甚至不知道我是否真的经常这样做，但也许我做过一两次。嗯，我登录，使用它，然后用完后就删除它。所以我退出并再次删除它。下次我想用它时，我必须再次下载。但它不再是显而易见的了，你知道。嗯，与其让它有吸引力，不如让它**没有吸引力**。这是四条法则中最难的一条，可能也是我最不推荐关注的地方，因为很难改变你的欲望。很难改变你对什么有吸引力、什么没有吸引力的期望。这有可能做到。如果你愿意，我们可以谈谈，但它很难。第三条是，与其让它容易，不如让它**困难**。所以，增加摩擦，在你和行为之间增加步骤。再次，从手机上删除应用程序就是一个很好的例子。然后第四条是，与其让它令人满意，不如让它**不令人满意**。你需要给行为加上某种后果或代价。嗯，如果你做这四件事，你就会更有可能避免。在我们继续讨论习惯之前，我想稍微跑题一下，谈谈社交媒体。当然，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: You just in you just invert each of those four. So rather than making it obvious, make it **invisible**. So unsubscribe from emails. Don't keep junk food in the house. For the social media example, I have so I've done this for the last year. I just deleted all social media apps off my phone. And I what I told myself was if you really want to use them, you can just download them and log in. And I I don't even know that I've really done that that much, but maybe I've done it once or twice. Um I log in, I use it, and then I delete it after I get done. So I log out and delete it again. And then the next time I want to use it, I got to download it again. But it's just it's not obvious anymore, you know. Um rather than making it attractive, make it **unattractive**. That one is the most difficult of the four and probably the place that I would recommend focusing on the least because it's hard to change your desires. It's hard to change your expectations about what things are attractive and what are not. It is possible. We can talk about it if you want, but it's it's hard. The third um is to make it **difficult** instead of making it easy. So, increasing friction, adding steps between you and the behavior. Again, deleting the app off the phone is a good example of that. And then the fourth is rather than making it satisfying, make it **unsatisfying**. You need to layer on some kind of consequence or cost to the behavior. And um if you do those four things, you're much more likely to avoid. Before we keep going with habits, I do want to take a little sidetrack here into social media. And sure,

**James Clear**: 这太棒了。这太棒了。嗯，我发现有些改变听起来容易，但在实践中却非常困难，而另一些事情听起来会很困难，但实际上一点也不难。最难的部分是说服自己去做。嗯，从手机上删除社交媒体就是其中之一。我这样做了一年。大约六个月后，我想：“如果我把电子邮件也删了呢？”所以，我把手机上的电子邮件也删除了。这对我来说听起来会非常困难，但它比我想象的要容易得多。嗯，再说一次，我只是遵循同样的规则，那就是如果我真的需要它，我就会下载应用程序并登录**Gmail**，然后做我需要做的事情。你知道，我过去一年只下载过两次。一次是在机场，我必须在航班起飞前发送一封电子邮件，另一次是我准备去看演出，我们需要在排队时下载门票。嗯，但用完后，我就会再次删除应用程序，然后我想，嗯，如果我需要它，我就会下载。这太好了，因为如果你看看我之前的手机行为，我想我删除**Instagram**之前，平均每天使用时间是42分钟或48分钟，差不多。所以你看看那个，你就会想，嗯，一天只有24小时。这占了他时间的1/20或1/30。嗯，你看到那个就会想，这对他来说一定很重要。你知道，这一定是他生活中非常重要的一部分。但实际上，我一删除它，它就消失了。它实际上并没有那么困难。所以，

<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: It's been awesome. It's It's been so great. Um I It's one of those things that I find that there are some changes that sound easy, but actually are very hard in practice, and then there's other things that sound like they would be difficult, but actually they're not hard at all. The the hard part is convincing yourself to do it. Um deleting social media off my phone was one. I did that for like a year. About six months in, I was like, "What if I did it for email?" And so, I deleted email off my phone. That sounded like it was going to be really hard to me, but it has been so so much easier than I thought. Um, again, I just have the same rule, which is if I really need it, I'll download the app and log into **Gmail** and do what I need to do. And I, you know, I've only downloaded it twice in the last like year. Once I was at the airport and I had to send an email before my flight and the other time I was getting ready to go to a show and I needed to download the tickets while we were in line. Um, but after I get done, I just delete the app again and I'm like, well, I'll just download it if I need it. And it has been so nice because if you had looked at my behavior on the phone before that, I think my average time on **Instagram** before I deleted it was like 42 minutes a day or 48 minutes a day, something like that. So, you look at that and you're like, well, there's only 24 hours in the day. This is getting like 120th or 130th of his time. Um, you would look at that and think, this must be pretty important to him. You know, this must be a pretty important part of his life. And in fact, it just evaporated as soon as I deleted it. It wasn't it wasn't actually that difficult. So,

**James Clear**: 所以，很多人在杂货店排队时，或者在车里等加油时，或者诸如此类的时候，他们会做什么？嗯，他们会拿出手机，你知道。嗯，昨晚我去了餐馆。每个排队等桌子的人，你进去，办理入住，好的，我们五分钟后给你安排座位。每个人都拿出手机。嗯，所以当你无事可做时，你会做什么？对我们大多数人来说，很多时候都是查看手机，查看，嗯，你知道，查看社交媒体。所以你确实需要一些东西来填补那个空白。所以也许，你知道，我所做的是我把**Audible**移到了我手机的主屏幕上，然后我说，嗯，我会在通常做那些事情的时候听有声书。你需要一些无摩擦的东西来填补那个空白。嗯，我不知道对每个人来说应该是什么，但我认为对那个问题有一个答案是很好的，因为否则你将不得不只是坐着，你知道，无事可做。

**James Clear**: So, a lot of people when they are standing in line at the grocery store or they're waiting for the gas to fill up in the car or something like that, what do they do? Well, they pull their phone out, you know. Um, last night I went to a restaurant. Every single person who was waiting in line for a table, you go in, you check in, you okay, we'll seat you in five minutes. Every single person pulled their phone out. Um, and so what do you do when you have nothing to do? And for most of us, a lot of the time it's check your phone, check your uh, you know, check social media. So you do need something to fill that space. So maybe, you know, what I did was I moved **Audible** to the home screen of my phone and I just said, well, I'll just listen to an audio book when, you know, when I'm usually doing that. You some try, you need something frictionless to fill that gap. Um, and I don't know what it should be for each person, but I think it's it's good to have a qu an answer to that question because otherwise you're going to have to just sit with, you know, there's nothing to do.

Um, I also have tried to install um some additional barriers, which is I can't log in to any of my social accounts on my own. I have to text my assistant to send me the login because it's tied to a separate phone. Um, it's I can't even get past the **two-factor** um because it doesn't go to my phone anymore.

### 上游习惯与反思

**主持人**: 我喜欢。哪些**上游习惯**（*upstream habits*）对人们来说最重要，值得思考或培养？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love it. What **upstream habits** are most important for people to think about or create

</details>

**James Clear**: 我之前没有提到这一点，但我认为这也与**排序**（*sequencing*）有关，那就是问，你知道，哪些事情是我想达到的结果或习惯的**上游**？这是一个很好的思考框架，可以让你思考应该专注于什么。你通常应该先做那些上游的事情。嗯，可能所有其他习惯中最重要的**上游习惯**是某种**反思回顾**（*reflection review*）的习惯。思考的习惯，嗯，你现在正在做的事情是最佳时间利用方式的可能性非常小，几乎不可能。所以我想**萨姆·奥尔特曼**（*Sam Altman*）有句话说，你应该对除了思考要做什么之外的任何工作都设定非常高的门槛。嗯，因为那将是最大的**杠杆点**，就是选择一个更好的事情来集中你的注意力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: that. So the I I didn't mention this earlier but I think this is also related to **sequencing** which is just asking you know what things are **upstream** from the outcomes that I want or from the habits that I want. It's a good it's a good way to a good frame for thinking about what you should focus on. You should generally try to do the things that are upstream first. Um probably the single most important habit that is upstream of all the other ones is some kind of habit of **reflection review**. The habit of thinking um it is so unlikely that um whatever you are working on now is the best use of your time is it's almost impossible. And so I think **Sam Altman** has some line where he says you should have a very high bar for working on anything other than thinking about what to work on. Um because that's that's going to be the biggest point of leverage is choosing a better thing to focus your attention on.

**James Clear**: 很多人都是这样，你知道，我以前也是这样。如果你是那种工作道德很好，努力工作让你受益匪浅的人，你就会达到一个开始把它当作拐杖的地步，因为你会想，嗯，我只要努力就能解决。你知道，我只要更努力工作就能解决这个问题。但你无法超越一个正在做更好事情的人。所以，嗯，如果你真的努力，也许你可以比现在多努力10%或20%。但如果你做正确的事情，你会得到100倍甚至1000倍的结果。所以，我认为我们应该改变“努力工作”的定义。它不应该仅仅意味着投入时间。它还应该意味着**超越他人思考**。如果你没有超越他人思考，你就没有超越他人工作。所以，嗯，**反思回顾**的习惯可能是最重要的习惯。你需要每周留出一些时间坐下来思考，我是否把我宝贵的时间和精力，我这宝贵的生命，花在我想花的事情上？除了留出一些思考空间，我不知道还有其他方法可以做到这一点。你知道，如果你只是埋头苦干，那么你很可能不会以正确的方式利用你的时间。所以，我有几种不同的做法。嗯，我每周五都会进行一次**周度回顾**（*weekly review*），主要是关于业务方面的事情。所以，你知道，它会查看指标，看看事情进展如何，以及订阅者、收入、支出等等。这只是一个快速的检查。大多数时候，什么都不会发生。我只是看看数据，一切都好。但偶尔你会遇到一周，你看到一个趋势，然后你会想：“哦，这个已经连续三周下降了，这是怎么回事？”或者类似的情况。所以，这只是一种在出现**危险信号**（*red flags*）时及时发现它们的方式。嗯，更重要的是，我每年都会进行一次**年度回顾**（*annual review*），年度回顾更多是关于价值观的。它更多是关于我所说的对我来说重要的事情是什么？我是哪种人，或者，你知道，我正在努力成为哪种人？然后看看我去年是如何度过的，然后说：“嗯，这是否符合？”我的日历在那里扮演着非常关键的角色。我详细地查看我的日历。我查看我去年做了多少次锻炼，每个月做了多少次，我每个月的平均次数是多少？我查看我去了多少个地方旅行，我在家外度过了多少个夜晚，这是否足够或不够，感觉如何？嗯，我查看我发表了多少篇文章或时事通讯，你知道，诸如此类的事情。所以这对我来说是一个机会，可以检查我过去一年的产出和时间。然后你看看你的价值观，然后你会说：“嗯，你说这很重要。你真的把时间花在那里了吗？”所以这是一种**纠正方向**（*course correct*）的方式。嗯，过去两年有点有趣，因为我通常在十二月进行年度回顾，但我一直把那个文档开着一整年，我不断地回到它身边，并试图在顶部写下新的原则或什么的，以帮助我纠正方向。

**James Clear**: And so many people are, you know, I I was like this too. If you have if you're the type of person who has a very good work ethic and hard work has benefited you a lot in your life, you get to a point where you start to use it as a crutch because you're like, well, I'll just work my way out of it. You know, I'll just I'll just work harder and that's a way to solve this problem. But you cannot outwork the person who's working on a better thing. And so um it is possible if you really grind maybe you can work 10% harder or 20% harder than you are now. But if you work on the right thing you get 100x of the results or thousandx the results. And so what you need I I almost feel like we should change the definition of what it means to work hard. It should not only mean putting in the hours. It should also mean **outthinking** the other person. If you're not outthinking them, you're not outworking them. And so, um, a habit of **reflection review** is probably the single most important habit. You need to create some time in your week to sit down and think, am I spending my precious time and energy, my one precious life on the things that I want to be spending it on? And I don't know any other way to do that than to make some space to think. You know, if you just keep your head down and work hard, it's just really unlikely that you're going to be spending it in the right way. So, I have a couple different ways I do it. Um, I do a **weekly review** every Friday where I sit down that's mostly related to business stuff. So, you know, it's looking at metrics and how things are going and, you know, subscribers and revenue and expenses and all that stuff. It's just a quick check-in. Most weeks, nothing happens. I just look at stuff and it's fine. But occasionally you'll get a week where you see a trend and it's like, "Oh, that's been going down for 3 weeks straight, like what's going on there?" or something like that. So, it's just a way to kind of notice **red flags** when they come up. Um, the more important one is I do an **annual review** and the annual review is more about values. It's more about what do I say is important to me? Who am I the type of person or you know, who am I trying to be as a person? And then looking at how I spent my last year and saying,"Well, did that match up or not?" My calendar plays a really critical role there. I go through my calendar in detail. I look at how many workouts did I do last year, how many did I do each month, what was my average per month? I look at how many places did I travel to, how many nights did I spend away from home, is that enough or not enough, like how did that feel? Um, I look at how many articles I published or newsletters I published, you know, things like that. And so it's kind of the chance for me to check in on my production and time for the last year. And then you look at your values and you say, "Well, you said this was important to you. Is that actually where you spent your time?" And so it's a way to **course correct**. Um, the last two years it's been kind of interesting because I I usually do that annual review in December and I have continued to keep the document open all year long and I keep coming back to it and trying to write like new principles at the top of it or whatever to help me course correct.

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，就像我的一条原则，我甚至不知道它是否真的有意义，但过去一年我的一条原则是“**像雷霆般行动**”（*move like thunder*）。嗯，所以它就像你看不见它，但突然之间就有一声巨响。嗯，这就是我试图做更少的事情，但产生更大的影响。所以我只是在顶部有一些这样的小句子，以努力让我保持在轨道上，你知道，我希望那一年能做些什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Um, like one of my I don't even know if it really makes sense, but one of my principles for the last year was like **move like thunder**. Um, and so it's like you don't really see it, but then all of a sudden there's this big crash. And um, that's the that's kind of like I'm trying to do fewer things but with a bigger impact. And so I just have little lines like that that are at the top to try to keep me on track with, you know, what I'm hoping to do that year.

**主持人**: 你会和妻子进行核对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you have a check-in with your wife?

</details>

**James Clear**: 是的，我们，嗯，我们没有正式的核对。我不会把它当作你在公司里做的那种一对一会议，但我们有，你知道，就像一次董事会会议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Yeah, we um, we don't have like a formal check-in. I don't treat it like a one-on-one that you would do like in a company or something like that, but what we have, you know, like a board meeting.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。是的。我不知道。它只是感觉太结构化和奇怪了，你知道。嗯，但我们过去几年做的最重要的事情是**每月约会之夜**（*monthly date night*），并确保每个月都真正发生，我们已经持续了大概，我不知道，大概24到30个月了。嗯，这非常重要。我们说这是我们真正交谈的唯一时间，这听起来很傻，因为我们一直在交谈，对吧？但一切都是物流。都是任务，都是弄清楚如何处理孩子，你知道，就像有很多事情需要做。都是待办事项，然后，嗯，你出去几个小时，然后你就会想，哦，现在我们真的可以交谈了，你知道。所以我认为那，嗯，那真的很有价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It just feel it just feels like too structured and weird, you know. Um, but the biggest thing that we've done the last couple years is a **monthly date night** and just making sure that that actually happens every month, which we have for like probably I don't know probably, you know, 24 to 30 straight months now. Um, has been huge. It's the one time what we say is it's the one time that we actually talk, which sounds silly because we're talking all the time, right? But everything is logistics. It's all tasks and figuring out what to do with the kids and you know it's like there's all these things that need to be done. It's all jobs to be done and then um you go out for a couple hours and you're like oh now we it's actually we can actually talk you know so I think that has been uh that's been really valuable.

**主持人**: 我认为那非常重要。

### 坏习惯与数字排毒

**主持人**: 你认为哪些流行的习惯是垃圾？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What popular habits do you think are garbage?

</details>

**James Clear**: 嗯，现在我唯一想到的是**消费新闻**（*consuming the news*）和**浏览社交媒体**。这是我感觉，你知道，我们有一个，嗯，我们的一位祖父母已经九十多岁了，嗯，我们和她聊过，她有点像，哦，是的，我们年轻的时候也吸烟，但没人知道，你知道，他们就像我们当时没意识到，每个人都吸烟。这不是，你知道，它就是那样。我想，当我94岁时，我会说什么呢？就像我们都在用社交媒体，没人知道，你知道，我们当时没意识到。我不是想过多批评社交媒体，因为，你知道，它显然也有好处。但是，嗯，我确实，我确实想知道我们回头看时会说什么？就像，是的，我们当时没有完全意识到它的全部影响。嗯，它有点像，你知道，在干扰我们的思想。所以，我意思是，我们正在走向一个世界，我认为人们还没有完全意识到，如果你和我在**《华尔街日报》**（*Wall Street Journal*）或**《纽约时报》**（*New York Times*）上打开同一篇文章，那将是两篇不同版本的文章，它们基于我们的浏览历史、我们的政治偏好。我不是说他们今天正在这样做，但你可以看到这项技术正在形成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: H the only one that's coming to me right now is **consuming the news**. Um and browsing **social media**. Those are the two that I just feel like I wonder, you know, we have a uh one of our grandparents is in their her 90s and um we talked to her and it's kind of like, oh yeah, we smoked when we were younger, but like nobody knew, you know, like they're like we didn't realize like everybody did it. It wasn't, you know, it was just like how it was. And I wonder like when I'm 94, like what am I going to be saying where it's like we were all on social media, nobody knew, you know, like we didn't realize. And I don't mean to criticize social media too much because like obviously there are benefits from it. But um I do I do wonder what we're going to look back on and be like yeah we didn't quite realize the full effect of all of it. Um and it was kind of like you know messing with our minds. So increasingly, I mean, we're moving to a world, I don't think people quite realize it yet, where if you and I open the same article in the **Wall Street Journal** or **New York Times**, it's going to be two different versions of that article that's based on our browsing history, our political preferences. And I'm not saying they're doing that today, but you can see the technology is sort of formulated.

</details>

**James Clear**: 我觉得唯一的赢法就是**不参与游戏**，你知道吗？所以这就是为什么我在很多方面都退出了。嗯，我们有两个同龄的朋友，他们从未有过社交媒体账号，我就想，天哪，我有时会想那是什么感觉。那有点像，我，我，我并不一定羡慕他们，但我确实看到那个，然后我想，那是一种令人耳目一新的生活方式，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: I kind of feel like the only way to win is to **not play the game**, you know? So that that's why I've sort of checked out in a lot of ways. Um, we have two friends who are our age who have never had social media accounts and I'm like, man, I kind of wonder what it's like sometimes. Like that's kind of I I I don't necessarily like envy them, but I do look at that and I'm like, that's kind of a refreshing way to live, you know?

</details>

**James Clear**: 很有趣的是，它在当下感觉多么必要。感觉就像，哦，我真的不能放弃这个，因为这是我生活中非常重要的一部分。但如果你能让自己放弃一个月或什么的，你就会意识到实际上生活照样过得很好。嗯，你仍然可以过上非常丰富、充实和有意义的生活，它在其中没有任何作用。所以，嗯，是的，我认为放弃它一直都很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And it is interesting how uh essential it feels in the moment. It feels like, oh, I can't really give this up because this is a really big important part of my life. But if you can get yourself to give it up for a month or something, you realize actually life goes on just fine. Um there's you can still live a very rich and full and fulfilling life and it plays no no role in it. So um yeah, giving I think giving that up has been has been good.

### 两分钟法则再探

**主持人**: “两分钟法则”是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the two-minute rule?

</details>

**James Clear**: **两分钟法则**（*Two-minute rule*）非常简单。它只是说，把你想要培养的任何习惯，缩小到两分钟或更短时间就能完成的事情。所以，每年读30本书变成读一页，或者每周做瑜伽4天变成拿出我的瑜伽垫。你知道，有时我向人们提到这些例子时，他们会有点抗拒。你知道，有个人说：“好吧，伙计。你知道，我知道真正的目标不仅仅是拿出我的瑜伽垫。你知道，我实际上是想做锻炼。”所以我理解人们的想法。但两分钟法则做了一件重要的事情。你知道，我有一个读者。他叫**米奇**（*Mitch*）。我在**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）中提到过他，他开始去健身房锻炼，减掉了100多磅。现在已经保持了十多年了。但他刚开始去的时候，有个规定，就是不允许在健身房待超过五分钟。所以他上车，开车去健身房，下车，做一半的运动，再上车，开车回家。这听起来很傻，对吧？听起来有点荒谬，就像，哦，显然这不会让他达到想要的效果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: **Two-minute rule** is very simple. It just says take whatever habit you're trying to focus on and scale it down to something that takes 2 minutes or less to do. So read 30 books a year becomes read one page or do yoga 4 days a week becomes take out my yoga mat. You know sometimes I mention those examples to people and they kind of resist it a little bit. You know one guy who's like okay buddy. You know like I know the real goal isn't just to take my yoga mat out. You know I'm actually trying to do the workout. So I understand where people are coming from. But the two-minute rule does something important. You know I have this reader. His name was **Mitch**. I mentioned him in **Atomic Habits** and he started going to the gym and he lost over 100 pounds. He's kept off for more than a decade now. But when he first started to go, he had a rule where he wasn't allowed to stay at the gym for longer than 5 minutes. So he get in the car, drive to the gym, get out, do half an exercise, get back in the car, drive home. And it sounds silly, right? It sounds like kind of ridiculous, like, oh, clearly this is not going to get the guy the results he wants.

</details>

**James Clear**: 但你意识到的是，他正在掌握**坚持出现**的艺术。你知道，他正在成为那种每周去健身房四天的人，即使每次只去五分钟。我认为这是关于习惯的一个非常深刻的真理，那就是一个习惯必须先建立起来，才能得到改善。你知道，它必须成为你生活中的标准，然后你才能扩大它并优化它，把它变成更重要的东西。你需要先标准化，然后才能优化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: But what you realize is he was mastering the art of **showing up**. You know, he was becoming the type of person that went to the gym four days a week, even if it was only for 5 minutes. And I think this is a very deep truth about habits, which is a habit must be established before it can be improved. You know, it has to become the standard in your life before you can scale it up and optimize and turning it into something more. You need to standardize before you optimize.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**James Clear**: **两分钟法则**（*Two-minute rule*）可以帮助你做到这一点。它有助于抵制那种**完美主义倾向**，那种你觉得你需要把所有事情都弄清楚，或者完美地去做才能开始做的感觉。我不知道我们为什么会对习惯这样做。我们对它们变得非常**全有或全无**。你知道，我们如此专注于寻找最佳销售策略、完美的商业想法、理想的饮食计划。我们如此专注于优化，以至于如果我们找不到完美的那个，我们就会想，嗯，我需要继续研究。但你需要掌握**坚持出现**的艺术。你知道，如果你不能每周去健身房五分钟四天，谁会在乎45分钟的锻炼计划有多好呢？你知道，那只是理论而已。**埃德·拉蒂莫尔**（*Ed Latimore*）有句话说，健身房里最重的重量是前门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: And the **two-minute rule** helps you do that. It helps push back on that **perfectionist tendency**, that feeling that you need to have it all figured out or to do it perfectly to do it at all. I don't know why we do that with our habits. We get very **all or nothing** about them. You know, we're so focused on finding the best sales strategy, the perfect business idea, the ideal diet plan. We're so focused on optimizing that if we can't find the perfect one, we're like, well, I need to keep researching. But you need to master the art of **showing up**. You know, like if you can't go to the gym for five minutes four days a week, who cares how good the 45-minute workout plan is? You know, it's just a theory at that point. **Ed Latimore** has that phrase or that quote where he says the heaviest weight at the gym is the front door.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**James Clear**: 生活中有很多事情都是这样。你知道，最难的一步是第一步。最困难的行动是第一个动作。所以，你需要掌握第一步，掌握第一阶段，然后前进。我只是喜欢这个原则，你应该努力利用你当前的优势来获得新的优势。所以，你知道，早期，如果我看看我的创业生涯，嗯，早期，我几乎没有任何优势。你知道，我没有钱，没有资源，没有人脉。但我有什么？我有时间。所以，在前三年，我每周一和周四都会写一篇新文章。我平均每篇文章会花15到20个小时。我写得最快的一次是8小时。嗯，最长的一次是40多小时，但这很少见。嗯，但你知道，如果你每周花20小时写两篇文章，那就是40小时的工作周。大多数人不会花那么多时间写一篇2000字的文章。所以我的任务就是努力让它成为最有用、最有价值、最可操作的文章。如果你这样做一百次，你最终会得到很多真正好的内容。这有助于受众增长。所以然后我利用我当前的优势，也就是时间，来创造有价值的东西。这有助于受众增长。现在我有10万电子邮件订阅者。现在我有了新的优势，嗯，那就是我有了受众。所以然后它继续增长。我想我达到大约20万订阅者时，我获得了**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）的图书合约。所以你利用你的新优势来获得另一个优势。现在我有了图书合约，嗯，然后花了三年时间写这本书。嗯，然后你就有了一本畅销书。那是另一个优势。你就可以，你知道，你看到你如何努力一步步提升，然后你开始积累这些新的优势，它让你处于一个非常不同的位置。嗯，现在，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: Like there are a lot of things in life that are like that. You know, the hardest step is the first one. The most difficult action is the first movement. So, you need to master the first step, master stage one, and then advance. I I just like this principle of you should try to use your **current advantages to gain new advantages**. So, you know, early on, like if I look at my entrepreneurial career, um, early on, I had very few advantages. You know, I had no money, no resources, no connections. But what did I have? I had time. And so, for the first three years, I wrote a new article every Monday and Thursday. And I would spend on average, I would spend between like 15 and 20 hours on each article. The short the fastest I ever did one was eight hours. Um, the longest was like 40 something, but that was rare. Um, but you know, if you if you spend 20 hours on two articles a week, that's 40-hour week right there. And most people are not spending that much time on a 2,000-word article. And so my mission was just to try to make it the most useful, valuable, actionable article it could be. And if you do that a hundred times, you end up with a lot of really good content on there. And that helped the audience grow. So then I then I used my current advantage, which was time to create something of value. That helped grow the audience. Now I have 100,000 email subscribers. Now I have a new advantage um which is I have an audience. And so then that kept growing. I think once I got to around 200 is when I got the book deal for **Atomic Habits**. So you use your new advantage to gain another one. Now I have a book deal um and spent the next three years writing the book. Um then you have a bestselling book. That's another advantage. And you can just, you know, you see how you try to like lever up um one after the other and you start to accumulate these these new advantages and it puts you in a much different position. Um now,

</details>

**James Clear**: 显然，这需要一些耐心，对吗？我刚才在30秒内描述的事情花了大约七年时间，你知道吗？嗯，所以这需要一段时间。但有时人们会说：“哦，**《原子习惯》**（*Atomic Habits*）是如何成为畅销书的？”而你真正看到的是，当书出版时，是之前大约五年积累的**势能**（*potential energy*）的释放。你知道，它不是一夜之间发生的。那是五年时间建立起数十万人的受众，结识其他作者，参加播客和接受采访。你知道，所有这些东西都是在同一时间发布的，但它花了一段时间才建立起来。所以无论如何，这只是我的另一个小原则，那就是**利用你当前的优势来获得新的优势**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: there's obviously some patience that needs to come with that, right? Like I just described something in 30 seconds that took like seven years, you know? Um so it takes a while. But sometimes uh people will say, "Oh, how did **Atomic Habits** become this bestseller or whatever?" And really what you're seeing when the book comes out is the release of **potential energy** that was built over like five years prior. You know, it's not like it happened overnight. It was the five years of building an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, meeting other authors, going on podcasts and doing interviews. You know, all that stuff was released around the same time, but it was it took a while for it to get built up. So anyway, that's just another one of my little principles, which is **use your current advantages to gain new advantages**.

</details>

### 克服感觉与自我认知

**James Clear**: 阻止人们做事情的原因之一是他们就是不想做。我们如何变得比我们的感觉更强大？我认为如果你不想做，那也没关系。嗯，我认为有时它是一个信号，你知道，就像**拖延**（*procrastination*）不总是一件坏事。如果你在拖延某事，有时它是一个信号，表明你实际上并不想要那件事。嗯，这没关系。我很长一段时间，我，我，我在学校表现很好。我成绩很好。对我来说，那就像一场我试图赢的游戏。你知道，我并不真正关心我是否在学习。我关心的是我是否得了A，你知道，我是否成功了？嗯，这可能不是你上学的方式，但那是，你知道，我当时对待它的方式。而且，嗯，所以很长一段时间，如果你在大学时问我，你要做什么？我说我要去医学院。嗯，那是我喜欢的事情。我确实认为我会喜欢做医生或外科医生。我认为那个职业有很多地方会与我的自我相符。但也有大约30%或40%的地方不适合我。而且，嗯，我一直这么说，因为那是你可以说出来而不会受到批评的事情。你知道，就像你感恩节或圣诞节回家，人们会问：“你要做什么？”你就会说：“我要去医学院。”每个人都会说：“那太棒了。”你知道，嗯，你知道，有些人应该成为医生，但我一直拖延的是准备**MCAT**（*MCAT*），入学考试。那是一个信号，你知道，那是一个信号，表明我并不真正想做这件事，因为我没有完全投入。嗯，我很长一段时间都忽略了这一点。嗯，然后参加了考试，考得不好，你知道，但它就像，是的，这不一定是坏事。这是一个信号，表明我在某种直觉层面上意识到这并不是我真正想要的，那只是我一直在讲的一个故事。嗯，而其他事情，比如写关于习惯的文章，例如，我夏天在一家骨科诊所实习，我做了很多很酷的事情。我参加了大约35次手术，并进行了**影子学习**（*shadow learning*）和观察。那真的很棒。我为诊所做了一些后台账单工作。但每天下午我通常有大约两个小时，我本应该工作到5点，但我没什么事可做。所以我坐下来，开始写关于习惯的文章。我只是有一个**Word**文档。它有点像“**詹姆斯**（*James*）关于习惯的想法”，它写了大约60页。然后我想，你应该发表一些东西，你知道，这有点荒谬，一直写这些东西，你打算怎么做？这又回到了我早先的观点，你应该公开分享你的作品，而且没有人要求我这样做，你知道，嗯，但我，所以这有点像，你晚上和周末在做什么？你用你的空闲时间在做什么？也许那才是你一周内应该做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: One of the things that prevents people from doing things is they just don't feel like it. How do we become stronger than our feelings? I think it's okay if you don't feel like it. Um I think sometimes it's a signal, you know, like you should **procrastination** is not always a bad thing. If you're procrastinating on something, something sometimes it's a signal that you don't actually want that thing. Uh which is fine. I for a long time I so I I was good in school. I got good grades. It was like a game for me that I tried to win. You know, I didn't really care about whether I was learning. I cared about was I getting A's, you know, am I am I succeeding? Um, which may not be the way that you want to go through school, but that's, you know, that's how I treated it at the time. And, um, so for a long time, if you asked me when I was in college, what are you going to do? I said I was going to go to medical school. Um, it was something that I I liked. I do think I would like a lot about being a doctor or a surgeon. There's I think there's a lot about that profession that would I would align with who I am. But there's also probably 30% or 40% that would not have been a good fit for me. And um I kept saying that because it's the type of thing that you can say and never be criticized for. You know, like you go home at Thanksgiving or Christmas and people are like, "What are you going to do?" And you're like, "I'm going to go to medical school." And everybody says, "That's great." You know, um and you know, some people should be doctors, but what I kept procrastinating on was studying for the **MCAT**. The entrance exam and that was kind of a sign, you know, it was it was a sign that I didn't really want to do this because I wasn't fully in. Um, and I ignored that for a long time. Um, and took it and didn't do that well and you know, but it's like yeah, like this wasn't that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It was a sign that I realized at some intuitive level that this isn't actually what I wanted and it was just a story that I kept saying. Um whereas other stuff like writing about habits for example I I was interned at an orthopedic medical practice over the summer and I got to do a lot of cool stuff. I went in on like 35 surgeries and got to like **shadow learning** that and watch it. That was really neat. I did some back-end billing stuff for the practice. But each afternoon I usually ended up with about two hours where I was supposed to be working till 5:00 and I didn't have anything to do. And so I sat down and I started writing about habits. I just had this **Word** doc. It was just kind of like **James'** thoughts on habits and it got to be about 60 pages long and I was like you should publish something of this you know this is kind of ridiculous keep writing about all this like what are you going to do it for kind of back to my earlier point about you should share your work publicly and nobody asked me to do that you know um but I so it's kind of like what are you what are you doing on nights and weekends what are you doing with your free time maybe that's what you should be doing during the week

</details>

**James Clear**: 这就是那种能量。所以你看看医学院，你就会想，嗯，我当时在拖延其中一个关键部分。然后你看看习惯和写作部分，你就会想，嗯，你当时在做这个，甚至没人要求你做。嗯，所以那是两种非常不同的能量形式。我认为努力寻找那些让你**奔向下一件事**，而不是**逃离上一件事**的地方。就像方向相同，能量完全不同。你自然而然地奔向什么？什么自然而然地吸引你？那些就是你应该加倍努力的地方。你刚才说的一件事让我印象深刻，那就是没有人能反驳我正在追求这个目标的事实，很多人似乎都在以这种方式优化他们的生活，对吧？我没有突出。我没有棱角。没有人能...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**James Clear**: and it was like very much that sort of energy and So you look at medical school and you're like, well, I was procrastinating on a key part of it. And then you look at the habits and like writing part and you're like, well, you were doing this and nobody was even asking you to. Um, and so those are two very different forms of energy. And I think trying to find the things where you are uh **running toward the next thing**, not **away from the last thing**. Like same same direction, totally different energy. What are you naturally running toward? What is naturally pulling you in? And those are the places that you should double down on. One of the things that you said that stood out to me there was nobody could argue with the fact that I was I was pursuing this goal and so many people seem to optimize their life in in this way, right? Where I'm not standing out. I'm not spiky. I'm nobody can

**James Clear**: 你不会因为什么而受到批评？我们如何培养这种勇气，我的意思是，那本书《**被讨厌的勇气**》（*The Courage to Be Disliked*），但基本上是那种勇气，嗯，是的，我开始在内心称之为“**标签的暴政**”（*tyranny of labels*）。你知道，它是一种受制于标签的暴政，是一种需要以某种方式被描述，需要被称为畅销书作家、外科医生或律师之类的标签。如果你需要那个标签，那么你就受制于以那种方式做事。

**James Clear**: what will you not be criticized for? How do we develop the courage to I mean the the book **The Courage to Be Disliked** but basically the courage to um yeah it's kind of the I have started to call it internally to myself I've started to call it the **tyranny of labels** you know it is the the tyranny of being beholden to a label it's the need to be described in a certain way to need to be called a best-selling author or a surgeon or a lawyer or whatever the label is. If you need that label, then you are beholden to doing it that way.

**James Clear**: 但如果你能从标签中解放自己，转而问自己，我想要什么样的生活方式？或者我想产生什么样的影响，无论实际的标签是什么？那么突然之间，大量的选择就出现了。所以，举个例子，我有一些朋友和家人是教授。如果你需要成为一名教授，如果你需要拥有那个标签，那么你的工作选择就非常有限。但如果你转而问自己，嗯，我想要什么样的生活方式？好的，教授夏天放假。我喜欢那种生活方式的灵活性。或者我想产生什么样的影响？嗯，教授可以教书。他们向其他人教授概念。嗯，如果你说，如果你只是说，我想要一种灵活的生活，我可以教导别人。那么有很多选择。你可以成为播客主，你可以成为**YouTube**博主，你可以写作，你可以做，你知道，你可以做几乎无限的事情，你可以成为教练。有很多不同的方式来教书，嗯，并拥有灵活的生活。但如果它必须围绕标签，那么突然之间你的选择范围就非常有限了。而且，嗯，我一次又一次地看到那些我认为非常有才华和聪明的人，但他们却限制了自己，因为他们必须拥有那个标签。

**James Clear**: But if you can release yourself from the label and instead ask yourself, what type of lifestyle do I want or what type of impact do I want to make regardless of what the actual label is? Now, all of a sudden, a ton of options open up. So, as an example, like I have a couple friends and family members who are professors. If you need to be a professor, if you need to have that label, you're very limited in what your job options are. But if instead you ask yourself, well, what kind of lifestyle do I want? Okay, well, a professor's off in the summer. I like the flexibility of that lifestyle. Or what type of impact do I want to make? Well, professors get to teach. They teach concepts to other people. Well, if you say, if you just say, I want a flexible life where I get to teach people. There are tons of options. You could be a podcaster, you could be a **YouTuber**, you could write, you could do, you know, you can do almost infinite, you could be a coach. There's so many different ways to teach um and to have a flexible life. But if it needs to be about the label, now all of a sudden your subset of options is very limited. And um I have seen this again and again with people who I think are very talented and intelligent but they kind of restrict themselves because they have to have the label.

**James Clear**: 所以我认为如果你能放弃这一点，如果你能放弃那种需要以某种方式被描述，需要拥有某种**地位标志**（*status marker*）的需求，转而问自己，我想产生什么样的影响？我想拥有什么样的生活方式？那么突然之间，你就有更多的选择来实现它。

**James Clear**: And so I think if you can give that up, if you can release that need to be described in a certain way, to have a certain **status marker**, but instead ask yourself, what type of impact do I want to make? What type of lifestyle do I want to have? Now all of a sudden you have a lot more options for making it happen.

### 深度与广度

**主持人**: 很多人只了解事物的梗概。所以如果你想到，嗯，**詹姆斯**（*James*），你知道，你读完一整本书，你可能会从那本书中获得一个想法，你把那个想法压缩成一个观点，你把那个观点发布到**推特**（*Twitter*）上。是的。

**主持人**: 他们认为他们理解的水平和你一样，但你已经把所有这些经验提炼成了那个观点。你如何看待何时可以只了解事物的梗概，何时需要深入研究，深入细节很重要？似乎，我将
