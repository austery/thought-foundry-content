### 杰克逊霍尔的超现实氛围与央行独立性危机

大家好，欢迎收听OddLots播客。我是乔·魏森塔尔。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Wisenthal.</p>
</details>

我是特蕾西·阿洛威。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

特蕾西，我们还在**杰克逊霍尔**（Jackson Hole: 每年由堪萨斯城联邦储备银行主办的全球央行年会）。说“我们还在”很有趣，因为我们是同时录制所有这些节目的，我们也不知道你具体什么时候会收听。但这又是另一期杰克逊霍尔特辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, we're still here at Jackson Hole. It's funny saying things like we're still here because we're recording all these episodes at the same time and we don't really know exactly when you're listening. But this is yet another Jackson Hole episode.</p>
</details>

又一封来自杰克逊霍尔的特别信函。所以，如果我坦诚地说，今年的杰克逊霍尔会议带有一种超现实的元素，因为它历来是一个学术会议。撇开主席的演讲不谈——我们稍后会详细讨论这个演讲——它是一个讨论重要议题、学术经济学的地方，这很棒，我喜欢那些东西，它们非常有趣。然而，最大的故事实际上是对**独立中央银行**（Independent Central Banks: 指中央银行在制定和执行货币政策时不受政府干预的程度）整个前提的攻击，但感觉所有事情都在讨论，唯独这件事没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another special missive from Jackson Hole. So I think there's like an element if uh if I'm being honest a certain surreality of Jackson hold this year because it is an academic conference historically and you know the setting aside the chairman's speech which we'll uh talk about more setting aside that speech you know it's a place for like talking about important issues and yeah academic economics and that's great and I love that stuff and it's super interesting and all that and yet the big story is really the attack on the whole premise on the independent central banks and yet it's sort of like feels like everything but that gets talked about.</p>
</details>

我想这是对的。你提到了撇开鲍威尔的演讲，但非常明显的是，在他的演讲中，他本可以借此机会谈论中央银行独立性或数据完整性等问题，考虑到劳工统计局最近发生的事情，但他选择了不谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's right. And you said setting aside Pal's speech, but it was very very noticeable that in his speech he could have taken it as an opportunity to talk about things like central bank independence or things like data integrity given what's been happening at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but he chose not to.</p>
</details>

是的，说得好。你说得对。他本可以这样做，因为我们都在想，这可能是他作为美联储主席的最后一次演讲。所以他本可以就他作为中央银行家的职业生涯以及这些事情的重要性发表一些非常重要的看法，但他却发表了一篇宏观经济政策演讲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, great point. You're right. Like he could have I because we're wondering like you know this is going to be his last speech last time speaking as the Federal Reserve chairman. So he could have said something really big about reflecting on a career of being a central banker and the importance of all these things and he he gave a uh you know macroeconomic policy speech.</p>
</details>

还有另一个层面，就是他现在试图做的很多事情，似乎都集中在劳动力市场恶化上，也许他会忽视目前通胀的一些上行风险。这只有在你拥有一个可信的中央银行，能够将长期通胀预期锚定下来时才能实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's also this other layer which is a lot of what he's trying to do now which seems to be to focus on labor market deterioration and maybe look through some of the upside risks to inflation right now. that only happens if you have a credible central bank that can pin longer term expectations for inflation down. Like</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes,</p>
</details>

他之所以能够做到这些，仅仅是因为美联储几十年来建立起来的信誉和社会资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the only reason he's able to do some of this is because of the credibility the social capital that the Fed has built up over decades.</p>
</details>

完全正确。我们之所以谈论这个，明确地说，是因为特朗普政府对**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**（Jerome Powell: 现任美联储主席）以及其他美联储理事的攻击，以及整个事件。这只是试图重组美国国内和国际政策的一部分。显然有关税问题，它们与货币政策相互关联，但还有与他国关系的改变，这涉及到“为安全付费”之类的事情，像是许多重大的转折点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly right. And the reason why we're talking about this, just to be very clear, it's because of the attacks from the Trump administration on Jerome Powell, also other uh Fed governors, also, you know, the whole thing. And this is just part and parcel of one attempt to sort of you know restructure how the US does both domestic and international policy because there's the tariffs obviously and those intersect with monetary policy but then there's just also the sort of changing relationship with other countries that gets into things like you know like let's get like payment for security or something like that like big so many like big hinges and pivots at one point</p>
</details>

我认为，说这是试图重塑全球秩序，无论是在通过国际金融体系实现的经济方面，还是在安全方面，都并非夸大其词。对我来说，令人困惑的是，美国拥有世界上最大的经济体，这是一个事实。美国在疫情期间的表现比许多其他国家都要好得多。我们的通胀率最终也低于世界其他许多地区。然而，特朗普政府似乎非常确信美国在当前的国际秩序中某种程度上正在失利，或者他们觉得通过重组可以获得更多。所以我想我们应该讨论一下这背后的一些动机，以及新世界可能的样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's I mean I don't think it's hyperbole to say it's a attempt at restructuring of the global order both in terms of the economy via the international financial system and also in terms of security. I think the confusing part for me is I it is a fact that America has the world's biggest economy. America came through the pandemic a lot better than a lot of other countries. We ended up having lower inflation than a lot of other parts in the world. And yet the Trump administration seems very very convinced that the US is somehow losing out from the current international order or maybe they feel that there's just more that they could get from restructuring it. So I think we should talk about maybe the motivations behind some of this and then what the new world could possibly look like.</p>
</details>

嗯，我们确实请到了最完美的嘉宾，一位我们曾邀请过的、总是在杰克逊霍尔与我们见面的老朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we literally have the perfect guest, someone we've had on the someone who we always catch up with in Jackson Hall.</p>
</details>

这正在成为一种传统。这是一种传统，他确实是最完美的嘉宾，因为他曾是英格兰银行货币政策委员会的成员。所以他拥有所有货币政策方面的资历。他目前是**彼得森国际经济研究所**（Peterson Institute for International Economics: 一家位于华盛顿特区的非营利性、无党派国际经济政策智库）的所长，并且是最近发表在《外交事务》杂志上的一篇文章《新地理：后美国世界中谁获利》的作者。他不是那种会回避重大问题的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's becoming a tradition. It's a tradition and he's literally the perfect guest because he used to be on the monetary policy committee at the Bank of England. So he has all the uh monetary policy bonafides. He is currently the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and he is the author of a recent article the new geography who profits in a postamerican world that was in foreign affairs and he's not one to like sort of dance around big issues.</p>
</details>

他说话直截了当。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He doesn't mince his words.</p>
</details>

是的。所以当我说他是讨论这个问题的完美嘉宾时，就是说：“好吧，如果我们和亚当·波森谈谈，我们就可以真正地谈论所有这些可能让许多人感到焦虑的问题。”所以亚当，非常感谢你再次来到OddLots。很高兴再次在杰克逊霍尔见到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So this is when I say perfect guest to talk about this. Someone that was like, "Okay, if we talk to Adam Posen, we can actually really like talk about all these things that maybe many people are anxious to talk about." So Adam, thank you so much for coming back on OddLots. Great to see you again here at Jackson Hall.</p>
</details>

谢谢你们再次邀请我，恭喜特蕾西和乔，OddLots的影响力越来越高。这很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for having me back and congratulations Tracy and Joe on the upwards profile of OddLots ever higher. So it's very cool.</p>
</details>

你这么说真是太好了。我们说这里的气氛有点超现实，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very kind of you to say. Are we right that there is a certain surality to the vibes here right now?</p>
</details>

是的，确实如此。正如你所说，鲍威尔主席的演讲有很多刻意聚焦的地方，而且联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的成员和所有人都非常克制，尽管对美联储的攻击以及政府文件被武器化以攻击个别美联储成员等事件正在发生。我认为特蕾西说得完全正确，我们没有提前排练，但这一切都属于更广泛的背景：你是否能锚定通胀预期？你是否对美元有信心？你是否对美国的信誉有信心？你是否对美国的对外政策有信心？这些都是美联储官员不应该谈论的事情，除了通胀预期。即使是通胀预期，他们也 reluctant 谈论，因为它可能会自我实现。如果他们谈论担忧，那么它就会开始瓦解。但公平地说，也因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it is. As you said, there was a lot of deliberate focusing down of chair pal speech and there's been a lot of self-discipline of members of the FOMC and everybody to be quite restrained uh at a time when the attacks on the Fed and the weaponization of government files to attack individual Fed members and so on is going on. I think Tracy's absolutely right and we didn't script this in advance but it is all part of this broader context of do you keep inflation expectations anchored do you have faith in the dollar do you have faith in the credit of the US do you have faith in US foreign policy and those are all things which Fed officials are not supposed to talk about with the exception of the inflation expectations and on the inflation expectations even there they're reluctant to talk about it because it can becomes self-fulfilling. If they talk about worrying about it, then it starts to unravel. But also, to be fair, because the</p>
</details>

通胀迅速下降的表面信息，我们前两次在杰克逊霍尔见面时也讨论过，即2022年期间，通胀下降是由于长期通胀预期被锚定。至少这是一种观点。但乔，这确实很超现实。我的意思是，我曾与委员会的几位成员交谈过，他们正努力过自己的生活，这很难。但我也想强调，这与他们在华盛顿财政部、环保局或劳工统计局的同事并没有太大不同，他们也受到了攻击。所以，我们之前做过一期节目讨论这个问题，但我很想听听你的看法：当中央银行的信誉开始受到攻击时，或者即使在财政方面，你看到政客们更多地干预货币政策时，即使这种干预只是一条Truth Social帖子之类的，到底会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">seeming message of the rapid come down in inflation that we talked about our last two times we were together in Jackson Hall over 2022 was due to having anchored long-term inflation expectations. At least that's one argument. But it is surreal, Joe. I mean, I I've gotten to talk to several of the members of the committee and they are trying to get on with their lives and um it's hard. But I also just want to emphasize it's not that different than their colleagues in Washington at the Treasury or at EPA or at the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they also are under attack. So, we've done an episode on this before, but I would love to get your take. What exactly happens to central banks when their credibility starts to come under attack or even when maybe on the fiscal side you see politicians interfere a little bit more with monetary policy even if that interference is just a truth social post or something like that?</p>
</details>

是的，特蕾西，我认为重点应该放在你所说的后半部分。当民选官员在任何权力斗争中都优于中央银行时，当财政政策，如果它真的失控，就会产生所谓的**财政主导**（Fiscal Dominance: 指政府的财政政策对货币政策产生压倒性影响，迫使央行配合财政扩张）效应，能够压倒任何货币政策。当中央银行的背景发生变化时，就不再是中央银行本身的信誉问题了。而是中央银行是否被允许实现其应实现的目标的信誉问题。我这样说并不是为中央银行找借口。在20世纪70年代**亚瑟·伯恩斯**（Arthur Burns: 曾任美联储主席）时期，确实存在中央银行自身受到损害而未能履行职责的情况。但我认为应该这样看待这个问题。你会在我们已经在美国看到的地方看到它，那就是长期政府债券的风险溢价略有上升，你会看到货币走弱。你知道，我认为其中一些可以与更广泛的，抱歉我总回到这个话题，但与更广泛的特朗普经济议程联系起来。正如你们两位所说，这是一场真正的制度变革，但我们已经看到了。所以在这篇我发表的《外交事务》文章《新经济地理》中有一张图表。再次感谢。它以一种简单的方式呈现了许多经济学家和学者已经做过的更复杂版本，即美元的相关性已经逆转了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think Tracy the emphasis is should be on the latter part of what you said. When elected officials who are superior to central banks in any power struggle, when fiscal policy, which if it gets really out of whack, has what's called dominance, fiscal dominance, can overpower whatever monetary policy is. When the context for central banking changes, then it's not so much necessarily the credibility of the central bank per se. It's the credibility of the central bank will be allowed to deliver what it's supposed to deliver. And I'm not saying that to make excuses for the central bank. There are instances like Arthur Burns in the 70s where the central bank itself is compromised and fails to deliver. But I think that's the way to see it. And where you see it is where we're already seeing it in the US, which is you see it in a slightly higher risk premium on long-term government bonds. You see it in weakening of the currency. And you know, some of this I think can be tied to the broader, again, I'm sorry to keep coming back to that, but to the broader Trump economic agenda. As both of you said, it is a real regime change, but we're seeing it already. And so there's a chart in this foreign affairs article, the new economic geography I put out. Thank you again. That does a simple version of something a lot of economists, academics have done, more sophisticated versions, which is basically the correlations on the dollar have reversed,</p>
</details>

对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

除了2008年和70年代末80年代初的几次中断，美元一直具有这样的特质：当它陷入困境时，会有更多的资金流入。即使美国在全球制造问题，人们仍然相信待在美国比其他地方更安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That with a couple interruptions in 2008, in the late '7s, early 80s, the dollar has the quality that when it gets into trouble, more money flows into it. And even if the US is causing a problem in the world, people believe they're safer in the US than</p>
</details>

2008年就是最好的例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2008 was the ultimate example.</p>
</details>

2008年就是最好的例子。美元向下调整。但基本上，国债利率和美元同步变动，这换句话说就是他们不需要提高利率来捍卫美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2008 was the ultimate example. Dollar adjust down. But basically, Treasury bond rates and dollar move in lock step, which is another way of saying they don't have to put up the rates to defend the dollar.</p>
</details>

这也意味着美元日常的大部分波动仅仅是宏观新闻，仅仅是日常新闻。简单来说，在今年4月1日之前，美元和10年期国债利率之间的日内数据存在非常强的正相关性。今年4月1日，这种相关性从正0.8变为负0.4。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it also means that most of the movement in the dollar daytoday is just macro news, just day-to-day news. And so putting it simple-mindedly, there's a correlation very strongly positive in intraday intrae data between the dollar and the 10-year Treasury rate until April 1. April 1 of this year that correlation shifts from plus 0.8 to minus0.4.</p>
</details>

它逆转了方向。当美国发生一些奇怪的事情时，比如我们单方面决定轰炸伊朗，比如我们通过一项财政不负责任的“大而美”的法案，比如当总统恶毒攻击鲍威尔时。天哪，利率上升，美元下跌。这看起来就像一个新兴市场。总之，这不仅仅是数据挖掘。你可以用非常复杂的计量经济学方法来做，你会得到相同的结果。美元的安全相关性已经逆转，这将是你所说的迹象，特蕾西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It reverses sign. And what happens is when something screwy happens in the US, like we decide unilaterally to bomb Iran, like when we do crazy stuff on one big beautiful bill that's fiscally irresponsible, like when Powell is attacked in vicious terms by the president. Gee, interest rates go up, dollar goes down. That looks like an emerging market. Anyway, this is this is not just a data mining. You can do it in very fancy econometric ways. You get the same result. the correlation of safety on the dollar has reversed and that would be a sign of what you're talking about Tracy.</p>
</details>

我们的朋友**卡里克·桑卡兰**（Carrick Sankaran: 一位经济学家，常在播客中讨论新兴市场）曾在播客中提到，新兴市场的定义就是如果你的长期利率在经济衰退时上升，对吗？因为你知道，在美国历史上，在危机时期，你会想：“哦，美国情况真的很糟糕。我要把钱投入美元和国债。”你说的就是这种反射机制这次没有完全启动，因为我们有四个月半非常清晰的数据。它正在朝着另一个方向发展。特朗普政府正在做的很多事情都会强化这一点，因为他们曾谈到对外国投资者征税的方式与国内投资者不同。他们曾谈到惩罚那些试图抛售美元的人。被提名为美联储理事的**史蒂文·莫兰**（Steven Moran: 被提名担任美联储理事的官员）曾谈到**海湖庄园协议**（Mara Lago Accord: 指特朗普政府可能通过与特定国家或实体达成协议，以影响美元汇率或国际贸易关系）并重新压低美元。这确实有理由以这种方式表现。现在请你谈谈你的《外交事务》文章，比如这种全球重组的理念以及谁从中获利，因为你也谈到了美国是全球最后贷款人（或保险人）的理念，但请你详细谈谈这篇文章的主旨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our friend Carrick Sankeran who's been on the podcast always talks about sort of the definition of an emerging market is if your rates at the long end go up in the recession, right? Because you know in times of crisis in the US historically you're like oh things are really bad in the US. I'm going to pile into dollars at treasuries. This is what you're talking about which is that that reflex has not kicked in exactly this time since we've got four and a half months of very clear data. it's going the other way. A lot of the things the Trump administration is doing are going to reinforce that because they've talked about taxing foreign investors differently in the US than domestic investors. They've talked about punishing people who try to switch out of the dollar. Steven Moran, who's been nominated to be Federal Reserve Board Governor, you know, has talked about a Mara Lago accord and re putting the dollar down. There's real reason for it to behave this way. Now talk to us about like your your foreign affairs piece like the sort of you know this idea of like the restructuring of the global and who profits from it because you also talk about this idea of like the US is like sort of the global insurer of last resort but talk to us a little bit about what this whole piece was about.</p>

### 美国作为全球保险提供者的角色及其面临的挑战

谢谢乔，这回到了特蕾西一开始说的，关于你认为通过这种世界变革能实现什么。所以我想论证的是，特朗普政府认为世界经济正在把美国当傻瓜，因此采取了非常严厉、直接的双边措施，从关税开始，还有其他威胁、投资要求、对社交媒体的军事打击要求，所有这些，以及威胁在乌克兰等情况下扣留军事援助，认为这将是一种再平衡，将从这些国家获得更多资金流入美国，从而改善我们的财政状况，使其更公平，并以某种方式为美国经济带来巨大的好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you Joe and and this goes to what Tracy was saying at the start about how what you think you're achieving with this world change. So what I'm trying to argue is that the Trump administration decided that the world economy is playing the US for a sucker and that very harsh direct bilateral measures starting with tariffs but also with other threats, demands for investment, demands for military assaults on social media, all these things, threats to withhold military assistance in the case of Ukraine and others that this will be a rebalancing that this will get more money from these countries into the US and thereby make our fiscal situation better, be fairer and somehow do great things for the US economy.</p>
</details>

这在各个层面都是错误的。但回到保险提供者这个根本点，我建立了一个心智模型，而不是数学模型，但这个心智模型我认为大多数人都觉得非常恰当：自二战以来的80年里，美国在世界经济中的主要角色一直是保险提供者。我们确保你可以安全地通过不同海洋运输货物。基本上，对财产权、知识产权都有尊重。有一些标准，特别是技术标准，一些品牌。有一个美元，你可以自由进出，也可以把钱停泊其中。而且市场和国债足够深入，你可以自由进出，没有人会关心，也不会影响价格。美元和国债的稳定性让你能够做到这一点。还有一系列其他事情。当然，还有军事和联盟，显然是为了北约盟友、日本、韩国等。我们为此收取了保费。我们确实获得了保费。我们的利率要低得多。人们会把大量资金投入美国政府债务，这使得整个经济运行得更好。我们基本上得到了所有这些国家的服从，以及军事联盟，他们大部分都会执行制裁。如果我们想实施制裁，他们就会在冲绳的林明空军基地接受我们的军队并支持他们，让他们驻扎在自己的国家。让我们的军队前置并做所有这些事情。在经济方面，它给了我们不成比例的份额，不仅是国债中的稳定投资，还有像我们的技术标准、法律事务标准、我们的金融体系都是默认的。总之，这带来了很多好处，对他们有很多好处，对我们也有很多好处。这是一项好生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is wrong on every level. But the fundamental point going to the insurer is I build a mental model, not a mathematical model, but a mental model that I think most people have found quite apt that for the last 80 years since World War II, the US's main role in the world economy has been to be the insurance provider. We made sure that you could ship things through with through different oceans and get there safely. That there was basically respect for property rights, respect for intellectual property rights. There were some standards, particularly technical standards, some brands. There was a dollar that you could get in and out of and park money in. And it was deep enough markets and treasuries that you could get in and out that nobody cared and it didn't affect prices. There was stability to US currency into the treasuries that let you do that. Just a whole host of things. Plus military and alliance as well, obviously for NATO allies, for Japan, for Korea and others. And we charged premiums for that. We did get premiums. We had much lower interest rates. People would put a lot of money into US government debt and that made the whole economy go off better. We had basically obedience from all these countries and military alliances that they would do sanctions for the most part. If we wanted to do sanctions, they would in Okinawa in in Rinmine Air Base, they would take our troops and support them and have them garrisoned in their country. to have our troops forward and doing this whole host of things. And on the economic front, it gave us disproportionate shares not just of the stable investment in treasuries, but things like our standards for technology, our standards for legal matters, our our financial system were the default. Anyways, this had lots of benefits, lots of benefits for them, lots of benefits for us. It was a good business.</p>

本质上，发生的情况是，你有一栋在马里布的海滨别墅，你已经投保了，而且如果没投保你也不会建造这栋别墅。很好。你支付保费，你得到了回报。现在全球变暖了，飓风更可能发生，海滩正在被侵蚀。你准备为你的保险支付更多费用。但相反，你发现你的保险公司决定：“不，我们要拒绝你的索赔，或者你必须私下塞点钱才能调整你的索赔。不，我们要把你的保费提高三倍，如果你不喜欢，我们就会离开这个州，你将不再有保险。”这就是特朗普政府正在做的事情。

<p class="english-text">Essentially, what's happened is you have a beach house in Malibu which you had insured and you weren't going to build the beach house unless it was insured. Fine. You're paying insurance. You're getting something for it. Now there's global warming. Hurricanes are more likely. There's erosion in the beach. You're prepared to pay a bit more for your insurance. But instead, you find your insurer has decided, "Nope, we're going to deny your claims or you have to slip something under the table to get your claim adjusted. Nope, we're tripling your premium and if you don't like it, we're going to leave the state and you're not going to have insurance anymore. That's what the Trump administration is doing.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，保险的作用也像经济发展的保护伞，对吗？因为如果你在马里布的海滩上有了保险，其他人就可以建造房屋，你可以开商店等等，也许你的房价开始上涨，你从中受益。所以，这是一个有点不公平的问题，因为我要请你代入别人的想法，但特朗普政府在这里的论点到底是什么，为什么他们认为自己正在当前的国际经济或金融秩序中失利？这个秩序似乎很大程度上是由美国建立的，正如你所指出的，它给美国带来了许多有形和无形的好处。嗯，这是我和彼得森研究所的同事们多年来一直在努力解决的问题。不只是特朗普。民主党方面也有人持这种观点。所以，在同一期《外交事务》杂志上，你认识的、曾在拜登政府担任财政部副部长的**沃利·阿德耶莫**（Wally Adeyemo: 曾任美国财政部副部长）也发表了一篇文章，题为《是的，贸易体系被打破了》。在拜登总统任期内，美国贸易代表发表了一次演讲，其中她说她基本上同意她的前任**罗伯特·莱特希泽**（Robert Lighthizer: 曾任美国贸易代表）在特朗普政府期间所说的一切。所以，这个问题已经存在很长时间了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the role of insurance also acts as a sort of like umbrella for economic development, right? Because if you have insurance on the beach in Malibu, other people can build houses and you can have shops and things and maybe your house price starts to rise and you benefit from that. So, this is a slightly unfair question because I'm going to ask you to channel someone else's thinking, but what exactly is the argument from the Trump administration here as to why they are losing out from the current international economic or financial order which very much seems to have been built by the US and as you pointed out has a lot of tangible and intangible benefits for America. Well, this is something I and colleagues of the Peterson Institute have been struggling against for several years now. Uh, not just Trump. There are people on the Democratic side who've had this view as well. So, in the same issue of foreign affairs, Wally Adamo, who you know, who was deputy treasury secretary in the Biden administration, has an article, yes, the trade system was broken. During the Biden presidency, the US trade representative gave a speech in which she said she basically agreed with everything her predecessor, Robert Lighheiser, had said during the Trump adation. So, this has been out there a long time.</p>

我知道你希望我回答一个问题，但我不会试图将其合理化。我认为有三四件事情正在发生。首先是，人们过度认为中国不公平，更重要的是，中国在不公平的情况下逍遥法外，并且因为我们在经济方面所做的事情而变得危险。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I know you want me to answer a question, but I'm I'm not going to try to rationalize it. I think there are three or four things going on. One is there is an excessive sense that China has been unfair, but even more so that China got away with being unfair and is dangerous because of things we did on the economic side.</p>
</details>

我认为这并不合理。我并不是对**中国共产党**（Chinese Communist Party）有什么好感。我曾公开称**习近平**（Xi Jinping）为独裁者，但这就像**汤姆·布雷迪**（Tom Brady: 美国橄榄球运动员）和**比尔·贝利奇克**（Bill Belichick: 美国橄榄球教练）赢得超级碗并不是因为他们耍了小聪明一样。中国之所以成为今天的中国，也不是因为它这里那里耍了点小聪明。第二点是，存在一个合理的担忧，拜登政府关心这个问题，特朗普政府也声称关心但似乎并不真正关心，那就是如果我们过度依赖单一集中来源获取像台湾的半导体这样的东西，那就会给我们带来国家安全风险。这会给我们带来经济风险。我之所以说特朗普政府似乎并不真正关心这一点，是因为完全集中在美国一个地方也毫无益处，因为那样你仍然会受到自然灾害、恐怖主义、政治问题、腐败的影响。你可以关心这个问题，并说我们必须确保其多样化。

<p class="english-text">And I don't think this is justified. Not that I have any love for the Chinese Communist Party. I'm on record calling she an autocrat, but just that Tom Brady and Bill Bich didn't win Super Bowls because they cheated in a little ways. China did not become China because it cheated a little bit here and there. The second thing is there was a legitimate concern which the Biden people cared about and the Trump people say they care about but don't seem to care about that if we're too dependent on concentrated single sources for things like the semiconductors in Taiwan that puts us at a national security risk. That puts us at an economic risk. The reason I say the Trump people don't seem to genuinely care about that is because being totally concentrated in the US in one spot isn't any good either because then you're subject still to natural disasters, to terrorism, to political problems, to corruption. You can care about this and say we got to make sure it's diversified.</p>

第三件正在发生的事情是，受所谓的“中国冲击”文献的影响，人们普遍认为美国制造业受到了严重破坏，导致美国某些小城市和城镇遭受重创。

<p class="english-text">Third thing that's going on is there's a perception fed by the so-called China shock literature that US manufacturing was devastated and this led to particular small cities and towns in the US being devastated.</p>

这些文献存在很多夸大和问题，与现实不符，包括大多数被提及存在问题的地区在20世纪70年代就已经存在问题，而且像匹兹堡和北卡罗来纳州罗利这样的地方有很多都恢复了。但无论如何，存在这种感觉，我想你曾邀请我的同事**罗伯特·劳伦斯**（Robert Lawrence: 彼得森研究所和哈佛大学的经济学家）来谈论制造业战略的局限性。最后，这是我自己的解读。当我这么说的时候，人们会生我的气。我认为有很多被转移的愤怒。我认为有些人相对特权。他们不一定富有，但在旧社会中，在美国社会过去的样子中，他们相对特权，却被变革和……

<p class="english-text">There's a lot of exaggerations and problems with this literature and it doesn't square well with the reality including the reality that most of the places that are cited as having had problems had problems in the 70s and that there's plenty of places like Pittsburgh and Raleigh, North Carolina that got back. But anyway, there's that sense and I think you've had on my colleague Robert Lawrence from Peterson and Harvard who talks about the limits of a manufacturing strategy. And then finally, and this is my own interpretation. People get mad at me when I say this. I think there's a lot of displaced anger. I think there are people who were relatively privileged. They weren't necessarily rich, but relatively privileged in older society in the way the US society used to be that have been disrupted and offended by change and by</p>

朝着平等的方向发展的力量所冒犯。我还认为有一群人，他们对2008年金融危机后、对疫情处理不当的看法后、对20年来伊拉克和阿富汗入侵及占领却一无所获后，对精英阶层感到非常愤怒和失望。所以有很多愤怒，这些愤怒被归咎于那些被诋毁的、与全球主义者联系在一起的精英，对吗？但我认为这种愤怒没有找对地方。我并不是想摆出高高在上的姿态。我的意思是，我们在美国历史和其他历史中都看到过这种情况。你知道，人们会煽动对移民的愤怒，或者煽动对美洲原住民、有色人种、难民或50年代政府中虚构的共产主义者的愤怒，因为他们对其他事情感到愤怒或害怕，但却归咎于此。所以，我认为这就是它的来源。但我只想强调你一开始说的话，这也是我文章试图说明的观点的一部分，那就是美国通过运行这个系统获得了非常清晰的好处清单，并且拥有一个良好的商业模式，提供保险是一个有利可图的商业模式。就像你说的，如果你为某些人提供保险，那就能让商业扩张，也能让其他人搭便车，而他们搭便车是件好事，因为那样你就能获得更多的商业、更多的税收、更多的生计和更富裕的人民。此外，有一个地方这个类比失效了，这对美国来说甚至更有利，因为你知道，如果你是**丘博**（Chubb）、**利宝互助**（Liberty Mutual）或**好事达保险**（State Farm Insurance）这样的保险公司，你对风险的程度并没有太大影响，无论你提供多少保险。但如果你是美国，你说：“我将保证你的安全”，你实际上确实减少了存在的风险。这意味着你收取相同的保费，但支付的赔款更少。

<p class="english-text">forces towards equality. I also think there's a bunch of people who are understandably very angry and disappointed with elites after the 2008 financial crisis after co been perceptions of mishandling after the Iraq Afghanistan invasions and occupations for 20 years that didn't produce anything. So there's a lot of anger that's discredited that of discredited elites who are associated with being globalists, right? But I don't think that anger is well placed. And and I'm not trying to be patronizing. I mean, we've seen this in the US history and other history. you know, people will stir up anger against immigrants or stir up anger against Native Americans or people of color or refugees or com mythical communists in the government in the 50s because they're angry about something else or they're scared of something else, but it gets blamed on that. So, that's where I think it comes from. But I just want to emphasize what you've said at the start and that's part of the point my article is trying to make is there's a very clear list of benefits the US had by running the system and by had a good business model was a profitable business model providing insurance and like you said if you're providing insurance for some people that lets commerce expand and it lets other people free ride and that's a good thing that they free ride and because then then you get more commerce and more taxes and more livelihood and better off people. And additionally, one thing where the analogy breaks down, it's even more favorable for the US because, you know, if you're Chub or Liberty Mutual or or State Farm Insurance, you don't really have a big effect on the extent of risks out there by how much insurance you give. But if you're the US and you say, "I'm going to guarantee your security," you actually do reduce the risks that are out there. And that means you're collecting the same premiums and paying out less</p>
</details>

冒着把保险类比引申过头的风险，我的意思是，确实有保险公司撤出佛罗里达等地区，因为他们说为这些地区投保不再经济，风险太高，重建成本太高。这里有没有可能提出这样的论点：特朗普政府可能正在环顾世界，说：“嗯，现在比以前风险更高了，我们不想承担扑灭无数火灾的责任。”我认为在国家安全领域，更狭义地定义，可以提出这样的论点：美国可能过度扩张了，或者需要优先考虑，并且有一些外交政策思想家正在讨论这个问题。我仍然认为这不太对，因为实际上威慑和保护就像你之前说的，有一种保护伞效应。但假设国家安全部分你可以放在一边，说有一个论点可以讨论。其余部分则毫无意义，因为你正在放弃美元的强势和较低的利率。你正在放弃与你在世界上的规模不成比例的外国直接投资。你正在放弃与你在世界上的规模不成比例的、对技术标准的影响力、对你品牌的喜爱、你服务的传播。你正在放弃对其他人口不成比例的影响力。再说一次，这就像看看来这里的外国学生，我知道你在一些节目中也谈到过，除非你能拿出一些绝对虚构的数字，说他们中有多少人不仅是中国间谍，而且成功地做到了，未被发现，并且获取了他们通过网络攻击和其他方式不可能获得的信息。除非你能拿出这样一个绝对荒谬的数字，否则所有好处都来自于我们这里有外国学生。而这也可以用来形容经济方面的所有这些事情。

<p class="english-text">at the risk of uh carrying the insurance analogy too far. I mean, it is true that we have insurers pulling out of areas like Florida because they say it's no longer economic to insure these areas. It's just too risky. It's going to cost too much to rebuild. Is there a case to be made at all here that maybe maybe the Trump administration is looking around the world and saying, "Well, it's riskier now than it was before and we don't want to be on the hook to put out a billion fires." I think there is a case to be made in the national security sphere more narrowly defined that the US may have overextended or needs to prioritize and there is a set of foreign policy thinkers out there talking about this issue. I still don't think that's quite right because actually deterrence and protection kind of like you said before there's an umbrella effect. But let's say that the national security part you can set aside and say there is an argument to be had. The rest of it doesn't make any sense because you're giving up strength of the dollar and lower interest rates. You're giving up disproportionate compared to your size in the world foreign direct investment. You're giving up disproportionate compared to your size in the world, influence over technical standards, love for your brands, spread of your services. You're giving up disproportionate amounts of influence on other populations. Again, it's just like looking at foreign students coming here, which I know you've talked about on some of your episodes, that unless you come up with some absolutely mythical number of how many of them are not only spies for the Chinese, but successfully pull it off, are undetected, and take the Chinese information that they couldn't possibly have gotten through cyber attacks and other means. Unless you come up with an absolutely absurd number like that, all the benefits come to us from having foreign students here. And that's what's can be said about all these things on the economic side.</p>

And if you're just thinking about like okay we provide this insurance role in some ways very literally say with our navy through various straits around the world and setting aside whether China cheated or not.

### 关税的负面影响与滞胀风险

不。抱歉，你还想听更多吗？我的意思是，关税的本质是一种税，一种对税基狭窄部分征收的扭曲性税收，它会产生不良的分配效应。它们是累退的。它们主要伤害企业方面的小企业，或者伤害家庭方面的低收入人群，而且它们往往会导致腐败，即使不是字面意义上的贿赂，也会导致扭曲，比如苹果公司带着一部金色手机出现在总统办公室，然后你知道，他们就获得了关税豁免，你知道，它往往会导致类似这样的事情，而大多数事情都不会。关税只对两件事有好处：如果有一个非常具体的行业和一个非常具体的谈判情况，而不是同时针对整个世界，而是针对一个你可以与之谈判，并且可以让人加入你的关税行列的特定国家，这样它就有效地成为一种经济制裁形式，这可以奏效。另一件事是，如果你是一个没有国家能力的欠发达国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Sorry. You want more? Um, I mean, look, again, because of the nature of tariffs, which are a tax, which are a distortion tax on a narrow part of the tax base that has bad distributional effects. They're regressive. They primarily either hurt small business on the corporate side or they hurt lower income people on the household side and they tend to lead to corruption even if not literal bribes but distortions of hey Apple showed up in the president's office with a gold phone and what do you know they got an exception to the tariff you know it tend to lead to stuff like that in a way that most things do tariffs are good for two things right if there is a very specific specific industry and a very specific bargaining situation not against the whole world in general all at the same time one specific country with whom you can bargain and you can get other people to join you in the tariffs so it's effectively a form of economic sanction that can work the other thing is if you are an underdeveloped country with no state capacity</p>
</details>

就像1820年的美国，或者今天的一些南亚、撒哈拉以南非洲和中美洲国家，即使在那里，关税也不是很多，它是一种收取必要收入的方式，因为你可以在边境设置警卫，确保有人收钱，而其他侵扰性较小、累退性较低、效率更高的税收形式，如果你没有良好的国家能力，就更难征收。这些是关税仅有的两种用途。

<p class="english-text">like the US in 1820 or a number of South Asian and subsaran African and Central American countries today even there not that many tariffs are a way to collect necessary revenues because you can literally set up guards at the border and make sure somebody gets the money whereas other more less intrusive less regressive more efficient forms of taxation are harder to collect if you don't have a good state capacity those are the only two things tariffs are</p>

这是一个很好的观点，因为你知道，你会看到人们说：“哦，在过去的好日子里，关税是黄金管理。”嗯，那时我们没有W2表格之类的东西。所以，是的，当然，你只需要在港口做就行了。让我们回到，好吧，撇开关税的结构性问题和不良分配效应等等不谈。就像现在，2025年8月，我们看看美国经济的状况，人们会如何看待关税与现在正在发生的一切的相互作用？

这是一个公平的问题。我们彼得森研究所做了很多工作，我的同事们也发表了文章，其他人也做了略有不同的工作，我们大致都得出了相同的结论。特朗普政府目前实施的关税政策，就短期经济前景而言，它是一种增税。它具有**滞胀**（Stagflation: 经济停滞与通货膨胀并存的现象）效应，这意味着它在减缓增长的同时推高通胀。它每年以2000亿至2500亿美元的年化速度收取大量收入，税率非常高。随着时间的推移，这可能会减少，因为人们会规避这种税收，人们会选择在其他地方生产，人们会逃税。但就目前而言，这是一次显著的增税，如果通过更有效的方式进行会更好。它对制造业也毫无帮助，因为它净效应是，虽然某些行业得到了帮助，正如我知道你们在供应链故事中报道过的那样，有很多小企业甚至大企业。

<p class="english-text">It's a fair question. We've done a lot of work at the Peterson Institute, colleagues of mine that we've published and others have done slightly different work and we all come out roughly the same place. This is the way the Trump administration is doing it in terms of the short-term economic outlook is it's a tax hike. It's stagflationary, meaning it's raising inflation at the same time as slowing growth. It's collecting a sizable chunk of revenue on the order of 2002 250 billion a year at an annual rate at this very high level of taxes. That will probably diminish over time because people get around that kind of tax and people choose to produce things elsewhere and people evade it. But for the moment, it's a significant tax increase that would have been better done through more efficient means. It also is going to do nothing for manufacturing because what it does on net is well there are certain industries that are being helped as I know you've covered in your supply chain stories you know there are a lot of small businesses or even big businesses</p>

There aren't American workers who want to be sitting there screwing screws into the back of iPhones. I don't mean to keep picking on Apple, but it's just it's a it's a clear example. So, you either have to pay them an incredible amount for that or you have to let somebody else do it. So in the short term, getting back to the monetary policy since we're in Jackson Hole,</p>

我认为我们还没有从关税中看到巨大的通胀并不奇怪，因为有很多主流人士像我们一样预期的事情。人们会否认关税是否会持续以及规模会有多大。企业需要时间来弄清楚是否能找到替代来源，以及这个替代来源是否是国内的。如果你把它转移到越南，那真的能让你摆脱关税吗？你是否有良好的关系？我的意思是，正如你详细讨论过的，这些供应链是自然形成的，而不是自上而下的。某人做了一个决定。所以，如果你签署了关税，需要时间来重新调整供应链。第三，有很多公司被特朗普总统点名，比如通用汽车或沃尔玛，它们被告知“不要因为关税而涨价”。所以，它们当然会尽可能地拖延。然后最终，当所有人都差不多同时涨价时，它们也会涨价。最后，很多这些公司和很多消费品公司都有库存，它们在第一季度建立了进口商品的库存。它们不会在关税成本转嫁之前涨价，直到库存耗尽。

People were going to have to take time to figure out if you're a business whether you can find a substitute source, whether that substitute source is domestic. If you move it to Vietnam, does that really get you out of the tariffs? Do you have a good relationship? I mean, it takes, as you've discussed in detail, these supply chains emerge organically and they're not top down. Somebody makes one decision. So, it takes time to re reformulate the supply chains if you're signing the tariffs. Third, you've got a bunch of companies that were called out by name by President Trump, like GM or Walmart, that were told, "Don't raise prices because of the tariffs." And so, of course, they're going to hold off as long as they can. And then eventually, when everybody's raising prices at ex roughly the same time, they'll raise prices. And then finally, a lot of these companies and a lot of the consumer goods companies had inventories and they built up inventories in the first quarter of imported goods. and they weren't going to raise the prices until passed through the tariff costs until they got burnt through the inventories. So you had four very solid reasons why it would take at least a few months for the tariffs to really start showing up in prices. So if I'm sitting at the Fed right now,</p>

然后是理事沃勒提出的讨论，主席今天在演讲中也谈到了，那就是你认为这会转化为多少第二轮通胀效应，这种通胀会持续多久。这是一个有趣的辩论，也是一个可以真诚进行的辩论。但关税通胀正在到来。

<p class="english-text">and then the discussion which Governor Wallers put out there which the chair talked about today talked about in the speech is how much do you think this translates into a second round inflation effects how persistent is this inflation. And that's the interesting debate and that's a good faith debate you can have. But the tariff inflation is coming.</p>

</details>

好吧，我将接受你关于辩论的挑逗，但你对二阶效应辩论持何种立场？因为你可以为任何一方提出令人信服的论点。你可以说，关税是攻击，因此它们会摧毁需求，并可能导致通货紧缩。或者你可以争辩说，关税或许给了公司一个集体涨价的借口，这样你就无法获得通常会抑制价格的竞争活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I'm going to take you up on the debate tease, but where do you fall on the side of uh the second order effects debate? Because you can make it feels a convincing argument for either side. You could say that, well, tariffs are attacks and so they destroy demand and maybe lead to deflation. Or you could argue that tariffs perhaps give companies an excuse to all start raising their prices together and so you don't get that competitive activity that would normally keep prices in check.</p>
</details>

我认为双方都可以进行一场合理而严肃的辩论，但我认为论据非常清楚地表明，第二轮效应将是巨大且持久的。有几个原因，这就是为什么我认为这很清楚。第一个原因是，我们从特朗普政府时期、拜登政府时期以及其他国家最近的关税经验中得知，如果最终购买进口投入的公司或购买它的家庭，关税转嫁给最终购买者的比例通常是关税的85%到90%。从数据来看，外国公司没有为此支付任何费用，这一点已经非常清楚。所以问题是进口商承担了多少，又转嫁了多少，这需要一点时间才能弄清楚，但通常这是一个非常可靠的结果。所以即使你得到的比这少，平均得到65%到70%，那仍然很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you can make a plausible serious debate on both sides, but I think the arguments are very clearly on the side that the second round effects are going to be large and persistent. There's several reasons which is why I think it's pretty clear. The first one is we know from what happened with the tariffs under Trump one under Biden from other countries in recent times that the pass through what generally you end up being if you're the company that ultimately buys the imported input or the household that buys it the pass through the final purchaser is usually 85 to 90% of the tariff. It's already very clear from the data that the foreign companies are not paying for any of this. So the question is how much are the importers eating it versus passing it on and it takes a little time for you to get to that but generally it's a very robust result. So even if you get less than that you get 65 70% on average that's still a lot.</p>
</details>

第二点是隐含在你所说的内容中，有时也是持不同观点的人所说的，即需求破坏要么与价格上涨对称，要么大于价格上涨，但没有特别好的理由假设会是这样。所以你必须看看实际发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second is implicit in what you said and then sometimes in things uh some of the people on the other side of this argument say is essentially the demand destruction is either symmetric to the price increase or is larger than the price increase and there's no particularly good reason to assume that. So you have to look at what actually is going on.</p>
</details>

我们有一个相当强劲的经济，非常接近充分就业。我们即将面临更多滞胀式的损害，尽管尚未显现。这对我来说是一个巨大的惊喜，但我们即将面临更多滞胀式的损害，这来自于移民限制、驱逐出境、劳动力增长的突然停止。这将在短期内赋予美国工人更大的议价能力。这将造成劳动力短缺，从而对工资产生上行压力。这将降低生产力以及产能。因此，总的来说，你可能会从移民限制和关税上涨中获得一些衰退性力量，但我强烈怀疑它们是否会超过通胀冲动，即价格设定和价格上涨的空间，抱歉，以及工资上涨的空间。第三，回到你一开始说的其中一点，锚定通胀预期是关键。这最终是允许中央银行说的，正如**伯南克**（Ben Bernanke: 曾任美联储主席）、**劳巴赫**（Thomas Laubach: 经济学家，曾任美联储高级顾问）和**米什金**（Frederic Mishkin: 经济学家，曾任美联储理事）以及我在25年前的通胀目标制一书中论证的，如果供应冲击是什么很清楚，并且你已经锚定了预期，那么你可以忽视第一轮供应冲击的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a pretty robust economy pretty close to full employment. We are about to get, though it hasn't shown up yet. This to me is the big surprise, but we're about to get more damage in a stagflationary way from migration restrictions, deportations, sudden stop of growth in the labor force. That's going to give American workers more bargaining power in the short term. That's going to create labor shortages, which put upward pressure on wages. That's going to decrease productivity and and capacity. So on balance you may get some recessionary forces out of both that and the tariff increase but I strongly doubt they will outweigh the inflationary impulses that there will be room for price setting price increases excuse me and wage increases. Third, going back to where one of the things you said at the start, anchoring inflation expectations is the game. That ultimately is what allows a central bank to say, as Bernanki, Labbach, Michigan, and I argued 25 years ago in the inflation targeting book, you're allowed to look through the first round effect of supply shocks if it's clear what the supply shock is and you have anchored expectations.</p>
</details>

我认为美联储，无论他们是否承认，都在公开低估2020年至2022年的经历对通胀预期的**去锚定**（De-anchored: 指通胀预期不再稳定地围绕央行目标波动）程度。它没有把我们带到1980年的阿根廷，但任何说它们与2020年之前相同的人，我认为都是在自欺欺人。此外，回到乔所说的这个时代的超现实之处，如果特朗普政府像他们那样，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the Fed, whether they admit it or to themselves or not, is publicly underestimating how much the 2020 to 2022 experience deankored inflation expectations. It didn't take us to Argentina in 1980, but anybody who says that they're the same as they were before 2020, I think is deluding themselves. And then additionally, going back to what Joe was saying about the surreal aspect of this time, if the Trump administration has been, as they have,</p>

以多种方式大力攻击美联储的独立性，并且这表现为美元走弱，那么这就是另一个理由，认为预期不会被锚定，你也不会从货币中获得抵消作用。

对于关税通胀。所以，砰砰砰，这就是我为什么认为论点很清楚，我们会看到比某些人所说的更多的通胀，更持久的通胀，更多的第二轮效应，这有四个原因。我有一个问题。我一直在问很多人这个问题。我对得到的任何答案都不完全满意。所以我要再试一次。即使在关税之前，甚至在特朗普之前，从市场的角度来看，长期利率似乎将比疫情前十年持续更高。为什么？什么改变了？

So bing bing bing, that's four reasons why I think the argument is clear that we're going to get more inflation, more persistence of inflation, more second round effects than some people are saying. I have a question. I've been asking this to a bunch of people. I'm not totally satisfied with any of the answers I've gotten. So I'm going to try again. Even before the tariffs, even before Trump, it appeared that from the perspective of the market that long-term rates were going to be durably higher than they had been in the decade prior to yco.

### 长期利率上升的驱动因素：世俗停滞与人工智能

那么，难道没有一个地方，我正在进行一个合法的真实讨论，而我非常坚定地站在其中一方吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, isn't there a place where I'm there's a legitimate real discussion and I'm very strongly on one side of it.</p>
</details>

好的。所以，我认为有益的讨论，所有功劳都归于**拉里·萨默斯**（Larry Summers: 曾任美国财政部长和国家经济委员会主任），大约在2019年还是2018年，他发表了关于**世俗停滞**（Secular Stagnation: 指长期经济增长缓慢，投资需求不足，导致自然利率持续低迷的现象）的演讲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So I think the useful discussion all credit goes to Larry Summers roughly was it 2019 2018 he gave the speech about secular stagnation</p>
</details>

他复兴了**阿尔文·汉森**（Alvin Hansen: 美国经济学家，世俗停滞理论的提出者）的概念，哦，抱歉，那要早得多。他发表了那次演讲，然后他在2019年发表了演讲，其中他说世俗停滞可能正在结束，他提出了几点，但最重要的一点是，如果你处于一个将持续扩张性财政政策推动需求并弥补需求不足的环境中，那么**R星**（R-star: 经济学中指的自然利率或中性利率，即在充分就业和稳定通胀下的实际利率水平）——中性利率——就会更高，这是非常清楚的经济学。然后他所说的以及我们其他人发展的原因，我认为是正确的，那就是回到保险的比喻，现在的风险更高了，有气候变化，中国无论谁的错，无论是否不可避免，都比以前更具安全威胁，俄罗斯比以前更具侵略性，人们必须在这方面花费更多，我们的社会正在老龄化，至少我们几乎所有大型社会，除了印度，都在老龄化，你必须在医疗保健和社会保障上花费更多，所有这些都将导致政府支出持续增加，无论你做什么，而且它们不太可能像我们已经看到的那样完全通过税收来融资。所以这是一个根本性的问题。我将论证的第二个根本性问题是，我们不知道人工智能何时会发挥作用。我们不知道影响会有多大。我们不知道会影响多少工作岗位。你们再次邀请了很多优秀的嘉宾来谈论这个问题，但我认为我们都可以同意，从现在起2到10年内，生产力增长趋势将有意义地增加。有一些聪明人，比如**阿塞莫格鲁**（Daron Acemoglu: 经济学家，麻省理工学院教授）和**约翰逊**（Simon Johnson: 经济学家，麻省理工学院教授），他们说不会。但我们大多数人认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">reviving the concept from Alvin Hansen and oh sorry that was much earlier he gave that speech then he gave the speech in 2019 in which he said secular stagnation may be ending and he made a number of points but the biggest one was if you're in an environment where you're going to have sustained expansionary fiscal policy pushing up demand and meeting shortfalls of demand then the rstar the neutral interest rate is higher and that's that's pretty clear economics and then the reasons which he said and others of us have developed I think are right that going back to the insurance metaphor the risks are higher now there's climate change China is no matter whose fault it is or whether it was inevitable or not China is more of a security threat than it was Russia is more belligerent than it was people have to spend more on that our societies are aging at least our almost all the large societies with the exception of India are aging and you have to spend more on healthcare and more on social security all of these things are going to lead to sustained increases in government spending irrespective of whatever else you do and they are unlikely as we've already seen to be fully tax financed so that is a fundamental the second fundamental I would argue that's pushing up our star is that we don't know when AI is going to kick in. We don't know how big an effect. We don't know how many jobs. You guys again have had many good guests talking about this, but I think we can all agree that sometime between 2 and 10 years from now there will be a meaningful increase in the productivity growth trend.

某种程度上会有所增加。现在我不需要完全相信麦肯锡全球研究院的说法，认为那是一个巨大的数字，但无论那个数字是多少，生产力增长趋势的改善通常应该被视为提高均衡利率，因为你本质上是在提高资本的平均回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that there will be an increase of some sort. Now I don't have to go all the way to Mackenzie Global Institute and believe you know it's some enormous number but whatever it is that number an improvement in productivity growth trend is generally one for one should be thought of as raising the equilibrium interest rate because you're raising the average return on capital essentially.</p>
</details>

这对我来说完全违反直觉。我本以为生产力的大幅提高，在其他条件不变的情况下，会是**反通胀**（Disinflationary: 指通货膨胀率下降，但仍为正值）的，利率会更低。它是反通胀的，但请记住，通胀我们应该将其视为一种短期现象，一种周期性现象，而不是一种结构性现象。所以它在某种意义上是反通胀的，即在生产力提高持续进行的同时，你以更少的投入获得更多的产出，但从结构上讲，你正在提高社会中资本的平均回报，因此所有竞争性资本都必须与更高的回报竞争，因此R星上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's totally counterintuitive to me. I would have thought that a big productivity increase would be all things equal disinflationary and rates lower and It's it's disinflationary but it remember inflation we should think about as a short-term phenomenon a cyclical phenomenon not as a structural phenomenon. So it's disinflationary in the sense that in any gi for while the productivity gain is ongoing you're getting more stuff for less but as a structural matter you are raising the average returns on capital in the society and so all capital that's competing has to compete with a higher return and so therefore our star is up</p>

### 中央银行在滞胀情景下的选择与滞后效应的辩论

既然我们已经深入R星领域，我想问一个关于中央银行的问题，请你戴上你的中央银行家的帽子。他家里实际上有访客。他的中央银行家的帽子是一顶波士顿红袜队的帽子，给那些不在房间里的人听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so now that we are deep in ourstar territory I'm going to ask a central banking question with your central bank hat on So you mentioned stagflation. He actually has visitors at home. His central bank hat is a Boston Red Sox cat for those who those aren't in the room.</p>
</details>

没错。好的。你刚才提到了滞胀。当中央银行面临滞胀情景时，它们到底应该怎么做？因为我们刚刚听了鲍威尔谈论就业的下行风险和通胀的上行风险。他显然在此时选择了劳动力市场而不是通胀风险。但显然存在权衡。你必须在这里做出选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. All right. So you mentioned stagflation earlier. What exactly are central banks supposed to do when they're faced with a stagflationary scenario? Because we just listened to pal talk about downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. He clearly seemed to choose the labor market over the inflationary risk at this moment in time. But there's clearly a trade-off. You have to make a choice here.</p>
</details>

是的。这就是为什么你要尽可能避免特朗普政府正在做的那些导致滞胀局面的糟糕政策。本质上，这是一个权衡选择。这就是为什么美联储如此强调辩论通胀冲击的第二轮效应以及你所说的定价能力有多大等问题。你从这些情况中获得了多少衰退效应？本质上，这是一个平衡问题。如果你被迫在两个目标之间做出选择，即美联储使命的两个部分，也是任何中央银行的两个目标，本质上你必须追逐那个更有可能失控的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And this is why you try to avoid bad policies such as the ones the Trump administration are doing which get you into a stagflationary situation if you can. Essentially, it's a contingent choice. And this is why the Fed is right to be putting so much emphasis on debating over second round effects of inflationary shocks and things like you were saying how much pricing power there is. How much recessionary effect do you get from these station? It's essentially a balance issue. If you're forced to choose between the two goals, the two halves of the Fed's mandate, but the two goals for any central bank, essentially you have to go after the one that's more likely to spiral out of control.</p>
</details>

啊，所以这就是他们的论点，劳动力市场恶化可能非常**非线性**（Non-linear: 指事物变化不呈直线关系，可能突然加速或减速），对吗？它可能会突然爆发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ah, so this is their argument that labor market deterioration can be very nonid linear, right? It can kind of explode.</p>
</details>

是的。非线性是他们思考的方式。我认为，再次强调，这是我持不同意见的另一个原因，因为证据表明，是的，而且有关于所谓的SOM规则的讨论，你可以看到失业率非常迅速地增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Nonlinear is the way they think of it. I think again it's another reason I would take the other side because the evidence is yes and there was the discussion about the so-called SOM rule that you can have these very rapid increases in unemployment</p>
</details>

但我们看到的是，出乎人们意料但必须认真对待的是，2008年之后和2020年之后，也就是金融危机之后和新冠疫情之后，失业率实际上下降得很快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what we've seen is much to people's surprise but has to be taken seriously is both after 2008 and after 2020 so after the financial crisis after COVID unemployment actually came down pretty</p>
</details>

而且没有经济学家所说的**滞后效应**（Hysteresis: 指经济系统在受到冲击后，即使冲击消失，也无法完全恢复到原有状态的现象，常用于描述劳动力市场）的证据，即一旦大量人失业，他们就更难重新找到工作。所以这个概念来源于工程学。它在20世纪70年代和80年代的欧洲非常真实，每次经济衰退导致失业率上升，它都不会完全回到衰退前的水平，因为会有一定数量的人无法重新找到工作。在2008年危机之前和期间，包括我在英格兰银行任职期间的演讲，以及2020年新冠疫情期间的鲍威尔主席和其他人，都非常担心失业率永久性上升的可能性。

<p class="english-text">And there wasn't evidence of what economists call hysteresus, which is the idea that once you put a lot of people out of work, it's harder for them to get back into work.

It's a concept that was very true of Europe in the 70s and 80s that every time you got an unemployment rate hike because of a recession, it wouldn't come all the way back down to where it was before the recession because there would be a certain number of people who couldn't get back into work. and ahead of the 2008 crisis and during it including what my time at the Bank of England speeches and then chair pal and others in 2020 during co worried a lot about this potential for permanently having rises in the unemployment rate.</p>

嗯，我不是——这不是——我欣赏这个玩笑，但这与其说是新自由主义者，不如说是经验主义者。所以，我的意思是，我的同事**奥利维尔·布兰查德**（Olivier Blanchard: 经济学家，曾任国际货币基金组织首席经济学家）在我的团队中，他在40年前创造了“滞后效应”这个概念，他和拉里·萨默斯以及一位合著者（我当然忘了他的名字，抱歉）在2013年发表了一篇论文，那是我接管彼得森研究所后他们为我们做的第一篇论文，他们在2008年至2010年的数据中寻找滞后效应，但他们没有找到。然后鲍威尔，我再次认为，我本人和其他人都非常同情他，他谈了很多关于滞后效应的问题，解释了为什么他们在应对新冠疫情时如此积极地降息。

但后来我们知道失业率确实下降了，所以人们关心这个问题，他们关心这个问题是出于好意，但这并不是新自由主义，这是证据，证据不存在，所以这意味着你并非不应该关心失业率，你应该像我们在新冠疫情期间那样采取临时的财政政策措施，延长失业保险，延长医疗保险，让失业者的日子不那么难过，但在我看来，通胀更有可能失控。

<p class="english-text">The UK is the one rich economy, high-income economy, where productivity growth not just went down for a while, but kept going down. And so now we've had a dozen years of very low productivity growth in the UK and at some point that catches up with you. Um, and I think that's the way to look at it is you throw Brexit in on top of that, which may be one of the reasons why productivity growth hasn't come back. And there's debate about that, but they have been running making less with more rather than more with less for a very long time. And wages and prices and the pound all haven't dropped accordingly. So it's not like unfortunately Greece suffered through say or Portugal during the financial crisis. And so something's out of whack. And this shows up eventually in the fiscal policy, which is what you're talking about, that they have a bunch of really hard choices to make. If the government, the current Labor government doesn't make lots of cuts, the interest rates keep going up.</p>

如果他们确实进行了大量削减，那么增长可能不会改善。所以，他们正处于一个非常非常艰难的境地。所以乔问了你一个关于英格兰银行的问题，我也会问一个类似的问题，那就是杰克逊霍尔之所以如此重要，原因之一是我们这里不仅有美联储。我们还有其他中央银行家，比如欧洲央行、日本央行，你每年都会看到他们与美联储主席经典地散步。当谈到中央银行的信誉和独立性问题时，你认为其他中央银行家在这里在想什么？他们是否有可能利用杰克逊霍尔会议？我们还在等待他们的消息。这通常发生在周六早上。我们是在周五下午录制这个节目的。你认为他们可能会利用这个平台来反击一些事情吗？所以，世界各地的中央银行家，无论是公开还是在我与他们的对话中，都对特朗普政府对美联储的所作所为感到震惊和恐惧。除了显而易见的原因，他们同情美联储的同事，而且这很令人厌恶，事实是他们一直认为这是理所当然的。整个经济学界在过去40多年里一直认为这是理所当然的，这可以追溯到**肯·罗戈夫**（Ken Rogoff: 经济学家，曾任国际货币基金组织首席经济学家）1986年的一篇经典论文，以及其他人随后的一些工作，即中央银行独立性是好的。它平均而言在很大程度上降低了一个国家的通胀并降低了通胀的波动性，而不会降低平均增长率。句号。这是活生生的经验。欧洲中央银行就是以此为基础建立的。这就是为什么德国联邦银行和德国人愿意放弃主权给欧洲中央银行。这是几十个国家都采用的标准做法。日本银行在过去30年里获得了独立性。

<p class="english-text">If they do make lots of cuts, then probably growth doesn't improve. So, they're just in a really, really tough situation. So Joe asked you a question with your BOE hat on and I'm going to ask something similar which is one of the things that makes Jackson Hole such a big deal is that we don't just have the Fed here. We also have other central bankers uh like the ECB, the BOJ and you see them do the classic walk with the Fed chair every year. When it comes to central bank credibility and the independence issue, what do you think those other central bankers are thinking here? And do they possibly use some of Jackson Hole? We're still waiting to hear from them. That usually happens on Saturday morning. We're recording this on Friday afternoon. Do you think they maybe use this as a platform to try to push back against some of it? So, the central bankers, both publicly and in conversations I've had with them from around the world, are shocked and horrified that the Trump administration is doing this to the Fed. Beyond just the obvious, they're sympathetic to their colleagues from the Fed and it's pretty yucky is just the fact that they have taken it for granted. The entire economics profession has taken it for granted for more than 40 years going back to a classic paper by Ken Rogoff in 1986 and then some subsequent work others did that in central bank independence is good. It reduces inflation and reduces the volatility of inflation on average for a country in a large way without reducing the average growth rate. Full stop. And this is lived experience. This is what the European Central Bank was based on. This is why the Bundus Bank and the Germans were willing to give up sovereignty to the European Central Bank. This is the standard practice that dozens of countries have adopted. The Bank of Japan got independence over the last 30 years.</p>

所以，这有点像过去的贸易经济学家，但更多地是在问题上。这就像，你知道，这就像质疑疫苗一样，当然现在人们会这样做，但曾经有一度会被认为是，你是什么样的反科学文盲，竟然会质疑中央银行的独立性？所以，我的意思是，这根本无法夸大。这就是回应。在各种国际版的中央银行夏令营中，你知道，杰克逊霍尔就是这样的地方。所以，欧洲央行有他们自己的版本，叫做CRA会议。今年在CRA会议上，每个人都团结在杰伊警长鲍威尔周围，并且有关于中央银行独立性和支持他的公开声明，在国际清算银行的年会上，这也是一个类似的事情，今年我受邀参加了。我通常不会受邀参加那个。我确实参加了这个。总之，再次强调，有公开声明，有私人声明。每个人都团结在一起。但正如我们讨论的，美联储领导层似乎已经决定，鲍威尔主席今年不应该在他的演讲中提及中央银行独立性。所以，这纯粹是推断。等到这次录音发布时，我们就会知道了。是的。但我的预期是，他们会向欧洲央行行长**拉加德**（Christine Lagarde）、英格兰银行行长**贝利**（Andrew Bailey）、日本银行行长**植田和男**（Kazuo Ueda）——这三位将在周六发表演讲的重要中央银行行长——发出一份备忘录：“请不要谈论这个问题。”我认为他们可能已经决定。

<p class="english-text">So, it's kind of like with trade economists in the past, but even more on questions. It's like, you know, this is like questioning vaccines, which of course nowadays people do, but at one point would have been thought of as what kind of anti-scientific illiterate are you that you would question central bank independence? So, I mean, there's no way to exaggerate. That's the response. At various international versions of central bank summer camp, you know, which is what Jackson Hole is. So, the ECB has their version which is called the CRA conference. And this year at CRA, everybody was rallying around Jay the sheriff pal and there were public statements about central bank independence and support for him at the BIS annual meeting which is a sort of similar thing which this year I got invited to. I don't usually get invited to that. I do get this. Anyway, again, there were public statements, there were private statements. Everyone was rallying around. But as we discussed, the Fed leadership seems to have decided that Chair Pal should not mention a word about central bank independence in his speech this year. And so, this is pure extrapolation. By the time this recording comes out, we'll find out. Yeah. But my expectation is they will have passed a memo to ECB President Lagarde, Bank of England Governor Bailey, Bank of Japan, Governor Auea, who are the three big central bank governors speaking on Saturday. Please don't talk about it. And I think what they've probably decided</p>

让外国中央银行家谈论这个问题在“**马加兰**”（Magaland: 指支持“让美国再次伟大”运动的群体）可能不会有好效果，并且可能只会给特朗普支持者带来更多问题。所以我认为这里的外国中央银行家的本能是会大声谈论这个问题，但我认为他们或明或暗地被告知不要这样做。嗯，这很令人兴奋，因为等到这个录音发布时，我们的听众就会知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is having foreign central bankers talk about this would not play well in Magaland and might just induce more problems with the Trump people. So I think the instinct of the foreign central bankers here would be to talk very loudly about this, but I think they explicitly or implicitly have been told not to. Well, this is exciting because by the time this comes out, this will either have been our listeners will already know.</p>

嗯，在一个很多人都不愿谈论这些事情的时候，对吗？

<p class="english-text">Well, at a time when a lot of people don't want to talk about this stuff, right?</p>
</details>

是的。当人们感到焦虑，当人们觉得会有相互指责，当人们想要保持低调的时候。是的。当他们不知道白宫或推特上是否会有人攻击他们时，人们想要保持低调。我很欣赏亚当的坦诚。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. When people are like anxious, when people feel like there's like recriminations where people people want to people want to keep low. Yeah. People want to keep their heads low at a time when they don't know if there's going to be some attack on them from the White House or, you know, on Twitter or TR. People want to keep low. And Adam, I appreciate his cander.</p>

但那是一次非常棒的对话。有一件事，我想我仍然不明白，而且我认为很难论证美国在它帮助建立的全球经济、金融以及某些政治体系中失利了，对吧？就像有一些具体的例子可以说明美国从中受益，有时是以令人难以置信的奇怪方式，比如如果你看看2013年或2011年的债务危机。你知道，这是一场源于美国、源于美国政治的危机，你看到的是投资者涌向美国国债的安全，而且你知道，收益率实际上下降了，这有助于美国债务。所以，有时存在这些看似反常的好处，而特朗普政府似乎想要抛弃它们。你知道，我有一件事想说，我在你的介绍中一直在思考，我回想起那本书《贸易战是阶级战》，我认为亚当可能非常不同意那本书的前提等等。但无论你对这些问题持何种立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that was a fantastic conversation. One thing well I guess the thing that I still don't get and I think it is really hard to make an argument that the US has lost out from an economic and financial and in some respects political system around the world that it has helped to create right like there are tangible instances where you can say like the US benefits in sometimes incredibly weird ways like if you look at the debt crisis in like 2013 or 2011 You know this is a crisis emanating from the US from the United States from US politics and what you saw was investors flock to the security of US treasuries and you know yields actually go down which helps with US debt. So there are these like sometimes perverse benefits that the Trump administration seems to want to throw away. You know, one thing I will say that I was thinking about in your intro is and I go think back to, you know, that book trade wars are class wars, which I think is actually I suspect Adam almost very disagrees with the premise of that book, etc. But regardless of where you stand on some of these questions,</p>

国内的混乱与国际的混乱是分不开的，反之亦然。它们是密不可分的。如果你认为美国存在某种不平等，或者其他任何问题，这些事情，比如贸易关系，所有这些都是相互关联的。所以，就像有人说：“哦，推翻所有这些不同的机构。”我认为它们在根本上是相互关联的，所以如果你，你知道，你攻击美联储，因为你认为无论是什么，那都是整个事情的一部分，这似乎是合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there is that relationship between you can't disrupt the domestic without disrupting the international and or vice versa. Like these are like inextricably linked. if you perceive to be there some sort of inequality in the United States or whatever it is these things like the trading relationship all of these things they are interlin so it's like one thing to say like you know there's this view is like oh knocking over all of these different institutions I think they're they're linked in fundamental ways and there it sort of makes sense that if you you know you go after the Fed because you perceive whatever that that's part and parcel of the whole thing</p>
</details>

你可以争辩说它们是相互关联的，但我想说，如果你试图通过国际手段解决国内不平等问题。那似乎不对，重点和焦点似乎错了。我想说的是，我一点也不惊讶它会这样发展，因为那就像我的玩具一样，就像**克莱因-佩蒂斯理论**（Klein-Pettis theory: 指全球化和贸易对国内收入分配的影响，可能导致赢家和输家，从而加剧不平等）等等，你知道，美国存在这种不平等，因为国际贸易体系中存在赢家和输家，对吧？所以我们打这些贸易战等等，因为这是关于一些内部问题，纠正某种内部失衡，所以我觉得，我明白了，我只是说，我一点也不惊讶它会这样发展，因为我看到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can argue they're linked but I would say if you're trying to solve domestic inequality through international means. That doesn't seem that it seems like the emphasis and the focus is wrong. I guess what I'm saying is I'm not surprised that it all goes to because like that was my toy for like like that that the sort of Klein Pettis theory etc that you know there's this inequality in the United States because of these winners and losers from the international trading system right and so we fight these trade wars etc because we are it's about something internal that rectifying some sort of internal imbalance and so I do think like I I get so this just gets to all I'm saying is I'm not surprised at all goes together because then I see I get</p>
