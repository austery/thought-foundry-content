### AI转型与领导力

**Claire**: 很多 CEO 都在发备忘录，说我们希望你们用这些神奇的工具完成十倍的工作量，然后让你们自己去想办法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: So many CEOs sending these memos. We want you to do 10 times more work using these magical tools. You go figure it out.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我看到很多 CEO 陷入了“授权陷阱”。他们写了 AI 备忘录，说：“嘿，我们要去做这件事了。”然后他们就不再做其他任何事了。他们要求他们的执行团队，执行团队再要求他们团队的负责人，负责人再要求他们团队的经理，经理再要求团队中的个人贡献者（IC），然后那个可怜的 IC 就会想：“我是要为整个公司解决这个问题吗？”这就像是：“你觉得这对那个人或你的组织会有好处吗？不，并不是。”所以我认为领导者进行**黑客马拉松**、进行**成果展示**，或者你随便怎么称呼它们，无论你想做什么，但你确实需要为组织提供一些“玩耍空间”，让大家适应它。一旦人们亲手操作这些工具，我发现一些恐惧就会消失。你实际上已经把这些标准（**rubrics**）整合起来，让你能够识别如何在不同层级上培养产品经理的 AI 流畅度。我认为这项工作非常有效，因为人们会围绕着什么受到奖励和什么被衡量而改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: I see a lot of CEOs fall to the delegation trap. They write the AI memo. They say, "Hey, we're going to go do this." And then they don't do anything else. They ask their exec team, who ask a director on their team, who ask a manager on their team, who ask an IC on the team, and then that poor IC is like, "Am I figuring this out for the whole company?" It's like, "Do you think that's going to go well for that person or for your or no, not really." And so I think it's really important for leaders to do hackathons, to do showand tells, whatever you want to call them, whatever you want to do, but you do need to provide a little bit of play space for the organization to get comfortable with it. And then once people put their hands on the tools, I find that some of the fear goes away. You've actually put these rubrics together that allow you to identify how do you build AI fluency as a PM at these different levels. And I think that exercise is so effective because people change around what gets rewarded and what gets measured.

</details>

**Claire**: 现在有很多任务在经济上是没有价值的。而这些正是 AI 和**智能代理**真正蓬勃发展的领域。欢迎回到“How I AI”。我是 **Claire**，产品负责人和 AI 狂热者，我的使命是帮助大家利用这些新工具更好地进行构建。今天我们有一期非常特别的节目，邀请到了 **Zapier** 的联合创始人兼 CEO **Wade Foster**。**Wade** 将向我们展示 CEO 如何不仅仅是向团队发送关于如何采用 AI 的邮件。相反，他将打开屏幕，向我们展示他如何使用会议记录、**Zapier** 以及，信不信由你，**Grock** 来发现、招聘和激励整个公司的人才。我们开始吧。本期节目由 **Brex** 赞助。如果你正在收听本节目，你已经知道 AI 正在以实际有效的方式改变我们的工作方式。**Brex** 正在将同样的强大能力带入金融领域。**Brex** 是为创始人打造的智能金融平台。有了在后台运行的**自主代理**，你的财务堆栈基本上可以自行运行。卡片发行、费用报销和欺诈拦截都能实时进行，无需你操心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: There is so many tasks that are not economically valuable right now. And these are the areas where AI and agents really thrive. Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have a very special episode with Wade Foster, co-founder and CEO of Zapier. Wade's going to show us how CEOs can do more than send emails to their teams about how they should adopt AI. Instead, he's going to pop open his screen and show us how he uses meeting notes, Zapier, and believe it or not, Grock to find, hire, and inspire talent across the company. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. Brex is bringing that same power to finance. BR is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it.

**Claire**: 添加 **Brex** 的银行解决方案和高收益国库账户，你就拥有了一个帮助你更智能地消费、更快地行动并自信扩展的系统。美国三分之一的初创公司已经在运行 **Brex**。你也可以访问 bre.com/howiAI。**Wade**，感谢你加入“How I AI”。我之所以非常高兴能邀请你来这里，是因为我认为 **Zapier** 在这方面做得非常出色。他们不仅积极将 AI 融入产品，更深入思考了 AI 如何改变一家公司以及人们的工作方式。今天我们有一场非常精彩的节目，我们将展示你如何思考 AI 人才、AI 流畅度、AI 面试，甚至如何找到一些可以引入组织的 AI 核心人才。那么，在我们深入探讨之前，你为什么如此积极地改变团队的工作方式、招聘对象以及公司内部的奖励机制？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howiAI. Wade, thanks for joining how I AI. Why I am so excited to have you here is I think Zapier has done one of the most exceptional jobs. Not just leaning into adding AI into their product, but really thinking about how AI transforms a company and how people do work there. And today we have a really exciting show where we're going to show how you think about AI talent, AI fluency, interviewing for AI, and even finding some AI pill talent out there that you can pull into the org. So before we get into it, why have you leaned in so hard into changing how your team works, who you hire, and what you reward inside the company?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我想有几个原因。首先，和其他所有人一样，我们认为这是一项变革性技术，能让我们向客户交付更多价值。这是首要原因。其次，我们的产品本身就做了很多这类事情，如果我们对外宣传这些东西如何改变你的工作方式，而我们内部却一点都不用，我会觉得很尴尬。所以当我跟团队交流时，我说我希望我们走在使用这些东西的前沿。这意味着我们会尝试新事物，也会犯错误。但即使我们犯了错误，那也非常好，因为我们可以把这些错误分享出去，说：“嘿，我们尝试了大家都说很棒的东西，结果呢，要么它对我们来说确实很棒，要么它对我们来说根本行不通，我们没搞明白。”我认为这让人们感觉更自在，更愿意去推动这些事情。此外，我们的一项核心价值观是“不当机器人，建造机器人”（**don't be a robot, build a robot**），这也很有帮助。所以我们可能比大多数公司都更倾向于投入这些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Couple reasons, I think. one for the same reason that everybody's doing it, which it feels like this is a transformative technology that allows us to ship and deliver just like a whole bunch more value to our customers. So that's first and foremost. Second, our product does a lot of this stuff and I would be embarrassed if we're out there evangelizing how this stuff can change how you work and internally we're doing none of it. And so when I talk to our team, I'm like, I want us to be on the forefront of using this stuff. And that should mean that we're going to try things and we're going to make mistakes. But even when we make mistakes, that's really good because we can now go out and share those mistakes and say, "Hey, we tried this thing that everybody was, you know, talking was so great and, you know, either it was great for us or actually it didn't really work for us, like we couldn't figure it out." And I think that has helped people feel a little bit more comfortable, you know, just pushing on these things. It also helps that one of our core values is don't be a robot, build a robot. So like we're just we're probably just like more predisposed compared to most companies to to get into these things.

</details>

**Claire**: 嗯，我经常听到人们说，当他们听到领导关于如何改变工作方式或思考工作的信息时，有时会感到非常焦虑。他们说：“我太忙了，没时间，或者我就是不知道从何开始，这不切实际。”而我能够打动人们的地方是，我认为你通过投资于团队获得这些技能，为他们提供了巨大的帮助，因为每个挑战——我给大多数人的挑战是，我说：“好吧，假设你在任何公司都干得很出色，我知道你会永远留在这里，但也许几年后你决定寻求新的冒险。你认为那次面试会是什么样子？你认为他们会在两三年后大声疾呼需要什么？你认为这会成为你评估的一部分吗？”他们几乎总是异口同声地说：“绝对是。”然后我说：“那么你很幸运能在一个希望你走在采用这些工具、技术和流程前沿的公司工作。”所以我认为这不仅对企业来说是正确的事情，而且我真的认为这对员工和团队成员来说也是正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Well, and one of the things that I hear a lot from people is they get a lot of anxiety sometimes when they're hearing these messages from their leaders about how they need to change how they do work or how they think about their job. and they say, "I'm so busy. I don't have time or I just don't know where to get started. It doesn't practically apply." And where I've been able to crack kind of people is I think you are doing your teammates a huge service by investing in them getting these skills because every challenge the challenge I give to most people is I say okay let's say you've had a wonderful run at whatever company you're at and I know you're going to be here forever but maybe in a couple years you decide you're up for a new adventure. What do you think that interview is going to look like? What do you think they're going to scream for in two or three years? and do you think this is going to be part of how you're evaluated? And they almost consistently say absolutely yes. And then I say then you're very lucky to be at a company who wants you to be on the leading edge in terms of adopting these tools and technologies and processes in your work. So I think it's not only the right thing to do for a business, but I actually think it's the right thing to do for employees and people as part of a team.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我百分之百同意。我看到很多 CEO 陷入了“授权陷阱”。他们写了 AI 备忘录，说：“嘿，我们要去做这件事了。”然后他们就不再做其他任何事了。他们要求他们的执行团队，执行团队再要求他们团队的负责人，负责人再要求他们团队的经理，经理再要求团队中的个人贡献者（IC）。然后那个可怜的 IC 就会想：“我是要为整个公司解决这个问题吗？”这就像是：“你觉得这对那个人或你的组织会有好处吗？”答案是：“不，并不是。”所以我认为领导者进行**黑客马拉松**、进行**成果展示**、进行周五下午的“随意玩耍”，或者你随便怎么称呼它们，无论你想做什么，但你确实需要为组织提供一些“玩耍空间”，让大家适应它。一旦人们亲手操作这些工具，我发现一些恐惧就会消失。这很自然，因为媒体会让你相信这些东西很可怕。但对于我们这些正在使用它的人来说，你看到了它的强大之处，但也看到了它的缺点。你会想：“哦，它在这方面不太擅长，但在那方面真的很棒。我要在这方面多加利用，而我的角色现在实际上是做这些其他任务。”所以它变得更加务实，而不是像衣橱里的妖怪一样会抢走你的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: I 100% agree. I see a lot of CEOs fall to like the delegation trap. They write the AI memo. They say, "Hey, we're going to go do this." And then they don't do anything else. They they ask their exec team, who asks a director on their team, who ask a manager on their team, who ask an IC on the team. And then that poor IC is like, "Am I figuring this out for the whole company?" It's like, "Do you think that's going to go well for that person or for your org?" And it's like, "No, not really." And so I think it's really important for leaders to do hackathons, to do showand tells, to do Friday afternoon, you know, mess around, whatever you want to call them, whatever you want to do. But you do need to provide a little bit of play space for the organization to get comfortable with it. And then once people put their hands on the tools, I find that some of the fear goes away. It's so natural because the media would have you believe that this stuff is terrifying. But for those of us who are messing around with it, you see how awesome it is, but you also see the flaws. You're like, "Oh, it's not so good at this. It's really good at this. I'm going to lean into it over here, and then my role is actually doing these other tasks now." And so it becomes a lot more pragmatic versus this like boogeyman in the closet that's going to come for your job.

</details>

**Claire**: 我同意。最后一点，我要表扬你的是，你让你的团队觉得这非常具体。例如，在“How I AI”的观众中有很多产品经理，你实际上已经整理了这些标准，让你能够识别如何在不同层级上培养产品经理的 AI 流畅度。我认为这项工作非常有效，因为人们会围绕着什么受到奖励和什么被衡量而改变。通过使其非常具体，人们可以投资于特定的技能和工具，并知道目标在哪里。所以你实际上已经使用 AI 来制作这些标准并使其更好。我认为这就是我们将从第一个工作流程开始的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: I agree. And then the last thing I'll give you a little kudos on is you've made this very tangible for your team. So we have a lot of for example product managers in the how AI audience and you've actually put these rubrics together that allow you to identify how do you build AI fluency as a PM at these different levels. And I think that exercise is so effective because people chain around what gets rewarded and what gets measured. And by making it very specific, people can invest in specific skills and tools and know where, you know, the goalposts are. And so you've actually used AI to both like make those and make them better. And I think that's where we're going to start with our first workflow.

</details>

### AI与企业文化

**Wade Foster**: 我想展示的第一件事是招聘日。我花了很多时间在招聘上。我这里有一个文档，你的大多数公司可能都有类似的东西，比如一份价值观文档。我认为大多数公司并没有在这上面投入大量精力，但当你开始拥有一个为 AI 编写得很好的文档，让它理解什么是好的和坏的行为时，这真的很有帮助。我想你实际上有一期节目是关于**Hillary** 的，她也做了一个类似的版本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: So the first thing I want to show, we're going to talk about recruiting day. I spent a lot of time on recruiting. I've got this dock here which is you know probably most of your companies have like something like this which is you know like a values um document. Um most of them I don't think put like a ton of effort into it but I think it's really helpful when you start to have a document that's like written well for an AI to understand like what is good and bad behavior. I think you actually had an episode with um

</details>

**Claire**: **Hillary** 做的，是的，**Hillary** 做了这个版本，它就像是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Hillary doing yeah Hillary like man that did a version of this where it was like

</details>

**Wade Foster**: ……你知道，默认行动。好吧。但这到底意味着什么？这里有“做这个，不要做那个”的例子。这有助于 AI 在处理这类事情时变得非常擅长。所以我们一直都有一个这样的文档，它帮助我们制定标准。当你考虑招聘某人时，你希望有明确的评估标准。这个文档我们很早以前就整理好了，但我有一个小技巧，即使你没有考虑过这些，你也可以做到。所以，我在这里的小技巧是，如果你使用 **Granola**，**Granola** 推出了一个名为“食谱”（**recipes**）的功能，它基本上就是一些花哨的**提示词**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: you know uh default action. Okay. But what does that actually mean? Like here's examples of do this, not this. And it helps the AI sort of get really good at these types of things. So we had a document like this for forever that helps us with our rubrics. And so when you think about hiring somebody, you want to have clear evaluation criteria. Now, this we put together long long ago, but I have a hack for how you can do this even if you haven't thought about this. Um, and so the hack that I have for this one is if you use Granola, Granola launched this feature called recipes, which are just fancy prompts basically.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我没有想到这个主意。这只是他们资料库里的一个东西，真是天才。我使用 **Granola** 已经差不多一年了。他们其中一个**提示词**就是：“构建不成文的公司文化手册。”所以你可以看到它实际上开始说明组织是如何运作的，至少根据我的会议记录是这样，而且我把它放在每一次会议中，这样人们至少知道 **Wade** 是如何工作的，以及围绕 **Wade** 的会议是如何运作的。你会得到一个关于你公司正在做什么的非常丰富的例子。所以，如果你使用像 **Granola** 这样的工具，如果你使用任何这些会议记录器，我认为你可以运行这样的**提示词**来实际提取公司的真实文化。这样你就可以看到它奖励什么，不奖励什么。我第一次运行这个的时候，我震惊了。我想，我们花了很多时间思考我们的文化，撰写我们的文化，我认为我们做得比大多数公司都好。但当我读完它时，我心想：“哇，这实际上以一种连我自己都未曾完全理解的方式触及了细节。”所以，我认为这就是 AI 的魔力，特别是如果你使用像 **Granola** 这样的工具来长时间收集数据。那么 AI 就会变得非常强大，因为你只需在上面加一个**提示词**，它就能生成这样的东西，现在它因为各种原因变得非常实用。你现在可以把它放入**职位描述**中。你现在可以把它作为招聘和解雇的一部分。你可以很好地设定期望。所以这是一个我会使用的工具。我现在会把这个输出给像 **ChatGPT** 这样的工具，然后说：“嘿，你能把这种不成文的文化变成一套评分**提示词**，用于在面试中根据这些与 **Zapier** 相符的特质来评估某人吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: And I did not think of this idea. This is something that was just in their library, which was genius. I've been using Granola for I don't most of the year, I think, almost a year now. And one of the prompts they have is, yeah, build the unspoken company culture. uh handbook. So you can see it actually starts to say how the organization works at least according to my meetings and I have it on in every single meeting so people really know at least how Wade works and the meetings in and around Wade works. Um and you get this like pretty rich example of what your company's doing. And so if you're using a tool like Granola, if you're using any of these meeting recorders, I think you can run a prompt like this to actually extract the real culture of the company. Uh, and so you can see what it rewards, you can see what it doesn't reward. Um, and it it it the first time I ran this, I was like I I was shocked. I was like, we spend a lot of time thinking about our culture, writing about our culture, and I think we do a better job than most. But as I read through it, I was like, "Wow, this actually gets at the specifics in a way that even I hadn't figured out quite how to do." And so, I think this is kind of the magic of AI, especially if you're using a tool like Granola or something to collect data over long periods of time. Then AI gets really powerful because you can just like slap a prompt on the top of it and it can generate something like this that now becomes really practical for a whole host of reasons. You can now put it into job descriptions. You can now use it as part of hiring and firing. You can set expectations really well. So this is a tool I would use. I I would take the output of this now and I would go give it to a tool like chat GPT and say hey can you take this like unspoken culture and actually generate a set of like scoring prompts for how to evaluate somebody in an interview against these traits that um match zappier

</details>

**Claire**: 好的，我想为在座的 CEO 或其他高管们指出一点：很多 CEO 都在谈论文化、我们的运营原则，以及我们想招聘什么样的人、如何招聘。但你确实拥有这种丰富的非结构化数据。我们大多数人都有一大堆 **Granola** 数据，它反映了你的团队在日常工作中实际如何相互交流和运作。利用这些数据并非仅用于功能性目的。尽管我们已经看到了很多功能性用途，比如分析销售电话并为销售人员提供指导，或者将产品辩论转化为文档，但实际上，将你所有公司沟通的聚合数据与你声明的价值观进行压力测试，这真的很有趣。因为这样你就能看到：我们与价值观在哪里保持一致？有哪些我们尚未明确表达但希望加强和记录的事情浮现出来？以及我们实际上在哪里偏离了方向？比如我们说我们是 XYZ，但如果我们真的看看我们如何相互交流，我们却做了很多 ABC。我只是觉得，很多 CEO 再次像发备忘录一样，说我们希望你用这些神奇的工具完成十倍的工作量，然后让你自己去想办法，但却没有花时间去思考如何更好地完成 CEO 的工作。我相信你认为自己是公司文化的承载者。那么，为什么不使用这些以前没有的工具来做到这一点呢？然后，你就可以像你所说的，使用 AI 将这些转化为各种资产，比如**职位描述**、**绩效标准**、全体员工会议内容等等，我认为这真的很有趣。而且，剧透一下，我们有一期节目即将播出，与你的行政助理 **Courtney** 有关，她会根据你的价值观，严格要求你的高管团队在会议中的表现。所以这不仅仅是关于“索伦之眼”从整个组织中监视，你也会将它用在自己身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: well and what I want to call out for the CEOs or other executives here are is you know a lot of CEOs talk about culture and our operating principles and how you know who we want to hire for and how we want to hire. But you do have this rich unstructured data. Most of us do just bunch of granola which is how your team actually speaks to each other and operates in the day-to-day and taking this this data and not using it for functional purposes. Although we've seen lots of functional purposes of this, taking sales calls and giving salespeople coaching, you know, taking product, you know, debates and turning them to documents, but actually taking the aggregate of all your company communications and stress testing it against your stated values is really interesting because then you can see well where are we aligned with our values? Where do things show up that we haven't actually clearly articulated that we want to reinforce and document and do all these things and like where are we actually off like we say we XYZ but then if we really look at how we speak to each other we do a lot of ABC and I just think so many CEOs again are like sending these memos like we want you to do 10 times more work using these magical tools um you go figure it out but aren't spending the time to figure out how to maybe even do the CEO job better. And I'm sure you think of yourself as the carrier of culture at your company. And so why not use these tools that weren't available before to do that? And then and then you can use, you know, AI to turn these into all sorts of assets as you said, job descriptions, um, performance rubrics, all hands content, all that kind of stuff that I think is really interesting. And we have, not to spoil it, we have an episode coming either before or after. We'll see when it gets scheduled with your EA Courtney who holds your executive team's feet to the fire on how they perform in meetings relative to your uh values. So it's not just about, you know, eye of Sauron from across the organization. You do turn it upon yourself as well.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 是的，我想是的。所以，我认为你所说的就是我们在很多会议中都有**辅导机器人**之类的东西。老实说，我喜欢它，因为作为 CEO，我希望得到很多反馈。由于权力动态等原因，你并不总是能得到真实的反馈，而 AI 是一个无限耐心的教练，所以它非常棒。它会说：“嘿，我认为你做得很好，干得漂亮。”然后又说：“这里有三件事，坦白说你做得不太好。”你当然不必总是同意它的说法，但它确实能帮助我更好地完成工作。我认为大多数人都想要这样的反馈。大多数人希望得到比他们的经理、同事或其他人有时间给他们的更多的反馈。而 AI 有世界上所有的时间来给你反馈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Yeah. I think so. So, I think what you're talking about is we have uh like coaching bots in a lot of meetings and stuff like this and I I love it honestly because I I as a CEO I want to get lots of feedback because of power dynamics and stuff. You don't always get like just the honest truth and AI is this infinitely patient coach and so it's just fantastic and be like hey here's some things I think you're doing great good job and like here's three things that candidly you're not doing a great job of you know you don't always have to agree with it but it's really helpful at just making me better at my job. Uh, and I think most people want that. Like most people want more feedback than your their their manager or their peers or whoever have time to give them. And AI has all the time in the world to give you feedback.

</details>

### AI驱动的招聘流程

**Claire**: 好的。所以你有了你的价值观文档。你向我们展示了我们如何从以前无法获得的数据源中创建或推断出一些价值观。但现在我们来谈谈招聘。再说一次，CEO 的工作是承载价值观、文化，推动组织发展，招聘优秀人才。你花了很多时间在招聘上，AI 是如何帮助你管理招聘过程中一些以前可能比较繁琐或难以扩展的部分的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Okay. So you have your um values document. You shown us how we could create maybe or infer some values from some sources of data that weren't available before. But then let's talk a little bit about hiring. So again, CEO job, carry carry values, culture, you know, drive pace in the organization, hire great people. So you spent a lot of time on hiring and how has AI come into how you manage some parts of the hiring process that were maybe a little bit more tedious or um harder to scale before?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我非常喜欢用它来作为面试的助手。所以，我再次大量使用 **Granola**。我构建了一个**智能代理**，它将帮助——它基本上会评估我的面试记录和笔记，并帮助我做出是否录用这个人的决定。所以我们现在看到的是 **Zapier Agents**。这是一个相当简单的**智能代理**。你可以看到，当 **Granola** 的文件夹中添加了笔记时，它就会被触发。在这种情况下，如果我们查看它，它是一个面试**智能代理**。每当它将面试添加到我的新面试文件夹时。**Zapier Agents** 的工作方式是，你可以给它们一系列要遵循的指令。所以在这种情况下，指令是：“你是一名 **Zapier** 的专家招聘评估员。你的任务是审查 **Granola** 提供的面试记录和笔记。你将审查知识源中提供的**职位描述**和作为知识源提供的 **Zapier** 公司价值观，以确定候选人是否应该进入招聘流程的下一阶段。你希望评估候选人的**功能专长**、**价值观契合度**等等。”所以你列出了你希望这个**智能代理**做的所有事情，然后最终我给它一个目标。这里的目标是：“嘿，我希望你向这位候选人推荐‘是’、‘否’或‘可能’，然后我希望你提供你的理由。给我三到五句话，说明你为什么推荐这个。然后我希望你继续给我发送评估邮件。”在 **Zapier Agents** 内部，你可以上传这些知识源。所以你可以在下面看到我有两个 **Google Docs**，**Zapier** 价值观标准，以及在这种情况下，我们正在查看一个**社交媒体职位描述**。所以我们正在招聘一名社交媒体助理，因此有一个与此相关的**职位描述**。所以这是一个非常简单的**智能代理**，现在对于我进行的任何这些面试，除了我自己的意见，我还会得到一个 AI 的意见。我非常喜欢这一点，因为它就像一个**偏见检查器**，它就像一个**思考伙伴**。你知道，特别是对于我这样面试各种学科、各种领域的人来说。我通常对很多事情都略知一二，但有一个工具能在我处理这些事情时给我一些“直觉”，并给我额外的提示、技巧和要点，让我能说：“哦，那个，那个确实很有趣。我应该多加注意。”所以，我们应该看看这对候选人来说是什么样子，但我想快速做一件事。所以，让我向你展示如果你想改变这个，**Co-pilot** 是如何工作的。在这种情况下，我刚刚结束对一位候选人的面试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: One of the places that I really like to use it is as like an assistant for interviews. So uh I again I use granola a lot. Um so I have built an agent that will help will will basically evaluate my transcripts and my notes and will help me make a yes no decision on how to hire this person. So what we're looking at here is Zapier agents. This is a pretty simple agent here. So you can see over here it triggers when there's a note added to a folder in granola. In this case if we look in it it's a interview agent. whenever it adds uh an interview to my new interviews um folder. And the way Zap year agents work is you can give them a set of instructions to follow. And so in this case, you know, the instructions are you're an expert hiring evaluator at Zapier. Your task is to review the interview transcript and notes provided by Granola. You're reviewing the job description provided at the knowledge source and Zapier's company values provided as a knowledge source to determine whether a candidate should advance in the hiring process. You want to evaluate the candidates's functional expertise, their values alignment, so on and so forth. So you run through all the things that you want this agent to do and then ultimately I give it a goal. And the goal here is, hey, I want you to recommend yes, no, or maybe to this candidate, and then I want you to provide your reasoning. Give me three to five sentences on why you think you should do what you uh why you are recommending this. Then I want you to go ahead and email me the uh evaluation. And inside Zapier agents, you can upload those knowledge sources. So you can see down here I have two Google Docs, the Zapier values rubric, and in this case, we're looking at a social media job description. So we're in the process of hiring someone to help out with our social, and so there's a job description uh associated with this. So this is a very simple agent now that for any uh of these interviews I'm doing with this, I will get in addition to my own opinion, I will get an AI opinion alongside of this. And I I I really like this because it acts as um like a bias check. It acts as a thought partner. You know, especially for me who's interviewing people across all sorts of disciplines, all sorts of areas. You know, I usually know a little bit about a lot of things, but it's nice to have another tool kind of gut-ing me on some of these things and giving me extra little tips and tricks and nuggets to go, "Oh, that that that actually was interesting. I should pay more attention to that." So, um, we should actually see what this looks like for a candidate, but I want to do one thing real quick. So, let me show you how co-pilot works if you want to go change this. So, in this case, I actually just got off an interview with a candidate

</details>

**Claire**: 我想展示它的输出，但我不想在演示时泄露任何**个人身份信息**（**PII**）。所以，我们将让 **Co-pilot** 把它删除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: and I want to show the output of it, but I don't want to uh have any PII leak while we're demoing this. So, we're going to have chat uh we're going to have co-pilot get rid of that. So, um,

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 所以，我们说：“改变**提示词**以删除关于候选人的任何可识别信息。”**Zapier Agents** 的 **Co-pilot** 很好的一点是，它会帮助你编写这些指令。你不必自己坐下来编写所有这些指令。你可以给它一些基本的指导方针，然后 **Co-pilot** 就会为你生成所有这些内容，然后如果你愿意，你可以直接编辑指令。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: let's say change the prompt to remove any identifiable information about the candidate. And so, the nice thing about how Zapier agents co-pilot works is it'll help you write these instructions. You don't have to sit down and write all these come up with all these instructions yourself. you can give it kind of just hey basic guidelines and then copilot will go generate all of that stuff for you uh and then you can just edit the the instructions directly if you if you want to.

</details>

**Claire**: 是的。我要给你的团队的产品人员或设计人员很多赞扬，因为我同时使用了 **Co-pilot** 和 **Zapier** 内部的许多“改进我的**提示词**”小功能。我也喜欢你在应用程序的某些部分如何评估我的**提示词**的强度。所以，有一个用于**提示词**的 **Co-pilot** 确实很有帮助，因为无论人们怎么说它不重要，它确实很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Yeah. And I'm going to go ahead and give I'm going to give your team's product folks or whoever design folks uh a lot of kudos because I use both co-pilot and a lot of the improve my prompt little mini features inside Zapier. And I also love how you score how strong some of my prompts are in some parts of the app. And so it is it is helpful just to have a co-pilot for prompting because no matter how much people say it's it doesn't matter. It definitely matters.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 完全正确。好的。所以它已经做出了改变。我要继续。我们只是——我没有实际检查我具体做了什么。所以我们只是凭感觉来做。所以你可以看到我们有针对高级社交媒体专家的面试评估。看，它已经删除了（个人信息），这很好。所以对这位候选人的推荐是“是”。嘿，候选人做得很好。你知道，强大的**功能专长**，完全符合 **Zapier** 的价值观。他们对**社交媒体策略**有深入的理解，特别是从以产品为中心的营销转向**故事构建**和**社区构建**。所以你可以看到它会通过**职位描述**，然后通过这里的价值观，最终尝试支持这个推荐。现在，我为了做得更好会做的一件事是查看这里的反馈，然后想：“好吧，我如何更新**提示词**，给我更多可操作的建议？”比如，如果我觉得这个评估者对候选人太宽容或太苛刻，我就会基本上遵循 **Hillary** 展示她的 **GPT** 时使用的相同系统，即提供更多建议，更多关于“这是个好答案，这是个坏答案”的细节。随着时间的推移，你会发现你的面试**智能代理**在评估候选人方面会变得非常擅长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Totally. Uh all righty. So it's made the change. I am going to go ahead. We're going to just I didn't actually check exactly what I did. So we're just going to do this vibe style. So you can see we've got uh interview evaluation for a senior social media specialist. Look, it's stripped out and that's nice. So recommendation for this candidate is yes. Hey, job well done candidate. Uh you know strong functional expertise all in alignment with Zapier's value. Uh they have a deep understanding of social media strategy particularly shift from product focused marketing to story building and community building. So you can see it kind of works through the job description then it works through the values here um and ultimately tries to like support the recommendation. Now, uh, one thing that I would do to make this better then is to look at the feedback here and go, okay, how can I update the prompt to give me even more actionable recommendations like if I felt like, you know, hey, this um, evaluator is like being too easy on candidates or too hard on candidates, I would um, basically go through the same system that Hillary shows off with her GPTs, which is like provide more suggestions, more details on this is a good answer, this is a bad answer. And over time, uh, you'll find that your, uh, interview agent starts to get really good at assessing candidates.

</details>

**Claire**: 所以，我给你两条我认为你应该做的改进建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: So, I'm going to give you two enhancements that I think you should make.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 哦，我喜欢！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Oh, I love it.

</details>

**Claire**: 一个是 **LaunchDarkly** 的 **Zach Davis** 在他的面试流程中展示的，他实际上在面试过程中根据标准评估面试官的质量。所以最后可以有一个“面试官反馈”部分，说：“嘿，你实际上忘记问 XYZ 了，或者在进入某个话题时你没有真正强调这一点，所以下次面试时请记住做 ABC。”我们在 **LaunchDarkly** 的工程面试中就是这样做的，因为你知道，人类在对话中会忘记我们到底要问什么，它会变成一个非常自然的流程。所以，在你的反馈渠道中给自己一个**面试教练**。另一件事是，我希望在主题行中直接显示“是”、“否”或“可能”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: One is one that um, Zach Davis at LaunchDarkly showed in his interview flow, which is he actually evaluates the quality of the interviewer during the session against the rubric. And so there could be a feedback for interviewer section at the end that says hey you actually forgot to ask about XYZ or when going into topic you didn't really reinforce this and so next time you interview remember to do ABC. We did this for um engineering interviews at launch because you know humans get into conversations and we forget exactly what we're going to ask and it becomes a very natural flow. So give yourself a interview coach in your feedback channel. The other thing is man, I just want that yes, no, maybe in the subject line.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 如果你想要像“面试候选人，是，继续推进”，因为我说的最重要的事情，你知道，我如何赢得优秀人才，就是我只想比其他人更努力地招聘他们。这是我的秘密途径之一。所以，你越早确定“这是个‘是’”，我们越早优先阅读它。让我们让候选人进入下一阶段。你可以在**人才招聘**方面变得有点激进。所以这是我的两条反馈意见，我们现在看到 **Wade** 正在实时使用 **Co-pilot** 将这些建议添加到总体的**提示词**中。我喜欢**智能代理**的一点是，我认为**智能代理**这个概念对很多人来说一直非常不透明，比如它们到底能做什么？这意味着什么？我是否必须做那些花哨的流程连接器，这些在你的产品中是可用的？但我真正想说的是，如果你要向某人解释如何分步骤完成这项工作，以及他们需要什么才能完成这项工作。把它写下来，那就是你的**智能代理**的定义。然后这些 AI 工具就可以执行它们。当然，像 **Co-pilot** 或“改进我的**提示词**”这样的功能可以使 AI 模型读取这些指令的方式更加结构化。但它基本上就是描述你想要完成什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: If you want like interview candidate, yes, move forward because the most important thing I say, you know, how I win good talent is I just I want to hire them harder than every than everybody else. That's one of my secret paths. So like the sooner you're like this is a yes, let's prioritize reading that. Let's get the candidate to the next stage. You can get um a little aggressive on talent acquisition. So those are my two pieces of feedback and we are seeing right here Wade is live using co-pilot to add those um suggestions into the overall prompt. And what I like about agents is I think this concept of agents has been very opaque to a lot of people in terms of like what can they even do? What does this mean? Do I have to like do these you know fancy flow connectors which are available um in your your product? But really what I say is just like if you were to explain to somebody how to do this job in steps and what they would need to get that job done. Write it down and that is that is the definition of your agent. And then these these AI tools can execute them. And then of course you know features like co-pilot or like enhance my prompt can then go make it a little bit more structured for how the AI models would read those instructions. But it's basically like just describe what you want to get done.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 是的。我想我经常这样描述它：如果你见过**标准操作程序**（**SOP**），你就见过**智能代理**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Yeah. I think uh a a way I often describe it is if you've ever seen standard operating procedures, you've seen an agent.

</details>

**Claire**: 而且你知道，那些擅长编写**标准操作程序**的人在构建**智能代理**方面非常出色。但即使你不擅长编写**标准操作程序**，**Co-pilot** 在这方面也能帮到你很多，因为你只需随口说一句：“你能帮我做这件事吗？”它就会开始说：“好的，我明白你的想法，但这个**标准操作程序**实际上应该是什么样子。”然后，能和像 **Claire** 这样的人坐下来聊聊，她说：“这里还有两个让它变得更好的主意。”然后你就可以直接告诉 **Co-pilot** 让它变得更好，这真是太棒了。我认为目前 AI 真正的挑战，至少在目前这个阶段，与其说是工具，不如说是提出如何让这些东西变得更好的想法。一旦你有了想法，实现起来就快得惊人。比如那两条建议，我只用了字面意义上的 60 秒就添加进去了，而且它们都是很棒的建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: And you know, the folks that are great at writing standard operating procedures are fantastic at building agents. But even if you're not great at writing standard operating procedures, this is where Copilot helps you out so much because you can just blab in, can you do this thing for me? and it starts to go, okay, I get your idea, but here's what standard operating procedure for that should actually look like. And then it's awesome to, you know, sit down and talk to someone like Claire who goes, here's two other ideas to make this better. And then you can just go tell CPI to make it better. I find the real challenge with AI, at least at this point in time, is less about the tools and more about just coming up with ideas for like how do you make this stuff better? And once you have the ideas, it's crazy fast to implement it. Like those two suggestions took literally 60 seconds to add to this and they're great suggestions.

</details>

**Claire**: 是的。那么，如果你想知道 **Claire** 关于 AI 能做什么的魔术秘密建议，其中一个我看到人们在做**智能代理**时常犯的错误是，他们会想：“我做什么？那就做我做的。”我说那是一个很好的起点，从我做什么以及我怎么做开始。但接着我说：“但然后问问自己，如果我有更多时间，我接下来会做什么？那之后我又会做什么？如果我有三个实习生来做这个，他们会做什么？”我说，把这个思路再往前推一点，想象一下，如果你做这项任务，你会做到极致，你可能会有实习生或额外的资源，以及无限的时间来把它提升到下一个水平。我认为 **Suzie** 的 **Matt** 在一个非常相似的流程中向我们展示了这一点，从 **Granola** 到一个更结构化的工作流应用程序。他说：“好吧，如果我有一个销售电话，我的营销团队能完美地根据这个销售电话运作，他们会做哪 15 件事？不是他们现在有能力做的 3 件事，而是我们有很棒想法的 15 件事。”这真的可以开启你的创造力，让你思考**智能代理**能为你做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Yeah. So how if you want them to know the Clarvo magic secret to suggestions on what your AI can do. One of the mistakes I see people make when they do agents is they think what do I do and let's just do what I do. And I say that's a great place to start what I do and how I do it. But then I say but then ask yourself if I had more time what would I do next? And what would I do after that? And if I had three interns on this, what would they do? And I say like pull that thread a little further along and imagine

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 做这项任务，你会做到极致，你可能会有实习生或额外的资源，以及无限的时间来把它提升到下一个水平。我认为 **Suzie** 的 **Matt** 在一个非常相似的流程中向我们展示了这一点，从 **Granola** 到一个更结构化的工作流应用程序。他说：“好吧，如果我有一个销售电话，我的营销团队能完美地根据这个销售电话运作，他们会做哪 15 件事？不是他们现在有能力做的 3 件事，而是我们有很棒想法的 15 件事。”这真的可以开启你的创造力，让你思考**智能代理**能为你做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: doing this task, you would do it to the nth degree and you would have maybe interns or additional resources and sort of infinite time to to take it to the next level. And I think Matt at Suzie showed us this on a very similar flow granola to a more structured workflows app where he said, "Okay, if I had a sales call and my marketing team operated perfectly off that sales call, what are the 15 things that they would do? Not the three things they have capacity to do now, but the 15 things that we have great ideas for." And that can really open up your creativity for what what an agent can do for you.

</details>

**Claire**: 百分之百同意。我认为这是讨论中被忽视的一点，那就是现在有很多任务在经济上是没有价值的，因为雇人做那件事太贵了，或者对人类来说太烦人、太乏味，无法始终如一地完成这些事情。而这些正是 AI 和**智能代理**真正蓬勃发展的领域，因为你可以放一个东西，它会非常乐意以非常低的预算完成那项任务，并且非常非常一致地完成这些事情。所以公司内部有那么多根本没有发生的任务，即使你能做，它们可能也会发生。所以，我认为很多价值就在于此，而不仅仅是“嘿，做我已经在做的事情”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: 100%. I think this is what's lost in the discussion is there is so many tasks that are not economically valuable right now because it's too expensive to pay a person to do that thing or it's too annoying and too tedious for a human to actually follow through consistently on those things. And these are the areas where AI and agents like really thrive because you can put something that will happily do that task for very low budget and do it very very consistently against those things. Um, and so there's so many tasks inside of a company that simply do not happen, even though they probably would if you could do it. Um, and so it's that that's where I think a lot of the value is. Um, not just in like, hey, do the stuff I already do.

**Wade Foster**: and you have figured out a way to use AI

**Wade Foster**: ……来识别人才。那么，你想向我们展示一下你从未听任何人说过的寻找人才的技巧吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: to identify talent. So, do you want to show us a little bit about your your trick that I have never literally never heard anybody say before on how to source some talent?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 所以，我喜欢用来帮助寻找“隐性人才”的工具之一是 **Grock**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: So, uh one of the tools I like to use to help source um under the radar talent is Grock. Um

</details>

**Claire**: 你是第一个在这里听到的人。这是“How I AI”的首次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: you heard it here first. This is a how I AI first you all.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 好的。所以，我们在这里寻找的是一些优秀的**社交媒体**候选人。所以我们说：“帮我找到 **X** 上那些喜欢 **Zapier**、**无代码**、**智能代理构建**、**自动化**以及相关话题的发帖人。我想要那些分享**教程**和**教育**相关想法的发帖人。嗯，让我们看看。我们还想要什么？嗯，这些发帖人应该有适度的关注者，不要太多，也不要太少。我正在寻找**沧海遗珠**。”让我们看看。我们还可能想要什么？嗯，假设我们有预算。所以，我们有预算，所以寻找**湾区以外**的人。我们不希望 **Zuck**（扎克伯格）把这些人抢走。嗯，我们，你知道，给我，我们就说给我 10 个想法吧。所以我们先从这个开始，看看它会给出什么。嗯，我喜欢，当我们寻找人才时，我会这样做，只是为了做大量的迭代，因为寻找候选人是非常疯狂的，比如你有招聘人员，他们一直在做这些事情。但他们都喜欢 **LinkedIn**，他们使用 **LinkedIn** 的东西。我发现 **Grock** 能够帮助你找到市场上人们没有寻找的不同切片。而且因为你可以通过**自然语言**提问，你可以进行这些在 **LinkedIn** 的**布尔搜索**工具中很难进行的奇特搜索。所以你最终会找到一些让你觉得“哦，这有点意思”的人。它也适用于其他事情。比如，如果你正在寻找，现在很多人都在做**网红营销**。那么，如果你想，这对我来说将是一个非常简单的方法来寻找潜在的**网红营销**人员，或者，你知道，如果我想找到那些可能只是想给我提供**产品反馈**的人。假设你是一家新创公司，你想找到有特定问题的人，你也可以用同样的方式。所以，你知道，**Grock** 就像一个**寻人工具**，是一个非常有用的工具。好的。所以，你可以看到这里我们收到了一些人。所以，你有“**自动化之王**”（**automation king**），他在分享教程。你有 **Ritz talks**。我们有很多来自印度、尼日利亚等地的人。所以那里一定有很多**无代码人才**。有趣。所以你可以点击这些人，然后开始查看不同的个人资料。实际上，我没有分享，我只是分享了一个标签。我们只是悬停看看我们能得到什么。嗯，好吧。这有点意思。嗯，“**千日挑战**”（**thousand day challenge**）。这有点意思。嗯，有人可能正在构建一个完整的**教育课程**。嗯，所以这很有趣。我们这里有一个，嗯，我不知道，感觉有点标准。嗯，有意思。看，你用这个工具的一个挑战是，你开始找到一些你无法总是分辨他们是不是**机器人**的人，这是 **Grock** 的一个挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Okay. So, uh what we are looking for here is we're trying to find some good social media uh candidates. And so let's say help me find uh posters on X that are fans of Zapier, no code, agent building, automation and related topics. Uh, I want posters that share tutorials and education related ideas, you know. Um, let's see. Uh, what else do we want? Um, these posters should have modest followings. Um, not too much, but not too little. Um, I'm looking for diamonds in the rough. Let's see. Uh, what else might we want? Uh, let's say we're on a budget. So, um, we're on a budget, so look for folks outside the Bay Area. We don't want Zuck to get his hands on these people. Um let's um you know g give me let's just say like give me 10 ideas. So we'll just start with this uh and see what comes up with here. Um I will like when we're looking for folks I will do this um to just do tons of revs for it because sourcing candidates is crazy times like you have recruiters like they do this stuff all the time. Um but they all love LinkedIn and they use like LinkedIn stuff. I find Grock like helps you find just a different slice of the market that people are not looking for. And because you can ask it um through natural language, you can do these kind of odd searches that are like really hard to do in kind of like LinkedIn's like boolean search um tools. Uh and so you end up finding people that you're like, "Oh, it's kind of interesting." And it's great for other stuff, too. Like if you're looking for um like a lot of folks do uh influencer marketing these days. Well, if you want like this would be a very simple way for me to source uh potential like folks to do influencer marketing or you know if I wanted to find people who just might have product feedback for me. Say you're like a new startup and you want to go find people who have a certain problem you could do the same way. So um you know Grock is like a people finder uh is a really helpful tool. Um, all right. So, you can see here we've got a handful of um folks that they sent over. So, you've got automation king uh who's sharing tutorials. You've got uh uh Ritz talks. Um we've got a lot of folks from India, Nigeria, etc. So, there must be like a hot bed of um no code talent going on in there. Interesting. So, you could click through to these and you know start to check out uh different profiles here. Actually, I'm not sharing I'm sharing just a tab. Let's just hover and see what we get here. Um, all right. That's kind of interesting. Um, a thousand day challenge. That's kind of interesting. Um, someone's maybe like building out like a whole education curriculum. Um, so that's interesting. We've got one here that's um, uh, I don't know, that's like kind of pretty standard, I feel like. Uh, interesting. See, a lot of the one challenge you have with this is you start to find folks who like I can't always tell if they're bots or that's the one challenge with the Gro stuff.

</details>

**Claire**: 不是机器人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Not a bot.

**Wade Foster**: 我知道，对吧？所以，我们说“不是机器人”。然后我们说：“给我一些头像使用真实面孔的人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: I know, right? So, let's say let's do not a bot. And uh let's say uh give me people with real faces as

**Claire**: 那就是他们所说的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: avatars. Um is that what they're called?

**Wade Foster**: 用于个人资料。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: For profile for profile.

</details>

**Claire**: 头像不是戒指。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Avatar would be not a ring.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 是的。我们只在美国招聘。所以我们只找位于美国的求职者。给我 10 个新的想法。所以你可以和 **Grock** 这样来回互动，你就会找到，我们在这里寻找的是**沧海遗珠**。所以并不是所有人都很优秀。它只是帮助你发现那些你可能永远不会遇到的人。嗯，否则的话。而且有趣的是，当我看到你给出的这个列表时，我在想，你知道，也许不是所有这些候选人都很棒，但正如你所说，班加罗尔一定有一些**无代码**的事情正在发生，比如我们应该在那里举办更多的社区活动吗？这些会不会是——所以它能给你一些关于你市场细分领域（sub-segments）的想法，也许不是从招聘的角度，而是从客户参与、社区参与的角度来看，可能会非常棒。现在，让我们看看。这很有趣。这个在“只有 16 个关注者”方面做得不好。这很难学，很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Yeah. And let's do let's just do um we only let's say we only hire in the United States. So let's do United States located folks. Um give me uh you know 10 more ideas or something like that. So you can kind of just do this back and forth with Grock and you'll just find like like we're looking for diamonds in the rough here. So it's not that they're all winners. Um it's just to help you unsurface folks that you may never come across um otherwise. Well, and what's interesting about what I was thinking as it gave you this list is, you know, maybe not all those candidates would be great, but as you said, there must be something no code happening in Bangalore, like should we do more community events there? Like could these be so so it can give you ideas of kind of sub sub segments of your market that maybe maybe not for an employment perspective, but maybe for a customer engagement, community engagement perspective could be really great. Now, let's see. Here's interesting. This one didn't do a good job on the, you know, only 16 followers. That's tricky to learn tricky.

</details>

**Claire**: 你需要说用户名不能有超过两位数的数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: You need to say it cannot have numbers more than two digits in their username.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 这就是诀窍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Cuz that's the trick.

</details>

**Claire**: 没错。嗯，这里有几个看起来很不错的。嗯，我喜欢 **Nathan**。**Nathan** 看起来有点意思。所以，你知道，再说一次，招聘是一个有趣的事情。我告诉我的团队，招聘没有捷径，归根结底就是**数字游戏**。所以你只是想增加你发现有趣、有才华的人的**表面积**。而且你最终必须筛选很多东西才能找到他们。所以，嗯，顺便说一下，**Grock**，我们只看 **X** 帖子，但你可以问它：“嗯，你知道，找 10 个 **YouTuber** 怎么样？”所以你可以做同样的事情，**YouTuber** 可能更适合我们，因为这些人正在发布内容和视频。所以，嗯，你知道，你也可以这样做。所以，我确实喜欢它，嗯，是的，寻找**沧海遗珠**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: There you go. Um, here's a couple that look pretty good, though. Uh, I liked I liked Nathan. Nathan seems kind of interesting. So, you know, again, with recruiting, it's an interesting The thing I tell my team is there's there's no there's no shortcuts in recruiting is what it boils down to. It really is a numbers game. And so, you're just trying to like increase the surface area of your ability to find interesting, talented people. Uh, and you kind of just got to sift through a lot of lot of stuff to find them uh at the end of the day. So, um, Brock, also, by the way, we're looking at just X posts, but you can ask it. um you know how uh how about finding you know 10 YouTubers um so you can do kind of the same thing and YouTubers might actually be a better fit for us because these people are posting content and videos. So um you know you can do that as well. Uh, so I do like it for um yeah, finding finding diamonds in the rough.

</details>

**Claire**: 那么为什么是 **Grock** 呢？不仅仅是因为你可以访问 **X**，这只是市场的一个不同切片，不同于 **LinkedIn** 甚至解析 **YouTube**，还因为它拥有如此广泛的数据来源可以提取。我还喜欢我们刚刚在这里看到的推理，那就是 **Grock** 感到沮丧了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: And so why Grock? Not just because you have this access to X, which is just a different slice of the market than something like um LinkedIn or or even like parsing YouTube, but also because it has this like pretty broad um sources of data that it can pull in. I also love the reasoning we just saw here, which is Grock got frustrated.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 哦，天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Oh goodness.

</details>

**Claire**: 好的，这里有一些有前途的 **YouTuber**。有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Okay, here is here are promising YouTubers. Interesting.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 所以，我们看到了。**Zapier** 的 2025 年旅团指南。哦，这很棒。有人制作了这个。我喜欢。我得去看看。烦人的是它给了我他们的 **X** 个人资料，但我真正想看的是 **YouTube** 频道。所以我回去说：“嘿，你能把 **YouTube** 频道链接包含在表格里吗？”嗯，**Doc Williams**，我碰巧知道这个人很不错。所以这是一个不错的发现。嗯，我们这里有一个竞争对手。这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: So, there we go. Uh, Zapier's Brigade Guide 2025. Like, oh, that's nice. Somebody built that. I like that. I'd have to go the The thing that's annoying is it gives me their their X profile, but what I really want to go see is the YouTube channel. So, I go back and say like, "Hey, can you include the YouTube handle uh channel link in the um table here?" Um, Doc Williams, I happen to know this guy is quite good. So that's that's a nice find. Um we got a competitor in here. So that's interesting.

**Claire**: 他们可能不会去那里。嗯，是的。所以，我不知道。嗯，我认为我没有看到很多人以这种方式使用 **Grock**。所以，嗯，我认为这是一个有趣的工具，值得分享。它特别有用……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: They're probably not gonna go there. Uh yeah. So I don't know. It's uh I think it I don't see a lot of people using Grock in this way. So uh I think it is an interesting tool to share. It is especially helpful

</details>

**Wade Foster**: ……对于……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: for

</details>

**Claire**: ……那些大量使用 **Grock** 的社区。嗯，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: communities that are heavily on Gro. Um yeah,

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 比如我们过去使用它的另一个领域是寻找……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: like another area we've used it before in the past is finding

</details>

**Claire**: ……嗯，**技术 AI 人才**，因为很多关于 AI 的讨论都发生在 **X** 上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: um technical AI talent because there a lot of discussion about AI happens on um X

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 所以它在发现这些人方面真的很有帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: and so it is really helpful at surfacing those folks.

### AI转型下的未来工作与公司文化

**Claire**: 好的，这可能是我们“How I AI”节目中第一次 **Grock** 演示，我没想到会是关于招聘的。所以这对我们的节目来说是一个非常非常大的第一次，感谢你的展示。那么简单回顾一下我们今天看到的内容，我们通过 **Granola** 了解了你的会议到价值观的工作流程。我们还谈到了你如何始终为自己，作为 CEO，提供反馈和指导。我们看到了一个 **Zapier** **智能代理**，它提供面试反馈，帮助你做出“是”或“否”的早期招聘决定，并为你提供关于你面试风格的**元分析**。然后我们通过 **Grock** 在互联网上寻找那些“长期在线”的 **YouTuber**。所以这是一个端到端的、AI 原生 CEO 如何利用 AI 进行招聘、雇佣和文化价值观对齐的端到端流程。我将提出几个**闪电轮问题**，然后我们就会让你离开。所以我要问的第一个问题是，这很多都围绕着**人才**，而关于 AI 的讨论很多都围绕着哪些角色正在改变，哪些角色正在消失，以及哪些角色是持久的。你刚刚说了一些话，那就是很多以前对公司来说在经济上不可行的任务现在可以完成了，我认为这是一整套可以在组织中完成的工作，但你仍然在寻找人才。所以，我必须问你，即使在所有这些 AI 转型中，你仍然觉得哪些角色是**竞争激烈**的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Well, this was our first I think our first Grock walkthrough on how I AI and I did not expect it to be around recruiting. So a very very first for for our show and thanks for showing it. So just to recap what we looked at today, we saw your meetings to values workflow via granola. We also talked a little bit about how you have sort of always feedback and coaching even for yourself as a CEO. We looked at a Zapier agent for giving interview feedback to make yes or no hiring, you know, kind of early calls and give you some meta analysis on your interview style. And then we are going to find terminally online YouTubers to she'll know on the internet via Grock. So this was a end to end how to AI native CEO endto end how to do recruiting and hiring and culture values alignment with AI. I'm going to do a couple lightning round questions and then we are going to get you out of here. So the first one that I have to ask is this has been a lot around talent and the conversation on AI has been a lot of like what roles are changing, what roles are going away and what roles are durable and you just said something which is a lot of tasks that were just not economically viable for companies now can get done and I think that's a whole set of work that can get done in an organization but you're still hunting for talent. So I have to ask you what roles you still feel are like highly competitive uh right now even in the middle of all this AI transformation.

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 所以我们对**工程人才**、**工程领导人才**的需求是永不满足的，我们一直在非常稳定地招聘这类人才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: So we're insatiable for engineering talent engineering engineering leadership like that we're hiring very very consistently.

</details>

**Claire**: 不过你提问的方式很有趣，就是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: There's an interesting way you phrase the question though which was um

</details>

**Wade Foster**: ……哪里仍然对**顶尖人才**有需求？我认为答案是**到处都有**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: where is there still demand for top talent? And I think the answer is for top talent everywhere. everywhere.

</details>

**Claire**: 到处都有。我看到有问号的地方是非常**高度专业化**的角色，它们专注于一项非常具体的任务，而现在这项任务几乎完全由 AI 完成。所以你可能会想到经典的**分析师角色**，比如：“嘿，我要去做一些竞争研究。”现在这只是一个**提示词**。所以你可以提升这项工作。你可以构建**智能代理**来帮助协调这些事情，然后你可以在其他领域重新部署自己。所以我看待大多数**知识工作**，然后说：“嘿，你的工作有一个版本可以被提升，让你产生更高得多的影响力，但这需要你投资于工具，需要你学习这些东西。”我最担心的是那些拥有大量从事这些工作的人的组织。那是一个非常艰难的地方，因为你肯定不再需要那么多那样的人了。所以我觉得，如果你处于那种情况，你必须找到一种方法来提升自己。因为那会很艰难。但大多数工作，我觉得都有**顶尖人才**。我需要**顶尖设计师**。我需要**顶尖招聘人员**。我需要**顶尖产品经理**。我需要**顶尖营销人员**。我需要**顶尖销售代表**。所有这些，我都没有停止招聘他们。只是“顶尖”的含义已经改变了很多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Everywhere where I see question marks is very hyper specialized roles that focus on a very particular task where that task is now almost entirely done by AI. So you think like your classic like analyst roles where it's like hey I'm going to go uh do like competitive research on a bunch of it's like that's a prompt now. Uh and so there are ways in which you can elevate that job. You can build agents that help orchestrate this stuff and then you can sort of redeploy yourself in other areas. And so I look at most knowledge work and say hey there is a version of your job that can be elevated and allow you to have much much higher impact but it requires you to invest in the tools and requires you to learn these things. And the places I worry most are in organizations that have fleets of these people doing these jobs. That's the place that's really tough because you definitely don't need fleets of those folks anymore. And so that's where I feel like, you know, if you're in that situation, you got to find a way to elevate yourself. Um because that's going to be tough. Um but most most jobs I feel like there is like top talent. I I I need top designers. I need top recruiters. I need top PMs. I need top marketers. I need top sales reps. Like all of these things, I'm not done hiring them. Um, it's just what it means to be top has has changed quite a bit.

</details>

**Claire**: 是的，我完全同意。我喜欢你公司内部正在做的事情是，你不仅积极招聘符合这种新形象的人，而且正如我们一开始谈到的，你还投入时间和精力来培养团队的这些技能。所以，我很好奇，作为一个非常积极投入并可能通过你的产品在过去两年中的演变，实际上改变了很多人工作方式的人，这在多大程度上改变了公司？有什么不同？有什么相同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Yeah, I completely agree. And what I like about what you're doing inside the company is you've just leaned in to not only hiring people who fit this new profile, but again, as we talked about at the beginning, investing in time and development for your team to build these skills. And so I'm curious as someone who has leaned in very hard and probably changed how a lot of people do their job probably by by practical nature of how your product has evolved over the past two years and allowed them to do their job little very differently. How has that changed the company if if at all? What feels different? What feels the same?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 你知道，到处都有**反馈机器人**。所以你总是能得到关于事情的指导和反馈。嗯，你知道，我们一直有很多**自动化**，所以这并不觉得有什么新奇。比如我们的 **Slack** 相当“脱缰”，表情符号反应会触发各种各样的东西。嗯，在 **Zapier** 内部，一个新人进来，说：“哦，这个表情符号很酷。我用这个来回应。”然后没有意识到这实际上是连接到某个东西的，他们就会触发一系列**自动化**。大多数时候，这都是一些相当良性的东西。所以它大多只会引来一笑。它没有连接到任何非常关键的东西。嗯，但这种情况在 **Zapier** 内部一直存在。嗯，你知道，我认为我们下一个机会在于如何开始打破更多的**信息孤岛**？我们已经在组织的部分区域开始这样做，但这感觉是更难的文化任务之一，你正在将两个职能家族合并，并说：“实际上，现在它们需要合二为一。”嗯，我们开始在某些地方看到这种情况。嗯，你知道，我不会坐在这里说：“你知道，我们现在只有建造者了。没有产品经理、设计师、工程师之类的东西了。”我们还没到那一步。嗯，我认为，你知道，其中一些东西在 2025 年感觉有点言过其实，但在 2030 年……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: You know there like there's feedback bots everywhere. So you're like constantly getting coaching and feedback on things. Um, you know, we've always had a lot of automation, so that doesn't feel all that new. Like our Slack is pretty unhinged with like, um, you know, emoji reactions trigger all sorts of stuff. Um, and it's not too uncommon of a scenario inside of Zapier for like a new person to come in and like, "Oh, that's a cool emoji. I'll react with this." And not realize that like that is actually attached to something. And they'll they'll, you know, trigger a suite of automations. Most of the time it's like pretty benign stuff. Uh, and so it mostly gets a chuckle. It's not hooked up to anything like crazy critical. Um, but that has always been the case inside of Zavier. Um, you know, I think the the next chapter for us where I see opportunity is how do we start to like break down more of these silos? We've already started doing this in parts of parts of the organization, but this feels like one of the harder culture tasks where you're taking, you know, two job families and saying, "Actually, these need to become one now." And um we're starting to see that in pockets. Uh you know, I wouldn't sit up here and say like, you know, there's uh you know, we we only have builders now. There's no such thing as like a product manager, a designer, an engineer. We're not that far. Um I I think, you know, some of that stuff feels a little overstated in 2025, but in 2030,

</details>

**Claire**: 我不知道。我曾在 2023 年说过，所以我只是在等待它成为现实。我只是每年都说我错了，但一旦它发生，我就会说：“看，看我，我有证据。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: I don't know. I I famously said it in 2023, so I'm just waiting for it to become true. I'm just either I get to every year I get to say I'm wrong for now, but as soon as it happens, I'm going to say, "Look, look at me. I have I have the receipts."

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我认为你的方向是正确的。只是时间范围有点棘手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: I think you're directionally correct. It's the time horizon that's tricking.

</details>

**Claire**: 时间范围。没错。完全正确。好的。我的最后一个问题，我问每个人。你看起来是个非常好的人，但是当 AI 不给你想要的东西时，当 **Grock** 变得傲慢时，你的**提示策略**是什么？你如何处理它？你如何应对？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Horizon. Exactly. That's exactly right. Well, okay. My last question I ask everybody. You seem like a really nice person, but when AI is just not giving you what you want, when Grock is being sassy, what is your prompting strategy? How do you handle it? How do you deal?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 是的。我基本上有两种方法。一种是比较客气的，你知道，比如“请做这个，请做那个，谢谢”等等。然后如果我真的真的得不到想要的结果，我就会变得非常简短，比如“不，再试一次。不，这样做不同。”所以这就是我的惯用方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Yeah. I I basically have two bows. One is like pretty pleasant, you know, hey, please do this, please do that, thank you, etc., and then if I'm really really not getting it, I get pretty curt, no, try again. No, do this different. Uh, so that that's my my go-to.

</details>

**Claire**: 好的。你觉得这些策略在**提示 Zapier 智能代理**时真的有效吗？比如我看到很多 **Markdown**。我们应该在里面放**全大写**吗？我们应该说“如果你做得对，我就给你一美元”吗？你在你的**智能代理提示**中测试过这些吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: Good. Do you um do you feel like any of those strategies actually work in prompting zap your agents? Like I see a lot of markdown. Should we put all caps in there? Should we say I'll give you a dollar if you do this right in in our agent prompt? Have you tested any of that?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 我测试过。我无法判断它是否有效。我认为它没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: I I I have. I can't tell if it makes a difference or not. I I think it doesn't.

</details>

**Claire**: 我认为我们如何**提示**更多地反映了我们自己，而不是我们的 AI 主宰者。好的，**Wade**，这真是太棒了。我知道一点点在哪里可以找到你，但我们可以在哪里找到你，以及我们如何能帮助你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire**: I think how we how we prompt is more of a reflection of us than it is of our AI overlords. Well, Wade, this has been fabulous. Where can I know a little bit of where we can find you, but where can we find you and then how can we be helpful to you?

</details>

**Wade Foster**: 是的。嗯，我就是 **Wade Foster**，在 **X** 和 **LinkedIn** 上。嗯，你应该看看 **Zapier**。看看 **Zapier Agents**。**智能代理**是一种与人们可能熟悉的 **Zapier** 不同的**自动化**构建方式。所以一定要去看看。嗯，你知道，如果你——我的意思是，你正在看“How I AI”，你想要在一家“AI 狂热”的公司工作，那么就来看看我们吧，我们正在招聘各地的**顶尖人才**。所以我们很乐意让你在 **Zapier** 内部构建疯狂的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wade Foster**: Yeah. Uh I am, you know, Wade Foster on X on LinkedIn. Uh you should check out Zappier. check out Zapper agents. Like agents are a way different way to build automations than folks maybe are familiar with with Zapier. Uh so definitely check those out. And uh you know if you're I mean shoot you're watching how I AI like you want to work at a company that's AI pilled so to say like check out we're hiring top talent everywhere. So we'd love to have you build crazy stuff inside of Zap here.
