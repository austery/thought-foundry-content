title: 从《好莱坞往事》到《搏击俱乐部》：电影如何成为解读美国的钥匙

### 电影中的好莱坞：解读美国的棱镜

>> 很高兴 Modern the Situation 团队再次回归，带来新一期的电影节目。马克，感谢再次加入。

>> 我们想更深入地探讨一些我们最喜欢的电影。马克，从和你一起看电影的经历中，我知道你喜欢的一个类型是关于好莱坞的电影。所以，我们想从《好莱坞往事》开始。你为什么不谈谈这部电影有何非凡之处，或者你为什么想讨论它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, excited to have the Modern the Situation crew back for another episode on movies. Mark, thanks for joining again. Yes. Excited.<br><br>>> So, we want to go deeper into some of our favorite movies. Mark, I know from watching movies with you that one of your genres you enjoy is movies about Hollywood. And so, we wanted to start with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why don't you talk about what's so remarkable about that or why you wanted to talk about it?</p>
</details>

>> 我之所以喜欢关于好莱坞的电影，原因之一是它们通常非常有趣。因为拍摄这些电影的人本身就来自好莱坞，他们知道所有内幕。而且他们往往会把这些内幕都放进电影里。所以这些电影都非常精彩。对于没看过的人，我推荐《穆赫兰道》，这是埃里克最喜欢的电影之一。

>> 还有《噩梦》。

>> 还有《大玩家》，那也是一部经典之作。当然，还有很多著名的电影，比如《日落大道》。但现在最具代表性的好莱坞电影，无疑是昆汀·塔伦蒂诺执导的《好莱坞往事》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The reason I like movies about Hollywood, I mean, one is they tend to be very entertaining because of course the people who make movies about Hollywood are from Hollywood and they know where all the bodies are buried. And they tend to put them all in the movies. And so they're all spectacular Hollywood movies. So for people who haven't seen, I would recommend Mulholland Drive. It's one of Eric's favorites.<br><br>>> nightmares run it<br><br>>> and, and then The Player, which also is an all-time one there. You know, there's a bunch of, of course, famous ones like Sunset Boulevard, but the iconic, you know, clearly the iconic Hollywood movie now is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, by Quentin Tarantino.</p>
</details>

>> 我喜欢好莱坞电影的原因是，有少数几个城市可以声称自己是“终极美国城市”。纽约是其中之一，我们所在的旧金山在某些方面也是。洛杉矶和拉斯维加斯也在这个名单上。顺便说一下，关于拉斯维加斯，可以去看《巴格西》，那是标志性的拉斯维加斯电影，我们改天再聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The reason I like Hollywood movies is because there are a handful of cities that have a claim to be like the ultimate American city. New York City is one of those. I think San Francisco in some ways, where we are is. Los Angeles and Las Vegas also put on the list. But, by the way, for Las Vegas, see Bugsy, we can talk about that another time. But that's the iconic Vegas movie.</p>
</details>

>> 但洛杉矶在很多方面都可以被描述为典型的美国城市。有一本很棒的书叫《Thinking Big》，书中讲述了洛杉矶这座城市的创建过程。可以说，洛杉矶是终极的美国城市，因为它是一个终极的“假装直到成功”的典范。它就像是城市中的西拉诺斯（Theranos）。具体来说，那里原本是沙漠，一无所有。在19世纪末，一群富裕家族把它变成了一个土地开发项目。他们在美国东部的报纸上刊登广告——那时候摄影还没进入报纸，所以报纸上的图片都是手绘的。他们会刊登洛杉矶待售地块的广告，配上果园、绿树、棕榈树的素描画。人们买了地，横穿整个国家搬过去，结果发现那里只是一片荒芜的沙漠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But LA in a lot of ways is sort of you could describe it as the archetypal American city. And literally, there's a great book we can put in the notes called Thinking Big where it goes into the creation of the city of Los Angeles. And basically, Los Angeles you could argue is the ultimate American city because it was the ultimate "fake it until you make it" thing. Like it was the Theranos of cities. And very specifically, it was desert, like there was absolutely nothing in LA. And then it was like a land development deal by a bunch of wealthy families in the late 1800s. And they literally placed newspaper ads in eastern newspapers. This is before photography made it into newspapers. And so when there was a picture of something in a newspaper, it'd be a drawing. And so they would list land plots for sale in Los Angeles and they would have like line drawings of orchards and beautiful everything's green and palm trees. And then people would buy the land, move across the country, and discover that it was just like blasted out desert.</p>
</details>

>> 后来，他们众所周知地创建了这座城市，从沙漠中开辟出来。还有一个著名的传奇故事，就是他们如何去取水，这个故事后来被拍成了另一部伟大的洛杉矶电影——《唐人街》。如你所料，好莱坞对历史有其特定的解读方式，所以回过头来看，这件事被描绘成一种纯粹的邪恶行为。但实际上，有一种非常直接的解读，那就是创建一个城市所必需的代价。这并非好莱坞历史所呈现的非黑即白，而是一个更复杂的故事，但仍然非常有趣，令人惊叹。像洛杉矶这样的城市并非每天都能被创造出来，所以这是一件了不起的大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then they famously created the city, they carved it out of the desert. And then they famously, it's a famous saga of how they went to get the water, which turned into another great LA movie, Chinatown. And you know, as you'd expect, Hollywood kind of goes for a certain interpretation of history. And so it, you know, sort of painted in retrospect as like a purely evil activity, but there's actually a very kind of straightforward reading, which is like this is what was actually required to create a city. And it wasn't as black and white as the Hollywood history has it. It was a more complex story, but still, very, very interesting, amazing story. And, you know, cities like Los Angeles aren't created every day. So that's a pretty big deal.</p>
</details>

>> 所以，我认为关于洛杉矶的电影，当它们达到“大写的艺术”的层面时，它们就成了关于美国的电影。它就像一个伟大的试验场，或者说一个伟大的主题，一个审视美国历史的绝佳镜头。而《好莱坞往事》就是这个主题下最顶尖的电影之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So anyway, like movies about LA, I think when they reach the level of capital A art, they become movies about America. It's like a great test bed or a great subject, or a great lens through which to look at the history of America. And Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is, I would say, one of the top movies along that theme.</p>
</details>

### 《好莱坞往事》：重塑1969年的文化转折点

>> 我先说一句，如果看这个视频的任何人还没看过《好莱坞往事》，请立刻暂停，去看电影，然后再回来，因为我们会剧透。如果你没看过，这部电影观看起来会非常有趣。顺便说一句，这本身就是一部极具娱乐性的电影，是那种可以无限重看的电影。演员阵容简直不可思议，每一帧画面都令人惊叹。所以它也是一部非常有趣的电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Let me start by saying if anybody watching this hasn't seen Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, pause the podcast immediately. Go watch the movie and then come back because we are going to spoil it. And it's tremendously fun to watch if you haven't read about it. By the way, I'd also say it's a tremendously entertaining movie. Like it's one of the most entertaining movies. It's like infinitely rewatchable. The cast is ridiculous. Every frame of the thing is amazing. So it's also a very fun movie.</p>
</details>

>> 好了，现在来说说《好莱坞往事》更深远的意义，或者说我的看法。它捕捉了一个对现代美国演变至关重要的时间和地点。我记得那一年是1969年。

>> >> 69年，是的。

>> 69年。为了让大家理解背景，电影虽然展示了当时发生的事情，但并没有解释所有的文化背景，所以我来解释一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So okay, so here's the larger significance of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or my view of it, which is it captures a time and place that was absolutely critical to the evolution of modern America. And I think Katherine, you'll remind me, but I think the year was it '69?<br><br>>> '69, yeah.<br><br>>> '69, yeah. '69. And so to put this in context, and the movie kind of goes through this, but the movie doesn't explain all the cultural backstory. It shows you what happened, but it doesn't explain the backstory, so I'll just go through the backstory.</p>
</details>

### 1960年代的文化背景：从乐观到幻灭

>> 我们现在所说的1960年代的文化大革命，大概始于1964年的伯克利言论自由运动，然后逐渐扩展，包含了嬉皮士运动、现代摇滚乐的诞生以及**反主流文化**（Counterculture: 指与社会主流价值观和行为准则相对立的亚文化）的兴起。突然之间，每个人都留着长发，戴着珠子，穿着麂皮夹克，不洗他们的李维斯牛仔裤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, basically, what we now consider to be the cultural revolution of the 1960s really started probably in around 1964 with the Berkeley free speech movement and then kind of expanded or metastasized to include the hippie movements and then the birth of like modern rock and roll and the rise of the counterculture. And all of a sudden everybody has long hair and they've got beads and they're wearing suede jackets and they're not washing their Levis's. And sort of the whole counterculture.</p>
</details>

>> 当时正值婴儿潮一代作为高中生和大学生步入成年，艺术、文化、创造力、社会创新都出现了令人难以置信的爆发。公社诞生了，整个嬉皮士运动兴起了。当然，这也是越南战争逐步升级的时期，征兵规模扩大，美国年轻人被非自愿地派往越南。于是，反战运动和大学校园抗议活动也随之兴起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so there was this incredible explosion of, this is when the baby boomers were coming of age as basically high school and college kids, this incredible explosion of art, culture, creativity, social innovation, the birth of the communes, the entire hippie movement. And then, of course, this is also when the Vietnam war was ramping up. And so this was the ramp up in conscription of American kids being sent off to Vietnam, but say non-volunteers. And so, the anti-war movement kicked in, the college protest kicked in.</p>
</details>

>> 我们通常将这段时期记忆为一场自发的、基本上是积极的爆发，它打破了1940、50年代僵化的文化规范，创造了现代解放的美国社会。与此同时，民权运动、女权主义、同性恋权利运动也蓬勃发展，现代道德观念在那个时期全面爆发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And the entire thing was, and we kind of remember it as this incredibly spontaneous and largely positive explosion of breaking out of the stultified cultural norms of the 1940s, 1950s, the creation of the modern kind of liberated American society. By the way, obviously also right alongside that, the civil rights movement and feminism, the gay rights and kind of all the whole explosion of modern morality through that period.</p>
</details>

>> 如果你阅读当时的历史，从64年到69年，这基本上是一件光荣而美好的事情，几乎没有任何负面影响。那些在大学校园里骚乱、在街头抗议、整天吸食大麻、过着嬉皮士生活、搬到公社回归土地的年轻人，似乎发现了一种更优越的生活方式。他们发现了与自然共存、反抗“当权者”、反抗邪恶公司、为环境、为地球、为和平而战的更优越的方式。所以，这是一股令人难以置信的积极浪潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And anyway, from if you read the histories of the time, basically from '64 to '69 it was just basically this glorious, wonderful thing with absolutely no downside. Like these kids that were rioting on their college campuses or protesting in the streets or getting stoned all day or having their whole hippie thing or moving to communes and going back to the earth, they had discovered a far superior way to live, right? They had discovered a far superior way to coexist with nature and to fight against the man and to fight against evil corporations and fight for the environment, to fight for the planet, fight for peace and the whole thing. And so it was this incredible kind of wave of positivity.</p>
</details>

>> 当然，有很好的论据说这其中确实有很多积极的成分，很多人也相信这一点。那是一个文化创造力极强的时代，催生了大量我们至今仍在欣赏的杰出艺术。所以，它有很多值得称道的地方。然后，在1969年，这一切戛然而止。这场运动的积极性突然刹车，转向了非常黑暗的一面，开始了漫长的滑向1970年代的颓势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And look, a very good argument that there was a lot to it. A lot of people do believe that. And then, it was a time of great cultural creativity that led to enormous amounts of amazing art that we still have today. And so there's a lot to like about it. And then basically what happened is in 1969, the positivity came to a screeching halt. And sort of the movement basically turned very much to the dark side and that sort of began the long slide into the 1970s.</p>
</details>

>> 这场滑坡体现在很多方面，比如毒品问题变得非常糟糕，从软性毒品转向硬性毒品，导致大量吸毒过量。许多参与60年代文化运动的人最终死亡。我们稍后会谈到死亡，因为电影直接触及了这一点，但随之而来的是惊人数量的死亡和堕落。性解放也显现出其阴暗面，也许它对每个人都不是那么好，尤其对女性在某些方面可能不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And that slide was basically a slide into, variously among other things, it was a slide into drugs going very bad, drug overdoses, the shift from soft drugs to hard drugs. A lot of people who participated in this cultural movement of the 60s ended up dying. We'll talk about the death later on because the movie directly hits that, but there's just an extraordinary amount of death that followed, degradation. And it turned into, you know, the sexual liberation, it turns out, has dark sides and maybe it isn't so great for everybody and specifically maybe it isn't so great for women, at least in some ways.</p>
</details>

>> 到了70年代，越南战争局势恶化，能源危机、经济衰退、通货膨胀接踵而至，政治也变得尖锐分裂。在很多方面，我们今天看到的政治动态就是从那个时候开始的。所以70年代情况变得非常糟糕。可以说，《好莱坞往事》是关于那个转折点的电影，而《不羁夜》或许是另一端的电影，它捕捉了当文化滑向混乱、疯狂、疾病和死亡时的景象。但今天，我们主要关注1969年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then in the '70s it was like Vietnam went very bad and then the energy crisis and economic recession and then inflation and just this very kind of bitter, divisive politics. In a lot of ways, the beginning of the political kind of dynamic that we see playing out today. And so the '70s, things went really bad. And the bookending movie, Once Upon a Time is the movie sort of about that pivot point. I'll talk about that. And then, Boogie Nights is maybe the movie on the other side of that, right? Which is like, once the culture is kind of sliding down a hill into chaos and madness and disease of death, Boogie Nights captures that on the other side. But for the purpose of today's discussion, we can focus on 1969.</p>
</details>

>> 如果你阅读当时的历史，基本上是查尔斯·曼森谋杀案——特别是在洛杉矶发生的这起案件——成为了转折点。人们普遍认为，曼森谋杀案是让大家意识到“哦，这整件事有黑暗的一面，天哪，我们麻烦大了”的那个时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so if you read the history of the time, basically what happened was it was the Charles Manson murders, specifically in Los Angeles. And then sort of on behalf of America, it was the Manson murders that basically were the turning point. It's the Manson murders are the thing that people point to and they kind of say, "Oh, that was the moment when we all kind of realized, oh, like there's a dark side of this whole thing and like, oh my god, here we go."</p>
</details>

### 塔伦蒂诺的“另类历史”：一部献给莎朗·塔特的情书

>> 让我们详细谈谈。如果你了解那个时期的历史，你就会知道曼森谋杀案在当时非常出名，至今在美国文化中也很有名。大家都知道有个叫查尔斯·曼森的人，他有一个死亡邪教，能让一些年轻人出去随机杀人。至今人们仍在问，他到底是怎么做到的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so let's talk about that at length. Let me just close off this introductory part though with kind of the most amazing thing about the movie that I found, which is if you know the history of that period, you know about the Manson murders. They were super famous at the time. They're still famous in American culture. Kind of everybody knows that there was this guy Charles Manson that had this death cult. He was able to get these kids to like go out and kill random people. And there's still like all these questions like, how the hell did he do that?</p>
</details>

>> 大家都知道他与好莱坞、电影业和音乐界有所交集，他是那个圈子的一部分。对于了解此事的人来说，曼森谋杀案也以莎朗·塔特谋杀案而闻名。因为当时有一位名叫莎朗·塔特的年轻金发女演员，她活泼、迷人、热情洋溢。当时她嫁给了罗曼·波兰斯基，他是当时好莱坞新锐导演之一。他们是好莱坞新的魅力权力夫妻。莎朗·塔特是其中一名遇害者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Everybody knows that he was kind of intertwined with Hollywood and intertwined with the movie industry and the music industry and he was part of that whole thing. And then specifically for people who know anything about that, they're sort of famously the Manson murders are also known as the Sharon Tate murders. Because there was this incredibly vivacious, attractive, bubbly, enthusiastic young blonde actress named Sharon Tate. Who at the time famously was actually married to Roman Polanski who was one of the leading, new Hollywood movie directors of that time. They were this basically this new Hollywood glamour power couple. And then Sharon Tate and among other people, Sharon Tate was one of the people murdered.</p>
</details>

>> 所以，当昆汀·塔伦蒂诺宣布他要拍一部关于查尔斯·曼森谋杀案的电影时，如果你看过他任何一部电影，比如《低俗小说》，你就会想：“天哪，这会很可怕。” 曼森谋杀案本身已经够糟糕了，再把它变成塔伦蒂诺式的，像《落水狗》那样血肉横飞的大屠杀暴力片，简直就是一场恐怖秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So Quentin Tarantino comes out, when he first announces the movie, he comes out and he says, Quentin Tarantino is going to make the movie about the Charles Manson murders, right? And if you've seen any other Tarantino movie like Pulp Fiction, for example, you're just like, "Oh my god, this is going to be horrible." Like the Manson murders are bad enough, but turning them into a Tarantino style mass slaughter violence, you know, Reservoir Dogs, just like blood and guts, basically super high exploitation movie as he had done in the past, it was a horror show.</p>
</details>

>> 我当时个人也很担心，因为我妻子非常兴奋地想去看这部电影，因为它由莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥和布拉德·皮特主演，是关于好莱坞、时尚、设计和创造力的。她说：“我们一定要去看这部电影。”我跟她说：“我们不能去，因为你会被银幕上的内容创伤到再也不想看任何电影，而且你下半辈子都会因为我没阻止你而怪我。这显然会是一场彻头彻尾的灾难。” 事实上，莎朗·塔特的家人在电影首次宣布时也站出来说：“等等，我们不希望我们家人的记忆被好莱坞拿来剥削利用。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I was actually personally worried about it because my wife got all excited to see the movie because it's going to star Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt and it's going to be about Hollywood and it's about fashion and design and all this creativity. And she's like, "We got to go see this movie." And I'm like, "We can't go see the movie because you are going to be so traumatized by what he puts on screen, that you're never going to want to ever see a movie ever again. And you're going to hold it against me for the rest of my life that I didn't prevent you from seeing this movie because it's obviously just going to be a complete horror show. Like, it's just going to be a disaster." And actually Sharon Tate's family actually came out and basically said when this movie was first announced, "Wait a minute, hold on. We don't want the memory of our family member, who we still love many decades later, turned into basically fodder for Hollywood exploitation."</p>
</details>

>> 然后发生了一件神奇的事情。据记载，塔伦蒂诺让莎朗·塔特的妹妹（或类似亲属）读了剧本。之后，她的家人立刻180度大转弯，公开表示完全赞同。我记得当时读到这个新闻时，心想：“这到底是怎么回事？他怎么可能让塔特的家人同意把这件事搬上银幕？” 当然，这最终引出了电影的转折——它变成了一封写给好莱坞、写给美国，特别是写给莎朗·塔特的情书。它以一种惊人的方式恢复了她的记忆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then there was this amazing thing that happened, and nobody knew anything about the movie, which is Tarantino, at least the way the story is recorded, actually let, I think it was Sharon Tate's sister or something like that, read the script. And immediately the family did a 180 and they came right out and they said we completely approved. And I remember at the time reading that and I was like, what the hell? How is it that he could possibly get the Tate family of all people on board with putting this on screen? And of course, that leads to kind of that, the movie sort of turns into a valentine to Hollywood and to America and specifically to Sharon Tate. It really kind of restores her memory in an amazing way.</p>
</details>

>> >> 他在电影里做了一件非常聪明的事。对于我们这些喜欢塔伦蒂诺并关注他作品的人来说，普遍的担忧是“天哪，这会很恐怖”。特别是如果你读过关于曼森谋杀案的资料，知道它们有多么血腥。但他的上一部杰作是复仇幻想片《无耻混蛋》，那部电影虽然也极其血腥，但它是一个关于“如果有人杀了希特勒会怎样”的复仇幻想。所以在《好莱坞往事》的开头，有一场戏展示了莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥的所有电影，其中他拿着《无耻混蛋》里那把著名的火焰喷射器。所以如果你是塔伦蒂诺的粉丝，你就会想：“等等，我们要往哪个方向走？是毫无目的的血腥暴力，还是一个更奇幻、关于‘可能发生什么’的不同方向？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> He did something very smart in the movie for those of us who love Tarantino and follow his work. So, I think that was the common theme, was like, "Oh god, this is going to be horrific." Right? And especially if you've read about the Manson murders, if you've read about how gruesome they are, yes, that was the dominant theme. But his last other fantastic Tarantino film was the revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds, which is of course, again, could have been extremely gruesome, but at the same time, it's a revenge fantasy of what could have happened. What could have happened if someone had killed Hitler? And so in the very beginning of the movie, there's a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio where it shows all of his films and he has the famous flamethrower from Inglourious Basterds. And so if you're a Tarantino fan, you're like, "Wait, wait, wait. Which direction are we going in? Are we going in gruesome violence with no purpose, or are we going in a different direction, a little more fantastical, a little more what could have happened?"</p>
</details>

>> >> 对于我们这些在影院里眼尖的观众来说，尤其是当家人都说“哦，没关系，会很好的”时候，我们大概知道这部电影不会那么糟糕。塔伦蒂诺会带我们走向一个不同的方向，但他在电影的前十分钟里为我们埋下了那个小小的彩蛋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so for those of us with the eagle eye in the theater, I think we kind of knew, you know, especially as you said, like the family said, "Oh, it's great. It's going to be fine." We kind of knew, okay, this film is not going to be nearly as bad. And Tarantino is going to take us in a different direction, but he did put that little Easter egg in there for us in like the first 10 minutes of the film.</p>
</details>

>> 有趣的是，我看电影时完全错过了那个彩蛋。莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥扮演一个史蒂夫·麦奎因式的60年代电影明星，名叫里克，电影开始时他的事业正在走下坡路。电影展示了他之前电影的片段，我当时只觉得那个火焰喷射器是个随意的笑料。我完全没想到它会起关键作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, it's funny you bring that up because I of course totally missed that when I was watching the movie. I just thought it was like a throwaway. Leo DiCaprio plays a sort of a Steven McQueen style movie star in the 1960s named Rick. As the movie starts, his career is imploding. He's trying to figure out how to turn things around or stay relevant to the times and it shows these clips from his prior movies in the universe. And I just figured it was just like a throwaway. Oh yeah, I see with the flamethrower. That's funny. Haha. Like it didn't even for a minute occur to me. I mean, since we're going to spoil it, we'll just say the flamethrower plays a critical role.</p>
</details>

>> >> 一个非常关键的角色。

>> 你有见过比那部电影结尾拿出火焰喷射器时更让人高兴的场面吗？我当时真的很享受这部电影，但我不知道会发生什么。我知道为了让塔特家人同意，肯定会有一些我没想到的惊人转折，但我仍然在整个观影过程中都处于一种恐惧的状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> A very critical role.<br><br>>> Have you ever been happier to see the flamethrower get taken out than at the end of that movie? But yeah, I mean I enjoyed the movie so much when I was watching it, but I did not know. I mean, I knew it had to be something amazing that I wasn't expecting in order to get the Tate family on board, but I still was sitting there in a state of dread throughout the entire movie, still anticipating that he would somehow...</p>
</details>

>> 剧透一下，在《好莱坞往事》中，他讲述了当时好莱坞曼森邪教的故事，一直讲到谋杀案发生的那个晚上，但他对历史做了一个转折，讲述了一个另类历史。在电影里，那些在现实生活中谋杀了莎朗·塔特的曼森邪教徒，走进了隔壁的房子，也就是莱昂纳多的房子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Anyway, so to spoil the movie, in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, he basically tells you the story of the Manson cult in Hollywood at that time and sort of how that all intertwined. And he takes it all the way up to the night of the murders, but then he takes a left turn in the history as he does this alternative history. And so the Manson cultists who in real life murdered Tate, in the movie they go in the house next door which is Leo's house.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便说一下布拉德·皮特扮演的角色，塔伦蒂诺对他的构想是，他是当时世界上最致命的人。他不仅是战争英雄，还是个绿色贝雷帽，一个战功赫赫的超级士兵，后来成了好莱坞的特技演员。所以，那些曼森杀手基本上是走错了房子。因为第一，他们面对的是一个为美国杀了20年人的人，基本上就是美国队长。第二，原来莱昂纳多的车库里还留着那把火焰喷射器。

<p class="english-text">>> With Leo's friend Brad Pitt. And Brad Pitt's character, by the way, I don't know if you know the backstory on the Brad Pitt character, but it explains a lot, which is basically Tarantino's conception of him is he's basically the most deadly man in the world at that time. So he's like a Green Beret, like a super highly decorated, basically super soldier who's become a Hollywood stunt man. And so basically the Manson killers basically walked exactly to the wrong house because number one, they're up against this guy who basically spent the preceding 20 years killing people for America. Basically Captain America. And then number two, it turns out Leo still had the flamethrower in his garage.</p>

### 暴力、喜剧与历史的反思

>> >> 最终那场戏……你根本无法预料到它有多么天才。电影中有一段让你忘记你正在看一部关于曼森谋杀案的电影。有一段长达30分钟的戏中戏，里克·道尔顿（莱昂纳多扮演的角色）正在失去他在好莱坞的地位，他与一个11岁的小女孩一起主演一部有点俗气的西部片。这可能是对好莱坞演员遭遇的最佳概括。你完全忘记了莎朗·塔特和花花公子庄园，忘记了新一代和无法找到工作的旧一代硬汉。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> >> that final scene... there's no way you can anticipate how genius the run-up to it is. And then also the final scene, because there's this whole other thing that happens in the movie where you forget that you're watching a movie about the Mansons. You forget that you're watching this horrific thing. There's a 30-minute scene of Rick Dalton, who's this aging actor losing his place in Hollywood, at a loss for why he's no longer powerful. And he has this moment where he stars in this kind of cheesy western with this 11-year-old girl, and it's like a movie within a movie. And it is probably the best encapsulation of what happens to actors in Hollywood. So you kind of lose track of the fact that here's Sharon Tate and she's at the Playboy Mansion. She's dancing. She's this new generation, but here's this old generation of like hyper masculine figures who can't get work.</p>
</details>

>> >> 那个小女孩对他说：“这是我这辈子见过最棒的表演。” 这句台词令人难忘。即使电影就在那里结束，也同样精彩。但接着它又进入了另一个序列，你突然想起：“哦，对了，我们马上要看到最血腥的场面了。” 你会想象，如果这事发生在詹妮弗·劳伦斯或者玛格特·罗比（她正是扮演莎朗·塔特的人）身上，那将是多么可怕。但你几乎忘了，因为前面有太多美丽又搞笑的片段。你忘了你正在看一部本应以恐怖暴力结尾的电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> And there's this genius movie within a movie where the little girl says to him, and it's probably one of the most memorable lines, she's like, "That's the best acting I've ever seen in my whole life." And I mean, even if they'd stopped the movie there, it would have been just as brilliant, right? But then it goes on to this other sequence where you're like, "Oh yeah, we're about to see the most gruesome possible thing." And I can imagine, it's like if it happened to Jennifer Lawrence or if it happened to Margot Robbie, who's actually playing her, right? It would just be this horrific thing. But you kind of forget because there's all of these just beautiful, hilarious sequences that run up to it. You forget that you're watching a movie that's supposed to end in this horrific violence.</p>
</details>

>> >> 当然，它并没有那样结束。它以另一种形式的恐怖暴力结束，但不是曼森谋杀案中那种女性对女性的暴力，我认为这是电影的另一个潜台词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> And of course, it doesn't. It ends in a different type of horrific violence, but not the female-on-female violence that characterized the Manson murders, which I think is another kind of subtext of the film. It's just how gory and violent the actual episode is, but you don't actually see that.</p>
</details>

>> 那个小女孩演员，你知道她代表的是现实生活中的谁吗？

>> >> 我不知道。

>> 朱迪·福斯特。她代表了“新好莱坞”。朱迪·福斯特在那个时代是一个冉冉升起的童星，后来在《出租车司机》中迎来了突破性角色。她代表了那种更自然主义的表演风格，取代了50、60年代更程式化的风格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The little girl actress, who was she intended to be in real life?<br><br>>> I don't know, actually.<br><br>>> Jodie Foster. She's representative of new Hollywood. So Jodie Foster was in that era a rising child star. And then she had her breakup role in Taxi Driver where she's just like, you know, it's an incredibly revolutionary acting performance. And so she's sort of representative of the new Hollywood with the much more naturalistic acting style that took over from the much more stylized style of the 50s and 60s.</p>
</details>

>> 这部电影的宏大意义在于，如果曼森谋杀案是1960年代文化革命走向堕落的转折点，那么《好莱坞往事》就是对一个没有发生这种悲剧的、不同的美国的幻想或情书。它让一切都朝着一个更积极的方向发展。通过在银幕上呈现这个另类方向，我认为它恰恰凸显了现实中发生的事情有多么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So basically, the macro relevance of this, just to restate the thesis, is if the Manson murders were where the cultural revolution of the 1960s went bad, then Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is sort of the fantasy or the love letter to a different America in which that didn't happen, right? And things kept going in a much more positive direction. But by putting on screen the alternate direction, my view is like he really highlights how bad it was that that's not what happened.</p>
</details>

>> 曼森谋杀案的悲剧不仅在于遇害者及其家人的悲剧，这本身已是巨大的悲剧，更在于它对整个洛杉矶，乃至整个美国的悲剧。如果你和经历过那个时期的人交谈，你会发现洛杉矶的气氛很快就变得黑暗。人们被吓坏了，不知道还有多少连环杀手在逍遥法外，不知道还有多少邪教。突然之间，每个人都得锁门，人们不再出门。那也是连环杀手盛行时代的开端，比如泰德·邦迪。人们真的被吓得不轻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so that the tragedy of the Manson murders was not just the tragedy for the people who were killed and for their families, which is a profound tragedy, but the tragedy was for basically for all of LA. Because if you talk to people who were around during that period, like things got dark in LA very quickly. People were so freaked out by the Manson murders. They didn't know how many other serial killers were running around. They didn't know how many other cults there were. Everybody all of a sudden had to lock their doors. People stopped going out. And this was the beginning of the heyday of the serial killer, you know, with Ted Bundy and it was the beginning of this wave of these things where people got really, really seriously freaked out.</p>
</details>

>> >> 我回去重看了那段暴力的开端，那是一段很长的暴力序列。但我记忆犹新的是，在电影上映前我读了影评，他们试图不剧透，但评论家们的意见非常两极分化，都说“这太暴力了”。有趣的是，在影院里，观众的反应是极度的大笑。

>> >> 是的。

>> >> 在长达20分钟的最暴力片段里，你却在笑。银幕上发生的事情也很有趣：克里夫（特技演员）在那些人闯进来之前，抽了一根浸了LSD的香烟，他当时嗨得不行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> I went back and watched the beginning of the sequence because it's actually a long sequence of violence. But what I remember so much, I read the reviews before, and critics were very divided. It was like, "This is so violent. This is extremely violent." And what's funny about seeing it in the theater is that the reaction from the audience is extreme laughter.<br><br>>> Yes.<br><br>>> You are laughing during the most violent sequence for 20 minutes. And what's really funny about what's happening on screen too is that Cliff, the stuntman, right before, he smokes an LSD cigarette.</p>
</details>

>> >> 他当时嗨得像风筝一样，这也是其中一个有趣的部分。塔伦蒂诺对细节非常讲究，当他们进来时播放的音乐是The Supremes的《Set Me Free Why Don't You Babe》。所以这是一个完美的时刻：歌词唱着“解放我”，这些人闯了进来，他嗨着，心想“这是真的吗？” 但克里夫的反应是笑。他在嘲笑这些女人。而这些女人拿着刀，准备动手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> Yes. So he is high as a kite when these guys come in, which is also a funny part of it. The music that is playing when they come in is The Supremes' "Set Me Free Why Don't You Babe." So it's this perfect moment of "set me free" and these guys come in, he's high, and he's like, "Is this real?" But Cliff's response is laughter. He's laughing at these women, right? And these women, they have their knives, they are ready to do the deed.</p>
</details>

>> >> 他在笑。我认为在某种程度上，塔伦蒂诺总是在探讨男性暴力。他想表达的是，你是否能通过极端的暴力来消解历史上发生的任何事情的力量。想象一下，如果曼森家族当时遇到的是嘲笑，而不是恐惧。现实中，他们被视为最邪恶的魔鬼，这赋予了这种极端邪恶几十年的力量。而电影的观点是：如果克里夫，这个房间里最阳刚、最致命的男人，当时只是嗨了，然后笑了，然后放出他的比特犬去对付那些同样有点傻、有点嗨的女人呢？如果整件事变成了一场喜剧呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> And he's laughing. And I think in some ways, Tarantino always has these takes on masculine violence. Can you take the power out of whatever situation happened in history by just this extreme violence? If the Manson family had been met with laughter, right? Instead, they were met with fear. They were seen as the most evil, taken by the devil. That set off serial killers. It gave power to this extraordinary evil for decades. And I think the point of it is, what if Cliff, the most masculine, deadly man in the room, had just been high and laughed and, you know, sicked his pitbull on these women who are kind of silly and high themselves? And the whole thing had become a comedy?</p>
</details>

>> >> 它确实变成了一场持续20分钟的纯粹闹剧。尽管这可能是你近年来见过的最暴力的场面——布拉德·皮特的角色用电话把一个人活活打死——但这却是你见过最搞笑的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> Which it turns into, like 20 minutes of just sheer hilarity.

The Brad Pitt character beats a woman to death with a telephone and it's just the funniest thing you've ever seen.</p>
</details>

>> >> 是的，然后火焰喷射器也出现了。你无法想象那种暴力。它用一种更可怕的暴力来回应我们知道即将到来的那种恐怖。你知道真实发生了什么，所以你会有一种奇怪的宣泄反应。现实是如此悲惨，而且是女性对女性的暴力——曼森家族自称“家庭”，这是对家庭的扭曲，他们杀害了一个怀孕八个月、即将组建家庭的女人。这背后有可怕的叙事。但电影中，这种暴力被更极端的暴力所回应，这是一种非常奇特的观影体验，既愉悦又充满了复杂的情感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> And the flamethrower shows up, right? You could not conceive of the type of violence. It meets the most horrific violence that we know is coming. And that's the backstory to this too, is like you know what really happened. So you have this weird cathartic response of, you know what actually happened and it's so tragic. And it was women on women. The Manson family called themselves "family," it was a perversion of the family, and they actually killed a woman who was 8 months pregnant starting a family. So there's this horrific narrative to this. But the fact that it's met with even more extreme violence... it's this very strange moviegoing experience that is both delightful but also like, you know, a lot of mixed emotions.</p>

### 历史的回响：从60年代到今天

>> 如果你把视角拉高一层，你会看到，代表着旧时代刻板形象的里克·道尔顿，以及代表着美国军方偶像的“美国队长”，在反主流文化的巅峰时期，最终痛打并烧死了一群嬉皮士。这成了一部非常取悦大众的电影。而它上映的时间，恰好接近我们过去十年文化革命中“觉醒文化”的顶峰。我不知道这是否能被恰当地描述为一部“反动”电影，但它肯定不符合那个时期其他艺术作品所追求的道德弧线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And then if you kind of telescope up one notch, it's like the ultimate square in the form of Rick Dalton, who's still putting Brylcreem in his hair and trying to be like a James Dean tough guy, when that's not what the world wants. And then, basically, Captain America, like an icon of the American military, at the time of Vietnam in which the military was not viewed at the level of respect that American culture has for it today. The fact that those two end up basically beating and roasting a bunch of hippies to death at the height of the counterculture. It's an incredibly crowd-pleasing movie. And that happened very close to peak woke during our cultural revolution of the last decade. I don't know if it's properly characterized as like a reactionary movie, but it definitely was not the moral arc of other attempts at art during that time period.</p>
</details>

>> >> 完全正确。电影的最后一幕，他被邀请过去，而她对发生的一切浑然不觉，这一切都充满了魔幻色彩。就像《无耻混蛋》是一部关于“可能发生什么”的复仇剧一样，这也是一个“美国往事”的故事。在2019年，被一群大笑、热爱这部电影的人包围，是一种奇特的观影体验。这与你在新闻中读到的一切都背道而驰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> Totally. And just even the final scene of him getting invited over and her sort of being blissfully unaware this happened. I mean that's all magical. In the same way that Inglourious Basterds was a revenge drama of what could have possibly happened, this is also like the Once Upon a Time in America story, like what could have happened. And it was a weird moviegoing experience in 2019 to be surrounded by people who were laughing, who loved it. It kind of went against everything you were reading in the news, which is that no one agrees with this alternative history. I mean, it was just a brilliant film.</p>
</details>

>> 塔伦蒂诺还为这部电影写了一本平装本小说。他特意以平装小说的形式写的，向那个时代致敬。但当然，作为塔伦蒂诺，它不仅仅是一本小说化作品，而是一部全新的小说。它设定在与电影相同的世界里，更深入地探讨了电影的主题，但他根本不在乎小说里是否有电影的情节。所以他在小说开头就把它抛开了。我认为很少有人读过它，但我认为它有理由成为一部伟大的美国小说，因为它更深入地探讨了我们正在谈论的所有主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tarantino actually wrote a paperback novelization of the movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. And he specifically wrote it as a paperback novelization. And so it came out in paperback, as an homage to this. But of course being Tarantino, it actually turns out, it's not just a paperback novelization. It turns out it's like an entirely new novel. And it's actually funny because it's set in the same world of the movie and goes much deeper into the themes of the movie, but he doesn't even care at all about having the plot of the movie actually in the novel. And so he just throws it away right up front in the novel. I think very few people have read it, but I think it has a reasonable claim on being a great American novel because it goes much deeper into all the themes that we're talking about.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为1964年到1972年（理查德·尼克松连任）的时期与我们过去十年所经历的非常相似。60年代的那场文化革命，我认为我们在过去十年里经历了另一个版本。它大约在2014、2015年开始，然后在2024年11月结束。如果你是右翼，你会想：“天哪，谢天谢地，终于结束了。” 如果你是左翼，你会想：“天哪，发生了什么？革命怎么会变得这么糟？” 这正是60年代革命结束时发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think there's a very direct analogy of let's call it 1964 to 1972 or something with the re-election of Richard Nixon. That cultural revolution that happened during the '60s, the hippie Vietnam revolution. I think what we in America have been through the last decade is sort of another version of that. Like we went through our version of that. It started around, I would date it to like 2014-2015, and then that era sort of ended November 2024. Obviously, if you're on the right, you're like, "Oh my god, thank god that's over." and the world could move on. If you're on the left, of course, you're like, "Oh my god, what just happened? How did the revolution go so bad?" That is precisely what happened at the end of the revolution in the 1960s.</p>
</details>

>> 1968年理查德·尼克松当选总统，那是一场艰苦的竞选。但他在1972年以压倒性优势连任，赢得了49个州。这就像美国人民站起来说：“够了，结束了。” 这其中的回响是如此深刻。当然，它们只是回响，不能完全等同，但仍然是：一场文化革命发生了，它在一段时间内要么是光荣的，要么是可怕的，然后它结束了。我认为这正是从69年曼森谋杀案开始，到72年尼克松连任结束的那个过程，然后滑向70年代，最终到80年代。我认为我们现在正在经历的正是同样类型的转变。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Richard Nixon was elected president in 1968 and it was a hard-fought race. But then he was reelected in 1972 in a landslide, like a 49-state landslide. So it's like the American people basically rose up and basically said, "Yeah, no more of this. It's over." And the echoes are just profound of how this played out. And they're echoes, right? It's not exactly comparable. But still, there was a cultural revolution. It was either glorious or terrible for some period of time and then it ended. I would argue that's exactly the process kicked off in '69 with the Manson murders and then sort of bookended with '72 with Nixon's re-election and then kind of the slide into the 1970s and then ultimately 1980s. And I would argue that's precisely the same kind of transition that we're going through right now.</p>

### 《热带惊雷》：对好莱坞和越战电影的终极讽刺

>> >> 我想过渡到有史以来最好的越战电影。

>> >> 好的，我们之前说的一切与凯瑟琳即将提出的极具争议的观点相比，都显得温和了。

>> >> 有史以来最好的越战电影是《热带惊雷》。它恰好也是关于好莱坞最好的电影之一。我会说《好莱坞往事》虽然是一部不可思议的电影，但更多是关于美国。而《热带惊雷》在不同方面也揭示了许多关于美国的信息，但它无疑是关于好莱坞最好的电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> I want to transition to the best Vietnam war film ever made.<br><br>>> Okay. This is everything we've said up until now is milquetoast as compared to the extremely controversial claim that Katherine is about to make.<br><br>>> The best Vietnam war film ever made is Tropic Thunder. It also happens to be one of the best films about Hollywood. I would actually say that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, while it is an incredible film, is more about America, but Tropic Thunder is also about America in different ways and reveals a lot about America, but is by far the best Hollywood film ever made.</p>
</details>

>> >> 它是在2008年上映的，这一点非常重要。因为那一年，我们有一位越战战俘竞选总统，对手是美国历史上第一位黑人总统。这个背景对于理解《热带惊雷》中处理的所有主题都至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> It was 2008, which is actually very important. Because 2008 was also the year where we had a POW from the Vietnam War running for office against the first black president in history. And that is a very important context for all of the themes dealt with inside of Tropic Thunder, which of course is a comedy. It's a satire, but it satirizes everything in the kind of "Before Times" of 2008.</p>
</details>

>> 这部电影最令人惊奇的事情之一是，伟大的演员小罗伯特·唐尼在整部电影中都涂着黑脸表演。他不仅涂着黑脸，而且极其投入。

>> >> 是的，他是一个**方法派演员**（Method Actor: 一种表演技巧，演员会完全沉浸在角色中，体验角色的情感和思想）扮演另一个方法派演员。

>> >> 就像《好莱坞往事》一样，当电影首次宣布时，大家都知道小罗伯特·唐尼要涂黑脸表演，你可以想象，当时人们的恐慌情绪是一样的。人们觉得他正在毁掉自己的职业生涯。但当你真正看这部电影时，你会发现它处理得非常巧妙，实际上是在讽刺那些为了赢得奥斯卡而不择手段的好莱坞演员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> One of the most amazing things about it is, the great actor Robert Downey Jr. plays the entire movie in blackface. And not only plays the entire movie in blackface, I would say extraordinarily commits to the bit.<br><br>>> Yes, he's a method actor playing a method actor.<br><br>>> In the same way that the Tate family was terrified of what would happen in the film, there was a whole kind of terror of what is going to happen. Like Robert Downey Jr. is destroying his career. But when you get into the film, it is handled so beautifully and delicately, and actually, it was satirizing Hollywood actors who will go through any extreme length to win an Oscar.</p>
</details>

>> >> 当它上映时，它显然是在讽刺那些想赢得奥斯卡的白人演员，所以它受到了普遍的喜爱。以至于小罗伯特·唐尼因此获得了奥斯卡提名。但大概在2017或2018年，当新一批年轻人进入新闻界时，他们说“这太可怕了”，并试图“取消”他。但很明显，他们并没有成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> When it came out, it was so clearly satirizing white actors who were trying to win an Oscar, right? So it was universally beloved. So much so that Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for an Oscar. But I believe it was like 2017 or 2018 when this sort of new crop of young people came through journalism and said, "This is horrible." They tried to sort of cancel him. But clearly, they did not cancel Robert Downey Jr. for doing a satirization of the role he played.</p>
</details>

>> 具体来说，小罗伯特·唐尼，一个美国白人演员，扮演一个澳大利亚白人演员，他是一个方法派演员，在整部电影里涂着黑脸扮演一个美国南方黑人。除此之外，他扮演的角色还和一个真正的黑人演员在同一个排里，他们之间的互动非常精彩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, just to fill this in, Robert Downey Jr., a white American actor, plays a white Australian actor who is a method actor, playing a southern black man in blackface for the entire movie. On top of that, he's actually in a platoon with an actual black guy, a young black actor, and the way they play off each other is brilliant.</p>
</details>

>> >> 电影制作方还做了很多聪明的事情。汤姆·克鲁斯在电影中扮演一个基于哈维·韦恩斯坦的制片人角色。他们不希望任何人知道汤姆·克鲁斯参演了，所以他们起诉了所有提前拍到他照片的狗仔队，因为他们希望观众进影院时能感到惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> The other smart thing that they did, by the way, is they also have Tom Cruise in the movie as the producer who's based on Harvey Weinstein. But they didn't want anyone to know Tom Cruise was in the film. So they actually sued any of the paparazzi who took pictures of him before because they wanted people to come to the theater and not know that Tom Cruise was in it.</p>
</details>

>> >> 每个人都关注小罗伯特·唐尼，但电影里至少还有四件其他“禁忌”的事情。2008年最不满的是残疾人权益倡导者，因为电影里有一句台词“永远不要演得太过了（Never go full retard）”。这在当时是可以说的，但他们对此非常不满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> Everyone focuses on Robert Downey Jr., but there are at least four other untouchable things that happened in that film. The disability advocates actually, when the film came out, the people who were most upset in 2008 were the disability advocates because of the commentary on "never go full retard." Which was okay to say in 2008 except for the disability advocates who were very upset about it.</p>
</details>

>> >> 电影还对越战回忆录进行了评论，因为后来很多越战回忆录被证明是完全不真实的。电影中，那本作为电影蓝本的回忆录的作者，实际上是一个从未去过越南的海岸警卫队成员。所以，这部电影在很多层面上都非常精彩，对各种事物都进行了评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> >> The other thing is that it is so much of a commentary on Vietnam War films because a lot of Vietnam war memoirs in later years have been proven to be completely disingenuous. And so in the storyline in the film, the guy whose memoir the movie is actually based on is a member of the Coast Guard who never got sent to Vietnam. So there's this brilliant commentary also on veterans' issues. This movie is so brilliant and the levels of commentary are remarkable to this day.</p>
</details>

### 《奥本海默》：一部道德立场模糊的“伟大艺术”？

>> 让我们来谈谈《奥本海默》。我非常欣赏克里斯托弗·诺兰，但我认为这部电影没有达到“大写的艺术”的水平。我认为它在道德和对我们文化的重要性上都严重不足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, let's start with Oppenheimer. I'm an enormous Christopher Nolan fan. I've seen all his movies. I love all his movies. And I think Oppenheimer was an incredibly well-made movie. I will argue that it did not reach our level of capital A art. I think it actually quite badly fell short on morality and ultimately in importance to our culture.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为电影的道德观是严重颠倒的。它以一种迎合我们当前政治的方式颠倒了，但就当时实际发生的情况而言，它是完全错误的。电影将奥本海默和爱因斯坦塑造成那个时代关于核武器使用的关键道德权威，我认为这两个论点在实质上都是非常不正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> My critique is the morality of the movie I think is very badly upside down. And it's upside down in a way that kind of flatters our current politics but is very badly upside down in terms of what actually happened at the time. The movie sort of sets up both Oppenheimer and actually also specifically Albert Einstein as sort of the key moral authorities of the era with respect to the use of nuclear weapons. Both claims of which I believe are like deeply incorrect on substance.</p>
</details>

>> 电影的前半部分相当忠于历史，它重现了20、30年代美国精英文化和研究机构被共产主义思想彻底渗透的状况。电影里有个笑话说伯克利一半的教员都是共产主义者。问题是，当他们开始从事机密武器项目时，人们非常担心原子弹的秘密会泄露给苏联。剧透一下：这正是发生的事情。核秘密确实泄露了出去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The first half of the movie I think is actually quite historically grounded. It's one of the only recreations on film of what American elite culture and society and the research establishment of the 1920s and 30s, like how thoroughly saturated that world was with communism. There's a joke in the movie that half the Berkeley faculty are communists. The issue becomes, okay, now they're working on a classified weapons program. There's this very big concern that the secrets of the atomic bomb were going to walk their way out the door from Los Alamos. And by the way, spoiler alert, that's exactly what happened. The nuclear secrets did walk right out the door.</p>
</details>

>> 所以，所有那些被描绘成对罗伯特·奥本海默迫害的铺垫的安全担忧，实际上都是完全合理的。最坏的情况确实发生了。我们现在知道，第一颗苏联原子弹的线路与美国的“长崎”原子弹完全一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So like all of the security concerns that are kind of a setup to what is sort of portrayed as the persecution of Robert Oppenheimer, they were all completely legitimate security concerns. And in fact, the worst case scenario actually did happen. The first Soviet atomic bomb was wire-for-wire compatible with the US Nagasaki bomb.</p>

>> 电影最终将剥夺奥本海默安全许可的行为描绘成他的一种伟大道德英雄主义行为，因为他想要制造小炸弹的功劳，但不想让大炸弹（氢弹）出现。但另一个版本的说法是，你完全支持击败德国和日本，但一旦轮到对付苏联，你就退缩了。这难道不有趣吗？

<p class="english-text">>> The movie paints this as like a great act of moral heroism on his part where basically he wanted credit for the little bomb, but he didn't want the big bomb to happen. But there's another version of the story which is you were completely in favor of beating Germany and Japan and then but the minute it came to beating the Soviet Union, you got cold feet. Hm. Isn't that interesting?</p>

>> 我对电影最尖锐的控诉是，爱因斯坦根本不是道德典范，他是一个斯大林主义者。有一本书叫《当理性放假时》详细阐述了这一点。电影将奥本海默和爱因斯坦呈现为房间里的道德成年人，我认为这在今天看来是荒谬的。因为我们坐在这里80年后，我们知道第三次世界大战没有发生。原因很明显，那就是**相互保证毁灭**（Mutually Assured Destruction, MAD: 一种军事威慑理论，指冲突双方都拥有足以毁灭对方的核武器，因此任何一方都不敢首先发动攻击）。双方都拥有核武器意味着任何一方都不能向对方开战。

<p class="english-text">>> And then there's my most stinging indictment of the movie, which is Einstein was the exact opposite of a moral exemplar. Einstein was a Stalinist. There's a book that goes through this called When Reason Goes on Holiday. The movie kind of presents Oppenheimer and Einstein as the moral adults in the room, to a degree that I just think is basically at this point bizarre. And the reason it's bizarre is because we're sitting here 80 years later and the thing that we know today is World War III didn't happen. And the reason World War III didn't happen is sort of fairly obvious, which was mutually assured destruction. The fact that both sides had nukes basically meant that neither side could go to war with the other.</p>

>> 我认为电影在道德上欺骗了观众，因为它把核武器是坏的、这些人是坏的、整件事是坏的，描绘成一个板上钉钉的事实。而爱因斯坦和奥本海默在某种程度上是试图反对这一切的道德英雄。我认为这真的欺骗了观众。

<p class="english-text">>> I just thought the movie really cheated on the morality of it because it kind of presented this as slam dunk that the nuke was bad and that these people were bad and the whole thing was bad and that both Einstein and Oppenheimer were moral heroes to some extent kind of trying to line up against this. And I just thought that that really cheated the audience.</p>

### 《搏击俱乐部》：一部从左翼到右翼的时代棱镜

>> 我们来谈谈《搏击俱乐部》。我认为它百分之百是“大写的艺术”，它经受住了时间的考验。它是一部你可以用作棱镜来审视我们社会的电影。回想起来，它在当时显然被视为一部左翼电影，因为它带有那个时代左翼的反资本主义和无政府主义色彩。

<p class="english-text">>> Fight Club. I think it's 100% true art with a capital A. I think it's amazing. I think it's definitely going to stand the test of time. It's one of those movies that has that characteristic where you can kind of use it as a prism on our society. It's amazing in retrospect. My social political analysis of it would be like it was clearly intended as a left-wing movie at the time because it was sort of left-wing anti-capitalism of that era, left-wing anarchism.</p>
</details>

>> 但你今天看这部电影，你会觉得：“哇，这简直是极右翼。” 因为主角是一个白人男性，一个享有特权的白人男性“incel”（非自愿独身者），他建立了一种受迫害情结。电影对资本主义的批判——社会原子化，人们成为巨大机器中可互换的齿轮，家庭和社区概念被摧毁——在今天听起来更像是右翼的批判。

<p class="english-text">>> You watch it today and you're just like, "Wow, it's like ultra right-wing." Because to start with, it's a white guy. You view it today and you're like, wow, it's a privileged white male incel, basically, with every advantage in the world who suddenly nevertheless has built up this persecution complex. And the argument the movie makes about capitalism is the great atomization of society and nobody has anything and people are just interchangeable cogs in the great machine of modernity. All concept of family and community is completely ruptured. Sitting here today, that's a right-wing critique.</p>

>> 我和一位参与制作这部电影的人聊过，我提出了我的理论，说它当时是左翼电影，现在是右翼电影。那个人说：“哦，不。电影结尾很清楚，他对自己所做的事情深感后悔。” 我当时想：“哦，好吧，那如果你用AI把最后一幕爱德华·诺顿的角色看着大楼倒塌的场景稍微调整一下，让他脸上露出一丝狡黠的微笑，那么整部电影突然就从头到尾都变成了极右翼电影。”

<p class="english-text">>> I did talk to somebody who was involved in the making of the movie and I laid out my theory that it was a left-wing movie at the time and now it's a right-wing movie. And this person basically said, "Oh, no. It's very clear in the movie that at the end, he greatly regrets what he's doing." And I was like, "Oh, well then if you just like used AI to just go in there and tweak the final scene of the Ed Norton character standing, watching the buildings come down and if you just tweak the final scene to where he would have like a sly little smile on his face, like all of a sudden the entire movie becomes like this, you know, basically ultra right-wing from start to finish."</p>

>> >> 这部电影是在1999年上映的，那一年被普遍认为是电影佳作辈出的一年。

>> >> 是的，也许是过去40年里电影最好的一年。

>> >> 我觉得它是典型的90年代电影。对消费主义的批判，对消费主义影响男性特质的早期批判，那种“我们要成立一个搏击俱乐部来重拾我们的男子气概和生活”的反应，感觉非常90年代。现在也在进行同样的对话，但当时的语境是“沃尔玛正在摧毁你”，而现在是“科技正在摧毁你”。

<p class="english-text">>> >> That movie came out in 1999.<br><br>>> 1999, which is kind of universally, I remember, a year of absolutely amazing movies.<br><br>>> >> Yes. Maybe the best single year for movies in the last like 40 years.<br><br>>> >> I feel like it's the consummate '90s film, right? The critique on consumerism, the early critique on consumerism affecting masculine traits. The whole reaction of, "We're going to have a fight club to kind of reclaim our masculinity and sort of our life." That felt like it was actually a '90s conversation. It's interesting because it's the same conversation that's happening right now, but it really was also a '90s conversation. At the time it was Walmart and capitalism are destroying you. Now it's like tech is destroying you.</p>
