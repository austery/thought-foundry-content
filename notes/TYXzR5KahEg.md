### 对话主题：哈佛教授解读谈话的科学 

**旁白：** 人们真的很在意是什么让他们不受欢迎，也非常想知道如何才能讨人喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Narrator:** People really care about what's making them disliked. And they really want to know how to be liked.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 首先，这是我在哈佛大学的课上做的一个练习，叫做“坠入喜欢里的十个问题”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Okay. So, first, this is an exercise that I do in my class at Harvard called 10 questions to fall in like.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以，如果我问别人那些问题，他们就会喜欢我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So, if I ask someone those questions, they're going to like me.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 这是一个很好的起点，但我们来谈谈这个，因为其中会有一些关于如何更受欢迎的小线索。**这是世界上关于沟通的最具教学性、最实用、最科学严谨的框架。** 斯蒂芬，你想听听吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** It's a great starting point, but let's talk about this because they're going to be little clues about how to be better liked. And **it's the most teachable, practical, scientifically rigorous framework in the world for communication.** Do you want to hear about it, Stephen?
</details>

**Stephen：** 我当然想听。我想成为世界上最有说服力、最有影响力、最讨人喜欢的谈话者。所以，我将听从你的引导。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Of course I want to hear about it. I want to be the most persuasive, influential, likable talker in the world. So, I shall follow your lead.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦天哪，这可是很大的权力。我太喜欢了，太喜欢了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh my gosh, it's a lot of power. I love it. I love it so much.
</details>

**旁白：** 哈佛大学教授 **艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯** (Allison Wood Brooks) 是一位行为科学家，她花了二十年时间研究对话科学。她将揭示我们都会犯的沟通错误、谈判的艺术，以及如何让任何人都喜欢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Narrator:** Harvard professor **Allison Wood Brooks** is a behavioral scientist who has spent two decades studying conversational science. And she's revealing the communication mistakes we all make, the art of negotiation and how to get anyone to like you.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们长大成人后，都觉得对话应该是一件容易的事。但作为一名科学家，当你深入探究时，你才会意识到，这就是为什么我们有那么多尴尬的时刻，为什么我们会说不该说的话，为什么我们很无聊，为什么我们会生气和充满敌意。而有非常明确的策略可以帮助我们解决所有这些问题。比如，我最重要的发现之一就是如何将社交焦虑重塑为兴奋感，这会让你专注于机会而非威胁。那篇论文最终在电影《头脑特工队》中被提及。然后是闲聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** We all get to adulthood and we feel like conversation should be easy. But as a scientist, when you look under the hood, you realize this is why we have so many awkward moments, why we say things that we shouldn't, why we are boring, why we get angry and hostile. And there's very clear strategies to help us with all of that. Like one of my biggest findings was how we reframe social anxiety as excitement, which makes you focus on opportunities rather than threats. And that paper ended up being featured in Inside Out, the movie. And then there's small talk.
</details>

**Stephen：** 我讨厌闲聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I hate small talk.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我会帮你重新定义它，因为它非常重要。但人们犯的错误是，他们在闲聊上停留太久，他们需要在这个话题金字塔上向上移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I'm going to help you reframe that because it's really important. But the mistake that people make is that they stay there way too long and they need to move up this topic pyramid.
</details>

**Stephen：** 在数字时代呢？我们需要开始用不同的方式沟通吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What about in a digital age? Do we need to start communicating differently?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，有明确的方法可以让我们基于文本的沟通变得更好，我们会逐一介绍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, there's clear things that we should do to make our textbased communication better and we'll go through all of them.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你说你最近做了一项关于男性友谊的有趣研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And you said you've done an interesting study recently about male friendship.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，而且情况相当令人担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yes. And it's quite troubling.
</details>

**Stephen：** 那么，作为一个男人，我怎样才能交到更多的朋友呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So, how can I make more friends as a man?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 好的，我们来谈谈这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, let's talk about that.
</details>

**Stephen：** 艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯教授，你是做什么的？为什么你认为你的工作对世界如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Professor Allison Wood Brooks. What is it that you do and why do you think it matters so much to the world?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我是哈佛大学的一名教授，也是一位行为科学家。我研究人们如何相互交谈，以及如何能做得更好。我在那里开设了一门我创建的课程，叫做“谈话”。我还写了一本关于这个主题的书，也叫 **《谈话：对话的科学与做我们自己的艺术》** (Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves)。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I am a professor at Harvard and I'm a behavioral scientist. I study how people talk to each other and how they can do it better. I teach a course that I created there called talk. I wrote a book about it, also called **Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves.**
</details>

**Stephen：** 如果有人现在选择收听这次对话，他们刚点击进来，可能在想，我该留下还是离开？如果他们留下来听这次基于你的书和所有研究的对话，我们能给他们什么承诺？你认为普通人能从中获得什么，并对他们的日常生活产生有意义的影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And if someone's chosen to listen to this conversation now, they've just clicked on it and they're thinking, you know, should I stay or should I go? What promise can we give them if they stay and listen to this conversation that is based on the work you've done in your book and all the research you've done? What is it that you think the average person can come away with that will have a meaningful impact on their day-to-day life?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** **人生的全部意义在于关系，而关系的核心在于交谈。** 所以，如果他们能学到哪怕一个有助于他们对话的策略，他们的生活就会得到极大的改善。想想看，从工作到恋爱关系、友谊、生产力，所有这一切都取决于拥有出色的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** **All of life is about relationships and relationships are about talking.** So if they can learn even one strategy that helps them in their conversations, it will massively improve their lives. If you think of everything from work to romantic relationships, friendships, productivity, all of it hinges on having excellent conversations.
</details>

### 谈话的科学：为何我们都感到困难

**Stephen：** 但对话不是很简单吗？就是张口说话而已。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** But conversations are easy, right? Like you just talk.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们都有这种感觉。我们长大成人后，都觉得对话应该很容易，因为我们从一岁半蹒跚学步时就开始学习如何对话了，而且我们每天都和大量的对话伙伴练习。所以当我们成年时，感觉自己应该已经是专家了，应该很擅长了。但作为一名科学家，当你深入探究其内在的复杂性时，你就会意识到，哦，这就是为什么我们会有那么多尴尬的时刻，为什么我们会说不该说的话，为什么我们不说该说的话，为什么我们互相伤害，为什么我们会变得戒备，为什么我们很无聊，为什么我们会生气和充满敌意。而有非常明确的策略可以帮助我们解决所有这些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** We all feel that way. We all get to adulthood and we feel like conversation should be easy because we started learning how to do it when we were one and a half years old as toddlers and we practice doing it with an enormous number of conversation partners every day of our lives. So by the time we become adults it feels like we should be experts, like we should be great at it. But as a scientist, when you look under the hood and you see, oh my goodness, all of the complexity that's happening under the hood, you realize, oh, this is why we have so many awkward moments, why we say things that we shouldn't, why we don't say things that we should, why we hurt each other, why we get defensive, why we are boring, why we get angry and hostile. And there are very clear strategies to help us with all of that.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你在说这些的时候，我在想，你认为有很多人因为不懂如何交谈而在生活中给人留下错误的印象吗？也许他们不被人喜欢，也许他们被误解，都是因为他们没有掌握如何进行一场精彩对话的科学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** As you were saying that, I was thinking, do you think there's a lot of people that are going through life giving off the wrong impression because they don't know how to talk? Maybe they are disliked. Maybe they are misunderstood because they haven't mastered the science of how to have a great conversation.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 在我最糟糕的日子里，我担心每个人都在被误解。当你思考谈话时，即使是现在我说话的时候，也不可能把你头脑中所有的内容和你的全部个性都说出来。所以，我们总是在筛选，我们总是在选择一部分东西通过对话与他人分享。没有人能做得完美。我担心很多人在这方面真的很挣扎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** On my worst days, I worry that everybody's walking around being misunderstood. When you think about talking, even as I'm talking right now, there's no way to take the entire contents of your mind and all of your personality and say it out loud. And so, we're always curating. We're always choosing what some subset of stuff to share with other people through conversation. And no one is doing that perfectly. And I fear that many people are really struggling with it.
</details>

**Stephen：** 如果你必须指出人们在想成为一个优秀的谈话者时想要的几件事，我们到底在追求什么？是……那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** If you had to pinpoint just a few things that people want when they think about becoming a great conversationalist, like what is it that we actually are aiming at? Is it to be, you know, what is that?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 通常人们希望被喜欢，甚至被爱。我们通常希望享受我们的对话，而不是让它们变得痛苦。我们希望感到安全和受保护，不希望它变得可怕和耗时。我们还希望实现职业目标，比如晋升、取得成就和做出明智的决策。所以，即使是人们在对话中试图实现的最基本动机，实际上也比“哦，我们在寻求连接”要复杂一些。当你真正深入挖掘时，在人们想要的那些类别中的所有目标里，就像一个巨大的动机星群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah. Usually people want to be liked, even loved. Usually we want to enjoy our conversations to not have them be miserable. We want to feel safe and protected and not have it be dreadful and time-consuming. And we want to achieve professional goals. So advancing and achieving and making great decisions. So already the very basic drives of what people are trying to achieve in conversation are actually a little bit more complicated than just like, oh we're looking for connection. And then when you really dig into it within all of the goals that people want in those categories, it's like a vast constellation of of motives.
</details>

**Stephen：** 我希望你能教我如何把话说得非常非常好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I would like you to teach me how to talk really, really well.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我不知道你是否那么需要我的帮助，斯蒂芬，但我很乐意。即使是最好的沟通者也有改进的空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I don't know if you need my help that much, Stephen, but I'd love to. Even the best communicators have room for improvement.
</details>

**Stephen：** 不，我觉得我需要。我真的需要，因为上周我一直在思考我经历过的所有不同类型的对话。有一次对话是我第一次见到我同事的家人，那有点让人紧张。你知道，人们总会遇到见岳父母之类的时刻。对我来说，经常是见到同事的家人，我觉得相当紧张，因为我觉得他们可能在评判我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** No, I think I do. I think I do because, you know, I was thinking about this last week and all the conversations I've had, the different types of conversations. I had one conversation where I met someone's family for the first time who works with me. And it was, you know, it was a little bit nerve-wracking because people have these moments where they meet the in-laws or whatever. For me it's often meeting someone who works with me's family, I find quite nerve-wracking because I think they're kind of probably judging me.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 因为他们确实在评判你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Because they are judging you.
</details>

**Stephen：** 是的，他们就是在评判我，我能感觉到。当我要进行那些对话时，我就会想：“哦，我的天哪。”然后我最终就会僵住或者有点不知所措。你可能会认为像我这样以此为生的人会觉得对话很容易。我绝对不这么觉得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Yeah, they are judging me and I can feel it. And as I go towards those conversations, I'm like, "Oh my god." And then I end up just like freezing or being a little bit paralyzed. And you'd think as someone like me who does this for a living finds conversations easy. I absolutely do not.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我和很多非常高层的、非常成功的人士交谈过，事实上，地位越高、越成功的人，越有可能意识到这一点非常重要，并且他们有改进的空间。这几乎就像你意识到这项技能可能是帮助你取得今天成就的原因，因此你希望在这方面做得更好，并且你敏锐地意识到自己何时会出现尴尬时刻、犯错或失误，然后你会想，我真的希望把这些从我的生活中剔除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I talk to very high level, very successful people and in fact the higher and more successful people are, the more likely they are to be aware that this is really important and that they have room for improvement. It's almost like you're aware that this skill is probably what helped you get where you are and therefore you want to get even better at it and you're keenly aware of when you have awkward moments or make mistakes or missteps and you're like I would really like to get that out of my life please.
</details>

**Stephen：** 太对了。我会反复回想两周半前一次尴尬的遭遇。我当时想，我本应该……但实际上，在读了你的一些作品后，我思考了我本可以做些什么，我们会谈到为那些时刻做准备这个想法，我通常不会这么做，因为我总以为自己应该是个天生的沟通者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Amen. I ruminate on an awkward encounter I had like two and a half weeks ago. I was like, I should have just... but actually in reading some of your work I thought about what I could have done and we'll get to this idea of preparing for those moments which I typically don't because I assume I should be a natural.
</details>

### 内向者的沟通挑战与闲聊的困境

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 当你谈论这些让你反复思考的不同例子时，我能问你一个问题吗？你是否觉得你有一个弱点，或者说一个你怀疑自己需要改进的、反复出现的问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Can I ask you as you were talking about these different examples of things that you're ruminating about? Do you feel like you have a weakness or like a recurring thing that you suspect you need to get better at?
</details>

**Stephen：** 我想其中之一是，在我的自我分类中，我有点内向。而且随着我在世界上越来越出名，我觉得我变得更内向了。所以，有时候这可能会被误解。我最快乐的状态是独处，或者和我非常熟悉的人在一起。如果我离开家，比如去健身房之类的地方，我会有点偏执。我总是有点紧张，这让我更加封闭。所以当我和人交谈时，有时会显得有点封闭，我不想把这种状态带到我需要更开放的时刻。总的来说，我就是讨厌闲聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I think one of them is I am a bit of an introvert in my sort of self-classification and as people know who I am more in the world, I think I've become more introverted. So, and sometimes that can be perceived in the wrong way. So, my happy state is kind of being alone or around people that I'm extremely familiar with. If I leave the house and I go say to a gym or something, I have a little bit of paranoia. I'm always kind of on edge, which means that this kind of shuts me down more. So when I do have conversations, I can sometimes appear to be a bit more shut down and I don't want to carry that into moments where I need to be a bit more open. And then I would say generally I just like hate small talk.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，不止你一个人这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, you're not alone there.
</details>

**Stephen：** 我觉得这就是为什么我做播客的原因，因为你可以直接跳到深入的话题，我可以问人们关于他们创伤的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And I just say it's like a point. This is why I think I podcast because you can just skip straight into the deep stuff and I can ask people about their trauma.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 其实在正常的对话中你也可以这样做。你发现自己会陷入闲聊吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** You can do that in normal conversations too actually. Do you find that you get stuck in small talk?
</details>

**Stephen：** 是的，经常会。我只是尽量避免它。我有个有趣的故事。地球上最有名望的人之一邀请我参加一个活动，我拒绝了，因为那里还有一百多个人，我只是不想在一个房间里和一群人待四个小时，对我来说那太累了。我的团队都说：“你必须去那个鬼地方，而且要玩得开心。”我说：“不，我不去，人太多了。”但我就是这样的人。我喜欢现在的环境，但我讨厌闲聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Yes, a good bit. I just try and avoid it. So I've got this funny story. one of the most prestigious people on planet earth invited me to come to a thing and I said no because there would be a hundred other people there and I just didn't want to be in a room for four hours with a bunch of other people, like it just for me it's so exhausting. And my team were like you go to that thing and you enjoy it. And I'm like no I'm not going there's too many people there. But that's kind of what I'm like. I love this environment, but I hate small talk.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我不确定这算不算弱点，更多的是你了解了自己的偏好。我觉得这没关系。也许我们稍后会谈到，但大型团体确实压力很大。集体对话以及弄清楚谁应该在什么时候和谁谈论什么，这对人脑来说是极其费力的。这与亲密的一对一对话截然不同，后者在你的控制范围内，目的也更明确。所以我们应该这样想，也许我们可以重新定义它，这不是一个弱点，而是思考你的社交组合。你在和谁交谈？是合适的人吗？是在合适的安排和合适的团体规模中吗？所以，我们现在正在做的一对一谈话，和去一个有一百人的派对，是完全不同的任务。我稍后会帮你重新定义这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I don't know if that's a weakness as much as it is you learning your preferences. I think it's okay. Uh maybe we'll get there, but large groups are very stressful. Group conversation and figuring out the structure of like who should be talking to whom when and about what is very overwhelming for the human mind. It's quite different than one on one intimate one-on-one conversation which is much more within your control and it's much clearer what the purpose is. So we should think about it maybe not a we can reframe it and it's not a weakness but thinking about your social portfolio. Who are you talking to? Is it the right people and is it in the right arrangements in the right group size? So, what we're doing right now one-on-one is a categorically different task than going to a party with a hundred people. So, I'm going to help you reframe that later on.
</details>

### 从双胞胎经历到对话科学研究

**Stephen：** 你为什么选择做这个？在所有你能做的事情中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Why did you choose to do this? All the things you could have done with your life.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是啊，人生真是奇妙，不是吗？我经常思考那些未曾选择的道路。但我很高兴能走上这条路。我在纽约州北部的一个小镇上的一个小湖边长大，那是个非常美丽的地方。我热爱运动，尤其是团队运动。我从小就珍视女性友谊。可能对我影响最大的是，我有一个同卵双胞胎姐妹。我认为我刚才描述的所有事情，要么表明了我有多么热爱对话，要么塑造了我对对话的热爱。但无论如何，我上大学时就对理解人类及其行为产生了浓厚的兴趣。当我到哈佛时，我意识到，哇，有像社会心理学和传播学这样的整个领域，它们声称是关于沟通的，但却没人费心去真正转录真实的对话，并进行大规模研究。所以，这就是我过去15年一直在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, isn't life so fascinating? I often think about the paths not taken. But I'm very happy to be on this path. I grew up in upstate New York on a small lake in a small town. It was a gorgeous place. And I love playing sports, team sports in particular. I love female friendship from an early age. And probably most formatively, I'm an identical twin. And all of the things I just described, I think, are either indicators of how much I love conversation or formed my love of conversation. But either way, I arrived at college deeply interested in understanding humans and their behavior. And by the time I got to Harvard, I realized, wow, there are whole fields like social psychology and communication that are purportedly about communication, but nobody's bothered to actually transcribe real conversations and study them at very large scale. And so that's what I've been up to for the last 15 years.
</details>

**Stephen：** 作为同卵双胞胎的经历在这方面是如何塑造你的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** How has being an identical twin been formative in this regard?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我的双胞胎姐妹叫莎拉。作为一个同卵双胞胎，我相信有很多地方和亲密的兄弟姐妹很像。但同卵双胞胎，就像世界上有另一个版本的你。我们共用一个卧室，在同一个运动队，一起在乐队里演奏。所以，这有点像近距离观察一个版本的自己。我看到她失败，就会想，“哦，好吧，我要避免那样。”我也会看到她成功。她说出一个绝妙的笑话，回答一个精彩的问题。我知道我也能做到，因为我们有相同的DNA，相同的能力。在某种潜意识里，我想我一直在追求帮助其他人在他们的关系中找到那种感觉，在他们的友谊中，在他们的恋爱关系中，在他们的工作合作中，因为我亲眼看到了两个人的关系可以变得多么美好，当你沟通良好时，你们可以变得多么亲密，多么能够真正理解对方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So, my twin's name is Sarah. Being an identical twin, there are many things that are similar to being a close sibling, I'm sure. But an identical twin, it's like you have another version of you in the world. And we share a bedroom. We were on the same sports teams. We played in band together. And so, it's sort of like watching a version of yourself up close. And I got to see how she failed and thought, "Oh, well, I'm going to avoid that." and I would see how she succeeds. She hits an amazing joke. She answers an amazing question. I know that I'm able to do that because we have the same DNA, the same abilities. In a sort of subconscious way, I think I've just been chasing trying to help other people find that in their relationships, in their friendships, in their romantic relationships, in their work collaborations, because I've gotten to see how amazing that can be for two human beings, how close you can be and how much you can actually understand each other when you communicate well.

### 重塑焦虑为兴奋：《头脑特工队》背后的科学

**Stephen：** 你都做了哪些研究？比如，你参考了哪些资料？你自己做研究吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And what research have you done? Like, what are the reference points you're pulling on? Do you do your own research?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 非常多，可能太多了。我几乎像一个正在康复的学者。我在学术界从事行为科学研究已经20年了。我知道我看起来年轻得不可思议。我从研究生院开始研究情绪，特别是焦虑，不是那种需要药物或治疗的焦虑，而是人们整天都会感受到的那种社交焦虑。然后找出它如何影响不同的行为，比如我们如何谈判，如何接受别人的建议，或者我们在公开演讲时的表现。接着找出策略和技巧，帮助人们更有效地管理那种焦虑。我最重要的发现之一就是如何将焦虑重塑为兴奋。这是一个非常容易的转变，因为它们本质上是同一种情绪，都是高唤醒、高能量、高皮质醇（一种压力荷尔蒙）、心率加快、手心出汗。你只需要改变你头脑中的想法。所以，大声说出“我很兴奋”这样的话，就能改变你对它的评价，让你真正体验到兴奋。这在很多方面都能帮助你表现得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So much. Too much probably. I'm a recovering academic. I've been working in academia doing behavioral science research for 20 years. I know I look impossibly young. I started in graduate school studying emotions, especially anxiety and not the kind of anxiety that requires medication or therapy necessarily, but the types of social anxiety that people feel constantly all day long. And figuring out, okay, how does it affect different behaviors like how we negotiate or how we take advice from each other or how we perform when we're public speaking? These types of things. and then figuring out strategies and tips to help people manage that anxiety more effectively. And one of my biggest findings was how we reframe anxiety as excitement. It's a very easy flip to move from, they're the same emotion because they're both high arousal, high energy, high cortisol, a stress hormone, high heart rate, sweaty palms. You just change how you think about it in your mind. So literally saying things out loud like I'm excited change how your appraisal of it. So you actually experience excitement. It helps you perform a lot better in a lot of different ways.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以你在2011年做了一项研究，是吗？那项“紧张的内莉”谈判研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So you did a study in 2011 was it? The nervous Nelly negotiation study.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。那项是关于谈判的，具体来说是这种兴奋感重评。那篇论文叫做《兴奋起来》。那篇论文最终在电影 **《头脑特工队》** (Inside Out) 中被提及。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yes. Yes. So that one was about negotiation specifically, the excitement reappraisal. The paper's called get excited. And that paper actually ended up being featured in **Inside Out** the movie.
</details>

**Stephen：** 哦，哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Oh wow.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。有一个很棒的场景，主角快要恐慌发作了，乐乐溜进小兵们的隔间农场说：“别再画那些事情会变糟的预测了，画一些事情可能变好的样子吧。”这太棒了。我当时和我的孩子们坐在电影院里，我丈夫朝我这边看了一眼，他说：“那是你的研究成果吗？”我说：“是的，是的，是我的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah. There's a great scene where the main character is about to have a panic attack and Joy sneaks into the little cubicle farm of minions and says, "Stop drawing all of these projections about how things are going to go badly and instead draw how things could go well." Which is so great. And I was sitting in the movie theater with my kids and my husband kind of looked down the way and he was like, "Is that your thing?" And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's my thing."
</details>

**Stephen：** 那么那项研究表明了什么？包括“紧张的内莉”那项，还有关于兴奋感的研究。

**Stephen:** So, what did that study show? Of those two studies, the nervous Nelly one, but also the one of excitement.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 当我们感到焦虑时，就像大多数人在谈判中一样，因为那是一个充满不确定性和失控感的紧张环境，这正是焦虑的配方，我们往往想要逃避。我们要么想通过让步来缓解那种感觉，要么就想离开那里。这就是“紧张的内莉”焦虑与谈判论文的主要发现。而将焦虑重塑为兴奋的论文，则是通过多种方式说服自己你感到兴奋，仅仅通过大声说“我很兴奋”。这样做会让你专注于机会而非威胁，关注事情可能变好而非变坏。这会带来不可思议的后续影响。它能帮助你唱得更好，帮助你做公开演讲更好，帮助你更有效地协作。所以这是一种非常强大的干预手段。

**Allison Wood Brooks:** When we feel anxious, as most people do in negotiations because it's an intense environment filled with uncertainty and a lack of control, which is the recipe for anxiety, we tend we want to escape. We either want to relieve that feeling by making concessions or get out of there, right? Just exit the interaction. That was the main finding of the nervous Nelly anxiety and negotiation paper. The reframing anxiety as excitement paper is lots of different ways to convince yourself that you're feeling excited just by saying I'm excited out loud. And in doing so, that makes you focus on opportunities rather than threats, how things could go well rather than poorly. And it has incredible downstream consequences. Helps you sing better, helps you do public speaking better, it helps you collaborate more effectively. It's just a very powerful intervention.

**Stephen：** 那项研究的具体操作是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And what was the sort of mechanics of the study?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们会把人带进来。我们告诉他们：“嘿，斯蒂芬，你将要在观众面前唱卡拉OK。”人们自然会对此感到非常紧张。然后，就在他们要上台唱歌之前，我们说：“好的，一位实验员会问你感觉如何。我们希望你们中的一些人说自己感到兴奋，另一些人说自己感到焦虑。”就这么简单，当我问：“斯蒂芬，你现在感觉如何？”你说……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So, we would bring people in. You tell them, "Hey, Stephen, you're going to be singing karaoke in front of an audience. People start to feel quite nervous about this naturally." Then, right before they're going to get up and sing this song, we say, "Okay, an experimenter is going to ask you how you're feeling. Some of you, we want you to say you're feeling excited, and some of you, we want you to say you're feeling anxious." And that alone, when I say, "Stephen, how are you feeling right now?" and you say...
</details>

**Stephen：** 焦虑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Anxious.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 很好。好了，我们去唱歌吧。你上台。那些说“我焦虑”的人唱得比那些说“我兴奋”的人差。后者上台后，节奏更准，音调更准，节奏感更好。我们用软件在他们实际在实验员面前唱歌时进行测量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Great. Okay, let's go sing the song. You go. People who said I'm anxious sing worse compared to people who say I'm excited. They get out there. They're more in tempo, more on pitch. They have better rhythm. And we measure it with a software when they're actually singing in front of the experimenters.
</details>

**Stephen：** 仅仅通过我说“我很兴奋”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Just by me saying I am excited.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以前几天我见我团队成员的家人时，我应该对自己说：“我很高兴见到他们。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So the other day when I met my team members family, I should have been saying to myself, I'm so excited to meet them.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 除此之外还有别的方法。这很重要，它并不总是有效，对吧？如果你非常害怕，而且事情真的很可怕，比如你害怕你母亲会去世，如果她得了绝症，你很难对此感到兴奋。但在临界点上，如果你在脑海中纠结于是紧张还是兴奋，如果你能真正说服自己你其实很兴奋，事情可能会进展顺利，“我这次考试会考得很好”，“我会在篮球场上大放异彩”，这种转变如果重复足够多次，实际上更有可能成真，尤其是在像见同事家人这样的高风险对话之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Among other things. So this is important. It doesn't always work, right? If you're terrified and it's really something dreadful, like you're terrified that your mother's going to die and turns out it's going to be hard to get excited about that if she has a terminal illness. But on the margin, if you're sort of torn between feeling nervous or excited in your mind, if you can really convince yourself that you actually are excited and that things could go well, I'm going to crush this exam. I'm going to tear it up on the basketball court. That flip, if repeated enough, actually becomes more likely to come true and certainly before a high stakes conversation like meeting your colleagues family.
</details>

**Stephen：** 太有趣了。我真的……我有一个叫“日记背后”的幕后频道在YouTube上。前几天我上吉米·法伦的节目，因为去美国深夜电视节目，用七分钟逗乐大家，这有点超出我的能力范围。所以我吓坏了，因为我是个很严肃的人。所以在我出去之前，有一段我的视频，我对我的团队说，在小幕布拉开前我对自己说的是：“这将会非常棒。等不及了。你已经为此做好了准备。”我脑子里说了这些废话，以为都是废话，然后我走了出去。我度过了我一生中最美好的时光。一切都进行得非常顺利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So interesting. I have this behind the scenes channel called Behind the Diary on YouTube and the other day when I did Jimmy Fallon because it's kind of outside of my wheelhouse to go on like late night TV in America and like seven minutes to be funny or whatever. So I was shitting myself cuz I'm a very serious guy. So before I went out, there's a video of me and I said to my team, what I said to myself before the little curtain opened was, "This is going to be amazing. Can't wait. You've prepared for this." Then I said all this nonsense in my head thinking that it was nonsense and I walked out. I had the best time of my life. It went so great.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 太棒了。现在你有证据了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Great. Now you do.
</details>

**Stephen：** 现在我有了。现在我们有一项研究证明这不是废话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Now I do. Now we have a study that proves that it's not.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** **我们与他人交谈的方式以及我们与自己交谈的方式……随着时间的推移，在累积中具有极其重要的意义。** 这项研究很有趣。我想这是我科学之旅的开始，我意识到我们与他人交谈的方式以及我们与自己交谈的方式，特别是重复性的方式，如果你想一想，你在上吉米·法伦节目前那样做了，下次你见同事家人前也这样做，下次你采访比尔·盖茨前也这样做，如果你养成了告诉自己你很兴奋的习惯，并且这对你有效，那么随着时间的推移，在累积中它会变得极其有意义，对吧？所以只关注一次，是的，它有帮助，但如果你能让它成为习惯，它会对人产生一种螺旋式上升效应。这是我科学之旅的开始，我想，哦，如果我们能研究一个短语，比如“兴奋起来”或“我很兴奋”，那如果我们开始研究人们相互交谈的级联式、展开式的方式呢？不仅仅是一句话，而是像对话的每一个回合。以前没有人这样做过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** **The way we talk to other people and the way we talk to ourselves... is incredibly meaningful in accumulation over time.** This one is interesting. I think this was the beginning of my scientific journey realizing that the way we talk to other people and the way we talk to ourselves especially in a repeated sense if you think about okay you did that before Jimmy Fallon now what if you do it before the next time you meet a colleague's family now what if you do it before you interview Bill Gates before you do it right if you then get in the habit of telling yourself you're excited and that becomes effective for you it's incredibly meaningful in accumulation over time right so just focusing on one time yes it's helpful but if you can make it habitual it has this sort of upward spiral effect on people it was the beginning of my scientific journey thinking oh well if we can study one phrase like get excited or I'm excited what if we start studying the cascading unfolding ways that people talk to each other and not just one line but like every turn of a conversation no one had done that before.

### 谈判的艺术与BATNA的力量

**Stephen：** 你做的那个谈判研究，它的机制是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And this negotiation study you did what was the mechanism for that?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，那是一个更经典的研究。几十年来，人们一直在研究谈判。几乎每所商学院和法学院都有一门非常好的谈判课程，这些课程都基于所有这些严谨的研究。但之前没有被研究过的是人们的情绪。大约15年前，包括学者在内的人们开始意识到，“哦，人们的感受很重要。”当他们感到紧张或愤怒时，这实际上是一个重要的区别。你内心的感受和你向对手表达的感受是不同的。所以在这篇论文中，我们发现，作为一个基准，大多数人在谈判前和谈判中都会感到焦虑，因为它是一个紧张的环境。参加谈判课程最大的好处之一可能就是你能不断练习，从而对谈判过程更加适应。这可能是参加这类培训课程最大的收获。所以在这篇论文中，我们有了那个基准。看，每个人都感到焦虑。那么，感到焦虑的后续结果是什么？我们让人们进行谈判，玩这些谈判游戏。我们发现，人们更有可能过早地离开，或者为了缓解焦虑感而做出更多的让步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah that was a more classic... People have been studying negotiations for decades now. And there's a really great negotiation course at almost every business school and law school that's based in all of this rigorous work. What had not been studied on in terms of negotiating are people's emotions. It was about 15 years ago that people including scholars came to the point where we were like, "Oh, people's feelings matter." When they feel nervous or when they feel angry, that's actually important distinction. how you feel on the inside versus what you're expressing to your counterpart. So in this paper, what we found is as a base rate, most people feel anxious before and during a negotiation because it is an intense environment. It's probably one of the greatest benefits of taking a negotiation course is that you just get reps and so you get more comfortable with the process of doing it. That might be the biggest takeaway from doing a training course like that. And so in this paper, we had that sort of base rate. Look, everybody's feeling anxious. And then what are the downstream consequences of feeling anxious? And what we find people, we had people doing negotiations, playing these negotiation games. What we find is that people are much more likely to sort of leave prematurely or make more concessions to relieve the feelings of anxiety.
</details>

**Stephen：** 提出糟糕的报价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Make bad offers.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。或者这取决于你的目标，对吧？如果你的目标是争取大量价值，那么做出让步和放弃金钱对你没有帮助。所以，如果我向老板要求加薪，而且我非常非常紧张，我就更有可能降低我的期望，接受一个糟糕的报价，并过早地离开这个情境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah. Or it depends on your goals, right? If your goal is to claim a lot of value, then making concessions and giving money away is not going to help you with that. So, if I'm asking my boss for a pay rise, for example, and I'm very, very nervous, I'm much more likely to lower my expectations, accept a bad offer, and leave the situation prematurely.
</details>

**Stephen：** 绝对是。那我该怎么办呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Absolutely. So, what do I do about that?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦，有很多方法。如果我们谈论要求加薪，你想要的是带着尽可能多的个人力量进去。一种方法是先在别处拿到另一份工作机会。我们称之为 **BATNA** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement：谈判协议的最佳替代方案)。你要加强你的BATNA。所以，如果你的老板说：“不，我不会给你加薪。”你可以理直气壮地说：“我要去接受那份别的工作机会，因为我刚从街对面的那家公司得到了一个更好的报价。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh, so many things. If we're talking about asking for a raise, what you want is to go in there with as much sort of personal power as you can, one way to do that is to get another job offer somewhere else first. So, we talk about this as the **BATNA** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). You want to strengthen your BATNA. So, if your boss says, "No, I'm not giving you a raise." You can legitimately say, "I'm going to go take this other job offer cuz I just got a better offer from the guy down the street."
</details>

**Stephen：** 如果你不想接受那个别的offer呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What if you don't want to take the other offer?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 那你就需要对自己诚实，明白你在谈判中拥有多少权力。很多人还犯了一个错误，就是叉着腰进去，好像在说“我应该得到更多的钱”。你应该先问很多问题，了解我是否在和对的人谈判？我的公司是否有资金给我加薪？为什么？我该如何以一种对他们有说服力的方式来证明这一点？对吧？这不取决于你，而是他们需要想留住你，并觉得你得到了公平和慷慨的回报。所有这些都需要你在进去提出要求之前问很多问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Then you need to be honest with yourself about how much power you have in the negotiation. You also probably a lot of people make the mistake of going in sort of hands on hips like I deserve more money. There are lots of questions that you should ask first to know am I negotiating with the right person? Does my company have the funds to actually give me more money? How can I justify this in a way that's compelling to them? Right? It's not up to you. It's that they need to want to keep you and to feel like you are being fairly and generously rewarded and all of that requires asking a lot of questions before you go in and start making demands.
</details>

**Stephen：** 在那种情况下，如果你为我工作，你会如何说服我？你会说什么？因为我确实认为，当你走进去向别人要钱时，很容易让对方产生抵触情绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** In that context, how would you try and persuade me if you work for me? So, what would you say? Because I do think, you know, it's very easy to get someone's backup when you walk in and ask them for money.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 如果你做得对的话，百分之百会。我很难回答这个问题，因为……也许这涉及到我的个人价值观。我暂时摘下专家的帽子。我认为获得加薪最好的方法就是变得非常出色。做有价值的事情，你的公司甚至会在你开口之前就给你加薪。所以在我心里，关于“我们如何进行一场要求加薪的对话”这个问题，我几乎希望你根本不会到那一步。如果你真的让自己变得几乎不可替代，并且非常有价值，你的老板会主动来找你，说：“我必须留住你。你太棒了。你太不可思议了。”这样的对话比走进去说“这不公平，我挣得不够多”要容易得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** 100%. I it's hard for me to answer this because maybe this is sort of my personal values. It's almost like I'm taking off my expert hat for a moment. I think the best way to get a raise is to be awesome. Do things that are valuable and your company is going to give you more money without even having to ask for it. So in my heart, this question of how do we have a conversation where I ask for more money? It's almost like I would hope that you don't even get to that point. If you are truly making yourself almost irreplaceable and incredibly valuable, your boss is going to be coming to you and saying, "I have to keep you around. You're amazing. You're so incredible." That's a much easier conversation to have than walking in and saying, "I'm it's not fair. I don't make enough."
</details>

**Stephen：** 我认为这是事实。我认为通常情况下，如果人们的首要任务是他们想要什么，他们往往得不到他们想要的。但那些把“我能给予什么”作为首要任务的人，往往能得到他们想要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I do think that holds to be true. I think that generally if people's first priority is what they want, then they often don't tend to get what they want. But people who have the priority, their first priority is what I can give tend to get what they want.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 没错。这有点像一种心态的转变。如果你优先考虑他人的需求，如果你思考你的老板认为什么有价值，组织认为什么有价值，并且你努力去满足那些需求，你就会让自己变得有价值，而这最终会回报给你。希望如此，我认为通常情况下都是这样。几乎总是这样。在“谈话”框架中，我们会讲到，K代表善意（Kindness）。这并不是利他主义意义上的善意，比如“我要帮助我的老板，做他想做的一切，因为我非常关心他。”那可以是其中的一部分。但它也是一种循环，比如，如果你给了他一切，如果你给了组织它所需要的一切，那就会回报给你。你实际上会变得有价值，并得到你想要的。这就是关系的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** That's right. It's a bit of a sort of like a mindset shift. If you prioritize other people's needs, if you're thinking about what your boss finds valuable, what the organization finds valuable, and you rise to meet those needs, you make yourself valuable, which is going to come back to you. Hopefully that's the hope. And I think often that is the case. Almost always that is the case in the talk framework and we'll get there. The K is for kindness. And it's not kindness in the sense of like altruism because I'm going to help my boss and do everything he wants because I care so deeply. That can be part of it. But also it's this sort of loop of like well if you give him everything if you give the organization what it needs that's going to come back to you. You will actually become valuable and get what you want as well. That's how relationships work.

### 对话罗盘：明确你的沟通目标

**Stephen：** 通常我采访别人时，是我来主导。今天，我要跟随你的节奏，好吗？因为你知道我和观众想要达到的结果。我这里准备了所有这些东西。这些积木上写着 T A L K。谈话。你来告诉我从哪里开始最好。你知道结果，你知道我想达到什么目的。我想成为最好的谈话者，最有说服力、最有影响力、最讨人喜欢的谈话者。所以，我将听从你的引导。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Usually when I interview people, I lead the way. Today, I'm going to follow, okay? Because you know the outcome that me and the audience want to get to. So, I have all this stuff here. I have these blocks that for anyone that can't see the conversation, say T A L K on them. Talk. You tell me the best place to start. You know the outcome. You know where I want to get to. I want to be the best conversationalist, the best talker, the most persuasive, influential, likable talker in the world. So, I shall follow your lead.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦天哪，这可是很大的权力。我太喜欢了，太喜欢了。我们从这个开始吧。我想让你想一个你最近进行的对话。必须超过5分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh my gosh, it's a lot of power. I love it. I love it so much. Let's start with this. I want you to think of a conversation that you had recently. It has to be more than 5 minutes long.
</details>

**Stephen：** 超过五分钟？好的，我立刻就想到了一个。那是我和我女朋友的一次对话，我只是想让她知道我承认我搞砸了。我承认在某个特定时刻我应该更专心，但我没有。我只是想承担责任，并向她传达我的歉意，让她知道我明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** More than five? Yes, I can think of one immediately. It was a conversation I had with my girlfriend where I just wanted her to know that I accept the fact that I fucked up. Like I accept the fact that I should have been more present in a particular moment and I wasn't. And I just wanted to own it and convey that I'm sorry and I get it.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，所以你有点承认自己有过错。你为什么想这么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yep. So you sort of have an admission of blameworthiness. Why did you want to do that?
</details>

**Stephen：** 因为我觉得她是对的，我后悔我的行为。有时候我觉得她不对，有时候我会反驳。但在那个特定的场景下，我觉得，实际上总的来说，我应该更专注。那对她来说是一个重要的时刻，事后看来，那不是我希望自己表现出来的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Because I felt that she was right and I regretted my behavior. So sometimes I don't feel like she's right. Sometimes I'm here to respond. In this particular scenario, I thought, you know, actually on balance, I should have been more present. This was an important time for her and in hindsight, that's not how I wish I had behaved.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 好的。在这次对话期间和结束时，你希望她有什么感觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Okay. How did you want her to feel during and at the end of this conversation?
</details>

**Stephen：** 被理解。真的就是这样。我希望她感到被理解，并且和我心意相通。但更重要的是，我只是想让她不用担心我不明白，这样她就不用再说一遍了。我只是想让她知道我懂了。并且未来我希望自己的行为能有所不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Understood. And you really... that was really it. It's like I wanted her to feel understood and I guess like connected to me. But it's more... it's really more I just wanted her to not worry that I didn't understand so she didn't have to say it again. Like I just wanted her to know that I get it. And that in future I wish I behave differently.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 在这次对话期间和之后，你希望自己有什么感觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** How did you want to feel during and after this conversation?
</details>

**Stephen：** 我想我是想卸下负罪感。因为我觉得很糟糕。是的，它一直压在我的良心上。我就想，我得说出来，我得承认，因为它让我觉得自己像个混蛋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I guess I wanted to offload the guilt. Because I felt bad. I felt like no actually. And it was weighing on your conscience. You were like, I got to say that. I got to own this because it's making me feel like a shit.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 好的。太棒了。当我们回顾我们的对话并试图描述我们的目标时，你很快就会意识到我们的目标非常复杂，我们想要很多东西。我猜可能还有时间因素。你能谈谈那个吗？比如，你有多少时间来实现这些目标？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Okay. Fabulous. Okay. When we look back on our conversations and try and describe what our goals were, very quickly you start to realize that our goals are very complicated that we want a lot of things. I'm also guessing there may have been a time component. Can you talk a little bit about that? Like how much time did you have to achieve these goals?
</details>

**Stephen：** 我的时间好像总是不够用。所以，是的，我大概有20分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I mean, I never seem to have enough time. So, it was like... Yeah. So, I had about probably about 20 minutes.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我有一个框架可以帮助我们思考对话目标，我称之为 **“对话罗盘”** (Conversational Compass)。就像你用来在沙漠或森林中找路的罗盘一样，这个罗盘帮助你决定不是走哪条路，而是说哪条路。X轴是水平的，关于你们的关系。高关系目标是你关心的、为对方或你们的关系服务的事情。这次对话听起来关系目标非常高。你真的就像，“我只想让她知道我觉得自己像个混蛋，我承认错误，我在乎，也许我不会再犯了。”低关系目标是我们关心的、为我们自己服务的事情。在这种情况下，你说了类似“我想卸下我的负罪感”这样的话。Y轴是关于信息交换。高信息目标取决于交换准确的信息。这在某种程度上是人类学会沟通的原因。但我们关心的很多事情是低信息的。所以它不关乎交换信息，有时甚至关乎隐藏信息。在这种情况下，你有一个高信息目标。你想说服她或向她证明你是个好人，她应该继续和你在一起，信任你。但你也有低信息目标，比如你不想让这次对话在情感上不愉快。你还有时间限制这样的低信息目标。你需要保护你的时间和她的时间。我们总是受时间和认知资源的限制。这样做的目的是帮助我们以一种逻辑的方式规划所有这些目标。每个象限都是好的。我们生活在所有四个象限中。我们不是要达到某个象限，它只是帮助我们描述我们真正关心的许多事情。每个象限都有一个积极的名字。高信息、高关系是关于 **连接** (Connection)。低信息、高关系是关于 **品味** (Savoring)。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I have a framework that helps us think about conversational goals and I call it the **Conversational Compass.** Okay. And like a compass that you might use to find your way out of the desert or the forest. The compass helps you decide which way not to walk but to talk. Okay. So the x-axis which runs horizontally, is about your relationship. High relational goals are things that you care about that are serving the other person or your relationship. This conversation sounded very high relational. You're truly like, I just really want her to know that I feel like a shit and that I'm owning it and like I care and I maybe won't do it again. Something like that. Low relational goals are things we care about that serve us. So in this case you said something like I want to offload get rid of my guilt. I was feeling bad. The y-axis is about information exchange. High informational goals hinge on exchanging accurate information. It's sort of the reason human beings developed the ability to communicate at all right way back when. But we care about tons of stuff that is low-informational. So it's not about exchanging information and sometimes it's about concealing it. In this case, you had a high informational goal. You wanted to sort of persuade her or prove to her that you're a good guy and that she should stay with you essentially, trust you. But you also had low informational goals like you didn't want it to be emotionally unpleasant to have this conversation. You also had low informational goals like a time constraint. You needed to protect your time and her time. and so we're always limited by time and cognitive resources. So the point of this is to help us plot all of those goals in a logical way. Each quadrant is good. We live in all four quadrants. We're not trying to get to one or another. It's just to help us describe all of the many things that we actually care about. High informational, high relational is about **connection**. Low informational, high relational is about **savoring**.
</details>

**Stephen：** “信息性”在这个语境下是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What does informational mean in this context?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 就是你需要相互交换多少准确信息。如果我们只是安静地坐在这里，我哼着歌，然后我说“我喜欢你的衬衫”之类的话，我们没有交换太多信息，但我们可能正在进行一次非常愉快的互动。所以不是每次对话都关乎高信息交换，尽管很多人认为如此。你认识这些人，他们非常事务性。他们觉得对话就是你把你知道的事情说给别人听，然后他们会把他们知道的事情说回给你。这是一个很大的错误。左下角基本上是 **辨别** (Discernment)，我们称之为 **保护** (Protection)。它保护你的时间，保护你的声誉，保护信息。所以，隐藏、保守秘密、快速行动。我们不能在这里坐上几个小时。然后是保护你的声誉。比如你关心给别人留下积极的印象。我希望你认为我聪明、温暖、冷静和值得信赖。这些是自利、低关系或低信息的目标。然后我们到左上角，那是低关系、自利、高信息的目标。这是很多与工作相关的目标，比如 **说服** (Persuasion)、做决定、头脑风暴等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Like how much accurate information you are trying to exchange with each other. If we just sat here kind of quietly and I hummed a song and I said something like I love your shirt. We're not exchanging a lot of information but we might be having a very lovely interaction with each other. So not every conversation is about high information exchange though many people think that it is. You know these people they're very transactional. They feel like a conversation is where you just say things you know at other people and that they're going to say things they know back at you. That's a big mistake. Lower left is essentially **discernment**. We call it **protection**. It's protecting your time, protecting your reputation, protecting information. So, concealing, keeping secrets, moving quickly. We can't sit here for hours and hours and hours. And then protecting your reputation. Like you care about making a positive impression on other people. I want you to see me as smart and warm and calm and trustworthy. These are self-serving, low relational or low informational goals. And then we get up to upper left, which is low relational, they're self-serving, high informational. This is a lot of work related goal, **persuasion**, making decisions, brainstorming, etc.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以如果我想被人喜欢并拥有良好的人际关系，我需要在这个图的右侧。这个说法准确吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So if I want to be liked and have great relationships, I need to be on the right side of this. Is that accurate?

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 如果一个信任你、爱你的人私下告诉你一些事，然后你到处告诉别人，会发生什么？你会失去信任。所以，你不能只生活在罗盘的这一边，因为辨别力对关系很重要。在这里，你希望建立一种关系，在这种关系中你们可以一起进行头脑风暴，一起做决定。即使是和朋友，你也会说：“哦，我们今晚去哪里吃饭？”你们需要一起协调好那个选择。所以，我认为一个愿望是尽可能多地待在右侧。事实上，拥有那种推动自己更多地思考更具社会性的目标的心态，是一个良性的目标。但是，听着，我们都有实际需求。所以你不能只生活在罗盘的右侧。关键在于以一种精明的方式四处移动，并且真正服务于你所关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So what happens if someone who trusts you and loves you tells you something in confidence and then you go tell everybody else? You lose trust. Yeah. So it's not that you can only live on this side of the compass because discernment matters for relationships. Right. So, and here you are going to be in a relationship where hopefully you're going to be like brainstorming things together, making decisions together. Even with a friend, you're like, "Oh, where should we go to dinner tonight?" You need to make that coordinate that choice well together. So, I think one aspiration is to try and be over on the right side as much as you can. And in fact, having the mindset of pushing yourself to try and think about your goals that are more pro-social more often is a virtuous goal. But like listen, we all have actual needs. So like you can't only live on the right side of the compass. It's about moving around in a way that is savvy and and actually serves what you care about.

### 如何有效道歉以及应对棘手对话

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们可以谈谈道歉吗？我很高兴你选择这个作为例子，以及你描述它的方式。我喜欢你说“我没有长篇大论地解释我为什么这么做或任何事情”。更多的人应该那样道歉。很多人在道歉时的本能是重提问题，并为自己做错事找借口或解释。这并不有效。更有效的是你所描述的。承担责任并说：“看，我就是搞砸了，我非常抱歉，我感觉很糟糕。” **而道歉中最有效的部分实际上是承诺改变。** 如果你对你的女朋友说：“我意识到我在这里搞砸了。我不会再这样做了。这是我未来会如何改变的具体计划。”听到你已经考虑过这些，并且这是可衡量的，因为她将来可以看到你是否真的遵守了那个承诺，这非常有说服力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Can we talk about apologies for a sec? I love that you chose this as your example because and the way you're describing it. I love how you're saying I didn't go into a huge explanation of why I did it or anything. More people should apologize that way. A lot of people their instinct when they're apologizing is to revisit the problem and sort of make excuses or explain why they did the thing wrong. It's not effective. What is more effective is what you're describing. Taking ownership and saying, "Look, I just messed up and I'm so sorry and I feel awful about it." And **the most effective component of an apology is actually making a promise to change.** If you say to your girlfriend, "I realize I messed up here. I'm not going to do it again. Here's how I'm going to be different in the future. Like a concrete plan. It's so compelling to hear that you've thought about that and that and then it's measurable because she can see in the future. Do you actually live up to that promise?
</details>

**Stephen：** 会不会有道歉太多的时候？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Is there a point where you can apologize too much?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们研究过这个问题。我做了一些相关的研究。我们从观察正常对话中道歉的频率开始。一个人过度道歉的情况相当罕见，但似乎在一次对话中，如果你道歉超过两次，它就开始更多地提醒人们发生过的不好的事情。就像你不断地重提它，让你回到负面情绪中，而不是向前看。我们还在一个非常大的假释听证会数据集中研究了道歉，对象是那些犯了非常严重罪行的人。我们观察了他们在假释听证会上所做的道歉类型。在那里，似乎你道歉再多也不为过，越多越好。同样，最有效的组成部分是承诺未来会改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** We studied this. I ran some studies on this. We started by looking at frequency of apologies made during normal conversations. It's quite rare for someone to over apologize, but it does seem like within one conversation, if you apologize more than twice, it starts to be more of a reminder of the bad thing that happened. Like you just keep revisiting it and it brings you back to the negativity rather than moving forward. We also studied apologies in a really large data set of parole hearings like among people who had committed really serious crimes and we looked at the types of apologies that they made during their parole hearings. And there it seems like you actually can't overapologize like more is better. And again, the most effective component is making a promise to change in the future.
</details>

**Stephen：** 在进行那些困难的对话时，有什么需要准备的吗？因为我们的生活充满了困难的对话，而实际上，正是对它们的逃避最终把我们的生活搞得一团糟。所以，当你想到我们都必须进行的困难对话，或者与难相处的人对话时，我需要为此做准备吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And going into those difficult conversations, is there anything one needs to do to prepare? Because our lives are full of difficult conversations and actually it's the avoidance of them that ends up messing up our lives the most. So when you think about difficult conversations that we all have to have or with difficult people is do I have to prepare for that?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 这很自然。几乎每个你听到的谈论沟通的人都倾向于关注困难的对话。我要告诉你，这实际上是对对话世界一个非常狭隘的看法。事实上，把对话分为“困难”和“容易”有点用词不当。并不是说有些对话是困难的，有些是容易的。而是在每一次对话中，都可能出现差异的时刻。我们用不同的语言表达同一个意思，我们的情绪不一致，我们的动机有差异。我想给你建议，但你不想接受。或者某些事情触及了我们身份的差异。我是美国人，你是英国人。所以，无论何时，你都会在所有这些不同的方面遇到这些短暂的差异时刻。你需要具备相应的技能，以确保温度不会变得太高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So this is very natural. Almost every person that you hear talk about communication tends to focus on difficult conversations. I'm going to suggest to you that that is a very narrow view of the conversational world actually. And in fact, thinking about difficult conversations is a little bit of a misnomer. It's not like there are some conversations that are difficult and some that are easy. It's that in every conversation there can be moments of difference where we use different language to mean the same thing. where we have an incongruence in our emotions, where we have a difference in motives. I want to give you you advice, but you don't want to take it. Or something dips down to a difference in our identities. I'm American and you're a Brit. So, anytime you encounter these little fleeting moments of difference in all of these different ways... you need to have the skill set to be able to make sure the temperature doesn't get too hot.
</details>

**Stephen：** 那套技能是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What is that skill set?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 有一项关于这个的绝佳研究。我发现它在我的生活中非常有帮助，这是朱莉娅·明克森、迈克·耶曼斯、汉娜·柯林斯的研究，叫做 **“接纳性”** (receptiveness)。所以，这是对接纳对立观点的态度，既是一种心态，也是一种行为。当有人向你提出一些看起来很疯狂的事情时，你不要负面地评判它。你必须对抗那种认为“这太疯狂了，那是错的，现在我要赢，我要证明你是错的”的人类本能。因为所有这些本能都会毁掉我们的对话和我们的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** There's a fabulous research on this. I have found it incredibly helpful in my life research by Julia Mincson, Mike Yeomans, Hannah Collins called **receptiveness**. So it's receptiveness to opposing viewpoints and it's both the mindset when you when someone comes to you with something that seems crazy, you don't judge it negatively. You have to fight the human instinct to think of it as like that's crazy, that's wrong, and now I'm going to win and now I'm going to be right and prove you wrong. Because all of those instincts ruin our conversations and our relationships.
</details>

**Stephen：** 比如说有人来找你，说了一些疯狂的话。他们说，天空是紫色的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** She says someone comes to me and comes to you and says something crazy. They say, you know, the sky is purple.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，它不是蓝色的，是紫色的。这里有一个你可以在那一刻说的神奇短语。“你觉得天空是紫色的，这很合理。”“你兴奋地告诉我天空是紫色的，这很合理。”“你对Y感觉X，这很合理。”“你对播客持怀疑态度，这很合理。”“你对我说话快感到恼火，这很合理。”“你对人工智能感到担忧，这很合理。”无论人们有什么感觉，无论他们向你表达了什么，我们都可以认可那种感觉，因为无论他们脑子里在想什么，那都是他们的现实。我们必须大声说出来，然后才能做任何其他事情，即使我们即将强烈地反驳他们。但我们必须先把认可的部分说出来，就像治疗师一直做的那样，为了让他们感到被倾听，感觉“哦，是的，我在这里是安全的”，这样我才能加入你，站到你这边，现在我们一起来解开这个奇怪的问题。你说天空是紫色的。多告诉我一些，比如你是怎么会觉得天空是紫色的？你现在可以问一些问题，了解他们是如何形成那种观点的，然后我们可以从中学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, it's actually it's not blue, it's purple. Here's a magical phrase that you can say in that moment. It makes sense that you feel that the sky is purple. It makes sense that you feel excited to tell me that the sky is purple. It makes sense that you feel X about Y. Makes sense that you feel skeptical about podcasts. It makes sense that you feel annoyed that I speak quickly. It makes sense that you are worried about AI. Whatever people are feeling, whatever they express to you, we can validate that feeling because whatever is going on in their mind is their reality. And we have to say that out loud before we go on to do anything else, even if we're about to disagree with them vehemently. But we have to say the validation piece first just like therapists do all the time in order for them to feel heard and like, "Oh yeah, I'm safe here so that I can join you on your side of the table and now we're going to untangle this weird problem together." You say the sky is purple. Tell me more like how did you come to feel like the sky is purple? Now I can ask you questions about how you came to that perspective and we can learn about it.
</details>

**Stephen：** 我想风险在于你不想认可错误的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** I guess the risk is you don't want to validate something wrong.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 为什么不呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Why not?
</details>

**Stephen：** 你不想显得在说……因为如果我说“你认为天空是紫色的，这很合理”，但它实际上是蓝色的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** You don't want to appear to be saying cuz if I say it makes sense that you think the sky is purple but it's actually blue.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** “认为”这个词很重要。应该是“你对Y感觉X，这很合理。”而不是“你对Y认为X，这很合理。”思考是一种认知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** The word thinks is important. It's it makes sense that you feel X about Y. Not it makes sense that you think X about Y. Thinking is like a cognition.
</details>

**Stephen：** 风险是听起来会不会有点居高临下？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Is the risk of it sounding patronizing?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 也许吧，但在实践中，感觉真的非常好。我们都渴望被认可，即使是荒谬的认可也感觉很棒。所以，当你们进入第二轮，每个人都在分享他们真正挣扎的事情，旁边的人说：“哇，我很抱歉。那听起来真的很难。”“你为你妈妈感到难过，这很合理。”现在你养成了那个习惯，你在让他们对一件确实值得那种认可的事情感觉相当好。所以，这一切都是关于培养这些习惯，无论分歧或不和来自何方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Maybe, but in practice it feels really, really good. We are all so hungry for validation that even ridiculous validation feels amazing. So then when you get to round two and everybody's sharing something that they're really struggling with and the person next to them says, "Wow, I'm so sorry. That sounds really, really hard." It makes sense that you feel upset about your mom. Now you've got that habit and you're making them feel quite good about something that actually does deserve that validation. So it's all about like developing these habits no matter where the difference or disagreement is coming from.

### TALK 框架：成为沟通高手的蓝图

**Stephen：** 人们真的很关心亲和力。他们非常想知道是什么让他们不受欢迎，也非常想知道如何才能讨人喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** One of the things we notice when we have conversations on this show about conversation is people really care about likability. Like they really want to know what's making them disliked and they really want to know how to be liked.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 好的。所以被喜欢是一个巨大的驱动力。但它只是我们关心的获得地位的众多事情之一。地位是在他人眼中的尊重、钦佩和喜爱。喜爱通常来自温暖和魅力。钦佩通常来自对能力的感知。所以我们理想中希望同时拥有温暖和能力。我们回到过去吧。我们来谈谈 **TALK 框架**，因为在整个框架中都会有关于如何更受欢迎的小线索。首先我想说，作为一个整体框架，**TALK 是世界上关于沟通的最全面、最具教学性、最实用、最科学严谨的框架。**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Good. So being liked is a huge drive. But it's just one of many things that we care about in terms of gaining status. So status is respect, admiration, liking in the eyes of other people. Liking is usually comes from sort of warmth and charm. Admiration often comes from like perceptions of competence. So we want warmth and competence at once ideally. Okay. Let's go back in time. Should we talk about the **TALK framework** because they're going to be little clues about how to be better liked across the whole framework. I just want to say as a whole framework **TALK is the most comprehensive, teachable, practical, scientifically rigorous framework in the world for communication.**
</details>

**Stephen：** 是你发明的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Did you invent it?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。你这么说是应该的，但我第一次写这本书的时候，说得不够有力。在过去将近一年的时间里，我开始意识到原因。一部分是因为大多数人只关注困难的对话，而我们这里关注的是所有对话，甚至包括那些看起来应该轻松有趣的对话。是所有地方的所有对话，个人的和职业的。另一部分是，作为一名科学家，我甚至没有真正打算这样做，但我们做研究的方式基本上是自然语言处理和机器学习，这正好符合人工智能这个新世界。所以这个框架可以被人类或机器用来指导人们成为更好的谈话者，也可以在事后用作评估标准，说：“好的，这次进行得怎么样？你做得好吗？我们来看看 T A L K 并评估一下。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I did. So you would say that, but I didn't when I first wrote the book I didn't say it strongly enough. And in the last almost year I've come to realize why. One part is because most people focus only on difficult conversations and here we are focusing on all conversations even the ones that seem like they should be easy and fun. It's all conversations everywhere personal and professional. The other piece is that I didn't even really intend this as a scientist but the way we do research is essentially natural language processing, machine learning fits into this new world of AI. So the framework can be used by humans or machines to coach people to be better conversationalists and used as a rubric after the fact of saying, "Okay, how did this go? Did you do well? Let's look at T A L K and evaluate."
</details>

**Stephen：** 好的，这是有史以来世界上最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Okay, it's the best in the world ever.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 谢谢你，斯蒂芬。好的，谢谢你。谢谢你的认可。好的。T 代表 **话题** (Topics)。话题是对话的基石。它是我们选择谈论的内容。很简单。我们都有一个直观的理解，我们好像会经历不同的板块。首先，我们要谈谈你和你女朋友的对话。然后，我们要谈谈 TALK 框架。然后，我们谈谈罗盘，等等。我们在经历不同的话题。我认为大多数人没有意识到的是，我们每次说话都在选择话题。不仅仅是在对话开始时，像一个开场白，“嘿，你觉得这部《外交官》怎么样？”不，是你每次说话时，我们都在做出一些举动，要么温和地保持话题，要么转换到别的话题。这最美妙之处在于，这意味着我们都拥有力量。我们都有控制权，可以把对话推向这个或那个方向。我们都可以做得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Thank you, Stephen. Okay, thank you. Thank you for recognizing. Okay. T is for **topics**. Topics are the building blocks of conversation. It is what we choose to talk about. Very simple. We all have an intuitive understanding that we sort of work through different chunks. First, we're going to talk about your conversation with your girlfriend. Then, we're going to talk about the talk framework. Then, we're talk about the compass, whatever. We're working through topics. What I think most people don't realize is that we're choosing topics every time we talk. It's not just at the beginning of a conversation like an opener like, "Hey, what do you think of this, you know, the diplomat?" No, it's every time you're talking, we're making moves to gently stay on topic or switch to something else. What's so beautiful about that is it means we all have power. We all have control to nudge the conversation one way or another. And we can all do a better job with it.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以这里的诀窍是什么？选择更好的话题，知道我们想要达到什么话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So, what's the game here? To pick better topics, to know what topic we're aiming at.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 有很多目标。既要选择更好的话题，也要思考如何让任何话题变得更好。一个非常重要的建议是，当你开始意识到你的大脑在实时对话中做了多少工作时，就把一些认知工作分担到事前。好的。所以，提前准备话题。这不意味着在你给你父母或女朋友打电话前写下一个议程。它的意思是，在你陷入对话的混乱之前，花上哪怕30秒，甚至10秒，来思考一下你可以谈论什么，或者你可能需要记住谈论的重要事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** There's a lot of goals. It's both about choosing better topics. It's also about how can we make any topic better. Okay, one huge piece of advice that when you start to realize how much your mind is doing during a live conversation is to offload some of that cognitive work to beforehand. Okay. So, prepping topics ahead of time. This does not mean writing out an agenda before you call your parents or before you call your girlfriend. What it does mean is spending even 30 seconds, maybe even 10 seconds before you're in the chaos of a conversation to think about what you could talk about or what might be important for you to remember to talk about.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你今天这么做了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Did you do that today?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 总是这样。有时候你不需要，对吧？比如你今天就做了。你做了大量的准备。你甚至把东西印在了卡片上。在某种程度上，我为这次对话准备了20年。我一直在研究这些东西。我自己设计了这个框架。我上过80个其他的播客。那都是为这一刻做的准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Always. Sometimes you don't have to, right? Like you did it today. You did extensive prep. You even have things printed on cards here. And in a way, I have been prepping for this conversation for 20 years. I've been studying these things. I designed the framework myself. I've gone on 80 other, you know, podcasts. I that's all prep for this moment.
</details>

**Stephen：** 在你的个人生活中呢？你能给我一个你准备话题的例子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What about in your personal life? Can you give me an example of where you prepared topics?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 在我所知道的每一次即将到来的对话中。我举个例子。在我来这里之前，和我们团队的成员卡西交谈时，我想问她从伦敦搬到洛杉矶是什么感觉。我想问她和你一起工作是什么感觉。她都说了好话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Every conversation that I know is coming. I give an example. So with Casi, which is a member of our team, before I got here, I thought about I wanted to ask her what it's like to be moving from London to LA. I wanted to ask her what it's like to work with you. She said all good things.
</details>

**Stephen：** 都是好话。下一个问题。A是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** All good things. Next question. What does A mean?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我经常会……这不是什么高深的科学。它只是字面意义上的一点点预想。我可以问你什么样的问题或话题，能让我们的对话感觉比仅仅在当下即兴发挥、谈论我在房间里看到的某个随机的东西要好一点？我在每次对话前都尽量这样做，因为现在我知道它有多么强大，多么友善。如果你给某人打电话，然后你想：“哦，对了，他们的孩子要去上吉他课。我应该记得问问这个。”或者，“哦，我的朋友在工作中有个重要的演讲。我应该记得问问结果怎么样。”这意味着你会记得问他们，这非常友善，他们也会很兴奋地谈论这个。这让一切都变得更好。所以，话题准备非常重要。在我们的研究中，我们发现，当你随机分配人们去准备或不准备话题时，那些提前思考过哪怕30秒的对话，他们会感觉不那么焦虑。对话会更顺畅。话题之间的“嗯”、“啊”等不流畅的情况会更少。他们会涵盖更多的话题，这通常是好事。更有可能找到好的话题。你也不太可能脱口而出，所以你不太可能与人分享你不想分享的事情。这只是一个极其强大的策略，而且不需要很复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I often will... It's not rocket science. It's literally just a little bit of forethought. What kinds of questions or topics could I ask you that will make our conversation feel a little bit better than just like winging it in the moment and talking about like some random thing I see in the room? I try to do this before every conversation because now I know how powerful it is and how kind it is. If you are calling somebody and you're like, "Okay, oh yeah, their kid was going to take guitar lessons. I should remember to ask about that." Or, "Oh, my friend had this big presentation at work. I should remember to ask how that went." That means you're going to remember to ask them and that's super kind and it they're excited to talk about it, too. It makes everything better. So, topic prep is a huge deal. In our research, what we find when you randomly assign people to prep topics or not, the conversations where people have thought ahead even for 30 seconds, they feel less anxious. They're much smoother. There are fewer disfluencies, so ums, stutters between topics. They cover more topics, which is usually a good thing. More likely to land on good topics. You're less likely to blurt, so you're less likely to share things that you don't want to share with people. It's just an incredibly powerful strategy and it doesn't need to be complicated.
</details>

**Stephen：** 这可能会让你成为一个更讨人喜欢的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** It probably makes you more, going back to the point about likability, it probably makes you a more likable person.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，更讨人喜欢得多。事实上，如果你能实现更多的目标，无论它们是高信息性、低信息性、高关系性还是低关系性，所有这些都会让你更讨人喜欢。你看起来更有能力，更温暖，尤其是当你倾向于那些亲社会、高关系性的目标时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Much more likable. Yeah. In fact, if you can achieve more of your goals, whether they're high informational, low informational, high relational, low relational, all of that makes you more likable. You seem more competent. You seem more warm, especially when you lean towards those pro-social, high relational goals.
</details>

### 话题金字塔与提问的力量

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 在你的描述中，你已经很快地在与他们互动时切换话题了。你知道你不能长时间地在谈论天气的话题上兜圈子。所以，简单说一下，我们不需要避免闲聊。事实上，对于陌生人或者很久没见的人来说，这是一种非常重要的社交仪式。我们在这里落脚，说：“哦，我们现在开始对话了。”人们犯的错误是，他们在那里停留太久了。太久了。任何超过“哦天哪，天气真暖和。加州就像夏天一样”这样一句话的时间，你就需要让它变得更个人化，并迅速地在这个话题金字塔上向上移动，向中度谈话、深度谈话迈进。闲聊在底部。这些是任何人都可以谈论的话题。定制化的谈话更令人兴奋，更个人化，更与你的兴趣相关。深度谈话是这个金字塔的顶峰。只有我们能以这种特殊的方式谈论这件事。不是每次对话都能达到深度谈话，但当它发生时，我们应该感到非常感激。这是作为人类最神奇的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** In that description already you're moving quite quickly through topics as you're interacting with them. You know that you can't be circling the drain talking about the weather for long periods of time. So just briefly let me say we don't need to avoid small talk. In fact, it's a very important social ritual for people who are strangers to each other, people who haven't seen each other in a long time. It's where we land and say, "Oh, we're doing conversation now." The mistake that people make is they stay there too long. Way too long. Any more than like one beat of, "Oh my goodness, the weather's really warm. It's like summer in California." Then you need to make it more personal and move up this topic pyramid towards medium talk, deep talk quickly. Right? So small talk is at the bottom. These are topics anybody can talk about. Tailored talk is more exciting, more personalized, more relevant to your interests. Deep talk is the peak of this pyramid. Only we can talk about this thing in this special way. Not every conversation is bound to get to the deep talk, but when it does, we should feel very appreciative. It's one of the most magical things about being humans.
</details>

**Stephen：** 关系就是在那里建立的吗？深度的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And is that where relationships are built? Deep ones.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 当然。在顶部的时刻，可能吧？这就是脆弱性带你去的地方。通常，问很多问题，尤其是追问，能让你更快地爬上金字塔。那么，我们是不是应该转到 TALK 框架的 A 了，因为 A 代表 **提问** (Asking)。话题和提问是紧密相连的。人们转换话题最常见的方式就是通过提问。所以你可以用问题，比如“你最近对什么感到兴奋？”或者“你最喜欢和哪位嘉宾交谈？”一旦你确定了一个话题，我们就用追问来深入探讨，并沿着话题金字塔向上移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** For sure. At the top, moments at the top probably, right? This is where vulnerability takes you. Often asking lots of questions, especially follow-up questions, gets you up the pyramid more quickly. So shall we shift to the A of the talk framework because A is for **asking**. Topics and asking are intimately tied to each other. The most common way that people switch topics is by asking a question. So you can use questions like what are you excited about recently? Or what has been your favorite guest to talk to? Once you're on a topic, we use follow-up questions to kind of dive deeply and move up the topic pyramid.
</details>

**Stephen：** 所以你是说我应该问更多问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So are you saying I should ask more questions?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。也许不包括你，因为你花了很多时间问问题，但对大多数人来说，让他们的对话变得更好的首要建议就是多问问题。提问。听起来很简单，几乎每个人都知道，但在实践中却相当困难，而且这是一种技巧。做得好的人在约会中更成功，在工作会议中更成功，作为合作者更成功，作为企业家在获得资金方面也更成功。所有这一切都取决于提问。所以，首要建议，就是多问问题。至少，不要成为一个不问问题的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yes. Maybe not you because you spend a lot of time asking questions, but most people the topline advice to make their conversations better is to ask many more questions. Asking. It sounds so simple and it's almost like everybody already knows that, but doing it in practice is quite hard and it's a skill. And people who do it well are more successful on romantic dates. They're more successful in work meetings. They're more successful as collaborators. They're more successful as entrepreneurs in getting funding. All of it hinges on on question asking. So the topline advice, just ask more questions. At the very least, don't be a zero question asker.
</details>

**Stephen：** 不问问题的人的命运会怎样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What happens to the fate of zero question askers?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦，他们不会有第二次约会。他们不会得到那笔资金。他们没有足够了解他们的伙伴，无法让他们成功。如果你第一次约会不问任何问题，想象一下，我们可能都经历过那样的约会，你会在10分钟内就想离开。第一次约会时，你们有很多东西要互相了解。你们有一切需要互相了解。所以如果有人不问问题，那真的是个大问题。我认为这对男性来说尤其是一个很好的技巧，在异性恋约会中。他们经常犯的错误就是问的问题不够多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh, they're not getting a second date. They're not going to get that funding. They're not learning enough about their partner to enable them to succeed. If you go on a first date and you're asking zero questions, which like imagine that we've all sort of been on that date probably, you want to leave within 10 minutes. When you're on a first date, you have so much to learn about each other. you have everything to learn about each other. So if someone's not asking, it's a real real real problem. Especially I think this is a very especially good hack for men on heterosexual dates. Often what they're getting wrong is that they're not asking enough questions.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你怎么知道的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** How'd you know this?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 从数据中。是的。我们有上千次快速约会的数据，结果是对方是否想和你进行第二次约会，我们还有对话记录。这是一项由斯坦福大学一个了不起的研究小组在大约10年前进行的一项惊人研究，你可以直接测量。测量他们在每次约会中问了多少问题。问更多问题的人被邀请进行第二次约会的可能性要大得多。想象一下，你进行了20次第一次约会，我说：“好的，斯蒂芬，你只需要在这20次约会中多问一个问题。如果你这样做了，你就能把另一次约会变成第二次约会，仅仅通过每次约会多问一个问题。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** From data. Yeah. So, we have a thousand speed dates and the outcome is does the other person want to go on a second date with you and we have transcripts. It was an amazing study run by this incredible research group at Stanford about 10 years ago and you can just measure it. Measure how many questions they ask on each date. People who ask more questions are enormously more likely to get asked to on a second date. So much. So, imagine you go on 20 first dates and I say, "Okay, Stephen, you just have to ask one extra question on those 20 dates. If you do, you'll convert another date into a second date from just one question per date, according to the data."
</details>

**Stephen：** 我多问问题对对方有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** What is it me asking more questions doing to the other person?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 这让他们感到被倾听，感觉你想知道他们的答案，你对他们感兴趣。所以这不仅表明了你的兴趣，而且你还能了解到他们脑子里的想法和他们的经历，这为你提供了更多的信息，从而可以问出更多更好的问题。所以这不仅仅是多问，尽管那是一个好的开始。这是关于问出色的追问。提问的好处几乎完全是由追问的力量驱动的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** It makes them feel heard and like you want to know their answer, that you're interested in them. And so it signals your interest, but also you learn what's in their mind and what their experience is, which arms you with more information that to then ask more better questions. So it's not just about asking more, although that's a good start. It's about asking great follow-up questions. The benefits of question asking are almost entirely driven by the power of follow-up questions.
</details>

**Stephen：** 给我举一个问出色追问的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So what? Give me an example of asking a great follow-up question.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我们在约会。有食物。一切都很顺利。我刚和你分享了今天早上我在日落大道上进行了一次美妙的散步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** We're on a date. It's there's food. It's going really well. I've just shared with you that I went on an amazing walk down the Sunset Strip this morning.
</details>

**Stephen：** 然后我会说：“真的吗？哦天哪，我一直想去。告诉我，感觉怎么样？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And then I would say, "Really? Oh my god, I've always wanted to go. Tell me tell me about it. How was it?"
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦，太不可思议了。我到了一个我以前从未去过的地方。我必须决定，是拐弯去看玛丽莲·梦露的公寓，顺便说一下，它就在弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特故居旁边。哦天哪。还是去几个街区外的门德斯兄弟的房子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh, incredible. So I got to this point. I had never been there before. There was I had to decide, was I going to veer off and go see the Marilyn Monroe apartment, which by the way is right next to the Frank Lloyd Wright house. Oh my god. or was I going to go a few blocks away was the Mendez brothers house.
</details>

**Stephen：** 那是谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Who's that?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 就是那两个杀了自己父母的兄弟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** The two brothers who killed their parents.
</details>

**Stephen：** 哦，Netflix上那个。哇哦。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Oh, on Netflix. Oh, wow. Okay.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 所以，我正好在两者之间，处于一个十字路口。我选择有文化内涵的，还是选择病态的好奇心？我选择了有文化内涵的。我一个人太害怕了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So, I was literally right in between and I was at this crossroads. Do I choose Cultured? Do I choose Morbid Curiosity? I went with Cultured. I was too afraid by myself.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你真可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** You're so cute.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 好的。我们约会结束了。那太有趣了。你问了这么可爱的问题，真的像是在为我加油，好像你真的想听这个故事。尽管别人可能没那么感兴趣，然后你就会觉得尴尬，哦，我刚分享了一堆脆弱的东西。我一个人在洛杉矶散步，对那两兄弟和那个故事有病态的好奇心。在那种时刻，很容易让别人感到不被认可，但追问让我觉得，哦，他想知道更多。他和我一起踏上了这段旅程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So, okay. So, we're off our date now. That was so fun. you were asking such lovely questions and it really helped to like cheer me on like you actually wanted to hear this story. Um even though it might like someone else might have been like not that interested and then you feel embarrassed like oh I just shared a bunch of vulnerable stuff. I was walking alone in LA. I had morbid curiosity about these two brothers and this story. It's very easy to make someone feel invalidated in that moment, but follow-up questions make me feel like, oh, he wants to know more. He's coming with me on this journey.
</details>

**Stephen：** 那我做得对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So, did I do the right thing then?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的，你做得很好。错误的做法是，想象一下如果我说：“哦，我在日落大道上进行了一次美妙的散步。”而你说：“哦，我在那条街上最喜欢的餐厅是一家寿司店。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah, you were doing great. The wrong thing to have done is... Oh, imagine if I had been like, "Oh, I went this on an amazing walk down the Sunset Strip." And you said, "Oh, my favorite restaurant on the strip is a sushi place."
</details>

**Stephen：** 哦，该死。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Oh, shit.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 人们一直都这么做。这叫做 **“回旋镖式提问”** (Boomer-asking)。不是因为婴儿潮一代（boomers），而是像回旋镖（boomerang）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** People do that all the time. This is called **boomer-asking**. Not because of boomers. It's a boomerang.
</details>

**Stephen：** 哦，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Oh, okay.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 所以，我对你说，斯蒂芬，你最喜欢的餐厅是哪家？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** So, I say to you, Stephen, what's your favorite restaurant?
</details>

**Stephen：** 周先生餐厅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Mr. Chows.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 哦，我去过周先生餐厅。上次我去的时候……是的。所以我问了一个问题。你和我分享了一些东西，那是一份礼物。任何形式的自我表露都是一份礼物。而我没有说：“哦，你和谁一起去的？”或者“你点了什么？”或者“里面是什么样的？你觉得怎么样？”我把对话的焦点直接拉回到了我自己身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Oh, I've been to Mr. Chows. Last time I went to Mr. Chows... Yes. So, I've asked a question. You've shared something with me that is such a gift. Any sort of self-disclosure is such a gift. And instead of saying, "Oh, who did you go with?" or "What did you order?" or "What is it like inside? How did you like it?" I bring the focus of the conversation right back to myself.

### 男性友谊的困境与脆弱性的力量

**Stephen：** 三小时前我问你那个问题时，你说了两件事。你说了把课程引入学校，但也谈到了男人和他们的对话。你说你最近做了一项研究。是关于男人的。这是我记住了你说的。这是回溯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** When I asked you that question three hours ago, you said two things. You said about putting curriculum into schools, but you also talked about men and their conversations. And you said you had done a study recently. Yeah. About men. This is me remembering what you said. This is back.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 太喜欢了。你刚才说的关于男性友谊的研究，我不能透露细节，但它揭示了一些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Loving it. Loving it. Thank you for that. But men and their conversations. You said you've done an interesting study recently which I can't go into the details about, but it was revealing about male friendship.
</details>

**Stephen：** 是的。男人不擅长沟通吗？如果是，为什么我们不擅长沟通？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Yes. Are men bad at communication? If so, why are we bad at communication?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 对话很难。当你深入探究时，它看起来更像一场火车事故，而不是你在电视节目中看到的那种整洁的剧本。它很混乱。我们犯错，我们必须修复它。我们需要核实我们的理解。我们需要不断地道歉。所以，完美不是任何人在对话中的目标。当你观察性别差异时，确实存在真实的性别差异。我们知道，在友谊中，女性倾向于真正地面对面交谈。男性则倾向于一起做活动，对吧？肩并肩。我们钓鱼，我们打篮球，我们在电脑上玩梦幻体育。我最近做的这个项目，我总是花大量时间大规模分析对话记录。但这个项目，我是在现场观察对话。不知何故，这比我通常作为科学家所做的要更直观。而且都是男人第一次遇见其他男人，试图建立友谊。最难看的是，他们真的在脆弱性方面很挣扎。**脆弱性是友谊的一个关键组成部分。** 友谊专家说你需要一致性，所以要反复互动；积极性，一起玩得开心；但可能最重要的是脆弱性。比如不仅分享彼此的感受，还有你正在挣扎什么？你的希望和梦想是什么？你的目标是什么？你想从中得到什么？看着这些男人进行数百次对话，却没有一个人问那些问题或谈论那些事情，这太令人抓狂了。作为一个女人，这几乎是令人震惊的，因为这有点像女人可能在对话的前三分钟内就会谈论的事情。我简直不敢相信，我想：“哇，这真的是一个巨大的差异。”我担心，从篮球伙伴或梦幻体育伙伴到脆弱的对话，这个跨越感觉如此可怕和冒险，以至于男人们无法迈出这一步。这是阻碍男性建立有意义友谊的一个重要部分。我们知道，男性的孤独感比女性严重得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Conversation's hard. When you look under the hood, it's looks more like a train wreck than a sort of tidy script that you would see on a TV show. It's messy. We make mistakes. We have to repair it. We need to check our understanding. We need to make apologies. constantly. So, perfection is not the goal for anyone in conversation. When you look at gender differences, there are real gender differences. We know that in friendship, women tend to actually face each other and talk to each other. Men tend to do activities, right? Shoulder-to-shoulder. We're fishing, we're playing basketball, we're in fantasy sports on our computers. This project that I did recently, I always spend lots of time analyzing transcripts at very large scale. This project though, I was observing conversations live. And for whatever reason, that was much more visceral than what I usually do as a scientist. And it was all men meeting other men for the first time and sort of trying to forge friendships. And what was so hard to watch is that they don't they really struggled with vulnerability. **Vulnerability is such a key component of friendship.** We friendship experts say you need consistency. So interacting repeatedly, positivity, having fun together, but maybe most importantly vulnerability. Like sharing not only your feelings with each other, but like what are you struggling with? What are your hopes and dreams? What are your goals? What do you want to get out of this? It was so maddening to watch these men have hundreds of conversations and like none of them asked those questions or talked about those things with each other. As a woman, it was almost shocking because it's sort of like what women would probably talk about within the first three minutes of the conversation. And I couldn't believe I was like, "Wow, this is really this really seems like a massive difference." And I worry that large scale the leap from being basketball buddies or fantasy sports buddies into vulnerable conversation feels so scary and risky that men are unable to make the leap. And that's a huge part of what's holding back men from having meaningful friendships. And we know that loneliness is so much worse for men than for women.
</details>

**Stephen：** 他们的朋友也少得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And they have way less friends.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。是的。一个荒谬的比例的男性报告说他们没有亲密的朋友。可能高达40%。这相当令人担忧。我认为他们的对话技巧和勇气……听着，我们谈过的所有事情，选择好的话题，当话题变得无聊时转换到新话题，问好问题，问追问，寻找轻松的时刻，道歉，倾听，所有这些事情都需要惊人的勇气和自信。对于那些被社会化教育认为脆弱是软弱表现的男性来说，这感觉就像需要太多的勇气才能在他们的关系中迈出那一步。这相当成问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yes. Yes. A ridiculous proportion of men report having zero close friends. 40% potentially. It's quite troubling. And I think that I think their conversation skills and courage. Listen, everything that we've talked about, choosing good topics, shifting to new topics when they get boring, asking good questions, asking follow-up questions, finding moments of levity, apologizing, listening, all of these things take a surprising amount of courage and confidence. And it feels like this thing for men who have been socialized to believe that vulnerability is a sign of weakness. It feels like it's like almost takes too much courage for them to make that leap in their relationships. And it's quite problematic.
</details>

**Stephen：** 男性说他们在危机时刻无人可求助的可能性高出400%。一半的男性表示他们对自己的友谊不满意。自1990年以来，男性的亲密朋友数量下降了30%到40%。男性在异性恋关系中开始依赖他们的伴侣来获得情感满足和支持。女性则不然。所以当一个女性配偶去世时，男性必须再婚来填补那个空虚。他们没有那种友谊。当一个丈夫去世时，女人有她的朋友来支持她。那么，作为一个男人，我怎样才能交到更多的朋友？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Men are 400% more likely to say they have no one to turn to in a time of crisis. Half of men say they are unsatisfied with their friendships. Men's number of close friends has dropped by 30 to 40% since 1990. Men come to rely on their in heterosexual relationships come to rely on their partner for emotional fulfillment and support. Women do not. So when you know a woman a female spouse dies, men have to remarry to fill that void. They don't have that friendship. When a husband dies, the woman has her friends to support her. So, how can I make more friends as a man?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我认为这真的是一次一个对话地来。你作为个体的力量在于向其他男性发出信号，嘿，让我们勇敢地迈出这一步。比如，你可以问这个问题：“你最近在为什么事情挣扎？”“你希望实现什么？”或者“你最近在思考什么你以前从未和任何人分享过的事情？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I think it's really one conversation at a time. The power you have as an individual is signaling to other men, hey, let's take this courageous leap. Like, here's a question you can ask. What have you been struggling with recently? What do you hope to achieve? But what have you been what kind of thing have you been thinking about that you haven't shared with anyone before?
</details>

**Stephen：** 在你做的那个研究中，给我描述一下对话听起来是什么样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** And in the study you did, what kind of Give me a flavor of how the conversation sounded.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** “嘿，伙计，你想不想……哦，这个热狗真难吃。”“是啊，真难吃。”“是啊，这个……是啊，我不喜欢这里的食物。”“我要去睡个午觉了。”就像在叙述你周围发生的事情。有时候他们会问：“你从哪里来？”然后那就会变成一种叙述。“哦，我爱芝加哥。那里有那支球队。我讨厌芝加哥熊队。哦是的，我记得某某某在那里打过球。”然后你就陷入了体育话题，这可能很重要，但你能否再进一步，问：“你高中时踢足球有没有感到过脆弱？”对吧？或者“你在体育方面有什么挣扎？”“你为什么没去大学打球？”无论话题是什么，你都可以迈出下一步，让它变得真正个人化、脆弱和有趣，这样你离开时就离拥有一个真正的朋友更近了一步，而不仅仅是一个你对他讲述你所知事情的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Hey man, you want to get Oh, this hot dog is gross. Yeah, it's really gross. Yeah, this is Yeah, I don't like the food. I'm going to go take a nap. It's like narrating what's happening around you. Sometimes they'd be like, "Where are you from?" and then that would turn into a narration. "Oh, I love Chicago. It has that team. I hate the Chicago Bears. Oh yeah, I remember when so and so played there." Then you devolve into the sports talk, which can be important, but you can you move a step beyond and be like, did you ever feel vulnerable when you played football in high school? Right? Like or like what did you struggle with in terms of sports? Why didn't you play college sports? Whatever the topic is, you can take that next step to make it actually personal and vulnerable and interesting so that you walk away one step closer to having an actual friend and not just someone you say things you know to.

### AI 时代的沟通挑战

**Stephen：** 在数字时代，在人工智能的世界里，我们是否需要开始以不同的方式进行沟通，以便人们……你知道我开始做什么了吗？故意拼写错误。如果你去我的领英，你会注意到我完全无视语法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** In a digital age, in an AI world, do we need to start communicating differently so that people... do you know what I've started doing? Intentional spelling mistakes. If you go on my LinkedIn, you'll notice that I have totally disregarded grammar.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 让我先告诉你我在课堂上做的一个练习。我认为它会让你深思。你的问题是关于我们互相输入的内容。所以基于文本的沟通，无论是在社交媒体上，还是通过短信或电子邮件，都有明确的事情我们应该做，以使我们基于文本的沟通变得更好，主要是让它更短，电子邮件更短，使用标题，使用项目符号，直奔主题，考虑别人的需求，只给他们那些。但我认为更广泛地说，思考你现在的生活，你的对话生活是如何展开的，是相当发人深省的。所以，在我的课堂上，我让我的学生对他们生活中的20到30分钟做一个沟通审计，你把所有传入和传出的信息，跨越所有数字和面对面的模式，都转录下来。你的私信，你的电子邮件，你的短信，你的电话，你的Zoom通话，你的面对面互动，所有的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Okay, let me start by telling you about an exercise that I do in my class. I think it'll be thought-provoking for you. So, your question is about the content of what we type to each other. So text-based communication whether it's on social media or over text or over email and there are clear things that we should do to make our text-based communication better mostly make it shorter, emails shorter, use headings, use bullet points, get to the point, think about what other people need, only give them that. but I think more broadly what is quite thought-provoking is to think about how your life proceeds these days your conversational life unfolds. So in my class, I ask my students to do a communication audit of like 20 to 30 minutes in their life where you transcribe every incoming and outgoing message across all digital and face-to-face modalities. So your DMs, your emails, your texts, your phone calls, your Zoom calls, your face to face interactions, all of it.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你能想象吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Can you imagine?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 不行。这相当难。你会注意到的首要事情是，沟通量实在是太大了，简直是疯狂的。而仅仅在20年前，可能只有现在的10%。我认为我们都感受到了那种不堪重负。不仅量大，我们还不断地在一种沟通模式和下一种之间切换和调整。我一边和你说话，一边在桌子底下发短信，一边听着我的邮件提示音，知道我的私信正在爆炸。那种精神上的调整真的很累人。在每种模式之间，我们都在与不同的人，就不同的想法、不同的线索、不同的话题进行交流。所以，你开始意识到所有这些事情是多么交织和重叠。要理清这一切，并做出所有这些决定，比如我应该回应谁，是相当困难的。我们默认会回应那些就在我们面前的人，但任何其他沟通模式，我们都会想，谁应该排在第一位？谁能得到我的关注？而关注就是爱，对吧？本质上是谁得到了我的爱。我的学生们对这个练习的评价，是完全令人震惊的，我建议任何人都去试试，那就是，只有面对面的对话，在事后回顾和当时发生时，才感觉是真实的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** No. It's quite hard. The sort of topline thing you notice is that it's so much it's just a crazy amount of communication that's happening in our lives now when only maybe 20 years ago it was like 10% of what it is now. I think we all feel that sort of overwhelm. Not only is it a lot, it's we're constantly sort of toggling and adjusting from one mode of communication to the next. So, I'm like talking to you while I'm like texting under the table, while I hear my emails going and knowing that my DMs are blowing up. That mental adjustment is really exhausting. And across each of those modes, we're like engaging in different ideas and different threads, different topics with different people. And so, you start to realize how braided and overlapping all of these things are. And it's quite hard to keep it all straight and to make all of these decisions about like who should I be responding to. We then default to the people who are right in front of us but any other mode of communication we're like well who should come first? Who gets my attention first? And attention is love right like who gets my love essentially. The thing that my students note about this exercise, which is completely mind-blowing, and I would recommend that anybody try it, is that only face-to-face conversations feel real in retrospect and while they're happening.
</details>

**Stephen：** 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Yeah.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 现在，这并不意味着其他的就不重要。当然，电子邮件对于事务性信息交换非常重要，但它不是真实的。它不是人脑被设计来做的事情。我们的大脑进化来做这种面对面的事情。这就是为什么我更喜欢像这样亲自进行采访，而不是在Zoom上，因为它是真实的，我们会有一个真实的记忆。那个记忆可能有点模糊。你可能会想：“哦，我认识这个，你知道的，棕色头发的中年白人女性。她精力很充沛。”对吧？那可能是你记得的全部，但它是真实的，我们可以保留那个记忆。我认为我感到如此困扰的是，我们的对话生活已经变得非常不真实。这就是为什么我们感到如此疏远和孤独，而那种孤独感高得离谱。我们没有真实的互动和真实的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Now, that doesn't mean that the other ones aren't important. Of course, email is so important for transactional information exchange, but it's not real. It's not what the human brain was built to do. our brains evolved to do this face to face. It's why I prefer doing an interview like this in person than on Zoom because it's real and we're going to have it's so engaging and we're going to have a real memory of it later. And that memory might be sort of vague. You'll be like, "Oh, I knew this like, you know, middle-aged white woman with brown hair. She had a lot of energy." Right? Like that might be the extent of what you remember, but it's it was real and we can hold that memory. And I think what I find so troubling, our conversational lives have become very unreal. And that's why we feel so disconnected and lonely and that loneliness is just outrageously high. We're not having real interactions and real relationships.

### 战略性真实：在职场中如何做自己

**Stephen：** 你认为我们应该以真实的自我出现在工作中吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Do you think we should show up to work as our authentic selves?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 纽约大学的一位学者朱莉安娜·皮尔默有一个很棒的短语，叫做 **“战略性真实”** (strategic authenticity)。如果你把完整的自己带到工作中，那对你和周围的每个人来说都是一场噩梦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** There's a great phrase by a scholar named Juliana Pillmer, who's at NYU, called **strategic authenticity**. If you were to bring your full self to work, it would be a nightmare for you and everyone around you.
</details>

**Stephen：** 跟我说说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Tell me about it.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 重点是，我们的行为会从一个对话转换到下一个，甚至在每次对话中从一个时刻转换到下一个时刻，而且它应该如此。这就是所谓的察言观色、审时度势和调整。我丈夫有句话：“运动员会调整。”这完全正确，好的谈话者也会调整。所以，如果你心里想：“这就是我，我要把这个完整的自我带到我所在的每一个空间”，那结果不会好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** The point is that our behavior shifts from one conversation to the next even from one moment to the next in every conversation and it should that's what it means to read the room and read the context and adjust. My my husband has a saying athletes adjust and it's exactly right good conversationalists adjust. So if you in your mind are like this is who I am and I'm gonna bring that whole whole self to every space that I inhabit, it's not going to go well.
</details>

**Stephen：** 战略性真实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Strategic authenticity.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 是的。把你之所以为你的那些价值观带到工作中。这些是你关心并且不妥协的事情，但你可以调整你的行为来适应情况的需要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** Yeah. Bring the things that make the values that make you you bring them to work. It's the things that you care about and are uncompromising about, but you can adjust your behavior to to fit the needs of the situation.
</details>

**Stephen：** 你会假装和表演吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Do you pretend and act?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 不。这是个好问题。我们喜欢在我的课堂上辩论这个问题，关于真实性、操控、什么是真实的、什么是真诚的。我想真诚可能是正确的词。让我们以提问为例。想象一下，我们在采访中到了一个点，你觉得：“哦，我现在需要问一个问题。”你可能并不渴望听到它的答案，但作为一个好的采访者，你知道你需要在那个时刻问那个问题。那并不意味着你是邪恶的、不友善的、不真诚的、操控性的。它意味着你正在努力实现对话的目标。而努力实现“嘿，我们要尽可能多地从彼此身上学习。我想向你展示我对你观点的尊重和兴趣。我想进行一次好的对话”这个目标，本身就体现了你是谁。这就是我们在这里的全部意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** No. This is a great question. We like to debate this in my class about authenticity, manipulation, what is real, what's sincere. I guess sincerity might be the right word to use. Let's use question asking as an example. Imagine that we get to a point in the interview where you're like, "Oh, I think I need to ask a question right now." You might not be dying to hear the answer to it, but you know as a good interviewer that you need to ask that question in that moment. That doesn't mean that you are evil, unkind, insincere, manipulative. It means that you're trying to live up to the goal of the conversation. And trying to live up to the goal of, hey, we're going to learn as much as we can from each other. I want to show you respect and interest in your perspective. I want to have a good conversation. that itself lives up to who you are. Like that's the whole point of being here.

### 最终问题与人类沟通的未来

**Stephen：** 艾莉森，我们有一个结束的传统，就是上一位嘉宾为下一位嘉宾留一个问题，而他们并不知道会留给谁。留给你的问题是：如果你的生活是一部电影，观众看到现在这个节点，他们会对着屏幕大喊，让你现在做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** Allison, we have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest. not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question left for you is, if your life was a movie and the audience were watching up to this point, what would they be screaming at the screen telling you to do right now?

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 真是个绝妙的问题。谢谢你，上一位嘉宾。离开哈佛。用“谈话”拯救孩子们。把你所有的时间和资源都投入到帮助世界上每一个高中生学会更好地做到这一点上。

**Stephen：** 为什么？

**Stephen:** Why?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我认为这是终极的人类技能，每个人都有潜力把它做好，而且这不是一个零和游戏。做得好的人越多，我们所有人都会过得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Allison Wood Brooks:** I think it's the ultimate human skill and everyone has the potential to do it well and it's not a zero-sum game. The more people who do it well, the better off we'll all be.

**Stephen：** 你用了“拯救”这个词。你为什么用“拯救”这个词？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** You said save. Why did you use the word save?
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 我认为我们正处在一个需要真正拯救他们免于数字成瘾和孤独的时期。我们已经到了一个需要回溯的地步，这真的很可怕。我认为第一步是，让我们把电子设备从学校里拿走，理想情况下是从家庭里、从他们手中拿走。但下一步是，什么东西会起来取代它？我认为可能是这个“谈话”课程。

**Allison Wood Brooks:** I think we're in a period where we actually are needing to save them from digital addiction and loneliness. We've gotten to a place that we need to roll back and it's really scary. And I think one first step is let's get the devices out of schools ideally out of families in their hands but then the next step is like what rises to replace it and I think it could be this talk curriculum.

**Stephen：** 你会这么做吗？你会离开哈佛吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Stephen:** So, are you going to do that? You're going to leave Harvard.
</details>

**Allison Wood Brooks：** 待定。

<details>

**Allison Wood Brooks:** TBD.

**Stephen：** 艾莉森，非常感谢你。感谢你所做的工作，因为这是非常重要的工作，而且考虑到世界上正在发生的一切，这也是非常及时的。这本书是关于……你亲口说的，你建立的这个框架是深深基于科学和研究的。我们经常想就沟通进行对话，但这些对话充满了陈词滥调和观点，以及许多没有科学严谨性支持的泛泛之谈。但你做了研究。你为你的人生投入了这么多时间在这个主题上，并且你设法以一种真正易于理解的方式写出了一切，对于像我这样有时不理解大词的普通人来说。所以这是一个很棒的入门读物，也是对伟大谈话科学的广泛探讨。我们在这本书中触及了几个方面，但还有很多我们可以深入探讨的。所以我会把这个留给观众。我会把链接放在下面，给任何想读的人。但也要感谢你，因为我认为这些问题是我们生活中最重要事情的基础，比如家庭、友谊、关系、成功和我们目标的追求。你在这里给人们的是一张通往他们最高潜能的路线图。

**Stephen:** Allison, thank you so much. Thank you for the work that you do because it's very important work and it's very timely work considering everything that's going on in the world at this moment in time. And this book is the definitive book on the art of you said it yourself. The framework that you've built here is one that's deeply based on science and research. And oftentimes we want to have conversations about communication that's full of platitudes and opinions and a lot of generic things that aren't supported by scientific rigor. But you've done the research. You've committed so much of your life to this subject and you've managed to write it all in a way that's truly accessible to people like me who are simply, you know, muggles and don't understand big words sometimes. So, it's a wonderful entry, but also a sort of an expansive look into the science of great talk. We've touched on several things in this book, but there's so much more we could have gone through. So, I'm going to leave that to the audience. I'm going to link it below for anyone that wants to read it. But also, thank you because I think of these issues as being issues that are really foundational to the most important things in our lives, like family, like friendships, like relationships, like the success and the pursuit of our goals. And what you're giving people here is a road map to reach their highest potential.
