title: 社区驱动的公共安全转型：从帮派和平条约到全国倡议
---

### 洛杉矶的和平协议

In 1992, the year that the Los Angeles homicide rate reached an all-time high, members of the Crips and Bloods, two of the largest gangs in the US, sat down together and brokered a peace treaty.

1992年，洛杉矶的凶杀率达到历史最高点，美国最大的两个帮派——**瘸帮** (Crips: 一个源于洛杉矶的非裔美国人街头帮派) 和**血帮** (Bloods: 一个源于洛杉矶的非裔美国人街头帮派) 的成员坐在一起，促成了一项和平协议。

This historic event ended a three-decade-long urban war that claimed more than 10,000 lives in LA County alone, not including those permanently maimed or incarcerated for life.

这一历史性事件结束了一场长达三十年的城市战争，仅在洛杉矶县就夺走了超过10,000人的生命，这还不包括那些永久致残或终身监禁的人。

I was one of those gang members who negotiated that treaty.

我就是谈判这项协议的帮派成员之一。

### 个人经历与帮派性质

Growing up in the Jordan Downs housing projects in the Watts section of Los Angeles, I witnessed things no child should ever be subject to.

在洛杉矶**乔丹唐斯保障性住房项目** (Jordan Downs housing projects: 洛杉矶瓦茨区的一个大型低收入社区) 的**瓦茨区** (Watts section of Los Angeles: 洛杉矶南部的一个社区，历史上以贫困和暴力著称) 长大，我目睹了任何孩子都不应该经历的事情。

By the time I was 16, I had attended 20 funerals of friends.

到16岁时，我参加了20位朋友的葬礼。

Like so many youth surrounded by violence and poverty, I was desensitized and angry, and joining the neighborhood gang was my solution for safety and protection.

和许多被暴力和贫困包围的年轻人一样，我变得麻木和愤怒，加入社区帮派是我寻求安全和保护的解决方案。

It's important to understand that Black American gangs aren't inherently violent.

重要的是要明白，非裔美国帮派并非天生暴力。

Less than three to five percent of so-called gang members are actually committing violent crime.

所谓的帮派成员中，只有不到3%到5%的人真正犯下暴力罪行。

More often, they're like surrogate families, protecting one another, but sometimes the only way we knew how to survive.

更多时候，他们就像是代孕家庭，我们互相保护，但这有时是我们唯一知道的生存方式。

### 和平协议的影响与推广

In the first two years of the peace treaty, homicides in Watts declined by 44 percent, changing the quality of life in my neighborhood.

和平协议生效后的头两年，瓦茨区的凶杀案下降了44%，改变了我社区的生活质量。

I was just 23 years old, and my firstborn son, Terrell, had just turned seven.

当时我只有23岁，我的大儿子特雷尔刚刚七岁。

Driven by the belief that our children would not inherit our conflicts, we took the call to peace to 16 more cities, contributing to a national decline in youth violence.

秉持着我们的孩子不应继承我们冲突的信念，我们将和平的呼吁带到了另外16个城市，为全国青年暴力的下降做出了贡献。

Peace was possible because nobody could stop that war but us, those of us at the center of the conflict.

你看，和平之所以可能，是因为除了我们，没有人能阻止那场战争，只有我们这些身处冲突中心的人。

It took months of intense, high-stakes conversations, starting with a handful of brothers from the four housing projects.

这花费了数月紧张而高风险的对话，从四个保障性住房项目中的少数兄弟开始。

During the negotiation, I asked who was winning the war that we were waging against each other.

在谈判期间，我问我们在彼此之间发动的这场战争中，到底谁是赢家。

Every time we'd die or go to prison, no one was there to provide direction and guidance for our kids.

每次我们死去或入狱，都没有人能为我们的孩子提供方向和指导。

Violence is about proximity.

你看，暴力关乎亲近。

I had known most of my so-called enemies my entire life, from school and from the neighborhood.

我一生中大部分时间都认识我那些所谓的敌人，他们来自学校和社区。

A small group of us went into so-called enemy territory.

我们一小群人进入了所谓的敌对区域。

The news of the peace treaty spread like wildfires.

和平协议的消息像野火一样蔓延。

Hundreds of youths from formerly warring gangs attended celebrations in the projects to mark the new beginning.

数百名来自昔日敌对帮派的青年参加了社区内的庆祝活动，标志着新的开始。

The peace treaty inspired similar agreements across the country and lasted for 12 years.

这项和平协议激励了全国各地达成类似协议，并持续了12年。

### 持续的暴力危机与内部解决方案

Fast forward to today, the cycle of violence remains an extremely concentrated problem with unequal impacts.

快进到今天，暴力循环仍然是一个高度集中的问题，并带来不平等的冲击。

Residents in low-income urban communities of color are 15 times more likely to be harmed by violence, yet three times less likely to get help.

低收入的城市有色人种社区居民遭受暴力的可能性是其他人的15倍，但获得帮助的可能性却低三倍。

For Black males ages 14 to 25, violence is the number one cause of death.

对于14至25岁的非裔男性来说，暴力是头号死因。

As this crisis has worsened in cities, overwhelmed police departments are joining forces with community leaders to say that arrests alone will not end the cycle of violence.

随着这场危机在城市中恶化，不堪重负的警察部门正与社区领袖联手表示，仅仅依靠逮捕并不能结束暴力循环。

Many solutions are being proposed, but what we're proposing is an internal solution, a solution led by those most impacted by violence, one that lifts up nontraditional leaders to play a key role in creating safety in their own respective communities.

许多解决方案被提出，但我们提出的是一种内部解决方案，一种由受暴力影响最深的人主导的解决方案，它提升了非传统领导者的作用，让他们在各自社区中发挥关键作用来创建安全。

Investing in nontraditional leaders as a complement to policing works.

你看，投资非传统领导者作为警务的补充是有效的。

### 纽瓦克社区街头团队模式

In 2014, I got a call from my friend Ras Baraka, mayor of Newark, New Jersey.

2014年，我接到了我的朋友拉斯·巴拉卡（Ras Baraka），新泽西州纽瓦克市市长的电话。

Mayor Baraka asked me to help him strengthen his community violence intervention strategy.

巴拉卡市长请我帮助他加强其社区暴力干预策略。

Newark had been on the top ten most violent city lists for almost 50 consecutive years.

纽瓦克曾连续近50年位列十大暴力城市榜单。

With a modest investment from local philanthropies, I launched a **Newark Community Street Team** (纽瓦克社区街头团队: 一个由前帮派成员和社区领袖组成的团队，致力于通过社区干预减少暴力)。

在当地慈善机构的适度投资下，我成立了纽瓦克社区街头团队。

I hired 16 **credible messengers** (可信传讯人: 具有社区背景和生活经验，能有效介入和调解冲突的人), many of them ex-gang members and formerly incarcerated folks who have deep relationships in the neighborhood.

我雇佣了16名可信传讯人，其中许多人是前帮派成员和曾被监禁的人，他们在社区中有着深厚的关系。

We trained them in conflict resolution and mediation strategies and deployed them in high-violence areas, asking them to use their relationship capital to intervene and mediate gang disputes that could lead to violence.

我们对他们进行了冲突解决和调解策略的培训，并将他们部署到高暴力区域，要求他们利用自己的人际关系资本来介入和调解可能导致暴力的帮派纠纷。

Law enforcement investigations are crucial, but not always successful, and often painstakingly slow, whereas the credible messengers can prevent the next shooting in real time.

你看，执法调查固然重要，但并非总是成功，而且往往进展缓慢，而可信传讯人可以实时阻止下一场枪击事件。

We launched the Safe Passage program to ensure our kids went to school safely, because violence often happens before and after school.

我们启动了“安全通道”项目，以确保孩子们安全上学，因为暴力事件经常发生在课前和课后。

We launched the city's first **trauma recovery center** (创伤康复中心: 为暴力受害者提供心理治疗和支持服务的机构) to provide therapeutic services to victims to help them heal.

我们还启动了该市第一个创伤康复中心，为受害者提供治疗服务，帮助他们康复。

We also provided mentoring, outreach, and case management.

我们还提供了指导、外展和个案管理。

Safety isn't just one intervention; it's a shared strategy and requires an ecosystem of programs that residents trust.

你看，安全不仅仅是一种干预措施。它是一个共享的策略，需要一个居民信任的项目生态系统。

When we started our work in Newark in 2014, the city had 103 homicides.

2014年我们在纽瓦克开始工作时，该市发生了103起凶杀案。

In 2024, we had 37.

到2024年，我们只有37起。

These are not just numbers; they're actual lives saved.

家人，这些不仅仅是数字。它们是实实在在被挽救的生命。

Newark now has nine consecutive years of decline, and we're no longer on the top ten most violent city lists.

纽瓦克现在已经连续九年下降，我们不再位列十大暴力城市榜单。

What we achieved in Newark was more than historic lows in violence.

我们在纽瓦克取得的成就不仅仅是暴力事件的历史新低。

Local law enforcement credits us as the essential strategic partner in reducing violence in the city.

当地执法部门将我们视为该市减少暴力的重要战略伙伴。

Today, the Newark Street team has over 80 staff, is a formal partner with the city, and received millions of dollars in public funding.

如今，纽瓦克街头团队拥有80多名工作人员，是该市的正式合作伙伴，并获得了数百万美元的公共资金。

### 被忽视的社区领袖与“扩大安全”倡议

We're not the only ones improving safety in our cities; it's just rarely recognized and supported.

家人，我们并非是唯一在改善城市安全的人。只是这些努力很少被认可和支持。

Take my good friend, Miss Brenda Glass, a survivor of violence from Cleveland, Ohio.

拿我的好朋友，来自俄亥俄州克利夫兰的暴力幸存者布伦达·格拉斯女士来说。

Brenda started Cleveland's first trauma recovery center, but had to cash in her retirement fund just to keep her doors open.

布伦达创办了克利夫兰的第一个创伤康复中心，但为了维持运营，她不得不动用自己的退休金。

Despite being the city's only 24-hour assistance for victims, it took the city five years before they granted her money.

尽管她是该市唯一为受害者提供24小时援助的人，但市政府花了五年时间才给她拨款。

Another champion is my brother Lyle Muhammad from Miami, who employs credible messengers in some of the most violent neighborhoods but struggles to provide a livable wage and ongoing training for his staff.

另一位倡导者是我的兄弟，来自迈阿密的莱尔·穆罕默德，他在一些最暴力的社区雇佣可信传讯人，但却难以提供足以维持生活的工资和对其员工的持续培训。

These often overlooked groups are most of the time ineligible for public funding, but what they do have is deep commitment, lived experience, trust, and community support.

这些常常被忽视的群体，大多数时候不符合公共资金的申请资格，但他们拥有的是深厚的承诺、亲身经历、信任和社区支持。

Other cities are primed to replicate our successes in Newark and follow the steps of leaders like Brenda and Lyle, but very few essential community organizations have the know-how to become a permanent part of the city's public safety workforce.

现在，其他城市也准备复制我们在纽瓦克的成功，并效仿布伦达和莱尔这样的领导者，但很少有重要的社区组织拥有成为城市公共安全队伍永久组成部分的专业知识。

We're about to change all of that with the generous investment from the **Audacious TED community** (TED大胆社区: TED组织发起的一项旨在支持大胆想法和项目的倡议), and support from people just like you.

家人，在TED大胆社区的慷慨投资以及像你们这样的人的支持下，我们即将改变这一切。

We're launching **Scaling Safety** (扩大安全: 一项旨在通过投资社区主导的项目来重塑公共安全的倡议), an initiative to put the public back in public safety.

我们正在启动“扩大安全”倡议，旨在将公众重新置于公共安全的核心。

Our solution is simple: redefine public safety by investing in a coordinated set of high-impact, resident-led programs that create real, lasting change.

我们的解决方案很简单：通过投资一套协调一致的、高影响力、由居民主导的项目来重新定义公共安全，这些项目能够带来真正持久的改变。

In 2021, I launched a community-based public safety collective to spread the Newark Community Street Team strategy nationwide.

2021年，我发起了一个以社区为基础的公共安全联盟，将纽瓦克社区街头团队的策略推广到全国。

We've already helped 150 organizations in 60-plus cities.

我们已经帮助了60多个城市的150个组织。

Now we're teaming up with the **Alliance for Safety and Justice** (安全与正义联盟: 一个在公共安全倡导方面处于领先地位的全国性组织), the nation's leader in public safety advocacy.

现在我们正与全国公共安全倡导领域的领导者——安全与正义联盟合作。

ASJ has unlocked three billion dollars in funding and led 150 policy reforms to support community safety programs.

ASJ已经争取到了30亿美元的资金，并主导了150项政策改革，以支持社区安全项目。

Together, we're creating a stronger, more effective approach to safety, one that complements law enforcement and breaks the cycle of harm.

我们共同正在创建一种更强大、更有效的安全方法，它能补充执法工作，并打破伤害的循环。

### 公共卫生类比与个人悲剧

Addressing violence is extremely complex, but just as we no longer rely on hospitals and emergency rooms alone to improve public health, we cannot rely on the justice system alone to create safety.

解决暴力问题极其复杂，但正如我们不再仅仅依靠医院和急诊室来改善公共健康一样，我们也不能仅仅依靠司法系统来创建安全。

In public health, **community health workers** (社区健康工作者: 在社区提供基本健康教育和支持的非专业医护人员) emerged to improve preventative healthcare by training residents in outreach and peer support.

在公共卫生领域，社区健康工作者的出现通过培训居民进行外展和同伴支持来改善预防性医疗保健。

They've reduced the burdens on emergency rooms and improved public health.

他们减轻了急诊室的负担，并改善了公共健康。

We believe the same can be done with public safety, because racially equitable access to safety begins with community engagement.

我们相信公共安全也能做到同样的事情，因为种族平等的安全获取始于社区参与。

In 2003, my oldest son, Terrell, who was seven years old when I negotiated the treaty, graduated from high school and was accepted into Humboldt State University.

2003年，我的大儿子特雷尔，就是我谈判协议时七岁的那个孩子，高中毕业并被洪堡州立大学录取。

The proudest day of my life was driving this kid to school to start his first day as a college student.

家人，我一生中最骄傲的一天，就是开车送这个孩子去学校，开始他大学生的第一天。

Terrell was an inspiration to his younger siblings and the reason why I became a lifelong advocate for peace.

特雷尔是他弟弟妹妹们的榜样，也是我成为终身和平倡导者的原因。

He came home from winter break, went to a party with some of his friends in an affluent neighborhood in LA.

他寒假回家，和一些朋友去洛杉矶一个富裕社区参加派对。

There, some kids from a local gang showed up at the party, mistook his red Mickey Mouse sweater for gang colors, and shot him to death.

在那里，一些当地帮派的孩子出现在派对上，把他的红色米老鼠毛衣误认为是帮派颜色，然后开枪将他杀害。

I'm no novice to violence; I've witnessed it my entire life.

家人，我对暴力并不陌生，我一生都目睹着它。

But nothing prepares you for the loss of your child.

但没有什么能让你为失去自己的孩子做好准备。

What I've come to understand is that peace is a journey and not a destination, and that public safety is not just the absence of violence and crime, but the presence of well-being and the infrastructure to support victims and survivors in their healing journey.

但我逐渐明白，和平是一段旅程，而不是一个目的地。公共安全不仅仅是没有暴力和犯罪，而是拥有幸福感以及支持受害者和幸存者康复旅程的基础设施。

Scaling Safety is our healing journey and my continued commitment to Terrell and Oscar Guizar and Ronzell Pointer, and the thousands like them, that their deaths were not in vain.

“扩大安全”是我们的康复之旅，也是我对特雷尔、奥斯卡·吉扎尔和朗泽尔·庞特以及成千上万像他们一样的人的持续承诺，让他们的牺牲不是徒劳。

### 关于“可付诸行动的希望”的问答

Helen Walters: Aqeela, another hug, if you will.

Helen Walters: 阿克拉，如果你愿意，再来一个拥抱。

Okay, come right here, I have a question.

好的，请过来，我有个问题。

Thank you for sharing your story.

谢谢你分享你的故事。

I speak on behalf of everybody when I say that we're so sorry for your loss.

我代表大家说，我们对你的损失深感抱歉。

Aqeela Sherrills: Thank you.

Aqeela Sherrills: 谢谢你。

Helen Walters: We talked a lot this week about actionable hope.

Helen Walters: 本周我们谈论了很多关于“可付诸行动的希望”的话题。

What you're doing exemplifies a spirit that too many of us have no idea what you've experienced and what you do on a daily basis.

你所做的一切，体现了一种精神，这种精神是我们很多人无法想象你所经历的，以及你每天所做的事情的。

What advice do you give those who are trying to dig deep in this time, to step up and to find actionable hope?

对于那些在这个时刻努力深入挖掘、挺身而出并寻找可付诸行动的希望的人，你有什么建议？

How do you do it?

你是如何做到的？

Aqeela Sherrills: I would say that where the wounds are in the personal life is where the gift lies.

Aqeela Sherrills: 我会说，个人生活中伤痛所在之处，正是天赋所在。

Sometimes we have to sit long and hard in the anguish and the pain of the things that we suffered and keep our eye on the prize, continue to look for the gift despite the circumstances around you.

有时我们必须长时间、艰难地坐在我们所遭受的痛苦和折磨中，并盯紧目标，尽管周围环境不尽如人意，也要继续寻找天赋。

The thing that I would encourage folks to do is to find someone that you know or don’t know — sometimes it’s easy to talk to people that you don’t know — and expose the deep secrets in your personal life as a way of accessing the gift of who you are.

我会鼓励大家去做的一件事是，找一个你认识或不认识的人——有时和不认识的人交谈更容易——并揭露你个人生活中最深的秘密，以此来发现你自身的天赋。

Because when you undress yourself, others can’t undress you, right?

因为当你自我袒露时，别人就无法剥夺你的真实面貌，对吗？

And I would say, for the folks who are the listeners, because people always come to us and they tell us their horror story, hold space for them, behold them, don't define them as their experience, because we're not the things that we've perpetrated or the things that have been done to us.

我还会对那些倾听者说，因为人们总是来找我们，讲述他们的悲惨故事，请为他们提供空间，接纳他们，不要用他们的经历来定义他们，因为我们不是我们所犯下的事情，也不是我们所遭受的事情。

Those things are only informing who we become, they don't define who we are.

这些事情只是塑造了我们成为怎样的人，它们不能定义我们是谁。

Helen Walters: Aqeela, you're an inspiration.

Helen Walters: 阿克拉，你是一个鼓舞人心的人。
