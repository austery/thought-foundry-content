### 美元作为全球金融支柱的挑战

**Jill:** 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的 OddLots 播客。我是 Jill Weisenthal。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Jill Weisenthal</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我是 Tracy Aloway。Tracy，我们不能太久不谈论美元在美国乃至全球金融体系中的作用，以及它是否面临某种威胁。我们录制这期节目是在7月17日。本周关于美联储独立性以及我们经常谈论的所有事情，又出现了一系列新的头条新闻。所以，我们似乎需要回到这个核心问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, we can't go too long without talking about the role of the dollar in the United States, the pillar of the global financial system, whether there is some threat to it or not. We are recording this July 17th. It has been a fresh week of headlines about say independence of the Federal Reserve and all of the things that we talk about all of the time. So, we sort of need to return to this central question.</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 是的。关于美联储主席的戏剧性事件，有趣的是，当最初关于特朗普可能解雇鲍威尔的头条新闻出现时，市场的巨大反应并非来自美元。它不在市场中，甚至不在债券中，而是在货币方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. The interesting thing about the Fed chair drama is when the initial headlines came out about Trump possibly firing Pal, the big reaction wasn't the dollar, right? It wasn't in markets. It wasn't even bonds. It was the currency.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 完全正确。我认为这是其中一件事，就是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And I think this is one of those things where</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 我不知道。我们不知道会发生什么，特朗普是否真的会试图寻找理由解雇鲍威尔。谁知道人们听到这期节目时会发生什么。但是，你知道，我认为人们感觉到，无论是美联储还是许多其他事情，都存在着现有规范或期望的某种侵蚀。所以，我认为，无论好坏，对现有的制度安排已经造成了一些损害。全世界都在关注，更不用说关税政策的随意性或波动性、正在进行的战争等等。许多事情都在变化。我们生活在一个有趣的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. We don't know what's going to happen, whether Trump will actually try to find cause to fire Powell. Who knows what will even happen by the time people are listening to this episode. But you know I think people get the sense that with the Fed here with many other thing there is this sort of like erosion of an existing set of norms or expectations etc. And so you know I think arguably some damage for better or worse has already been done to the existing institutional arrangement. Everyone around the world is paying attention not to mention the sort of arbitrariness or volatility of tariff policy ongoing wars and so forth. Much is in change. We live in interesting times.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我是这样想的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what I think.</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 请说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Go on.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 在金融市场评论中，谈论一个重大转折点是老生常谈，对吧？因为我们已经看到人们几十年来一直在谈论美元的消亡。是的，没错。但即便如此，我认为现在不同的是，许多长期**结构性趋势**（Secular Trends: 持续数年甚至数十年的长期经济或市场趋势）似乎正在逆转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's a cliche in financial market commentary to talk about a major turning point, right? Because we've seen people talk about the death of the dollar for decades. Yeah. Exactly. But that said, I think what's different about now is the number of like long-term secular trends that appear to be reversing</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 正在发生变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the move.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。所以，全球化正在走向**去全球化**（Deglobalization: 经济、政治和文化联系减弱的趋势）。人口增长正在转向人口萎缩。通货膨胀正在上升，而不是多年的通货紧缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, there's globalization going from deglobalization. There's population growth going to shrinking populations. There's higher inflation instead of years and years of deflation.</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 有趣的是，人们将如何应对这种情况？市场将如何应对这种情况？特别是当他们已经非常非常习惯于通过回溯测试等方式来应对以前的情况时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And the interesting thing about that is, of course, how are people going to react to that? How are markets going to react to that? Especially when they've grown very, very used to the previous situation through, you know, back testing and all of that stuff.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 完全正确。我只想说一件事，这使得从投资者的角度来看，时机非常有趣，因为有许多趋势似乎即使没有逆转，也至少走向了新的方向。然而，有一个趋势尚未真正逆转，那就是你仍然可以通过持有美国科技股和美国市场获得丰厚回报。它们今年表现强劲，尽管表现不佳，这是新的情况，全球股市今年大部分时间都跑赢了美国股市。但这种基本观念，即投资者赚钱的地方仍然集中在美国少数几家公司，这种观念在某种程度上令人惊讶地仍然完好无损。问题是，这会是最后一个“靴子落地”，还是美国例外论的终结，仅仅从全球投资组合经理的角度来看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And I'll just say one thing which makes this very interesting timing wise from the perspective of investors because there is a lot there are a lot of trends that seem to be if not going in reverse at least a new direction etc. One trend that hasn't got really gone in reverse however is you are still getting paid a lot to own US tech and you know US markets they're up solidly on the year they are underperforming which is that is new global equities have outperformed US equities in large part this year but this basic idea that where all the money to be made is as an investor is still in like a handful of US companies like that in a way surprisingly is still kind of intact and The question is, will that be like the last sort of the shoe to drop or the end of US exceptionalism from just the perspective of a globally oriented portfolio manager?</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 我认为这是一个值得关注的好事情。我将借鉴 Bob Brackett 的《商品能源转型》一书中的一页，说这些类型的转型往往比人们预期的要长。你不应该期望所有事情都同时发生。它将分阶段进行。所以，有很多值得关注和讨论的事情。我非常高兴地说，我们有完美的嘉宾，一位我们几年未曾交谈过，但始终是最有趣的人之一。我们将与 **Inigo Fraser Jenkins** 交谈。他是 Alliance Bernstein 的市场策略师。他最近发表了一本新的在线公开书籍，内容涉及今年的重大趋势，其中一个重点是关于美元稳定性或**后美元时代**（Post-Dollar Universe: 美元不再是全球主要储备货币的未来世界）以及它可能是什么样子的。所以 Inigo，非常感谢你再次来到 OddLots。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think that's a good thing to watch. I'm going to pull a page out of Bob Brackett's Commodities Energy Transition book and say that these types of transitions often take longer than people expect. You shouldn't expect everything to happen all at once. It's going to happen in stages. So, there's a lot to look out for, a lot to discuss. Well, I'm really excited to say we have the perfect guest, someone we haven't spoken to in uh several years, but always one of the most interesting guys around. We're going to be speaking with Inigo Frasier Jenkins. He is a market strategist at Alliance Bernstein. He has recently published a new quote book that's public online about the sort of like the big trends of the year including a big focus on the sort of like question about the stability of the dollar or a postdoll universe and what that could look like. So Inigo, thank you so much for uh coming back on OddLots.</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 非常感谢。很高兴能再次回到节目中。

### 宏观趋势的逆转与美元的未来

**Jill:** 告诉我你的书。你的书是什么，今年的书主题是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me about your books. What are your books and what is the theme of this year's book? Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 是的。这本书旨在将我们对投资者面临的一些最大问题的看法汇集一处。所以，正是你已经提到的一些问题，比如全球化正在转向去全球化，人口增长正在转向劳动年龄人口的放缓，以及利率和通货膨胀与过去30年左右的常态不同。所有这些问题都存在于背景之中。我们认为有充分的理由表明，过去30或40年的一些规范确实正在瓦解，要么已经走到尽头，要么正在逆转。然后，在过去3到6个月里，真正主导我们客户对话的一个特定问题就是你一直在谈论的美国例外论问题。它结束了吗？美元作为**储备货币**（Reserve Currency: 被各国央行和金融机构广泛持有，用于国际交易和稳定本国货币的强势货币）的作用是否会改变？美元的预测与美国股市的预测是否相同，或者它们只是不同的事物？如果这些问题确实存在，我们是否真的想掌握它们，并就投资者可以如何应对这些问题提供一些看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the book is a way of drawing together in one place some of the views we have on some of the biggest questions that investors face. So exactly some of the issues that you've mentioned already in terms of globalization turning into deglobalization of population growth turning into a slowdown in working age population and issues around interest rates and inflation being different from the norms of the last 30 or so years. And all these issues sit in the background. We think there's a strong case to be made that some of the norms of the last 30 or 40 years really are unwinding and either run their course or going into reverse. And then one of the particular issues that has really dominated the client conversations that we've had the last 3 to 6 months has been this question you've been talking about in terms of US exceptionalism. Has it ended? Does the dollar change in terms of its role as a reserve currency? Is the prognosis the dollar the same as prognosis for US equities or are these just different things? And if these kind of questions do we really want to kind of get to grips with and offer some views what investors can do about them?</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你在这里关注的时间框架是什么？因为我认为我们通常没有足够地谈论时间框架。阅读这本书的一些内容，我发现有些令人担忧，有些令人沮丧，因为你谈论的是整个世界基本上都面临的这些长期挑战。所以我在想，这里的时间框架是什么？是在足够长的时间框架内我们都会死去，还是在未来20或30年内？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What kind of time frame are you looking at here? Because I think we often don't talk enough about time frames and reading some of the book some of it I found, you know, a little bit worrying, a little bit depressing because you're talking about all these long-term challenges that the entire world basically faces. And so I'm thinking like what is the time frame here? Is it on a long enough time frame we're all going to be dead anyway or is it the next 20 or 30 years?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我认为有趣的是，有许多不同的力量同时作用于市场。现在所有这些都是战略性力量，但我在书中谈论的那些，可以被认为是作用于大约5到10年的时间框架。当然，任何涉及人口统计学的话题，人们有时会充耳不闻，因为他们认为它变化太慢，肯定不会有什么影响。但实际上，如果它与其他事物同时发生，那么就有理由认为，这种战略性视野可能并没有人们想象的那么遥远。当这种对全球化的看法，例如，与对债务水平的担忧、与全球化向去全球化转变的担忧联系在一起时，这些事情突然在投资者关注的问题清单上迅速上升。因此，我会说，尽管人们可能认为这些问题在某种名义上的战略未来中更为遥远，但事实上，我们在过去6个月左右看到的是，这些长期问题已经成为主导近期的问题。所以，那个更长的未来已经变成了少数人正在面对的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the interesting thing is there are a bunch of different forces acting at the same time on markets. Now all these are strategic forces but the ones I'm talking about in the book that is and so they can be thought about as acting over a say 5 to 10 year time frame and of course anything that involves a conversation on demographics occasion people just kind of close their ears because they think well it's so slow moving that surely that's not going to matter but actually if it's happening in conjunction with other things then there is an argument that that strategic horizon perhaps isn't quite so far off as people thought and when that view on delization for example is tied with concerns around debt levels is concerned around the shift from globalization and deglobalization. These are things that have suddenly zoomed up the list of concerns that investors have. And so I'd argue that although one might have thought that these are issues that were sort of further off in some sort of notional strategic future that in fact what we've seen in the last 6 months or so is those longerterm issues become things that dominate the near term. And so that's a longerterm future has become issues that few people are facing. out</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 仅仅就人口统计学这一点，你提到很多人听到这个词时会觉得这是一个缓慢变化的趋势，但实际上，当你看到这些数字时，它们是惊人的。所以，你知道，显然人们谈论中国的人口轨迹，西方的人口老龄化，但即使是拉丁美洲的人口增长图表，我看到生育率正在各地崩溃。我的意思是，这确实是非同寻常的，而且它并不是缓慢发生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just on the demographics point you mentioned that a lot of you you hear that word as okay this slowmoving trend it is actually though staggering the numbers when you look at so you know obviously people talk about the population trajectories in China aging in the west but even like I saw these charts of Latin American population growth like fertility is collapsing everywhere I mean it's really extraordinary and it's it's not happening slowly</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 是的，所以这些变化确实发生得非常迅速，就我们过去看到的变化而言。我认为人们只需要意识到，在过去30或40年里，人口结构对增长率提供了多么巨大的支持。我们经历了全球化的非凡时期，它将额外的劳动力带入了相同的经济环境。你有一大批人都加入了劳动力大军，同时女性劳动参与率也增加了。因此，一系列因素导致了更多的劳动力可用。我认为，甚至在你深入探讨去全球化问题之前，仅仅是这种**人口结构变化**（Demographic Shifts: 人口年龄、性别、生育率、死亡率等方面的长期变化）就已经抵消了自80年代全球化进程以来我们所看到的全球劳动力池增长的很大一部分。现在，人们可能会对此非常悲观，但这并不是一个预示未来看跌的展望，它肯定改变了你对增长所在地的基本假设。例如，如果你看看从现在开始的预测，我们对未来10到15年的展望是，至少根据联合国人口数据，美国劳动年龄人口仍将增长，但增长速度将比过去30年人们习惯的要慢得多。它将以每年约0.2%的速度增长，但在欧洲，劳动年龄人口将以每年约0.5%的速度萎缩。在中国，从现在到2050年，它将以每年约1%的速度迅速萎缩。所以，是的，我的意思是，其他力量显然也在并行发生，但作为基本层面的影响，这确实改变了人们对增长率的看法。不，但在此背景下，是的，从绝对角度来看，这告诉我们增长正在放缓。但回到你开始这期播客时提到的另一个话题，即美国例外论，尽管美国的增长正在放缓，但我们和大多数预测者都有一个基本假设，即劳动年龄人口仍然会略微增长。这比欧洲、日本、中国等人口正在萎缩的地方的预测要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes so the changes uh certainly happening very rapidly uh in terms of the context of past changes we've seen and I think that people just need to be aware of just the scale of the support the demographics has given to growth rates over the last 30 or 40 years. We've seen this extraordinary period when there's been globalization that's brought extra workers into the sort of same environment in terms of the economic um arena that they work in. and you've had a large kind of cohort of people who've all been in the workforce and you've had an increase in the female participation ratio at the same time and so you've had a series of things that have meant that there have been many more workers available and I'd argue that even before you're going to get into the issue around deglobalization that demographic shift alone undoes a very large part of this increase in the global worker pool that we've seen through the process of globalization since the 80s. Now people can you know can get very negative about this but you know it isn't an outlook that implies a bearish way of prognosis for the future but it certainly changes the base case of where you think kind of growth lies. So for example, if you look at the sort of prognosis from here onwards, we have an outlook of the next sort of 10 to 15 years where on the UN population data at least that the US working age population is still going to grow but it's going to grow much more slowly than people have been used to in the last kind of 30 years. It'll grow at about 2% peranom but in Europe the working age population is going to shrink at about half% peranom. In China it's really going to shrink quickly at about 1% peranom between now and 2050. So yes, I mean other forces are happening in parallel with this kind of clearly, but you know as a base level effect that does change one's view on what growth rates look like. No, but but in that context that yes, from an absolute perspective that's telling us growth slows down. But back to the other thread that you started this podcast with in terms of the US exception point, although growth is slowing in the US, the base assumption that we have and the most forecasters have is the working age population does still grow ever so slightly. And that is a better prognosis than say in Europe, in Japan, in China where it's shrinking outright.</p>

### 政府债务与美元避险地位的动摇

**Jill:** 我能问一下政府债务吗？因为这是另一个人们谈论了很长时间的问题。高赤字，特别是在发达国家。我认为这是自二战以来最高的债务水平，大概是这样。你如何调和对债务驱动的不稳定或对经济增长影响的警告，与投资者在很大程度上继续购买政府债券这一事实？我知道在4月2日之后，我们确实看到了10年期国债利率的飙升，但之后又有所回落。现在它实际上非常接近4月初的水平，但似乎对债务的广泛需求仍在继续。那么，这何时才会真正成为投资者关注的问题呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask about government debt because this is the other thing that you know people have been talking about for a very very long time. High deficits especially in the developed world. I think the highest level of debt since like World War II, something like that. How do you reconcile I guess the warnings over debtdriven instability or impact on economic growth with the fact that investors keep for the most part buying government bonds? I know after April 2nd we did see a spike in like 10-year Treasury rates, but it came down a bit after that. It's actually pretty close to where it was in early April now, but it does seem like there is broadly continued appetite for debt. So when would that actually become a concern for investors?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 投资者最近一年左右一直在问我这个问题。所以，是的，你说的没错，净债务占 GDP 的水平与二战时相同。我想首先要说的是，这不仅仅是美国的问题，实际上是 G7 国家普遍存在的问题。所以，G7 国家净债务占 GDP 的水平已经回到了二战结束时的水平。当然，它已经持续了一段时间，上升了大约30年，在利率下降的环境中这并不重要。但如果利率周期出现了决定性的转折，那么这显然就开始成为一个问题。人们喜欢担心这些债务水平，当然，在其他条件相同的情况下，这意味着包括美国在内的主权发行人比以前风险更高。所以你可以说，也许应该对**主权风险**（Sovereign Risk: 一个国家政府无法或不愿履行其债务义务的风险）进行定价，并且应该有一个更陡峭的**收益率曲线**（Yield Curve: 显示不同期限债券收益率之间关系的曲线）。问题是，到目前为止，这些担忧完全被投资者对流动资产和更安全的流动资产的需求所淹没。所以你确实看到了对主权风险进行定价的尝试。是的，可以说在4月份的美国，几年前在英国围绕 LDI 危机（**LDI危机**，Liability-Driven Investment Crisis: 2022年英国养老金因利率剧烈波动导致其“负债驱动型投资”策略面临流动性危机），以及上次法国大选之前。你会看到市场试图对主权风险进行定价的这些插曲，但很难知道，你知道，在哪个点上这会成为一个问题，因为这显然是一个可以长期推迟的问题。今年早些时候，Niall Ferguson 发表了一篇引人入胜的论文，他认为基本上真正重要的不是净债务占 GDP 的比重，而是偿债成本相对于国防预算的相对规模。之所以这似乎是一个相关的话题，是因为去年是美国偿债成本首次超过美国国防预算的一年。然后他回顾了之前出现这种交叉的大国例子，结果都发生了不好的事情。无论是英国、奥斯曼帝国还是哈布斯堡王朝的例子，一系列历史事件都导致大国在偿债成本远大于国防预算的情况下，无法再投射硬实力。现在，我认为最相关的有趣例子是英国。1920年，偿债成本远大于国防预算。这对投射硬实力的能力产生了巨大影响。有趣的是，英国设法扭转了局面，最终国防预算再次大于利息偿付成本和债务，但它是通过通货膨胀、贬值以及失去储备货币地位来实现的，我认为这正是使其在今天具有相关性的关键。所以我想总结一下，就如何思考这个问题而言，我认为主权风险或许应该被定价，鉴于市场对这种风险的看法与流动性需求之间存在巨大的不确定性。我认为人们只能得到一个方向性的答案，即在某个时候收益率曲线应该会变陡，但很难做出战术性的判断。我认为，投资者在实际操作中思考这个问题的一个更恰当的方式是，这意味着美元作为避险资产的地位不如以前。这才是关键点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I keep being asked this question by investors in recent question and really for the last year or so. So yeah, you're right in saying that the level of net debt to GDP is the same as it was in World War II. I guess the first thing to say about that is not just a US problem. That's actually a G7wide problem. So G7 debt in terms of net debt to GDP is back to where it was at the end of World War II. Now of course it's been getting there for some time. It's been rising really kind of 30 years and that hasn't mattered in an environment of falling interest rates. But if there has been a definitive turn in the interest rate cycle, then that obviously starts to become a problem. People like to fret about these debt levels and certainly you know other things equal. It implies that sovereign issuers including the US are more risky than they were before. And so you could say well maybe there should be a pricing of sovereign risk and a should be a steeper yield curve. The problem is that so far those fears have been utterly swamped by the demands that investors have for liquid assets and safer liquid assets. So you have seen attempts to price sovereign risk. Yes. arguably in April in the US, a couple years ago in the UK around uh the LDI crisis prior to the last French election. You get these sort of episodes where the market tries to price sovereign risk, but it's very hard to know, you know, at what point that becomes a problem because this is a can that obviously can be kicked down the road a long way. There was a fascinating paper published by Nile Ferguson earlier this year where he made the argument that basically it's not net debt to GDP that really matters. It's the relative size of the debt service cost compared to the defense budget. And the reason that seems like a relevant thing to talk about is last year was the first year where the US service cost on debt exceeded the US defense budget. And then he goes back and looked at previous examples of great powers that have seen this kind of crossover take place and bad things happen. And whether that is the example of the UK or the Ottoman Empire or the Hapsburgs, you know, a whole series of historical episodes have led to great powers no longer being able to project hard power if the debt service cost is much larger than the defense budget. Now the interesting example that I guess is vaguely relevant from that is most relevant is the UK. In 1920, the debt service cost became much greater than defense budget. That had a big impact on the ability to project hard power. Now what's interesting is the UK managed to reverse course and actually end up with a defense budget again larger than interest service cost and debt but it did so through inflation depreciation and through the loss of reserve currency status which I guess is the kind of key thing that makes it relevant today. So I guess to conclude in terms of of how one thinks about this, you know, I think the sovereign risk is something that perhaps should be priced given the massive uncertainty about you know how that risk is perceived in the market versus demand for liquidity. I think one's just left with a a kind of directional answer saying well yes at some point the yield curve should steepen but is very very hard to make a tactical kind of call around that. I I think perhaps a more pertinent way for investors to actually think about that in practical terms is that it means that the dollar is less of a safe haven asset but than it was before. And that's the key point really. It's not so much</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 就美元的特定回报预测而言，它与六个月前的情况有所不同。我认为现在整个市场几乎达成共识，人们对美元的看法比六个月前更为悲观。但我想有趣的是它的风险性，以及美元风险现在与对其他风险资产的风险更相关联的观点。这意味着人们在构建投资组合时应该采取不同的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in terms of coming up with a particular return forecast on the dollar being different from where it was say 6 months ago. I think it's become almost consensus across the street that people are now more negative on the dollar than they were say 6 months ago. But I guess what's interesting is the riskiness of it and the idea that risk the dollar are now more correlated with the risks to other risk assets. And so that implies a different approach the way people should form portfolios.</p>
</details>

### 美元地位变化的迹象与投资策略

**Tracy:** 好的，让我们深入探讨这一点，因为我认为这是一个非常重要的观点，即人们谈论美元面临的某种风险，美元地位面临的风险。所以我想谈谈，抛开时机不谈。也许它很快，也许它很慢，也许是中期。你会关注哪些数据点来判断正在发生什么？是美元兑其他货币的汇率水平吗？是美元在交易中的份额吗？是美元在主权储蓄中的份额吗？或者，这似乎是你所说的方向，是它与风险资产的关系，无论是负相关还是正相关？当人们对美元在投资组合中的看法发生有意义的变化时，这些“指纹”会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's get into this because I think this is the really important point which is that people talk about some sort of you know risks to the dollar risks to the dollar status and so I want to talk about more like setting aside timing. Maybe it's fast, maybe it's slow, maybe it's medium-term. What are the data points that you would look at to say something is happening? Is it dollar levels against other currencies? Is it dollar share of transactions? Is a dollar share of sovereign savings? Or is it, and it seems like where you're going with this, is it the relationship, whether it's inverse or positive, to risky assets? what are these sort of like fingerprints of what it would look like when it's like oh something has meaningfully changed about the way people view the dollar in their portfolios. So I guess I first of all kind of pick up in terms of the relationship with dollar and other assets. And so you've seen just the last few months episodes when the a dollar has declined at same times that bond yields have gone up. I is a more risky environment and the dollar hasn't behaved in a safe haven asset in that kind of environment. You've also seen a more deeply negative correlation between dollar and gold. Obviously priced in dollars that implies that the dollar is seen as less of a safe haven asset. And you've seen an increased correlation between assets such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin. All things which are plausibly possible non-fear zero duration assets that you know that through a certain lens share certain characteristics anyway. So you've seen this market behavior where more dollar risk has been priced. At least there have been episodes of that. What I think would really change this though and make it more of an immediate concern for people is if there were large flows out of US bonds from institutional investors. Now there's been a lot of talk about this. There's been a lot of coverage of it. I've been asked about it in many many meetings. But so far as far as we can tell that is much more talk than actual flow. I mean there have been episodes for example where the Japanese pension system or elements of European pensions have been selling dollar bonds but the numbers are very small in the scheme of things. So so far what you're still seeing is a demand for safer liquid assets uh is still the dominant yeah forces but that's the thing that we really look for for a change. I mean I think one thing in the background here is one has to bear in mind there are some very different kinds of risks here that are all being conflated and they point in the same direction but they come from I guess very different basis. So one is the concern around fiscal sustainability as we discussed. So that yes it's certainly a concern but you never know what the timing of that's going to be. Separate from that is a more geopolitical imperative which is the need for countries which are rivals to the US to try and deolarize in some way. Now the problem is there is no viable alternatives. That means that the flow into other alternatives is going to be slow. We obviously seen this in the increased bidding by central banks for gold and I think it's and I think that could spread to other kind of assets as well. But that's a sort of non-marketdriven more geopolitical concern that can carry on. And then you have specific investor concerns, you know, when there have been suggestions from the US administration that perhaps we can apply some kind of taxes or charges on foreign holders of US assets and that has certainly grabbed attention but and people have backed away from that. So it doesn't seem to be an immediate concern right now. But three very different things pointing the same direction which is for there to be somewhat less trust in the dollar as a safe haven. The biggest thing in its favor though is that growth in the US seems likely to be stronger than growth in other regions and the lack of another alternative means the outflows are going to be slow. I think so this is a drip freed story that sits in the background I think we have for many years to come</p>

**Inigo:** 所以我想我首先会谈谈美元与其他资产的关系。在过去几个月里，你看到了一些美元下跌而债券收益率上升的情况。这是一个风险更高的环境，美元在这种环境中并没有表现出避险资产的特性。你还看到美元与黄金之间存在更深的负相关性。显然，以美元计价的黄金价格上涨意味着美元被视为避险资产的程度降低。你还看到黄金、白银、铂金和比特币等资产之间的相关性增加。所有这些资产，从某种角度来看，都可能具有某些共同特征，例如它们可能是非恐惧驱动的零久期资产。所以你看到了这种市场行为，即美元风险被更多地定价。至少有过这样的情况。然而，我认为真正会改变这一点并使其成为人们更直接关注的问题是，如果机构投资者大量抛售美国债券。现在关于这一点有很多讨论，也有很多报道。我在许多会议上都被问到这个问题。但到目前为止，据我们所知，这更多是口头上的讨论，而非实际的资金流动。我的意思是，例如，日本养老金系统或欧洲养老金的一些部分确实曾出售美元债券，但从整体来看，这些数字非常小。所以到目前为止，你仍然看到对更安全的流动资产的需求仍然是主导力量，但这正是我们真正关注的变化。我的意思是，我认为这里的一个背景是，必须记住这里有一些非常不同类型的风险，它们都被混为一谈，它们指向同一个方向，但它们的基础却非常不同。所以，一个是我们讨论过的对财政可持续性的担忧。是的，这当然是一个担忧，但你永远不知道它的时机。除此之外，还有一个更具地缘政治的必要性，那就是美国的竞争对手国家需要以某种方式实现去美元化。现在的问题是，没有可行的替代方案。这意味着流向其他替代方案的资金将是缓慢的。我们显然已经看到中央银行对黄金的竞标增加，我认为这可能会蔓延到其他类型的资产。但这是一种非市场驱动的、更具地缘政治的担忧，可以持续下去。然后，你还有特定的投资者担忧，你知道，当美国政府曾建议对外国持有的美国资产征收某种税费时，这确实引起了关注，但人们已经放弃了这种想法。所以目前看来，这似乎不是一个直接的担忧。但三件非常不同的事情指向同一个方向，那就是对美元作为避险资产的信任度有所下降。然而，最有利于它的一点是，美国的增长似乎可能比其他地区更强劲，而且缺乏其他替代方案意味着资金外流将是缓慢的。我认为这是一个缓慢释放的故事，它将在未来许多年里一直存在于背景之中。

**Tracy:** 我能讲个故事吗？

</details>

**Tracy:** 我发誓这与这次对话有关，但你可能以前听过这个故事，Joe。我听过的最好的对话之一是 Howard Marx 和 Mike Milken 在洛杉矶 Milken 会议上的对话，它基本上是关于他们的职业生涯中投资格局是如何变化的。所以在1950年代和1960年代，如果你把钱投入蓝筹股，比如 **Nifty50**（Nifty50: 印度国家证券交易所的基准股票市场指数，这里泛指表现优异的蓝筹股），一切都很好，你获得了稳定的利润。但到了1970年代初，市场崩溃，通货膨胀高企，这改变了一切。所以更高的波动性伴随着更高的通货膨胀和实际购买力的下降，这意味着人们当时损失了大约90%的钱，这太疯狂了。Mike 和 Howard 的论点是，这导致了基金经理的爆炸式增长，也导致了高收益债券市场的诞生，因为人们意识到，你不能再仅仅购买宝丽来股票并期望获得稳定的回报。你必须更复杂地对待它，并衡量风险与回报。所以我想我的问题是，我们在这里谈论的是投资者行为的类似重大转变吗？所以也许不是衡量风险与回报，而是衡量风险与实际回报，或者类似的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I swear it's relevant to this conversation but you've probably heard this story before actually Joe one of the best convers conversations I ever listened to was between Howard Marx and Mike Milin at the Milin conference in LA and it was basically about how the investment landscape had kind of changed over their careers. So in the 1950s and 1960s if you put your money in blue chip stocks like the Nifty50 or something like that, everything was fine and you made consistent profit. But then the market crashed in the early 1970s and you had high inflation and that kind of changed everything. So higher volatility along with higher inflation and a deterioration in real purchasing power which meant people lost like 90% of their money at that time which is crazy. And Mike and Howard's argument was that this was what caused the explosion of money managers and also the birth of the high yield bond market because people realized well you can't just buy Polaroid stock anymore and expect a consistent return. you have to be more sophisticated about it and measure risk against that return. So I guess my question is are we talking about something similar here in terms of a C shift in investor behavior? So maybe instead of weighing risk against return, you weigh risk against real returns or something like that.</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我认为这是一个强有力的叙事，将持续很长时间，因为人们已经非常习惯于一个几十年来通货膨胀一直温和的环境。通货膨胀的波动性相对较低，并且通货膨胀一直在下降。与此同时，我们看到股票和固定收益资产在大部分时间里都产生了强劲的回报。而且，股票和固定收益资产设法在它们之间保持了负相关性。因此，你以实际价值实现的总回报与风险之比非常高。现在，我绝不是在暗示我们面临看跌的前景，但我认为我们确实面临一个更艰难的前景。一个存在多种结构性力量，意味着通货膨胀水平会更高，波动性也会更大的前景。考虑到我们之前谈到的人口结构等增长限制。考虑到我们目前大多数资产类别的估值都很高，几十年来表现良好的投资组合所实现的实际回报可能会低得多。因此，这提出了一个真正根本性的问题，即大多数投资者的目标究竟是什么。你知道，目标是最大化每单位风险的回报，还是**保值实际购买力**（Preserve Real Returns/Purchasing Power: 确保投资回报能够抵消通货膨胀，从而保持或增加资产的实际价值）？或者换一种思考方式，这里最终相关的风险定义是什么？我的意思是，风险是我投资组合在未来10年内的预期波动性，还是未来10年内购买力损失的风险？我会认为，对于几乎所有投资者来说，如果他们最终思考这个问题，后者才是更大的问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think that's a strong narrative that will carry on for a long time because people have been very used to an environment where for decades and decades inflation has been benign. It's been relatively low volatility of inflation and inflation's been going down. At the same time, we've seen strong returns both from equities and from fixed income assets over most of the time. And um equities and fixed income have managed to have a negative correlation there between them. And so the overall return versus risk that you've achieved in real terms has been very strong. Now I'm absolutely not suggesting that we face a bearish outlook, but I think we do face a harder outlook. an outlook where there are multiple structural forces that imply the level of inflation will be somewhat higher and somewhat more volatile. Given the constraints on growth that we spoke about in terms of demographics etc. Given where we are in terms of the valuations across most asset classes being high, the likelihood is that the real return achieved from the portfolios that have done well for many decades is going to be much much lower. And so it raises this really fundamental question which is actually what is the objective of most investors. You know is the objective to maximize return per unit risk or is it to preserve real returns or another way of thinking about it is what is the definition of risk that's ultimately relevant here? I mean is risk the expected volatility of my portfolio over the next 10 years or is risk the risk of a loss of purchasing power over the next 10 years? And I would suggest that for nearly every investor if they think about it ultimately it's the latter of those two that's a much bigger issue.</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 等等，为什么不是两者兼顾呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait why not both?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我的意思是，理想情况下，人们会关心两者。这取决于你认为自己有多少自由度，因为不幸的是，如果资产的预期实际回报普遍较低。如果它们之间的相关性普遍较高，那么要获得一定水平的实际回报就会困难得多。所以我认为实际上，在衡量风险（作为投资组合的预期波动性）与保值购买力之间存在直接的张力。因为如果你长期真正关心的是保值购买力，我会认为你可能不得不承担更多的风险，就预期波动性而言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean ideally one would care about both. It depends how many degrees of freedom you think you have because you know unfortunately if the expected real return across assets is going to be generally lower. If the correlation amongst them is generally higher then ekking out a certain level of real return becomes much much harder. So I think actually there ends up being a direct tension between the measure risk as um expected volume of the portfolio versus preserving purchasing power because if the thing that really matters to you in the long run is preserving purchasing power I would argue that actually you probably have to take more risk in the sense of expected V</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 尽管我知道这很难向人们解释，而且在市场已经35倍的时候，这听起来可能很轻率，我并不是特别看好长期前景，但我认为你别无选择，你必须考虑承担更多风险，因为另一个选择是跑输通货膨胀，这对人们来说会更痛苦。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and even though I'm aware that's a horrible thing to have to explain to people and it might sound very cavalier at a point when the ship is 35 times and I'm not spelling uh particularly you become bullish a long-term outlook but I think you'll have no choice you have to think about taking more risk because the other you know option is to underperform inflation and that is more painful for people</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 我的意思是，至少好消息是人们可以选择如何承担这种风险，如何分配它，他们相信什么样的风险，什么样的风险与他们所需的流动性、时间范围和信念等相符。但在两种不同类型的风险之间的这种张力中，我认为保值购买力的需求才是真正的重点，这最终对许多投资者类型来说是一种治理上的转变。所以，你知道，看看你今年的主要主题，并思考这种美元重要性下降或主导地位下降或安全性下降的世界。你提到的一件事是地缘政治，当然，现在有多场战争正在进行。美元正在被武器化。当然，俄罗斯在入侵乌克兰后就处于这种境地。但政治呢？我的意思是，我们总是谈论地缘政治，但我对实际政治以及美国目前正在发生的事情也很感兴趣，对美联储独立性的攻击。那不是地缘政治，那是政治。但它可能会动摇人们对美元体系的信心。其他类似的束缚，政府为维持某种稳定而给自己设定的，或者仅仅是贸易政策的波动性，或者政府通过了另一项巨大的减税措施。在债务轨迹上没有政治意愿进行有意义的改变。国内政治如何影响全球对美元稳定性的看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean the good news at least in that is that people can choose how they want to take that risk how they want to partition it what kind of risks do they believe in what risks are consistent with the liquidity that they need and the time horizons they have and the beliefs they have etc etc but in this tension between the two different kinds of risk I think is that need to preserve we purchasing power that is the real focus and that is a a shift in governance ultimately for many investor types. So you know looking at your big themes this year and thinking about this idea of a sort of a world where the dollar is less important or less dominant or less safe or something like that. One of the things that you mention is geopolitics and of course there are multiple wars going on. There is the weaponization of the dollar. Of course, Russia was on the the other end of after its invasion of Ukraine. But what about politics? I mean, we always talk about geopolitics, but I'm also interested in like actual politics and what's going on in the United States right now, the attacks on Federal Reserve independence. That's not geopolitics. That's politics. But it could shake people's faith in the dollar system. other, you know, shackles like that that the government has put on itself to maintain some sort of stability or even just sort of the volatility in trade policy or the fact that the government, you know, passed another gigantic tax cut. There's no political appetite for meaningful change in the debt trajectory. How does like politics, domestic politics play into global perceptions of dollar stability?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我认为这里有两条途径。我想一条途径又回到了财政可持续性这个话题。如果各党派都没有真正有意义地改变财政轨迹的意愿，那么人们就会面临这样的问题：债务的可持续性如何？这个问题可以被推迟吗？但出路在哪里？我认为最终通货膨胀是最可能的出路。我认为你必须对人工智能可能带来的增长抱有极大的乐观，才能认为存在另一种出路。我想第二点是海外投资者对美国的信任问题。当然，有些时候这种信任受到了动摇。当时我正在全球客户中进行一系列市场推广活动，当时正在讨论是否应该达成某种“马拉拉戈协议”（Mara Laga accord: 指代可能对外国持有的美国债务地位进行改变的政治协议，此处为虚构或代指），并可能改变外国持有美国债务的地位。好吧，现在看来这个建议已经被搁置了，而且很长时间没有在会议中提及，所以也许这不会发生，但仅仅是它被提出这一事实，你知道，与此同时，人们对财政可持续性感到担忧，并且存在非常强大的地缘政治力量试图寻找美元替代品，这我想某种程度上助长了这样一种观点，即美元作为避险资产的地位可能不如以前。我的意思是，最大的警告是，这取决于我们这里谈论的是哪种风险。我认为如果我们谈论的是一般的商业周期风险，那么人们，你知道，我认为现在普遍认为，与一年前相比，美元风险更高。当情况变得非常糟糕时，当地缘政治冲击发生时，通常，你知道，幸好是短期性质的，那么你仍然会看到人们涌向美元，美元在短期内可能会在潜在的巨大冲击中上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are two avenues here. I guess one avenue again is back to this topic of fiscal sustainability. And if there is no appetite across parties to really meaningfully change that fiscal kind of trajectory, then one is left with this you know kind of question of how sustainable is the debt? Can this can be kicked down the road? But what are the ways out? And I and ultimately I think that inflation is the most likely route out. I think you have to be hugely optimistic about the growth that can come from AI in order to have a view that there's an alternative way out. And the second I guess is this question of trust in the US from the point of overseas investors. There certainly there have been points where that's been shaken. So I was doing a series of marketing tours around global clients at the point where all those discussions was taking place about should there be some kind of Mara Laga accord and potentially changing the status of foreign owners of US debt and okay it looks like that's been backed away from as suggestion and certainly hasn't come up in meetings for a long time so maybe that's not going to happen but just the fact it was raised you know at the same time that there is this concern about fiscal sustainability and there are geopolitical political forces which are very strong to try and find dollar alternatives and that I guess sort of feeds this kind of view that that perhaps the dollar has less of a safe haven status than it did before. I mean the big caveat is it depends what kind of risk we're talking about here. I think if we're talking about general business cycle risks then people you know I think generally do take the view now compared to say a year ago that the dollar is more risky. When things get really bad when there's a geopolitical shock often you know quite short-term in nature thankfully then you still see people flee to the dollar and the dollar rally in the short term over potentially large shocks. </p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 既然我们谈论的是风险溢价和政治或地缘政治不稳定，我想到一件事，我们基本上是在谈论世界如何变化以及规范如何转变。我有点好奇，规范或者投资者的反应是否会以一种更出乎意料的方式改变，即我们不会看到风险溢价上升，因为每个人都对不稳定或重大冲击感到紧张，或者其他什么，也许每个人都只是习惯了它，你不会看到更高的风险溢价被定价。我的意思是，这在市场中是一个持续的主题，对吧？发生了一些重大事件，然后类似的事情后来又发生了，但你没有得到那么大的反应。这有可能吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since we're talking risk premiums and political or geopolitical instability, one thing I wonder is we're basically talking about how the world is changing and norms are shifting. And I'm kind of wondering could the norms or could the response from investors change in a more unexpected way in the sense that instead of seeing risk premiums go up because everyone is nervous about instability or big shocks or whatever maybe everyone just becomes really used to it and you don't see higher risk premiums priced in. I mean that's a consistent theme in market right? something major happens and then something similar happens later and you don't get as big a reaction. Is that a possibility here?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我的意思是，我认为这是一种可能性。我的意思是，我，我不太确定这是否足以让人对长期前景超级看好。再说一遍，你知道，我确实认为美国市场和全球股市将产生奇怪的正实际回报，但今天的估值很高。所以我认为，你知道，是的，人们可以勾勒出一个叙事，即不需要结构性地回到较低的估值水平，因为我们目前的实际利率水平，因为我们目前一些最盈利公司的盈利能力持续性。我的意思是，所有这些都证明了当前的估值是合理的，但要证明估值向上转变，我认为这正是你问题中试图表达的，我认为那将非常困难。所以，是的，我可以得出积极的回报前景，但，是的，这取决于对实际收益走向的看法，而不是由市盈率扩张驱动的。我认为那将是一个很难做出的判断。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean I think it's a possibility. I mean I e I'm not sure that's enough to turn one super bullish uh in terms of long run again I you know but just to stress you know I do think that the US market and global equities are going to produce weird positive real return but valuations today are high. So I would argue that you know that yes one can outline a narrative that there does not need to be a shift back to structurally lower levels of valuation because of where we are in real rates because where we are in terms of the persistence of profitability for some of the most profitable firms. I mean all these things justify valuations where they are but to justify a shift upward in valuations which I think is what you're kind of getting to been your question I think that would just be really tough. So yes, I can get to a positive return outlook, but yes, that's driven by views on where real earnings go, not by multiple expansion. I think that would be a hard call to make.</p>

<p class="english-text">Joe has a complicated relationship with gold, but when we're talking about real purchasing power, what exactly are you advising people to buy to or hedge to to preserve that purchasing power?</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 是的。所以有广泛的应对措施，而且我认为未来不像过去那样简单，过去债券和股票都能产生正实际回报，并且它们之间存在负相关性。我的意思是，对我来说，**实物资产**（Real Assets: 具有内在价值或与实物商品挂钩的资产，如房地产、大宗商品、基础设施等）排名第一的是全球股票。我的意思是，只要通货膨胀只是适度高而不是高得多，那么就有强有力的证据表明股票表现得像实物资产并产生实际回报，而且它是一个流动性资产类别。所以它排在第一位。除此之外，还有一系列其他实物资产，无论是真正的实物资产，还是私人资产领域，例如具有浮动利率性质的私人债务，可以是房地产、农田等形式的实物资产，然后是黄金。所以黄金在过去200年里的长期实际回报率，据我们所知，是每年正0.2%。所以这是一个非常小的数字。尽管也许人们应该，你知道，说如果你购买它是因为你害怕某种真正的避险事件，那么零实际回报可能也不是那么糟糕。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So there's a broad range of responses and it's not as simple I guess in future thing as perhaps with hindsight it was over years when both bonds and equities produce positive real returns and had a negative correlation between them. I mean think of real assets for me number one is global equities. I mean as long as inflation's only moderately higher and not much higher then there is strong evidence that equities behave like a real asset and produce real returns and that's a liquid asset class. So that comes number one. Alongside that there are a range you know of other real assets as well be it real physical assets or be it areas of private assets for example kind of private debt that has a floating rate nature attached to it can be in real assets in the form of real estate farmland etc and things like that and then there's gold so gold has a long run real return of the last 200 years of plus 0.2% 2% peranom as far as we can tell. So it's very small number. Although maybe one should, you know, say that if you're buying it because you're frightened of some a really riskoff event, then a zero real return may not be such a bad thing.</p>

**Jill:** 是的，完全正确，然后我也为此失眠。我就是睡不好。我认为支持黄金的关键论点，我们多年来一直在给客户的建议中支持黄金配置，但我认为支持黄金的关键论点是，你看，是的，你希望在战略上大幅增持股票，即使这不是一个非常看好的前景，仅仅因为这能给你带来正的实际回报。问题是，你在这个股票头寸周围添加什么来帮助分散投资组合中的风险，因为问题是，如果通货膨胀确实保持较高水平，并且可能更具波动性，那么债券将不会像过去那样分散股票风险。黄金的关键吸引力在于，黄金与股票的相关性在不同的通货膨胀水平下仍然为零。所以它似乎在较高的通货膨胀时期具有作为股票风险分散器的既定记录，这是它在投资组合中的关键作用。然后，我的意思是，除此之外，我们还可以认为，出于地缘政治原因和非利润驱动的原因，中央银行将继续购买它，这可能会提供上涨支持，但我不会试图给出数字或预测，因为那太难了。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. totally and then I lose sleep over that too. I just don't sleep well. I think the key argument in favor of gold and we've been pro a gold allocation in the advice we give to clients for some years but I think the key argument in favor of it is that look yes you want a big overweight on equity strategically even if it's not that bullish outlook but just because that gives you a positive real return. The question is what do you add around that equity position that helps diversify risk in the portfolio because the problem is that if inflation does remain higher and perhaps more volatile then bonds are not going to diversify equity risk as they have in the past. The key attraction of gold is that the correlation of gold and equities remains at zero at different inflation levels. So it does seem to have an established track record as being a diversifier risk of equity risk that is in higher inflation episodes and that's its kind of key role in portfolios. Then I mean on top of that we can also take the view that for geopolitical reasons and nonprofit driven reasons central banks will carry on buying it and that might give upward support but I'm not going to attempt to give a number or forecast on that because that's simply too hard to do.</p>

### 气候风险与人工智能的影响

**Tracy:** 在这个更不稳定或潜在更具通胀性的未来世界中，你谈到的一个更大的结构性趋势是气候风险。我不得不说，在过去几年里，当我看到金融机构谈论气候时，我有点不屑一顾。有时感觉像是敷衍了事。我们看到……

</details>

**Inigo:** 是的。所以我们的观点非常具体，那就是我们想思考哪些是作用于市场5到10年期的主要结构性力量，以及哪些是真正影响投资者面临的根本风险的因素。所以，除了人口结构变化、人工智能、对债务的担忧和去全球化等同时发生的其他力量之外，我们还认为需要思考是否存在与气候相关的风险。我们对此的特定观点是，世界到2050年实现净零排放的可能性极低，原因有两类。一是社会和政治上很难足够快地改变行为。其次是人工智能的电力需求。所以，你知道，据我们所知，到明年年底，全球数据中心的电力需求将与日本的总电力需求相同。所以我们基本上在全球电力需求上增加了一个 G3 经济体，而且这将继续增长。所以这意味着我们无法实现净零排放。气候科学似乎表明，这意味着我们可能会看到超过2°的升温。那么问题是，投资者是否需要关心这个问题？这是否会从通货膨胀、通货膨胀风险、供应链风险或增长率的角度产生影响？所以在我们的书中，我们花了大量时间汇集学术证据，研究气温变化对 GDP 的影响。现在首先要说的是，我们研究了28项关于气温与增长之间联系的研究，它们的结果各不相同。这是一大堆点。所以首先要说的是，关于气温与增长之间关系存在巨大的分歧，但如果你简单地画一条平均线，它的趋势是向下的。所以，是的，我们可以争论它的重要性，但我们研究的学术工作普遍认为，在边际上，气温的更大升高对增长不利。同样，问题是，你知道，这如何重要，人们如何思考它，以及它的规模如何，因为所有这些的平均值意味着未来10年股票前景的变化，这仅仅是全球股票前景每年减少0.2%。这听起来可能不是什么大问题，你知道，它肯定小于人口结构变化或股票预测均值回归的影响。话虽如此，最近的预测比旧的预测更糟，意味着对股票回报在10年期产生负0.5%或负0.6%的年影响。这开始与人口结构对预期平均回报的影响达到相同的数量级。但我会说我们超越了这一点，因为真正让我震惊的是这些预测的误差范围巨大。所以，是的，当然，我们可以争论全球化、人口结构、企业盈利能力以及劳动力与利润份额将如何影响盈利前景，我们可以尽力为这些建立模型，并且我们对它们有一定的误差范围。但气候和人工智能的误差范围，我会说，是两件与所有其他事物都非常不同的事情，这带来了我们工作中**激进的预测误差**（Radical Forecast Error: 指预测结果与实际情况之间存在巨大且难以预料的偏差），并真正意味着人们需要，你知道，以更激进的方式思考多元化，因为我们在10年期视野上的路径误差比历史上任何时候都要宽。

<p class="english-text">Yes. So our view is very kind of specific on this which is we want to think about what are the big structural forces that act on markets over a 5 10 year horizon and what are things that really affect the fundamental risks that investors face. So in conjunction with these other forces happening at the same time in terms of demographic shifts and AI and worries about debt and deglobalization, we also have I think a need to think about whether there are risks associated with climate. And the specific view that we have on that is that it seems highly unlikely that the world will achieve net zero by 2050 for two different kinds of reasons. One is that it's socially and politically really hard to change behaviors fast enough. Secondly is the power demand of AI. So you know so as far as we can tell by the end of next year global data center power demand will be the same power demand as the total power of Japan. So we basically added a G3 economy onto global power demand and that will continue to grow. So that implies that we don't hit net zero. The climate science seems to suggest that means that it's likely we see a warming greater than 2°. And then the question is well do investors need to care about this? Does this matter either from the point of view of inflation, inflation risk, supply chain risk or growth rates? So in our book, we spend a lot of time so pooling academic evidence on what the effect is of a change in temperature on GDP. Now the first thing to say is you plot the 28 studies that we looked at in terms of the link between temperature and growth. They're all over the place. It's a big bunch of points. So the first thing to say about it is there's huge disagreement about what the relationship between temperature and growth is but the trend line through it if you simply put a sort of average line kind of through it is downwards. So yes we can argue about how material it is but there is a link that seems to be the consensus across the academic work that we looked at that you know at the margin a bigger increase in temperature is bad for growth. Again the question is you know how does this matter and how do people kind of think about it and what's the scale of this because the average of all those you know implies a change in the equity outlook 10 years forward that just simply shaves 2% peranom off the global equity outlooks that might not sound like a very big deal you know it's certainly smaller than the impact of demographic change or mean reversion on an equity forecast having said that the more recent forecasts are worse than the older forecast and imply something that looks like a minus.5 or minus.6% 6% peranom impact on equity returns at the 10-year mark. And that starts to get to be the same kind of order of magnitude as demographics has on the average return that one should expect. But I'd argue that we go beyond that because the real thing that struck me is just the scale of the error bars around these forecasts is huge. So yes, of course, we can argue about what globalization and demographics and corpor profitability and labor versus profit share will do to the earnings outlook and we can try our best to have models for those and we have certain error bars around them. But the error bars around climate and also AI I would say are two things that just are very different from everything else that introduces the sense of radical forecast error in what we're doing and really implies that people need to be you know thinking about perhaps diversification in a more radical way because we have path error on 10 years horizons that's much wider than it's been historically.</p>

**Tracy:** 回到人工智能，显然这不仅对能源转型和气候变化产生影响，而且对经济前景、生产力影响以及当然对股市也至关重要，我们看到大型科技巨头继续占据主导地位。人工智能是否会基本上加剧现有的市场失衡，即强者恒强，只有少数几家科技公司受到青睐，这是否会损害广泛的生产力增长？这是否是一种风险，或者这是你的基本判断？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Going back to AI for a second, obviously this is really important not just for the energy transition and the impact on climate change, but also for the economic outlook, the impact on productivity and also of course for the equity market where we've seen the big tech giants just continue to dominate. Is there a risk or would it be your base case that AI basically just intensifies I ex I guess existing market imbalances where the big just get bigger and only a select group of tech firms is kind of favored and that presumably would undermine productivity gains broad-based productivity gains.</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 我认为预测生产力增长的最大问题是，任何新技术出现时，都很难预测它对总体生产力和经济表现能力的影响。而且，你知道，长期以来，整个市场对生产力的预测一直非常糟糕。所以我想我们首先应该以谦逊的态度对待生产力预测，当然不应该依赖巨大的生产力增长来证明盈利增长的合理性。这是我想说的第一点。其次，它必须与我们之前谈到的去全球化和人口结构等增长的下行力量结合起来考虑。所以，是的，我们似乎确实会从人工智能中获得生产力提升，其规模备受争议。但问题是，你知道，这是否足以克服我们过去30或40年习惯的增长水平的下行力量。第三个要素是，人工智能带来的巨大生产力增长在多大程度上需要显著的**工作岗位置换**（Displacement of Jobs: 由于技术进步、自动化或经济结构变化导致某些工作岗位消失或被取代）。现在这是一个备受争议的话题。我们还不知道答案。我的意思是，一方面，人们可以指出200年的技术进步和自动化，但我们仍然几乎实现了充分就业。迄今为止，没有证据表明自工业革命诞生以来，我们所看到的所有自动化导致了结构性失业率的上升趋势。你知道，同样，与此同时，似乎最容易受到人工智能驱动自动化威胁的工作岗位是在非工会化部门。这似乎与我们过去30或40年自动化转变中可能看到的风险有所不同。所以我认为围绕人工智能的宏观总体问题核心是，首先，我们可以预期生产力增长的量是多少，你知道，这是否足以抵消其他地方的增长下行力量，如果你对人工智能驱动的生产力增长前景非常看好，你是否必然对就业前景持悲观态度，这在目前是一个非常开放的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the biggest issue around trying to forecast productivity gains is that with any new technology that comes along, it turns out to be really really hard to forecast what the impact that has on aggreate productivity and the ability of the economic expression you know in general and you know everyone across the street to forecast productivity has been really poor for a long long time. So I guess we should firstly approach productivity forecasts with a degree of humility and certainly shouldn't rely on huge productivity gains as a justification for earnings growth. Say that's the first thing I'd say. Secondly is that it has to be put in conjunction with downward forces on growth um from the things we spoke about earlier in terms of deglobization and demographics etc. So yes, it seems likely we do get a productivity improvement from AI and the scale of it is hotly debated. But the question is, you know, is that enough to overcome downward forces on growth from the levels of growth that we've become used to for the last kind of 30 or 40 years. And the third element is to what extent does a large productivity gain from AI require significant uh displacement of jobs? Now that's a very hotly debated topic. We simply don't know the answer to that yet. I mean on the one hand one could point to 200 years of technological advance and automation and yet we have almost full employment. There's no evidence to date that there's been a structural trend increase in unemployment through all the automation we've seen uh since the birth of the industrial revolution. You know, equally at the same time, the jobs that seem most at risk from AIdriven automation are those in non-unionized sectors. And that seems like a different kind of risk than the one perhaps we've seen, you know, through automation shifts the last kind of 30 or 40 years. So I think the heart of the macro aggregate you know kind of question around AI is firstly what's the quantum of the productivity increase that we can expect you know whether that is enough to offset these downward force and growth elsewhere and if you are very bullish on the outlook for AIdriven productivity growth do you necessarily have to bearish in terms of the job outlook and that's a very much an open question at the moment</p>

### 系统性投资的未来

**Jill:** 我还有一个问题，这是一个私人问题，如果你不介意的话，但我知道你曾公开声明你不再是**量化分析师**（Quant: 运用数学、统计学和计算机科学方法进行金融分析和交易的专业人士），这有点好笑，因为我有点想象办公室场景，Michael 站起来喊道：“我宣布破产。”我有点想象 Indigo 在 Alliance Bernstein 的办公室里喊道：“我不再是量化分析师了。”但无论如何，所有这一切意味着什么？这种巨大的转变对**系统性投资**（Systematic Investing: 基于预设规则和算法，通过计算机程序自动执行的投资策略）意味着什么，它基本上依赖于回溯测试大量的历史数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have just one more question and it's a personal one if you don't mind, but I know you you kind of publicly declared that you're no longer a quant, which is kind of funny because I kind of imagine the equivalent of the office scene where Michael stands up and shouts out, "I declare bankruptcy." I kind of imagine Indigo at the office of Alliance Bernstein shouting, "I am no longer a quant." But anyway, what does all of this mean? This sort of big shift mean for systematic investing that basically relies on, you know, back testing reams and reams of historic data.</p>
</details>

**Inigo:** 是的。所以我认为有一种观点认为，在更大的结构性层面，我们已经处于某种经济环境30或40年了，而驱动这种环境的力量，你知道，已经走到尽头或正在逆转，因此长期以来存在的一些经验法则将不再以同样的方式发挥作用。现在这并不意味着系统性投资会突然停止运作，因为显然，首先有许多在较短时间范围内运作的过程，它们不需要考虑这些巨大的、缓慢变化的结构性力量。其次，我认为拒绝任何形式的系统性定量输入几乎是荒谬的，考虑到人工智能正在取得的进展，并假设人们可以继续以同样的方式工作。所以这绝不是要拒绝那种过程，但我认为很难说那些行之有效的一般方法会以同样的方式继续下去。特别是当涉及到帮助客户思考治理以及回到我们一开始谈到的这个问题时，即我们真正关心的风险的真实衡量标准是什么。你知道，那是投资组合的波动性，还是购买力的衡量标准？这是一种深刻的治理问题，我认为很难用任何一种系统性过程来解决，它几乎必然地超出了这种过程的范围。所以正是这些讨论，我们现在花更多时间与客户进行，因为我们认为这些是发生更大转变的地方。Alliance Bernstein 的 Inigo Fraser Jenkins，非常感谢你来参加节目。时间过得太久了，和你交谈和阅读你的资料总是很有趣。感谢你加入我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I I think there is a case made that the bigger structural level that we've been in a certain economic environment for 30 or 40 years and the forces that drove that you know have run their course or going into reverse and therefore some of the rules of thumb that have existed in for a long time aren't going to work in the same way. Now that does not mean that systematic investing um suddenly stops working because obviously there are firstly a host of processes that operate over shorter time horizons that don't need to take into account these huge slowmoving structural forces. Secondly, it would be you know almost absurd I think to reject any kind of systematic quantitative input given the advances in AI that are taking place and assume that one can sort of carry on working in the same way. So it's not to kind of reject with that kind of process at all, but it is I think hard to say that the general approaches that have worked are going to carry on in the same way. Specifically when it comes down to the really hard questions around helping clients think about kind of governance and back to this question we spoke about at the beginning which is actually what is the real measure of risk that we care about. you know is that the volatility of the portfolio or is it uh a measure of purchasing power and that's the kind of deep governance question that I think is very you know hard to attack with any kind of systematic process almost necessarily kind of sits outside of that and so it's those kind of discussions that we're spending a lot more of our time on clients because we think those is where some of the bigger shifts are taking place indigo Frasier Jenkins at Alliance Bernstein thank you so much for coming on it had been too long it's always interesting to talk to and read your stuff appreciate you joining us on our</p>

### 对话总结与未来展望

**Jill:** Tracy，我总是很喜欢和 Inigo 聊天。时间过得太久了，我认为他可能是最优秀的人之一。你知道，很多人都试图综合宏观概念，而且，你知道，环游世界与客户交谈，谈论宏观概念一定很有趣。我认为他是这方面最优秀的人之一，而且我认为他非常清晰，并且非常认真地对待这个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I always really like talking to Indigo. It'd been too long and I think he's probably one of the best out there. you know, a lot of people try to synthesize big picture ideas and, you know, must be a lot of fun like going around the world and talking to clients and talking about big ideas. I think he's like one of the best at it and I think uh he's very cogent and takes that process very seriously.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 他确实如此。我确实想象你肯定会从客户那里反复听到同样的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He does. I do imagine you must get the same questions from clients over and</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 那太有价值了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's so valuable, right?</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。我的意思是，我想这让你能够权衡人们最关心的是什么，但我只是想知道，我的意思是，我想你每次听到它都会给出一种固定的回答。我不知道。或者也许你会随着时间的推移完善你的论点。我不得不说，说到论点，你提到 Inigo 的这本书是公开可用的。我们应该在节目笔记中放一个链接，或者类似的东西，这样每个人都可以边听这期节目边阅读它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I guess it allows you to weigh what's the biggest concern for people, but I just wonder I mean I guess you give a sort of set response each time you hear it. I don't know. or maybe you refine your arguments as you go along. I got to say, speaking of arguments, you mentioned that this book is from Indigo is publicly available. We should put a link in the show notes um or something to it so everyone can read it alongside this episode.</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 里面有大量的数据和有趣的图表，绝对值得任何人阅读。所以，我们一定会找到一种方法来引导人们阅读它。所以我对这个问题非常感兴趣，特别是关于美元对风险的敏感性，因为多年来，人们的观点是，如果发生了一些不好的事情，或者发生了一些新的事情，或者人们感到焦虑，就会出现美元避险潮。我仍然认为在某种程度上你会看到这种情况，但它确实似乎是真的。我的意思是，你知道，自4月初以来，你看到许多资产都在复苏。我们没有看到美元。我认为你现在有这样的时刻，你有一个所谓的“风险事件”，但却没有美元避险潮。它转向黄金或其他东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The amount of data and interesting charts in there, it's certainly well worth anyone approing. So, we will definitely make sure that we find a way to point people to that. So I'm really interested in this question of and on the dollar specifically about the sensitivity of the dollar to risk right because for years the view is something bad happens or something new happens or something people get anxious in the flight to dollars and I still think you see that to some extent but it definitely seems true. I mean, you know, you see this recovery in a lot of assets since early April. We haven't seen the dollar. And I think you have these moments now where you have a sort of quote risk event unquote and there is no flight to the dollar. It's a flight to gold or something else,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 对吧？美联储的例子就是一个很好的例子。我从那次对话中得到的两点是，即使我们谈论的是世界正在发生的事情以及它如何转化为市场的巨大转变，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? And the Fed example is well, it's a really good example. The two things I kind of took away from that conversation are even if we're talking about a sea shift in what's happening in the world and how that translates into markets,</p>
</details>

**Jill:** 这并不意味着所有事情都会同时发生，对吧？这可能是一个非常非常缓慢的过程。我想我将使用旧的油轮比喻，对吧？如果你在快艇上，你可以很快转弯，但如果你谈论的是这些巨大的结构性变化，那更像是一艘油轮，需要一些时间。然后第二件事是，我认为此刻真正不同的是，Inigo 在一开始就谈到了，那就是正在发生的重大变化的汇合。这不仅仅是美元的潜在消亡。它还是美元的消亡加上去全球化加上人工智能加上人口增长等等。现在，我一直在思考这个问题，它与我们一直在具体谈论的内容有点离题，但显然有很多变化。但即使你只看一个，最近我一直在思考的一个是自动驾驶汽车。即使世界上没有其他技术进步，我认为你也可以论证，例如，自动驾驶汽车将大规模重塑城市景观。对吧？如果我们不再需要开车，我们安排城市、郊区和远郊的方式有可能发生大规模改变。这只是其中一件事。实际上它甚至没有被谈论太多。但如果你真正深入思考其影响，它实际上是巨大的。但我们现在正在发生很多事情。那只是一个不那么引人注目的小问题。但再加上自动驾驶汽车。再加上人工智能以及它对白领劳动力以某种方式造成的颠覆。再加上国内政治波动性的上升以及对美联储的攻击等等。再加上多场战争正在进行等等。再加上出生率正在崩溃这一事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it doesn't mean it's all going to happen at once, right? This can be a very very slowm moving thing. And I I guess I'm going to use the old tanker cliche, right? Like if you're in a speedboat, you can turn it very quickly, but if you're talking about these huge huge structural changes, it's more of a tanker and it takes some time. And then the second thing is I think what is actually different about this moment and Indigo talked about it at the beginning is just the confluence of major changes that seem to be happening. It's not just death of the dollar potentially. It's also death of the dollar plus declobalization plus AI plus population growth and all of that. Now, I've been thinking about this and it's a little bit tangential to what we've been talking about specifically, but there's obviously so many changes. But even if you just take one, and one that's been on my mind lately is self-driving cars. Even if there was nothing else happening technologically in the entire world, I think you could make the argument that self-driving cars, for example, will massively restructure urban landscapes. Right? The way that we arrange cities and suburbs and exerbs has the potential to change massively if people don't have to drive anymore. And this is just one thing. It actually doesn't really even get talked about that much. But if you actually follow follow through the implications, it's actually big. But we there are so many things happening right now. That's just one minor one that doesn't even get that much attention. But add in self-driving cars. Add in AI and the effect that that has on disrupting the white collar workforce in some way. Add on the rise of sort of domestic political volatility and the attacks on the Fed and so forth. Add on the fact there are multiple wars going on, etc. uh add on, you know, the fact that birth rates are collapsing.</p>
