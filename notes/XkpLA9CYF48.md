### 克林顿的爱泼斯坦证词风波

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是《头条新闻》。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 27 日，星期五。我们正在报道以下内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, February 27th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我刚刚结束了作证。我尽我所能回答了他们提出的每一个问题。昨天，在一场闭门会议中，前国务卿**希拉里·克林顿**接受了长达六个多小时的质询，**众议院监督委员会**的共和党成员就**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**一事质问她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Well, I have just finished uh testifying. I answered every one of their questions as uh fully as I could. In a closedd door meeting yesterday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sat for a deposition that stretched more than six hours as members of the Republican le House Oversight Committee questioned her about Jeffrey Epstein. And

</details>

**希拉里·克林顿**: 我们回来回答问题，一遍又一遍地重复，字面意思就是一遍又一遍。我不知道我必须说多少次我不知道杰弗里·爱泼斯坦。我从未去过他的岛屿。我从未去过他的家。我从未去过他的办公室。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Hillary Clinton**: we returned to answer questions repetitively, literally over and over again. I don't know how many times I had to say I did not know Jeffrey Epstein. I never went to his island. I never went to his homes. I never went to his offices.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 克林顿和她的丈夫、前总统，花了数月时间试图对抗国会传票，称其无效且带有政治动机。他们只在受到国会蔑视的威胁后才同意出庭。当时，他们要求公开作证，以便任何人都能观看。共和党人拒绝了。但昨天，该委员会的一名共和党成员，代表**劳伦·博伯特**，泄露了克林顿在房间内的照片，该照片立即被一个右翼播客发布到社交媒体上，几乎导致整个会议脱轨。克林顿的证词突然暂停，之后才同意继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Clinton, along with her husband, the former president, had spent months trying to fight congressional subpoenas to testify, calling them invalid and politically motivated. They only agreed to appear after they were threatened with contempt of Congress. At that point, they asked for their testimony to be public so anyone could watch. Republicans refused. But yesterday, a Republican member of the committee, Representative Lauren Boowbert, leaked an image of Clinton from inside the room, which was immediately posted to social media by a right-wing podcaster that almost derailed the whole session. Clinton abruptly paused her testimony

</details>

**希拉里·克林顿**: 我们正在经历一场极其不严肃的闹剧般的质询，国会议员和共和党人更关心的是拍到克林顿国务卿的照片，而不是真正找到真相并追究任何人的责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Hillary Clinton**: before eventually agreeing to continue. We are sitting through an incredibly unserious clown show of a deposition where members of Congress in the Republican party are more concerned about getting their photo op of Secretary Clinton than actually getting to the truth and holding anyone accountable.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 监督委员会的一些民主党人谴责了这次质询，称共和党人并未关注与爱泼斯坦关系最密切的人。他们指出，他们的共和党同事上周都缺席了亿万富翁共和党捐助者、**维多利亚的秘密**前负责人**莱斯利·韦克斯纳**的质询，他曾帮助爱泼斯坦积累财富。克林顿还指出，她被问及一些与爱泼斯坦毫无关系的事情，包括**“披萨门”阴谋论**和**不明飞行物**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Some of the Democrats on the oversight committee condemned the deposition, saying that Republicans weren't focused on the people with the closest ties to Epstein. They noted that their GOP colleagues all skipped a deposition last week of Lesie Wexner, the billionaire Republican donor and former head of Victoria's Secret, who helped Epstein build his wealth. Clinton also pointed out that she was asked some questions about things that had nothing to do with Epstein at all, including the Pizzagate conspiracy and UFOs.

</details>

**希拉里·克林顿**: 我只想说，我今天学到的一件事是，如果你真的对克林顿夫妇、杰弗里·爱泼斯坦和**吉斯兰·麦克斯韦尔**有具体问题，那就去问**比尔·克林顿**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Hillary Clinton**: I would just say one of the things I learned today is if you really have specific questions about the Clintons and Jeffrey Epstein and Gain Maxwell, you got to ask Bill Clinton.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，委员会的共和党成员表示，他们期待着比尔·克林顿今天的证词。他卸任后曾多次乘坐爱泼斯坦的飞机。在爱泼斯坦的档案中有很多他的照片。这将是美国前总统首次被迫在国会委员会前作证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Republican members of the committee, meanwhile, said they were looking ahead to Bill Clinton's testimony, which is scheduled for today. He flew on Epstein's plane several times after leaving office. And there are many photos of him in the Epstein files. It will be the first time a former US president has been compelled against his will to testify in front of a congressional committee

### 纽约ICE逮捕事件引争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在纽约市，一名大学生被移民局特工逮捕，引发了一系列连锁反应，市长和**特朗普总统**也卷入了其中。早上 6 点左右，身穿便衣的**ICE**特工出现在**哥伦比亚大学学生宿舍**。据大学官员称，他们要求进入，声称是正在搜寻一名失踪儿童的警察。一名管理员让他们进去了。哥伦比亚大学表示，他们在学生公寓门口重复了同样的说辞，甚至出示了一张据称失踪儿童的照片。这时，特工逮捕了一名本科生。当被要求出示搜查令时，他们没有出示。几小时内，哥伦比亚大学的代理校长就逮捕事件发表了紧急声明，约 200 人参加了学校的紧急集会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: in New York City yesterday. The arrest of a college student by immigration agents set off a frantic chain reaction that roped in the city's mayor and President Trump. Around 6:00 in the morning, ICE agents wearing plain clothes showed up at Columbia Student Housing. According to university officials, they demanded to be let inside, claiming they were police officers searching for a missing child. A superintendent let them in. Colombia says they then repeated the same story at the door of the students apartment, even showing a picture of the alleged missing child. At that point, the agents arrested an undergrad student. When asked to show a warrant, they did not. Within hours, Colombia's acting president sent out an urgent statement about the arrest and some 200 people showed up for an emergency rally AT THE SCHOOL.

</details>

**学生代表**: 这是攻击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Student Representative**: Are attack.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 纽约市市长**埃里克·亚当斯**碰巧正要去白宫参加一个与特朗普总统的无关会议。亚当斯在社交媒体上表示，他向总统提出了逮捕事件。特朗普后来告诉他，她将被释放，她也确实被释放了。然而，**美国国土安全部 (DHS)**表示，她的驱逐案件仍在进行中，因为她没有有效的学生签证。DHS 还对哥伦比亚大学的说法提出了异议，称特工们佩戴了徽章并口头表明了身份。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: By total chance, New York City's mayors Oron Mandani happened to be on his way to the White House for an unrelated meeting with President Trump. in social media posts. Mdani said he raised the arrest with the president. Trump later told him she would be released and she was. The Department of Homeland Security, however, says her deportation case is still active because she does not have a valid student visa. DHS has also disputed Colombia's version of events, saying the agents were wearing badges and had verbally identified themselves.

</details>

**纽约州官员**: 这简直令人震惊。这震惊了良知。真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**NY Official**: It's simply shocking. It shocks the conscience. Truly,

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，一些纽约官员谴责了特工们以虚假名义进入学校的行为。纽约州州长**凯西·霍赫尔**在一份声明中表示：“没有人应该在政府手中消失。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: some New York officials, meanwhile, condemned the agents for entering school property under what they said were false pretenses. And in a statement, New York Governor Kathy Hokll said, quote, "No one should disappear at the hands of the government.

### 五角大楼激光击落无人机

**Tracy Mumford**: 在德克萨斯州，本月第二次，**FAA**因担心政府使用的高能激光而关闭了一片美国空域。**国防部**昨天使用该激光在**埃尔帕索**附近的一个边境小镇上空击落了一架无人机。这与 2 月初发生的情况非常相似，当时使用相同的技术击落了**海关和边境保护局**认为是无人机但实际上是气球的物体。这种激光是日益强大的反无人机技术的一个例子，引发了人们对如果该技术在商用飞机附近使用会发生什么的担忧。在这两种情况下，激光的使用均未经 FAA 批准，该机构随后出于谨慎立即关闭了附近空域。第一次是整个埃尔帕索机场不得不暂时关闭。批评人士说，这一事件暴露了政府内部的沟通不畅。而昨天使用激光的行为可能进一步加剧了这一点，因为《纽约时报》获悉，五角大楼击落的无人机是一架**美国政府无人机**。四位未经授权公开评论的人士表示，该无人机来自**国土安全部**。目前尚不清楚军方认为它瞄准的是什么，尽管联邦官员曾表示，近年来，贩毒集团已在边境附近飞行了数万架无人机。**FAA**、**国防部**和**海关和边境保护局**在一份联合声明中表示，他们将“继续努力加强合作与沟通，以防止未来发生此类事件”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Texas, for the second time this month, the FAA has closed a pocket of American airspace over concerns about a high energy laser that the government's been using. The Department of Defense used the laser yesterday to shoot down a drone over a small border town near El Paso. It's very similar to what happened in early February when the same technology was used to take down what Customs and Border Protection thought was a drone, but turned out to be a balloon. The lasers an example of increasingly powerful anti- drone technology that's raised concerns over what could happen if it's used near commercial airplanes. In both cases, the laser was used without the FAA's approval, and the agency then abruptly closed the nearby airspace out of caution. The first time the entire El Paso airport had to be temporarily shut down. Critics say the incident show a communication breakdown inside the government. And yesterday's use of the laser may underscore that further because the Times has learned that the drone the Pentagon shot down was a US government drone. Four people who were not authorized to speak publicly said it was from the Department of Homeland Security. It's not clear what the military thought it was aiming at, though federal officials have said that drug cartels have flown tens of thousands of drones near the border in recent years. In a joint statement, the FAA, Defense Department, and Customs and Border Protection said they would quote, "Continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future."

### AI冲击就业市场

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在硅谷，我们看到了一个迄今为止最明确的迹象，表明**人工智能**将如何彻底颠覆美国劳动力市场。金融科技公司**Block**，旗下拥有**Cash App**、流媒体服务**Title**以及你在全国各地商店都能看到的支付系统**Square**，宣布将裁员约 4000 人，占公司总人数的 40%。公司高管**杰克·多西**表示，这是因为 AI 使公司能够以更少的员工完成工作。他补充说：“在接下来的**一年**里，我相信大多数公司都会得出同样的结论并做出类似的结构性改变。”在整个科技行业，AI 编码工具已经开始能够自动化广泛的任务。宣布裁员后，多西与公司员工举行了虚拟全体会议。据参加会议的两人称，与会者在屏幕上刷满了“反对”表情符号。一名员工质问多西，为什么他那天要戴一顶写着“爱”的黑帽子。尽管公司内部一片愤怒，但在昨天的盘后交易中，Block 的股价上涨了 26% 以上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Silicon Valley yesterday, there was one of the clearest signs yet of how artificial intelligence is set to radically upend the American workforce. The financial technology company Block, which owns Cash App, the streaming service Title, and Square, the card payment system you see at stores across the country, announced it's cutting roughly 4,000 jobs. That's 40% of the company. The top executive, Jack Dorsey, said it's because AI has allowed the company to do its work with fewer employees. He added, quote, "Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. Across the tech industry, AI coding tools are already starting to be able to automate a wide range of tasks. After announcing the cuts, Dorsy held a virtual town hall with the company's employees. Participants flooded the screen with thumbsdown emojis, according to two people who were on the call, and one employee confronted Dorsy about why he'd chosen to show up that day wearing a black hat that said love on it. Despite the anger inside the company, in after hours trading yesterday, Block's share price jumped more than 26%.

### 华纳兄弟收购战新动态

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，价值数十亿美元的**好莱坞**大戏——收购**华纳兄弟**的争夺战，出现了一个新转折。整个事情基本上是一场混乱的三角恋。去年 12 月，**Netflix**向娱乐业投下重磅炸弹，表示将收购**华纳兄弟探索频道**（这家老牌电影制片厂和电视巨头）的大部分股份。但**派拉蒙**也想要它。现在派拉蒙提出了一个更好的报价，Netflix 正在退缩。这一最新转折为美国媒体界的一股重要新势力变得更加强大铺平了道路。派拉蒙由**大卫·埃里森**执掌，他的父亲是科技巨头**甲骨文**的亿万富翁创始人，并且与**特朗普总统**关系密切。埃里森去年接管了派拉蒙，并立即重组了其著名的**CBS**新闻部门，承诺使其更加“中间派”。他收购华纳兄弟的潜在交易还需要获得联邦监管机构的批准，也将使他负责**CNN**，数百万观众通过 CNN 获取新闻。总的来说，对于埃里森来说，这是一个多么大的故事弧线啊，他二十年前来到好莱坞想成为一名演员，现在却有望拥有整个新闻和娱乐产业的巨大份额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, the billiondoll Hollywood drama that is the fight to buy Warner Brothers has a new twist. The whole thing has basically been a big messy love triangle. Back in December, Netflix sent shock waves through the entertainment industry when it said it would acquire a large portion of Warner Brothers Discovery, the legacy movie studio and TV juggernaut. But Paramount wanted it, too. Now Paramount has put in an even better offer and Netflix is backing down. This latest turn paves the way for a major new force in US media to become even more powerful. Paramount is run by David Ellison, whose father is the billionaire founder of the tech giant Oracle and has close ties to President Trump. Ellison took control of Paramount last year and immediately shook up its storied news division at CBS, pledging it would become more centrist. His potential acquisition of Warner Brothers, which will need the approval of federal regulators, would also put him in charge of CNN, where millions more people get their news. Overall, it is quite the story arc for Ellison, who came to Hollywood two decades ago trying to be an actor and is now poised to own a massive chunk of the entire news and entertainment industry.

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周，**特朗普总统**发表了马拉松式的国情咨文，吹嘘他的领导力并抨击民主党人。民主党人也准备好了他们的反击。我们将进行一轮快速问答，关于民主党人采取的三种回应方式。首先，一小群议员试图通过集体穿着某种颜色来传递信息。答案是白色。这是对妇女选举权运动的致敬，也是对特朗普当前推动新的投票限制措施的象征性抗议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This week, President Trump gave a marathon length State of the Union speech, touting his leadership and slamming Democrats. The Democrats were ready with their push back. We're going to do a speed round here on three ways Democrats mounted a response. First, a small group of lawmakers tried to send a message by all coming dressed in this color. The answer, white. It was a nod to the suffrage movement and a symbol of protest against Trump's current push for new voting restrictions.

**Tracy Mumford**: And last one, the governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, gave the Democratic Party's official rebuttal, hitting on a particular theme that is expected to dominate this year's midterm elections. Can you fill in the blank? Is the president working to make life more for you and your family?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 美国男子冰球队，他们在演讲中被特朗普提及了他们的奥运胜利。这支球队的队员们本周实际上成为了意想不到的政治新闻的中心，尤其是在一位政府机构负责人被拍到在更衣室里与他们一起庆祝，并在他们赢得金牌后畅饮啤酒之后。您的问题是，这位美国官员是谁？答案是：**FBI**局长，他本人就是一名冰球运动员，也是一位铁杆粉丝，**卡什·帕特尔**。帕特尔为前往观看比赛辩护，称部分原因是为了监督奥运安保，但批评人士认为这是纳税人资金又一次可疑的使用。去年，帕特尔使用政府专机飞往德克萨斯州的一个私人狩猎场、一个苏格兰高尔夫度假村，以及宾夕法尼亚州，他的女友在那里（她是一名乡村歌手）在一场摔跤比赛中表演。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The US men's hockey team whose Olympic victory Trump called out in his speech. The players have actually been at the center of an unexpected number of political stories this week, especially after the head of a government agency was filmed celebrating in the locker room with them, cheering and chugging a beer after they won gold. Your question, which US official was that? The answer, the head of the FBI, who is a hockey player himself and a big-time fan, Cash Patel. Patel has defended making the trip to the games in Italy, saying it was in part to help oversee Olympic security, but critics say it's just the latest in a string of questionable uses of taxpayer funds. Last year, Patel used a government jet to fly to a private hunting ranch in Texas, a Scottish golf resort, and to Pennsylvania, where his girlfriend, who's a country singer, was performing at a wrestling match.
