### 全球伦理盘点的意义

**艾尔·戈尔**: 非常荣幸能与**万吉拉**和**卡琳娜**在这里交流。我希望你们能想象，能与卡琳娜以及万吉拉在一起对我来说是多么愉快。我们认识很久了，万吉拉曾去过我位于纳什维尔的家。我们今天在这里是为了讨论**全球伦理盘点**（Global Ethical Stocktake）。这是 **COP 30** 提出的一项新倡议，坦率地说，我认为早就该有人想到了。统计消耗了多少桶石油、多少吨煤是一回事，但衡量我们在“对与错”的光谱上表现如何，才是世界在试图解决气候危机时面临的核心挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: And it's such an honor to be here with Wanjira and Cora. I hope you can imagine what a pleasure it is for me to be here with Karena, but also with Wanjira. We've known each other for so long. Wera's been in my home in Nashville. And uh we're here to talk about the global ethical stock take. This is a new initiative in COP 30 that frankly in my view somebody should have thought of a long time ago. Taking stock of how many barrels of oil and how many tons of coal that's one thing. But taking stock of how we're doing on the spectrum of right versus wrong is really at the heart of the challenge that the world faces in attempting to solve the climate crisis.

</details>

**艾尔·戈尔**: 这确实是一项开创性的倡议。在经历了 28 届气候大会后，才终于提到了“**化石燃料**”这个词。但既然已经提到了，焦点正在迅速增强。万吉拉和卡琳娜，你们两位担任了全球伦理盘点的共同召集人，分别协助收集来自**非洲**和**北美**的意见。所以我想先请教两位，从你们的角度来看，为什么这次全球伦理盘点对于正在柏林进行的谈判如此重要？万吉拉，你先请？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: It is it is really a groundbreaking initiative and it took 28 cops before the phrase fossil fuel was ever even mentioned. But now that it's been mentioned the focus is really intensifying. So Wera and Karina you two have served as co-conveners of the global ethical stock tag helping to gather input from Africa and North America respectively. So I'd like to start by asking you both, each one of you for your perspective on what makes this global ethical stock take so important to the negotiations underway here in Berlin. Wer, why don't you start?

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 非常感谢。很高兴能再次与你在一起，也很高兴能在内罗毕见到你。这周我们一直在讨论这个问题，感觉非常好。全球伦理盘点在很多方面，在我看来，就像是一次**重置**。昨天，**劳伦斯·图比亚纳**提醒我们，当“1.5度目标”被写入《巴黎协定》时，是多亏了**公民社会**和人民的力量。但随着时间的推移，人民变得越来越边缘化，技术性讨论占据了主导，现在是时候进行重置了。**玛丽娜·席尔瓦**凭借她的智慧决定本届 COP 将以此为核心。我们要记住，她非常有勇气，在世界各地召集了五次盘点会议。她参加了大部分会议，并在整整一年的过程中将**正义**置于核心地位，她表示本届 COP 审视解决方案的视角必须是伦理性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: Thank you so much. It's great to be here with you again. It was wonderful to have you in Nairobi. Wonderful to see every we've had a great time this week talking exactly about that. Um the global ethical stockic in many ways in my mind is like a reset. Yesterday we were reminded by Lance Tobiana that when the 1.5 degree um statement was placed into the Paris agreement it was thanks to civil society. It was thanks to the people and over time that has become people have become more and more peripheral. The tech the the technical has taken over and it's time for a reset. In her wisdom, Marina Silva decided that this would be the cup. And let's remember, she was courageous to actually convene five stock takes across the world. I think she attended most of them and center justice in the process over a whole year said that this will be the COP where the lens through which we see solutions will have to be ethical

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 如果我们将伦理问题和价值观视为事后才考虑的东西，我们就无法解决气候危机。对我来说，这就是一切，因为这意味着我们必须以人为中心。我们必须以**原住民**、地方社区以及那些受影响最深的人为中心。我开始喜欢“**全球多数**”（Global Majority）这个概念，即那些受影响最严重、但责任最小的绝大多数人。我们不能忽视这一点，这也让我们在这里的表现更加坚定。还要记住，我们即将迎来在南非举行的 **G20** 峰会，这是第一次在非洲举行。他们将感受到我们的冲击，因为我们将不断讨论并始终将这一问题置于核心地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: and that we cannot address the climate crisis if we make ethical issues and values an afterthought. For me that's everything because in that coded in that is that we have to center people. We have to center indigenous people, local communities, those who are most affected. I I'm starting to like the thought of the global majority that the most impacted large majority of those who've done the least that we cannot ignore that and that also made us a lot fiercer about how we show up here and also remember we are moving on to G the G20 in South Africa the very first time it's being held in Africa. They will not believe what will hit them just because we will be talking about this issue and centering it constantly.

### 北美视角：道德失调与精神维度

**艾尔·戈尔**: 太棒了。说得好。卡琳娜？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: Fantastic. Well said, Cora.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 谢谢 TED Countdown House。能参与全球伦理盘点对我来说是巨大的荣幸。我很高兴能和我的父亲在一起，也很荣幸能与万吉拉同行，她是一位了不起的世界领袖，我从你身上学到了很多。我不是 COP 的内部人士，没有参加过每一届会议并追踪每一个动向。我一直任职于**地球伦理中心**（Center for Earth Ethics），去年是我们成立 10 周年。我们从世界各地的信仰和智慧传统中汲取力量来面对生态危机，探索气候的**道德与精神维度**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: Well, um, thank you so much to Ted Countdown House. Uh, and, uh, I want to say that this is a great honor for me to be a part of the global ethical stocktake. Um, I am delighted to be here with with my father. I'm I'm so happy and honored to be in the company of oneai who's such a wonderful leader in the world. Um, and I've learned a lot from you. Thank you. And um, I am not a cop insider. I haven't been somebody that's been at all the cops and and following every single move of it. I have been at the Center for Earth Ethics, which had our 10-year anniversary last year. and we draw from the world's faith and wisdom traditions to face the ecological crisis and we explore the moral and spiritual dimensions of of climate and um so when this was announced as an idea the global ethical stock take it was a great deal of excitement and I have to say that picking up on on what each of you has said it feels like the time is so ripe um and this is the missing piece.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 正如你所说，在经历了 29 届 COP 之后，我们知道问题所在，也知道该怎么做，但从数据、科学和技术中，我们并不一定知道“如何”去做。为了知道“如何”，我们需要知道“为什么”。我深切感受到，有时人们对这个过程失去信心，是因为“为什么”似乎变成了维持现状——维持那些极度不公平、少数人囤积物质财富、以及人类与我们进化而来的自然世界、文化、社区和深层价值观持续脱节的系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: Um there after 29 cops, as you've said, we know what the problem is and we know what we need to do about it, but we don't necessarily from the data and the science and the technology know how to do that. And in order to know the how, we need to know the why. And it really strikes me that sometimes people lose faith in this process because it seems as if the why is about sustaining current systems that are very inequitable that um that involve a hoarding of material wealth by by the few. Um that involve a a continued disassociation from the natural world that we evolved in from our cultures, our communities, our deepest values.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 因此，如果通过全球伦理盘点，我们不仅能面对痛苦、死亡和损失这些**道德风险**——有些人抱怨这是“末日论”，但在伦理盘点的视角下，我们不必争论是乐观还是悲观，只需看清赌注是什么。这些选择将产生后果。另一件事是审视“**道德关怀圈**”是如何划定的。在伦理学中，关怀圈的划定取决于谁在制定伦理以及伦理应用于什么。如果应用于整个地球，我们需要看到，那些受气候危机影响最深的人，往往在决策中话语权最小，且最不可能是造成这些伤害系统的始作俑者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: And so if through the global ethical stock take we can really face not only the the the moral stakes in terms of of of the suffering and the death and the loss that actually will occur. Some people complain that's doom but it's actually in the lens of the global ethical stock take. We don't have to have that conversation. Is it doom? Is it optimism? Is it pessimism? It's just what the stakes are. It's doing a moral ethical stock take. these choices will have consequences. And I think that the other thing that we can do is look at issues of uh how one draws a a circle of moral concern. It's one of the things that happens in ethics. You know, there's different types of ethics, professional ethics, so on. The way the circle of moral concern is drawn depends on who's doing the ethics and what the ethics are applied to. applied to the whole earth. We need to look at the fact that those who are most impacted by the climate crisis are simultaneously those that are least likely to have uh a say in the decisions that are being made um and least likely to have caused the the systems that are causing the harm.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 对于这三类群体：世界上的贫困和边缘化人群、后代以及所有非人类生命，我们需要让他们在场。全球伦理盘点一直在做这件事，它不断照亮这些角落。此外，我们还必须讨论**问责制**。在联合神学院（Union Theological Seminary），人们在开始上课前会先说：“你对谁负责？”起初我觉得这有点让人不适，但后来我理解了，这反映了你的意识和存在。我们很早就指出，化石燃料行业的参与是一个问题。划定道德关怀圈、通过透明度了解人们对谁负责，并连接我们的深层价值观，这使得全球伦理盘点成为当下最正确的平台和力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: And so for those three, the poor and marginalized people of the world, future generations, all non-human life, we need to keep that present in the room. the global ethical stocktake has has done that. It does that. It shines that light constantly even knowing that it's here. And so that makes a difference. And then we also have to ask about accountability. Um you know at Union Theological Seminary where I where the center for ethics is based there was a way in which people began uh classes when I first went there by saying who are you accountable to? Say your name and who are you accountable to? And at first I thought that was kind of off-putting, but I understood it after a little while. It's actually very real. It's it's it's uh it explains your something about your consciousness and presence. And so it was named early on that the the fossil fuel industry's participation was a problem. And I think that drawing a circle of moral concern, understanding who people are accountable to with that type of transparency and connecting to our deepest values makes the global ethical stocktake exactly the right platform, vortex, force uh for this moment and I'm so happy to be a part of it.

### 非洲：从受害者到解决方案的中心

**艾尔·戈尔**: 非常感谢。一直以来被亏待的群体之一就是**全球南方**。万吉拉，你来自全球南方，二十年来一直是非洲最杰出的领袖之一。顺便说一句，我看到你登上了《福布斯非洲》的封面，也是《时代》杂志全球百大影响力人物之一。非洲是增长最快的大陆，拥有全球 60% 的优质太阳能资源，却仅获得了全球 2% 的气候融资。这就是卡琳娜提到的某些人试图维持的结构。但我们的目标是对地球上所有人负责，包括后代和非人类生命。在这种背景下，非洲一直在以独特且充满活力的方式做出回应，而世界其他地方并不总能理解。作为非洲的领袖，你如何看待非洲的回应？世界其他地方能从中学习到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: Thank you. Thank you very much. So, [applause] one of the groups that has been um shortch changed, I don't know quite what the right word is, is the global south. Uh and Wera, you you come from the global south. You've been one of the most distinguished leaders uh in Africa for two decades now. By the way, I happen to see you on the cover of Forbes Africa as the co cover lady and uh one of Time's most uh [applause] one of Time magazine's most 100 most influential people in the world. So, you're really you're you're cleaning up here. Uh but Africa has uh fastest growing continent. uh a and it it has 60% of the prime solar resources in the world but gets only 2% of the climate finance that is allocated in the world. uh and that is part of the structures that you said Karen some people are trying to keep them in place but really our objective is to be accountable to all the people of the earth including future generations including non-human life so in the midst of this h Africa has been responding in its own energetic and unique way and it's not always seen and understood in the rest of the world how as one of the great leaders in Africa how has Africa been responding to this and um what could the rest of the world learn from the way Africa is now responding?

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 这是一个非常好的问题。我们刚参加完在亚的斯亚贝巴举行的非洲气候峰会。**埃塞俄比亚**做出了一个自觉的决定，立即淘汰化石燃料汽车。这并不是因为他们是排放大国——他们不是——而是因为这符合经济逻辑。埃塞俄比亚电网中 90% 是可再生能源，他们决定投资于自己拥有的能源。非洲有机会利用这些机遇**跨越式**进入未来，而不是投资于过去。这种变化正在埃塞俄比亚发生，许多国家和政府也在投资本地制造业，以增加对可再生能源的需求。这一切都在发生，无论别人怎么说，甚至是在任何悲观情绪中。非洲故事现在最重要的一点是，人们正忙于艰苦的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: That's a really good question because we just came out of the Africa climate summit in Addis um a country that has made a conscious decision to phase out immediately fossil fuel vehicles that is Ethiopia deciding that actually it's not because they are emitters cuz they're not but it's because it makes economic sense. This is a country with 90% renewable energy in the grid. They said, "Let's invest in the energy we have." The forces and the the the opportunities are aligned for Africa to leverage and leap into the future and not invest in the past because it it makes more sense for us. And there you're seeing that happening in Ethiopia. You're seeing countries and governments investing in local manufacturing, local opportunities to increase demand for for renewable energy. This is all happening despite what others are saying. Actually, it's in spite of any doom and gloom. They're so busy doing the hard work. And this is what's really important about the African story right now.

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: “**共同但有区别的责任**”必须保留，这也是非洲全球伦理盘点的核心。但紧随其后的是，要将非洲视为解决方案的枢纽。如果不释放非洲的可再生能源、关键矿产以及最年轻且增长最快的劳动力，世界就无法解决气候危机。这些是未来的资源。如果我们对自己诚实，要实现深度脱碳，就必须将一些重工业和数据中心转移到拥有 90% 可再生能源的地方。这些正是非洲正在努力、投资并发出政治信号的机遇。我们要做的不是过去的生意，而是未来的生意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: The the common but differentiated responsibilities must remain and it was centered in the Africa global ethical stockic. But immediately after that was the opportunity to see Africa not as a challenge but as a at the hub and the center of solutions that actually the world will not address the climate crisis without Africa unlocking its renewable energy resources its uh in the the critical minerals that are responsible for the renewable energy and the fastest and youngest growing workforce. These are the resources of the future. They will be the opportunities to decarbonize deeply. If we are honest with ourselves to deeply decarbonize, you will have to move some of these real industries, data centers to places where there's 90% renewable energy. Those are the opportunities Africa is working on, investing in and creating the political opportunity and sending political signals that that is the business we want to do. The business of the future and not the business of the past.

### 应对结构性邪恶与化石燃料殖民主义

**艾尔·戈尔**: 太棒了。非洲领导人峰会对我很有启发。卡琳娜向我介绍了美国的**威廉·巴伯二世**牧师，他经常引用圣经中的一句话：匠人所弃的石头，已成了房角的头块石头。非洲现在正处于可能成为世界真正领袖的地位。你提到了埃塞俄比亚，肯尼亚、赞比亚也在取得巨大进步。尼日利亚作为非洲最大的国家，终于取消了柴油补贴，结果那里的太阳能板热潮令世界震惊。卡琳娜告诉我，她参加了你们的非洲伦理盘点，告诉我最后**库米·奈杜**（Kumi Naidoo）做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: Yeah, fantastic. And the the African leaders uh summits have been quite inspiring to me. Karina introduced me to Reverend William Barber III in the US who often the second sorry you also introduced me to his son [laughter] but uh but uh William Barber II often quotes a line from scripture and my faith tradition about the stone that was rejected by the builder which then becomes the keystone in the new architect's design and Africa is now in a place where it might become become one of the real leaders in the world. You you you mentioned Ethiopia, Kenya's also making great progress. Zambia is making great progress. Nigeria, the biggest country in Africa finally eliminated the subsidies for diesel and as a result the incredible boom in solar panels there is just startling the world. So and and Karen was telling me also she was at your Africa stock take and tell me what happened at the end with Kumi Nadu.

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 非洲伦理盘点的一大特点是，它没有花太多时间讨论别人必须为我们做什么，而是提醒人们，非洲不会被赤字定义，而是被我们能为自己做的事定义。但我们也强调，脱碳和淘汰化石燃料是绝对的道德义务。库米·奈杜站起来，面对 COP 主席团说，如果你们是认真的，既然我们在这里进行全球伦理盘点，你们就必须正视这个问题，因为淘汰化石燃料是**不可谈判**的。现在，玛丽娜·席尔瓦甚至正在领导 COP 30 制定淘汰化石燃料的路线图。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: Well you know one as we said a lot of what and I I liked this about the Africa stocktake. It's it didn't spend a lot of time on what others must do for us. It spent a lot of time reminding people that Africa will not be defined by the deficits, but by what we can actually do for ourselves, but that there is an absolute moral obligation to decarbonize and phase out fossil fuels. Yeah. So Kumidu and everybody who knows him knows that he's now leading the non-prololiferation treaty stood up and faced the COP presidency because we had President Korea there, we had Anna Tony there and of course we had Marina Silva and said if you as the COP presidency are serious and here we are the global ethical stopake, you must take this issue on head on because the phase out of fossil fuels is non-negotiable. And now and now Marina even right now this morning is leading the effort at COP 30 to to develop a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels.

</details>

**艾尔·戈尔**: 卡琳娜，你共同领导了北美伦理盘点。但在 COP 30 现场，大家避而不谈的问题是美国的缺席和退出《巴黎协定》。美国仍是最大的历史排放源，负有道德义务。在缺乏政府领导的情况下，美国人现在是如何应对气候问题的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: So I'm so glad that both of you were there when that happened. Now Karena, you co-led the North American uh ethical stock take which comprises not just the United States but also Canada and Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda, uh some island nations. But the elephant in the room here at COP 30 is of course the US absence and the US departure from the Paris agreement. US is still the largest historic source. China will soon rec claim that title but the US has a moral obligation to weigh in. Uh what is your take now on how Americans are contending with the climate issue in the absence of any leadership from the the US government?

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 我认为美国正处于一个特殊的时刻。我们能感受到一种强烈的**认知失调**，这种失调不可能永远持续下去。人们的经历——热浪、风暴、干旱、野火，以及低收入社区和有色人种社区承受的严重污染——与现状之间存在巨大的鸿沟。大多数美国人对目前的生活方式、文化和社会深感不满，充满了焦虑。这种失调被我们的分心文化、屏幕和消费主义所加剧。但我认为这种情况即将改变，因为这种失调在长期内是不可持续的。黎明前总是最黑暗的，对气候危机的否认、对贪婪和自私的拥抱，正在从更深层次催化一些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: Well, I think the United States of America is going through a a moment. Um [laughter] uh we all know ourselves, our friends. Sometimes people have those times. they're just going through something and then um hopefully come back stronger than ever. And I think that um there one thing I would name is that and obviously so diverse uh to to talk about what Americans are thinking is very difficult. But I would say that I sense so much dissonance uh in the United States of America that feels like it can't possibly continue forever. You know, um dissonance between people's uh experience. We've had these in talking about climate, we've had these uh heat waves and stronger storms and droughts and wildfires and um and also people live with a lot of the pollution. Of course, that is that is situated largely in low-income communities and in in communities of color and uh and and that is a big part of the story. But by and large, it feels to me like many Americans are deeply unhappy with the lifestyle, with the culture, with the society. There's so much there's a lot of anxiety and um and I would say of course that has socioeconomic uh dimensions to it and it's not fair, but it seems rather across the board honestly. Um, and I think that the dissonance um is so stoked by our culture of distraction and screens and you know to be it's not it's not incidental to the climate crisis obviously that that so often we're in we're we're just people spend 90 I think the statistic is something like 90% of time indoors and then on that you know much of it on screens and um there there's so much uh emphasis on consumerism and commodification of everything And so I feel that um that uh the way in which Americans are processing this um is about to change because the dissonance is not tenable in the long term. Um I think things you know there's that saying darkest before dawn things get so bad. there's a distillation of this idea of of of denial of the climate crisis of an embrace of greed and selfishness um and and materialistic values and and so on. And I think that um that in some way it's catalyzing something on a deeper level.

</details>

### 伦理盘点：从法律到道德的飞跃

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 全球伦理盘点是一个绝佳的机会，让我们挖掘那些能代表这个国家最好一面的声音。例如，1991 年在华盛顿举行的第一次全国有色人种环境会议，提出了 **17 条环境正义原则**。第一条原则就谈到了地球母亲和生命的生态统一。这不仅关乎正义和公平，也关乎对我们生活在这个生命星球上的现实的觉醒。我们还以**易洛魁联盟**（Haudenosaunee）的感恩致辞开启了北美伦理盘点。这种古老的文化对美国的建国产生了深远影响，比如权力制衡的概念。但易洛魁人会说，我们遗漏了两件事：**自然**和**女性**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: And I can I'll stop there and just say the global ethical stock take um was a really wonderful opportunity to look at uh it was North America as you say it wasn't only the United States of America but within the United States of America we have a lot of deep legacies and lineages and heritage to work with um and to dig deeper and to find those voices that can represent uh from what that um what the best that's happened in that country is was such a pleasure and an honor. And so just to give an example um we uh so the environmental justice movement I mentioned before about the location of of the toxic sites and where most people are experiencing the impacts. Um in 1991 there was the first national people of color uh conference on the environment in Washington DC and it was convened pe uh by actually the United Church of Church of Christ played a role in this. Um but there was a and they had done this study in 1987 called toxic waste and race which tracked and mapped and this is where data is very important you know to this movement um that this was that that was being dumped in um in in mainly black and indigenous communities toxic waste and the smoke stacks and so on. So the 1991 conference came up with the 17 principles of environmental justice. And right in talking to the people that were there and the leaders of the environmental justice movement in the United States which include Robert Bullard and Benjamin Chavis and Peggy Shepard and uh others um there was a realization that they all remembered. Yeah, we went to Rio right after we went to Rio in 1992. And wasn't that amazing that all of the UNFC and all of these conferences started there and there were conversations that were already they already knew about what we were talking about. The very first principle of of um of and of the 17 principles talks about mother earth ecological unity of life. You know it is about justice and fairness and it's also about a expanded consciousness of where we are of the reality that we're living in on this living planet. So to have the voices from and somewhere in the official and some in the self-organized from this the the environmental justice movement in the United States that comes from a deep place that's very American and it's not just about you know the the face that we're showing to the world on the biggest stage right now. It's about the depth. And I think I'd also like to mention two other quick things which is one is you know we we opened uh we were able to open with the Hodnoni better known as the Irakcoy um Thanksgiving address uh which is often called the worlds before all else. We had Sophia Palace Anandaga young woman um give this address and before and this is ancient from a culture that is indigenous to that region um and was very influential actually on the founding of the United States in many ways. So some of the key concepts that made their way into the US Constitution checks and balances for example three brand that came from the Hosoni Confederacy of the six nations of the Irakcoy. So to have but but they will say that we left out uh this is what Hodnosi people would say we left out two things we left out nature and women.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 感恩致辞是向自然界的所有生命致谢：风、太阳、水、浆果、鱼、鸟。这正是我们所缺乏的意识。我成长过程中对美国人身份有一种非常理想化的看法，认为我们摆脱了殖民者。但到了某个阶段我意识到：等一下，我们就是**殖民者**。这种复杂性正是全球伦理盘点的精髓。它不是为了让你感到内疚或羞耻，而是为了展示另一种道路，并走上那条路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: So we opened the um the global ethical society North America with the Thanksgiving address with Sophia Palace. And what it is, it's acknowledging and thanking all of the beings of the natural world. The winds, the sun, the waters, the berries, the fish, the birds. I mean, I'm sorry. Forgive me for paraphrasing this way. I'm just trying to communicate it quickly. Please don't mean to be disrespectful, but just to convey that this is the consciousness that we lack. And you've seen with this, you know, I don't want to call it a trend. I think there's something quite serious and heartfelt about it with land acknowledgements which are very, very important. And I've always felt that there's something in there of that yearning. You know, it is about what was unfair in the past and who who did [clears throat] something wrong and the loss that hasn't been acknowledged and the pain, but it's also about the land actually where we are. So to begin with that Thanksgiving address to have a a moderator who was Tyino was the first people to encounter Christopher Columbus. There's a lot of of Tyino rooted people in New York City because they're Puerto Ricans. Uh, and and so, um, anyway, I'm saying these broad brush strokes, but I just I'll close, but I just want to say, you know, grow as an American growing up the way I did, um, which was a little bit vicarious, campaign trail politics, so exposed to the political culture, the electoral process, very much with a extremely idealistic view of who we are, who we were are as Americans. And um and you know it's at a certain point in in and this is before this current administration I had this realization through you know education of various kinds not just in higher institution education places but in but life that you know I grew up thinking gosh we're so great as Americans because we threw off the colonizers you know we got rid of colonization it's so great that's who we are and then at a certain point I was like wait a minute we are the colonizers [laughter] right uh oh And the complexities of that are of the essence of a global ethical stock take. It's not that simple. And to be able to look internally and then to be able to use this this modality of this of this global ethical stock take they call it the balanso the balance. I love how they call that in Portuguese. Um is actually not just to you don't need to feel guilty and shame and all of that primarily just demonstrate the other way. walk the other way. And I think that's what we're being given the chance to do. And I saw and I learned that so much from you, Wera, as well.

### 新殖民主义与问责制

**艾尔·戈尔**: 殖民主义这个词被提出来了。在非洲，殖民历史依然是一个必须面对的重要遗产。万吉拉，这如何影响着非洲的前进道路？

**Al Gore**: Colonization has come up. Yeah. And one of the many uh legacies that complicates our path forward now is the history of colonization in in Africa. some of the uh long-running conflicts in Africa really were not there prior to colonization when different groups were pitted against one another. How is that still an important legacy that must be addressed uh in in Africa?

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 很有趣，我母亲那一代人比我们这一代人更痴迷于讨论殖民主义。我们现在更多地将目光和责任要求转向**领导层**。因为权力已经交到了他们手中，我们必须提醒他们，今天我们面临的许多挣扎并不完全归咎于殖民主义。虽然基础可能是在那时奠定的，但我们的领导人延续了剥削、排斥和通过自肥使人民贫困的遗产。在肯尼亚，人口平均年龄只有 19 岁，80% 的人不到 35 岁。他们没有时间为过去感到痛苦，他们在展望未来并要求政府负责。

**Wanjira Mathai**: You know, it's it's so interesting because I think my mother's generation obsessed more about colonization than than my generation does. M and it's interesting to see that because we are turning our eyes and our demands for responsibility on the leadership because our governance systems are responsible for the next phase. It is to them that power was handed. We remind them and it a lot of what we struggle with today is not thanks always to colonization alone. The foundations may have been set and they were, but we have leaders who have continued the legacy of exploitation. We have leaders who have continued to exclude and and to impoverish by enriching themselves. We're calling them out. I don't know how many people know that a country like Kenya, the average age of Kenyans today is 19 years old. Wow. 80% are under the age of 35. They have no time to agonize about what may have happened. They're looking into the future and they're holding governments accountable. We have young people who have been lost their lives challenging governance systems and saying no, we shall not be exploited by our own people.

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 现在的重点是领导力。我们没有多少时间了，必须进行经济转型。我们不能在贫困中进行气候适应。贫困是可持续发展目标（SDG）的第一位是有原因的。当人们处于生存边缘时，无论什么样的帮助到来，你依然在边缘。所以这与过去的对话完全不同，因为现在的年轻人正看着他们的领导人说：“钥匙在你们手里，为什么现状还是这样？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: So I think the the current obsession is on leadership. We don't have much time. We've got to transform economically. We cannot adapt against poverty. And poverty is the number one SDG for a reason. We've got to focus on ensuring that people are not the hungriest and the poorest and facing the most dramatic impacts of climate change. When you are on the edge, it doesn't matter what sort of help comes, you're on the edge. And so I think it is a completely different conversation than we've had in the past because when you have young people who are looking for jobs today who are looking at their leaders and saying you have the keys, how come it's still this way? So there's a bit of a different conversation now.

</details>

**艾尔·戈尔**: 但如果我坚持一下“殖民主义”这个词，非洲的一些活动家使用了“**化石燃料殖民主义**”这个短语。在全球金融系统中，资金分配仍带有旧时代的烙印。非洲拥有最好的太阳能潜力，却只得到了 2% 的投资。这是不是一种“**新殖民主义**”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: Yeah. But but if I could persist a little bit on the on the the the word colonization, some of our mutual friends who are activists in Africa use the phrase fossil fuel uh colonialism with I mean in the developing world as a whole uh 100% of the increased global warming pollution emissions in the years ahead will be from developing countries. Yet developing countries only get 18% of the fossil fuel of the finance for the sustain for the green revolution. Uh a and yet they get almost half of the finance for building yet more fossil fuel facilities and the resource curse that Nigeria and many other nations in Africa have suffered. So the global fin system for allocating capital still has a legacy from an earlier era. A and is that now changing in Africa?

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 我会说，我们正在使用“新殖民主义”来定义这些借用了剥削和排斥模式的新结构。化石燃料行业绝对是其中之一。我们拥有 60% 的太阳能潜力，为什么不投资呢？我问过一位负责“损失与损害基金”谈判的朋友，她说该基金目前获得的资金不到需求的 1%。这就是我们必须解决的不正义，这就是新殖民主义，因为资源显然没有流向需要它们的地方。这些正是全球伦理盘点所关注的核心问题。

<details>

**Wanjira Mathai**: I would say, you know, we then are using neoc colonialism to define some of these new structures that have borrowed the patterns of exploitation, patterns of exclusion and definitely the the fossil fuel industry is one because we know we have 60% of the world's best solar potential. Why not invest in that? Like you said, 2% of investments in solar. Why? I called my friend who is a negotiator for Botswana here on loss and damage and I said I'm going to be speaking about global ethical issues. How are we doing on the loss and damage fund especially given the realities of the storms that we've seen horrific Jamaica 30% of their GDP wiped out in that storm. We couldn't possibly be waiting for more evidence that the loss and damage fund needs investment. She wrote back that it has less than 1% of what's needed. That is the injustice we've got to be addressing. That is the neoc colonialism because wherever those funds are being because we're told the resources are there but they're clearly not going where they need to go. And those are the real issues that are being centered here by the global ethical stockic. And that's the colonialism if you want to use that word. But we have to distinguish it and say it's new because it's these new forms that are being inspired by the patterns of extraction and exclusion.

### 伦理盘点的未来：从倡议到永久机制

**艾尔·戈尔**: 去年全球 93% 的新增发电装机是可再生能源，但其中 75% 的资金来自私人投资者，且大部分流向了富裕国家。伦理盘点如何帮助我们将焦点重新转回到淘汰化石燃料这一首要任务上？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: So um the the money that's needed for the sustainability transition is sometimes uh sometimes the focus is on uh government to government aid. But in in reality, if you look at, you know, last year, 93% of all the new electricity generation installed worldwide was uh solar, solar and wind and renewables. Uh but it's unevenly distributed. Uh and where did the money come from for that? By the way, 75% of the money came from private investors, but most of that went to the rich countries and not to the developing countries where it's most needed. The emissions reduction that can come from building new solar and wind and batteries and EVs etc. in developing countries reduces emissions. Uh there are three times as many opportunities there. And I know that out of the global ethical stock take, partly from uh Africa, partly from North America, uh came this number one priority that I've heard Marina emphasize, which is let's get back to the priority of phasing out fossil fuels. And this has come up in it came up in the North American stock take as well. How how do we do that? How can a focus on the difference between right and wrong, a focus on the ethics of the decisions we're making help us get there?

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 我认为它正在发挥作用。正如艾达·贝尔·韦尔斯所说，纠正错误的方法是向它们投射真理之光。伦理透镜本身就具有影响力。伦理本质上是区分对错及其对我们行为的影响。当一种深切感受到且广泛共享的对错感与现行法律和社会规范脱节时，伦理的力量最为强大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: Well, I think it is helping us. The uh IWL said the way to what write wrongs is to shine the light of truth upon them. And I do sense that even the fact that this light is shining is making a difference. I mean, we know there are a lot of fossil fuel lobbyists at this cop, more than ever, I'm told. So, that hasn't changed. But I do think that knowing that there is an ethical lens is uh is itself has an effect. Um, and I would say that you know, yes, the the the difference ethics is essentially the difference between right and wrong and the implications for our behavior. um as individuals and collectives and um it is most powerful uh when there is a deeply felt and more and more widely shared sense of right and wrong that's out of step with both laws and social norms and most

</details>

**艾尔·戈尔**: 如果我可以简短打断一下，卡琳娜在过去十年里成了我的主要老师之一。这种普遍的对错理解与法律政策之间的差异，我们在民权运动和反种族隔离运动中都见过，现在我们在气候问题上也看到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: if I if I could interrupt briefly this is Ka's become one of my principal teachers by the way over the last 10 years that she's been doing this and so when you look just I'm sorry to interrupt you but this this difference between the general understanding of right and wrong as it has evolved. Uh the difference between that and what the laws and policies tell us is right and wrong. We saw that in the civil rights movement. We saw that in anti-apartid and now we're seeing it in the in the climate issue.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 是的。我们要面对的事实是，造成气候危机的大部分行为在法律上是完美的，甚至是社会鼓励和财务补贴的。这里有一个伦理学概念叫“**结构性邪恶**”（Structural Evil）。它的一个关键特征是它极易伪装成“善”。化石燃料行业之所以能继续发展，是因为他们提出了道德主张，声称是为了发展、为了结束能源贫困。这与事实严重不符。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: Yeah. So one of the things that we have to face up to is that most of what is causing the climate crisis is perfectly legal and even socially encouraged. Right? So and financially subsidized is is is a reflection of those things. So it's not it's also important I think there's a concept that from um ethics that I think is useful here called from structural evil. this woman Cynthia Mo Lebeda who was at Union Theological Seminary drawing on the work of sorry to be so academic [laughter] um of Dietrich Bonhofer who uh was at Union and he actually went back to his native Germany to oppose Hitler back uh during the Third Reich and was uh executed by the Nazis. So he has some moral authority as well as having been this this theologian. And so one she talks about the elements of structural evil. One of the key characteristics is that it easily masquerades as good. So when you look at why fossil fuel development continues to be uh in there, it's because they make a moral claim. They don't they don't they don't, you know, abandon the idea of of moral claim. They say it's for development. It's for ending energy poverty. It's for and this is so dissonant with the facts that as we know them that we have the renewable energy uh capability. people uh have worked very hard including yourself on getting that financing, getting that technology up to speed and so on. So it's becoming untenable to make that false moral claim um that that somehow uh this fossil fuel development and continuing that is going to be um good for the world. Uh but they're still trying and which makes the global ethical stock take all the more important.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 宇宙不是物体的集合，而是**主体间的共融**（A communion of subjects）。这是托马斯·贝里的一句话。我们往往认为人类与自然是分离的，这才是最深层的病根。其他生物是我们的亲属，而不仅仅是供我们消费和榨取的资源。我们的物种智慧正在接受审判，除非我们汲取其他形式的智慧，否则我们将无法度过难关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: So I think that um bringing this lens and bringing this modality and as it came up I can say in the North America diagonal it came up in several ways. One of the one of the ways it did was that um Robert Bullard who was from as I said in the in the environmental justice movement who was in that 17 principles he said the very last thing he said in his thing he said just basically stop the fossil fuels. He said that this is really the main thing to do. Um and it came up in uh in the idea of fossil fuel non-prololiferation treaty from Sapora Burman. It came up um from David Suzuki and Fletcher Harper to get rid of the lobbyists in the COP. It it came up in in many ways. So there's no way with the president of the COP uh sitting there and and the leadership and also Selwin Hart the the the representative of the of the secretary general of the United Nations um who we should acknowledge Antonio Gutierrez has been a voice of moral clarity um for for really I think an extraordinary leader and and and and he was represented by someone who said look fossil fuel companies are making record profits right now. It's not as if they're just doing all right financially. I mean, it's actually morally obscene. And so, there has to be a way in which um it's human perception that needs to change. And to do that, we have to look at what drives human perception. And that is values. It is the way we communicate. You know, there's so many aspects of this stock take. We just started it. So, we're just learning how to do it. But but it's also drawing from the deepest impulses and wells of human wisdom and culture. So when you invite those people in, indigenous peoples, faith leaders, you know, people that that are poets and musicians, people really know how to do this. kind of a different skill set than data science, you know, and we we deserve as as human species and we owe each other and future generations all of what human intelligence has to offer, you know, it really is as as I was saying, we were talking about the other day as if our the intelligence of our species is on trial right now and we aren't going to make it unless we draw from those other forms of intelligence. And this is also a way to do that.

**艾尔·戈尔**: 最后一个问题，关于全球伦理盘点的未来。玛丽娜·席尔瓦建议将其作为 COP 进程的永久组成部分。你们认为它的未来应该是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Al Gore**: Wow. Okay. So I have uh I'm going to put one final question to the two of you about the future of the global ethical stock take. A lot of people are now saying this should become a permanent part of the cop process going forward and my understanding is that your leader Marina Silva is now proposing that that be the case. What should be the future of the global ethical stock take?

</details>

**万吉拉·马赛**: 玛丽娜部长为我们设置了这个“重置”键，但将其推向前进是由于我们所有人的责任。这意味着在我们每天的工作中，都要自觉思考我们被要求遵循的道德价值观。在世界资源研究所（WRI），我们关注自然、气候和人，但核心始终是人，因为生命、生计、文化和身份才是我们工作的“为什么”。如果我们不履行彼此之间的契约，我们就无法看到化石燃料的淘汰。非洲有一个概念叫 **Ubuntu**（吾邦托），即“我在故你在”。我们必须记住，我们是相连的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wanjira Mathai**: You know the truth is Marina as I said uh Minister Marina in the in in her wisdom and of course courage set this reset for us but taking it forward has to be all our responsibility. And what that means in is that whatever work we do every single day is to consciously think about what the moral values and ethical lenses are we are called to think about. So I'll I'll I'll give you an example for us at the at the World Resources Institute where we work on Yes. nature, climate, people, making bets on cities and how they evolve and grow, making bets on how we protect forests and restore forests. But again, centering people because it is lives, livelihoods, cultures, and identities that are the why. These are the why we do this work that we do that with the absolute consciousness that it is not because it's work we have to do but it is because everything we depend on is anchored in our values towards others and I think the the harmony of other living things was at the core that in at the very foundation if we do not honor the contract to each other then we will not see the phase out of fossil fuels. We will not see the crisis ended in the way that it needs to be. That actually we have a in in the African ethical stockic we have this concept mucho when when we we welcomed the Brazilians the South African ancestral blessing in the very beginning evoked this prayer of Ubuntu very similar I am because you are. And then we heard about another cultural tradition. My outbreath is your inb breath. I mean there are so many traditions that call on us to remember that we cannot but be connected and we our wisdom. I loved what Karina said about our intelligence be as a as a species being on trial because the truth of the matter is with everything we know, we surely shouldn't be making the sort of decisions we make. So everywhere in every room, if we continue to make sure that our negotiators, our governments are centering the global ethical stock take, mention it in every opportunity you get. We would love to hear from you what happens in those rooms and how those negotiators can take action. But we are reminded that the we are here the Paris agreement was thanks to people pushing and insisting that we center the common but differentiated responsibility agenda. We can do it but we all have to do it.

</details>

**卡琳娜·戈尔**: 我认为它应该继续下去。巴西团队提出了五个深层问题，其中最基本的一个是：如果我们知道解决气候危机需要做什么，为什么我们不去做？这些问题非常具有启发性，它们让我们深入审视现代文明背后的系统和结构，同时也为悲伤和喜悦留出了空间。这必须继续下去，它将成为一场运动的运动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karenna Gore**: For my part, I think I think it should continue. I uh I think one of the things I'd like to say about it is that um is that there were these five questions that they put forward. The under there was one underlying question and if you look at the official COP 30 Brazil team's page of global ethical stocktake, it begins with like there's one basic question. if we know what what we need to do to solve to face the climate crisis, why are we not doing it? But then there are five underneath there and they really thought about it and it went through different phrasings and of course it's translated into English and so on and and and so but they're interesting that what the questions are. So I I won't take up too much time by reading them all, but I just want to say that one of the things I really like about this approach is it you know a lot of times people are very weary of how we talk about these problems, right? Because it seems like lots of fingerpointing and clubbing over the head and you know kind of you and then this optimism or pessimism all this kind of stuff. this is questions that are actually quite disarming um in their in their sort of overview approach. Um and I just want to say on on one level, you know, I'll just mention two of them. Uh the second one is why do we maintain production and consumption models that harm the most vulnerable and jeopardize the 1.5 mission? Why do we maintain uh production and consumption levels? Well, there's an answer to that. Actually, there are lots of answers to that. It has to do with that we're actually it's not only about greed. It's partially that. But it's partially that people are asked to be consumers. We measure success and tell people they're doing well if they hoard a bunch of stuff. Like, why don't we look at these social norms and actually ponder them instead of just repeating them and going through the motions of them? Well, why is that? Well, in part because the global economy is the thing of jobs and that's how people get. So, we're really looking deeply at the systems and structures that underly our modern civilization, but we're it's being done carefully and and and in a way that invites in joy and space for grief when necessary and so on. So, I think it's incredibly healthy and necessary. The other one I was going to mention in this context was the the third one which is what can be done to ensure wealthy countries accelerate the uh transition to and and provide finance to the most vulnerable. So that is in there. It's not the common but differentiated responsibilities and so on. And I think that looking at where where people are calling for systemic change, different voices, different ways of communicating, it must continue. I don't know exactly how the system works as to where it lives and so on and who does it, but I'm here to serve and especially if I get to do so alongside Wira and uh and Marina is a great leader um of this and of course it will be many people. It won't be a select few um it will be many people and the self-organized dialogues and the way that it catalyzes and going going forward I think will be a movement. It's called you know this they've talked about a movement of movements And that's a good way to think about the global ethical stock
