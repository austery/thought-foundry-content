title: 马杜罗被捕对石油市场意味着什么？
summary: 本期播客深入探讨了委内瑞拉总统**马杜罗**被捕后，美国在该地区的战略意图及其对全球石油市场的影响。嘉宾**格雷戈里·布鲁**分析指出，美国此举主要旨在展示其在西半球的主导地位，而非单纯为了石油。尽管委内瑞拉拥有庞大石油储量，但其基础设施老化、政治风险高企，使得开采成本高昂。讨论还涵盖了委内瑞拉石油生产的历史性衰退、**雪佛龙**等国际石油公司在当地的困境与坚持，以及美国未来可能对伊朗、古巴等国采取的行动，并强调了地缘政治事件对能源市场和国际关系带来的深远影响。

### 美国行动的真实动机

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 我能问一个非常基本的问题吗？考虑到我们讨论过的发展委内瑞拉石油工业面临的所有障碍，以及这似乎需要投入的巨额资金和时间，这真的是为了石油吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Can I ask a very basic question, which is, given all the hurdles that we've talked about to developing Venezuela's oil industry, and the vast amounts of capital and time that this will seem to need to take. Is this really about oil?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我不这么认为。但我认为对总统来说，可能就是为了石油。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: I don't think so. But I think for the president, it might be.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 解释一下。让我来详细说明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Explain. And let let me unpack that.

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: **唐纳德·特朗普**总统似乎确实非常关注石油。他经常谈论石油，而且一直如此。我的意思是，你可以回顾他的公共记录，他是一个在公众视野中出现几十年的人。他经常谈论汽油和石油。这似乎是他对世界、全球经济和国内政治看法的核心。而且我认为在某种程度上，他的观点停留在20世纪80年代，也许是90年代初。他认为石油对地缘政治行动很敏感。他认为石油是一种令人觊觎的资源，拥有大量石油很重要。他认为油价至关重要，必须保持低油价。所以你需要市场上尽可能多的石油，这样汽油价格才不会上涨。这种观点在目前有点过时，特别是从美国的角度来看。美国现在是世界上最大的石油生产国。它生产的石油比历史上任何国家都多，而且在可预见的未来很可能保持这种状态。美国现在进口的原油远不如以前那么多。此外，它的大部分原油进口现在来自相对安全的地区，其中加拿大是首要来源。撇开美国与加拿大双边关系中断的任何风险不谈，美国可以从非常安全、可靠的地方获得大量原油。它不需要委内瑞拉的石油。坦率地说，其他任何国家也不需要。市场上有很多供应过剩。还有来自其他更便宜、更安全、更具竞争力的来源的可用供应。所以，将此视为夺取石油的举动，我一直有点难以接受，除非是从总统的角度来看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So, President, President **Donald Trump** does seem to think about oil a lot. He talks about it a lot, and always has done. I mean, this is you can go back and see his public record is someone who's been in the public eye for decades. And he talks about gasoline and oil quite a lot. It seems to be quite central to his view of the world, the global economy and domestic politics. And I think to some extent, his viewpoint is kind of locked in the 1980s, maybe the early 1990s. He sees oil as being sensitive, to geopolitical action. He sees it as being a resource that is coveted, that is important to have in large quantities. And he sees the price as being crucial. You have to keep the price of oil low. So you need as much oil on the market as you can, so that gasoline prices don't go up. That view is a little outdated at this point, particularly from the point of view of the United States. The US is now the world's largest oil producer. It produces more oil than any nation has done in history and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The U.S. doesn't import nearly as much crude as it used to. Also, most of its crude imports now come from relatively safe places, Canada being first among them. Putting aside the any risk of, you know, disruption of the US, Canada bilateral relationship, the U.S. can get a lot of its crude from very safe, secure places. It doesn't need oil from Venezuela. And quite frankly, neither does anybody else. There's quite a lot of supply sloshing around. There's available supply from other sources that are cheaper, that are safer, that are more competitive. So framing this as a move to seize oil has always been a little bit hard for me to accept, except from the point of view of the president.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 具体来说，美国想要什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Specifically, what does the U.S. want?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 是的，美国的官方想法，对吧。作为一个政策制定机构、一个官僚体系、一个大国。我认为这首先是为了展示美国在西半球的首要地位。你知道，我确实认为现在有一个智囊团，他们将复兴的**门罗主义**视为优先事项。你知道，美国应该将注意力从欧洲和中东等地转移开，而应该集中在西半球。通过这样做，对一个长期以来一直是美国对手的国家施加巨大压力——撇开它是一个石油生产国的事实不谈，委内瑞拉长期以来一直反美——对这个国家施加巨大压力，建立石油封锁，悬赏其总统的头颅，然后派遣**三角洲特种部队**绑架总统，将其带走并在美国受审，这向所有人发出了一个非常强烈的信号：美国现在将以更具侵略性的方式行使其首要地位。我认为对于**特朗普**来说，将此事与材料、能源和能源安全联系起来具有吸引力。但归根结底，正如我们一直所说，我认为公司不会很快对此感兴趣或参与进来。汽油价格将保持低位，原因与美国在委内瑞拉的行动无关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: Yeah, the official mind of the United States, right. As a as a policymaking, bureaucracy, as a as a as a great power. I think this was first and foremost about demonstrating U.S. primacy in the Western Hemisphere. You know, I do think there is a brain trust now that sees a resurgent Monroe Doctrine or Don Rowe Doctrine, whatever you want to call it, as being a priority. You know that the U.S. should shift its viewpoint away from places like Europe in the Middle East, and should concentrate its attention on the Western Hemisphere and doing this, putting a lot of pressure on a state that has been a US adversary. Putting aside the fact that it's an oil producer, you know, Venezuela has been anti-U.S. for a long time, putting a lot of pressure on this state, erecting an oil blockade, putting a bounty on the head of its president, and then flying in Delta Force to kidnap the president, take him out and put him on trial in the US, sends a very strong signal to everyone that the US is now going to be exercising its primacy in a much more aggressive way. And I think for the for for Trump, I think there's an allure in making this about, you know, materials and making it about energy and making it about energy security. But at the end of the day, as we've been saying, I don't think companies are going to get interested or involved any time soon. And gasoline prices are going to remain low for reasons that have nothing to do with what the US is doing in Venezuela.

### 马杜罗被捕与市场反应

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 大家好，欢迎收听**Odd Lots podcast**的又一期节目。我是**乔·魏森塔尔**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 我是**特蕾西·阿洛韦**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I'm Tracy Alloway.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: **特蕾西**，今年开局不凡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy, quite a start to the year.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 是的。我的意思是，我当时甚至没有预料到。我甚至没有抱任何希望，认为今年至少在第一周会稍微平静一些。我只是放弃了那个特别的愿望。但你说得对。周末我们有了一些重大新闻。这不仅仅是发生在周六。当然，我们谈论的是**马杜罗**的被捕。这不仅仅是发生在周六，它发生在周六早上五点左右。所以我醒来时，已经收到了私信，他们问：“你们要不要做一期节目？”“关于什么？”“你们在说什么？”然后大约五分钟后，我才反应过来：“什么？他被拘留了？发生了什么？我完全不明白。”但，是的，这是一种地缘政治上的真正地震。我想说，这是一种被滥用的陈词滥调，但这确实感觉像一场地震。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yes. I mean, I was actually at this point I wasn't even predicted it. I wasn't even holding out hope that it might be a little bit quiet. At least for the first week of the year, I've just. I've given up on that, particular ambition. But you're right. We had some huge news breaking over the weekend. It's not just that it happened on the Saturday. And of course, we were talking about, the arrest of, Maduro. It's not just that happened on Saturday. It happened at five in the morning or so. They got to Saturday. So I woke up and I already had DMs. They're like, are you guys going to do an episode or an episode on what? What are you talking about? And then it's sort of five minutes. What? He's in custody. What happened? I don't understand that. At all. But, yeah, it's, sort of a a geopolitical, a genuine earthquake. I would say that sort of. It's a cliche that gets overused, but this feels like an earthquake.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 是的，这里面有很多“第一次”。比如，这是自80年代以来美国在南美洲的第一次重大干预。这是美国第一次如此明确地因为一个国家的石油储备而进入该国。是的，这很令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, there are a lot of firsts involved here. So, like the first major U.S. intervention in South America since, like, I guess the 80s, the first time the US seems to have been this explicit about going into a country because of its oil reserves. Yeah, that was surprising.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 是的，这才是超级有趣的地方。过去，至少，人们会说：“哦，这是为了传播民主。”我认为其中一个，我想说更有趣的——我把这放在引号里，因为这本身并没有什么特别好笑的——但就是没有那种假装，比如：“哦，这位刚刚获得诺贝尔奖的反对派领导人会得到一个机会”之类的。这非常奇怪。所以，表面上看，我的解读是**特朗普**想让**马杜罗**下台，然后**马杜罗**就下台了。而他们会用某种明显的意识形态或原则来包装这个想法，除了可能主导西半球之外，似乎并没有进入考虑范围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, that's the super interesting thing. It's like it's not clear that, you know, in the past at least, like, oh, it's about spreading democracy. And I think one of the, I guess funnier. And I'm putting that in quotes because none of this is like particularly funny per se, but it's like there's no pretense of like, oh, this opposition leader who just won the Nobel Prize that she's going to get a shot or anything like that. It's a very strange. It's so, it's still face value. My, my interpretation is Trump wanted Maduro gone and got Maduro gone. And the idea that they're going to dress it up in some obvious ideology or principle other than maybe dominating the hemisphere, does not seem to have entered the equation.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 但是，但是，但是。可能不是表面价值。这不对。这不是我们今天要谈论的。但是有一种理论认为，这并不是因为石油储备。而是因为委内瑞拉的稀土开采，其中大部分通过各种途径运往中国。对所有人来说。是的，有这么回事。是的。所以你可以想象，告诉美国人：“我们绑架了一个独裁者，并以贩毒罪逮捕了他，额外的好处是你们将获得更便宜的汽油价格。”这可能比“嗯，我们真的需要一些稀土，比如你从未听说过的钽之类的”更能引起共鸣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But, but. But. It might not be face value. And this is not right. This is not what we're going to talk about today. But there is a theory going round that it's not really because of the oil reserves. It's because of, rare earth mining in Venezuela, much of which was making its way to China through various means. To all kinds of no one. Yeah, that's a thing. There's like. No. Like. Yes. So you can imagine that telling Americans, you know, we've we've kidnaped a dictator and arrested him for drug trafficking and the bonus is you're going to get cheaper gas prices. That probably resonates a little bit more than like, well, we really needed, you know, some rare Earth like tantalum or something like that that you've never heard of.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 是的。不，我有一百万个问题。我只是想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. No, I have, like, a million questions. I'm just trying.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 很多人也有一百万个问题，比如，我不知道，这是否完全史无前例，你就这样抓走了一个外国领导人？我惊讶于这竟然能发生。这看起来可能，这看起来几乎是波澜不惊地发生了，就像他们直接进去抓走了一个外国领导人。你会认为他们会受到成千上万的卫兵和一些坚不可摧的宫殿的保护，但显然并非如此。这一切仍然是一个完全的谜团，比如到底发生了什么，到底意味着什么，以及它将走向何方等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, so many people have a million questions also, like, I don't know, like, is this totally unprecedented in terms of you just snatch a foreign leader? I'm amazed that this could, like, happen. It seems like a possible like it seems like almost uneventful in the way, like they just went in and took a foreign leader. You think that they'd be fortified with thousands and thousands of guards and some impenetrable palace are evidently not all just sort of still a complete mystery of like, what exactly happened and what exactly it means and where it's going and all that stuff.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 好的。然而，市场和全球经济的即时反应是，这对石油意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right. The immediate reaction, though, in markets and the global economy was what does this mean for the oil?

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 是的，是的。因为据说委内瑞拉拥有最大的原油储备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, yeah. Because supposedly Venezuela is the holder of the biggest reserve of crude oil.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 是的。大约3000亿桶是你看到的数字，这再次使其高于沙特阿拉伯等著名出口国。对。但问题是，它多年来实际上并没有从地下开采出那么多。它一直在生产，我想大约每天一百万桶。对。人们谈论的实际改善委内瑞拉石油基础设施的数字是惊人的。所以，如果你不能从地下开采出来，如果你没有基础设施来做这件事，那么储备就毫无意义。而且在油价低于60美元的时候，谁会为此买单呢？我不知道这有多经济。太多问题了。总之。我们不需要一直重复所有这些问题。互相提问。这就是为什么我们现在有嘉宾参加这个节目，因为我们想向他们提问。总之。我们很高兴地说，我们确实有完美的嘉宾，我们过去曾与他交谈过，包括一期关于圭亚那石油储备的节目，这当然也是这个故事的一部分，因为他们是邻国，而且他们之间存在争议，他们的一些储备在两国之间存在争议。我们当然将与**欧亚集团**高级分析师**格雷戈里·布鲁**对话。那么，**格雷格**，非常感谢您来到**Odd Lots**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Something like 300 billion barrels is the number that you see, which again places that above noted exporters like Saudi Arabia. Right. But the issue is it hasn't actually been pulling much of that out of the ground for many, many years. It's been producing, I think like a million barrels per day. Right. The numbers that people are talking about to actually improve the Venezuelan oil infrastructure are staggering. So reserves mean nothing if you can't pull it out of the ground. If you don't have the infrastructure to do that, and then who's going to pay for it at a time when oil is below $60? I don't know how economical that. So many questions. Anyway. We don't need to just keep restating other, all the questions. Ask. Each other. That's why we now that's why we have guests on this show, because we'd like to ask them questions. Anyway. We're excited to say we really do have the perfect guest, someone we've talked to in the past, including an episode about, the oil reserves in Guyana, which, of course, is also part of this story because their neighbors and they have contested, some of their reserves are contested between the two countries. We're going to be speaking, of course, to **Gregory Brew** senior analyst at the **Eurasia Group**. So, Greg, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 非常感谢再次邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: Thank you so much for having me back.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 您是怎么知道的？您的周六早上是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How did you find out? What was your Saturday morning like?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我的周六早上很早就开始了，就像我现在所有的早上一样，因为家里有一个15个月大的孩子。所以我当时正在煮咖啡，做我平时常做的事情，那就是查看**推特**，或者随便你怎么称呼它。我立刻看到了关于委内瑞拉发生了一些令人震惊的、神秘而模糊的推文。大约五分钟后，我看到，哦，不，我们进去了，绑架了总统，抓住了他，逮捕了他。火箭发射了，直升机飞过加拉加斯。一切都非常戏剧化。我立刻想到的是，这对石油市场意味着什么？然后我才想起那天是周六早上。我们可以行动了。是的，在亚洲市场开盘前的36小时。我觉得这很有趣。你知道，这些事情现在似乎总是在周末发生，因为无论谁扣动扳机，都想确保他们与市场反应之间留出一些空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So my Saturday morning started very early as, all my mornings do now because I have a 15 month old at home. So I was making coffee and I was doing what I always do, which is, checking Twitter or whatever you call it. And I immediately saw, you know, cryptic, vague tweets about something that had happened that was shocking, that had to do with Venezuela. And after about five minutes, I saw that, oh, no, we went in and kidnaped the president, seized him, apprehended him. You know, rockets were fired, helicopters flew over Caracas. It was all very dramatic. And my immediate thought was, you know, what does this mean for oil markets? Then I remembered that it was Saturday morning. And we could get. Action. Yeah, for 36 hours until Asian markets opened. I thought, that's interesting. You know, these things always seem to happen on weekends now because whoever is pulling the trigger wants to make sure they put some space between themselves and, and the market reaction.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 我能说我在这件事实际发生和我周六早上发现之间有四个小时的幸福时光吗？因为我有一个朋友来家里，我们进行了一次老式的过夜，这很有趣，我给她倒咖啡，我们只是聊天。然后，我送她出门后，立刻看了我的手机，心想：“好吧，我美好的放松周末结束了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can I just say I had a blissful four hours between this actually happening and me finding out on Saturday morning because I had a friend over, we had an old fashioned sleepover, which was kind of fun, and I was serving her coffee, and we were just talking. And then, like, I showed her the door, immediately looked at my phone and was like, okay, well, that's the end of my nice, relaxing weekend.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 等等。没错。再说一遍。那真是令人难以置信的克制，能和朋友共度一个早上而不半心半意地关注手机，因为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wait. That's right. More about that. That's incredible restraint to like, spend a morning with a friend without like half paying attention to the phone because.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 谢谢，谢谢。我知道这对你来说很不寻常。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Thank you, thank you. I know it's unusual for you.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 那会非常困难。是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That would be very hard. Yeah, yeah.

</details>

### 委内瑞拉石油储量与开采困境

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 好的，让我们从一些先验知识开始。关于委内瑞拉的石油储量，我看到一些关于3000亿桶这个数字的争论，特别是来自对冲基金经理**约翰·阿诺德**。他说这个储量数字似乎是前委内瑞拉领导人**查韦斯**神奇地制造出来的。在此之前，经过审计的探明储量数字要低得多。那么，我们真的知道委内瑞拉有很多石油吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right, let's start with, like, let's let's look at some of our priors here. So Venezuelan oil reserves. I have seen some debate around that 300 billion number, particularly from **John Arnold**, the hedge fund guy. He was saying that this was a reserve figure that seemed to be magically produced by **Chavez**, the previous Venezuelan leader. And before that, the, proven reserves number, the one that had actually been audited, was a lot lower. So do we actually know that Venezuela has a lot of oil?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 嗯，你知道，这个对话很快就会变得非常技术化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: Well, you know, this this conversation could get very technical very quickly.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 请继续。我们能。是的。让我们深入探讨。什么是石油储量？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Go ahead. Please let we can yeah. Let's let's dive in. What are oil reserves?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 首先，你从技术可采储量开始，也就是说，地下有多少石油。你通过地质勘探、钻探测试井等发现了什么？从这个角度来看，委内瑞拉在其境内的**马拉开波盆地**西部，以及更重要的是在该国东部和东南部的**奥里诺科盆地**，可能拥有多达一万亿桶石油，那里是这种非常重、特重、高硫原油的所在地。它可能是世界上最大的连续石油储量。它的竞争对手将是阿尔伯塔的油砂和沙特阿拉伯东部的**盖瓦拉油田**。所以从技术上讲，那里可能有一万亿桶石油。但当我们谈到什么是可采储量时，你知道，**美国地质调查局**在2009年做了一份报告，他们得出的数字是4000亿到5000亿桶可以从地下开采出来。你知道，这还不包括价格，不包括你愿意花多少钱。然后我们谈到探明储量。探明储量是价格、盈利能力、可用投资、安全、风险评估、如果你是国际石油公司需要支付多少钱、你需要与国家政府分成多少等等的函数。这就是我们得到一个更模糊数字的地方。你知道，**欧佩克**有探明储量的数据。**美国能源信息署**公布了各国探明储量的数据。谈到委内瑞拉，**乌戈·查韦斯**政府在2007年大幅上调了他们所说的可采石油量。然而，当时布伦特原油价格高达每桶100美元以上，所以油价非常高。而今天，你知道，调整通货膨胀后，价格非常低。每桶60美元。但是，你知道，与2007年的价格相比，甚至更低。所以说委内瑞拉现在有3000亿桶石油可以从地下开采出来，这并不准确。石油在那里。但考虑到所有风险、安全问题、委内瑞拉的动荡，以及升级基础设施和钻井所需的资金，在当前市场条件下试图开采出来，这个数字远低于3000亿桶。这很多。邻国**圭亚那**的探明储量约为200亿桶。而在委内瑞拉西部的**马拉开波盆地**至少是这个数字的两倍。所以那里有很多石油。但它是否接近3000亿桶，这是一个备受争议的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So first you start with the technically recoverable reserves, i.e. you know, what is the oil in the ground. What have you discovered through a geological survey's through drilling test wells, etc.? From that point of view, Venezuela could have as much as a trillion barrels, within its territory in the Maracaibo Basin, the west, but also, most significantly in the Orinoco basin in the east and southeast of the country, which is where this very heavy, heavy, extra heavy sour crude is located. It's probably the largest continuous reserve of oil in the world. Its rivals would be the tar sands of Alberta and the Guevarra Field in eastern Saudi Arabia. So technically there is maybe a trillion barrels of oil there. But when we get down to what is recoverable, you know, the **US Geological Survey**, did a report on this in, I think, 2009, and the figure they landed on was between 400 and 500 billion barrels of what you could pull out of the ground. You know, if not, not counting on price, not counting on how much money you were willing to spend. Then we get to proven reserves. And proven reserves are a function of price, profitability, available investment, security, you know, assessing risks, how much you need to pay if you're an international oil company, how much you need to split with the national government, all of that. And that's where we get a much more fuzzy figure. You know, **OPEC**, they have figures on proven reserves. The **Energy Information Administration** of the United States puts out proven reserve figures on various countries. When it comes to Venezuela. There is that, that incident of the **Hugo Chavez** government radically upgrading the amount of oil that they said was recoverable in, I think it was 2007. The thing about that, though, is that at the time, Brant, crude prices were upwards of $100 a barrel, so the price of oil was very high. Cut to today where, you know, adjusting for inflation, the price is very low. It's $60 a barrel. But, you know, compared to the price in 2007, it's even lower than that. So saying that Venezuela has 300 billion barrels of oil that you could pull out of the ground right now just isn't accurate. The oil is there. But trying to get it out in the current market conditions, given all the risks involved, the security concerns, the upheaval in Venezuela, and then just the amount of money you would need to upgrade the infrastructure and to drill the wells, the figure is much lower than 300 billion. It's a lot. Neighboring **Guyana**, has proven reserves of around 20 billion barrels. And there's at least twice that in the McCabe basin in the west of Venezuela. So there is a lot of oil there. But whether it approaches 300 billion barrels is, is the subject of much debate.

</details>

### 委内瑞拉石油产量下降的历史

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 当油价，当石油市场周日晚上开盘时，并没有太大的反应。我认为这有点直观，就是你可以提出任何数字，1000亿、1万亿、3000亿、1000亿，在中短期内。我猜，重要的是泵出和销售桶油的能力。我们看到的一件事是，委内瑞拉多年来的石油产量急剧下降。有各种潜在的驱动因素，包括可能的价格，可能的制裁。但也有说法是，你知道，社会主义政府将大量石油基础设施国有化后，却让石油基础设施恶化了。请给我们您的解读。就像我知道我这里没有实际的图表，但如果你能在脑海中想象那张图表。每个人都想象一条向下走的线。大部分是向下走的。您为什么不给我们讲讲那张图表的故事呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: When oil prices, when the oil market open on Sunday night, there really hasn't been much of a reaction. And I think it's sort of intuitive, which is that you could come up with any number you want 100, a trillion, 300 billion, 100 billion in the medium, the short term. What matters, I presume, is capacity to pump barrels and sell them. And one of the things that we've seen, we've seen the discharge of how Venezuelan oil production over the years has dropped off quite precipitously. And there are various sort of potential drivers, including maybe price, maybe sanctions. But also there's story that the, you know, the, the socialist government that that nationalized a lot of the oil infrastructure has let the oil infrastructure deteriorate. Give us your read. Like I know where I don't literally have a chart here, but if you could like have that chart, in your mind. Everyone imagine a chart of a line going down. Mostly down. Why don't you like, tell us the story of that chart?

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 当然，当然。我喜欢描述图表。而且，你知道，正如**乔**很清楚的，**特蕾西**你可能也知道，我是一名受过训练的历史学家，所以我喜欢追溯时间，从头开始。委内瑞拉石油的开端在一百多年前。委内瑞拉是世界上最古老的石油生产国之一。你知道，它在20世纪20年代、30年代首次开始商业化生产原油。有一段时间，大约30年，它可以说是世界上第二重要的石油生产国，也是西半球最重要的石油生产国，因为它离美国很近，它向美国输送了大量原油。这发生在50年代和60年代中东成为主要关注点之前。你知道，委内瑞拉已经存在很长时间了。它泵出了大量原油。当我们考虑委内瑞拉石油生产的图表时，实际上，你知道，它在过去20年里与其说是一次崩溃，不如说更像一个W形。委内瑞拉的原油产量从20年代一直上升到70年代初，超过每天300万桶。我相信那是委内瑞拉产量的历史高峰。在20世纪70年代中期，委内瑞拉的生产开始下降。它下降得相当急剧。有很多原因，其中之一是中东。你知道，他们面临着更激烈的竞争，更便宜的生产商，你知道，他们不得不削减投资。他们不得不削减产量。所以产量从70年代下降到80年代。在90年代，它又开始攀升。这与委内瑞拉国家石油公司**PDVSA**有关。长期以来，**PDVSA**在国家石油公司中是独一无二的。你知道，我们谈论沙特阿拉伯的**沙特阿美**、伊拉克石油公司、科威特石油公司。世界上几乎每个大型石油生产国都有一家国家石油公司。委内瑞拉的**PDVSA**长期以来像一个资本主义企业一样运作。它以确保利润为基础运作。在90年代，它非常擅长与来自西方和其他地方的国际石油公司达成协议。所以，在90年代，你知道，大约30、35年前，委内瑞拉的产量又开始攀升。在21世纪初，它接近每天300万桶，正好是价格达到顶峰的时候。你知道，委内瑞拉在21世纪初赚了巨额资金。我想，当时它拥有南美洲任何国家中最高的人均收入。它非常富有。它赚了很多钱，然后**乌戈·查韦斯**上台了。你知道，这种围绕着一个非常大的社会主义福利国家、大量的公共企业和国有公司，但也伴随着大量的威权主义、大量的腐败和大量的盗贼统治的政治意识形态。**查韦斯**推动了石油工业的进一步国有化。石油工业此前已经国有化了。现在我们可以深入另一个兔子洞，谈谈委内瑞拉资源民族主义的历史。但该行业在70年代就已经国有化了。90年代所做的是，你知道，更多的是与国际公司进行合资交易，引入国际资本。**查韦斯**关闭了这扇门，要求所有在委内瑞拉运营的公司给予**PDVSA** 60%的股份。他要求更高的特许权使用费，从现有交易中抽取更多的资金。结果，产量开始下降，因为投资突然枯竭了。国际公司对在委内瑞拉运营不再那么感兴趣。它们正在撤离。与此同时，**PDVSA**正在从一家运营良好的石油公司，基本上变成了**查韦斯**及其政府的存钱罐。当权力移交给**马杜罗**时，情况变得更糟。管理不善和腐败更加严重。与此同时，委内瑞拉的油田，鉴于原油的性质和遇到的技术问题，管理起来很棘手。你知道，该行业在21世纪陷入失修。油价在2014年、2015年崩溃。这与针对**马杜罗**政府的大量抗议、街头起义和暴力镇压同时发生。你知道，**马杜罗**正在镇压，委内瑞拉的石油产量直线下降。与此同时，美国正在对委内瑞拉实施制裁，与**马杜罗**的镇压相关的严厉制裁。所以所有这些因素共同构成了一个有高峰有低谷的故事。但当我们来到2025年，委内瑞拉坐拥一个陷入失修的庞大石油工业。它每天生产的石油略低于一百万桶。它表面上拥有巨大的原油储备，而美国公司实际上在处理这些原油方面拥有丰富的经验，比如**雪佛龙**、**埃克森**、石油服务公司、较小的美国中型企业。所有这些公司都曾参与过，或者其中许多公司在过去的一个世纪里都曾参与过委内瑞拉的业务。所以他们知道那里的利害关系。但他们也知道风险和成本。我认为他们会非常警惕再次介入，特别是鉴于局势仍然如此不确定。

**Gregory Brew**: Sure, sure. I love describing charts. And I'm also, you know, as as Joe well knows Tracy, you probably know as well. I'm a historian by training, so I love to go back in time and start at the beginning and the beginning. For Venezuela, oil is over 100 years ago. Venezuela is one of the oldest oil producers in the world. You know, first began to commercially produce crude in the 1920s, 1930s. For a while, you know, close to 30 years. It was arguably the second most important oil producer in the world and in the Western Hemisphere, because it was so close to the United States, it was sending a lot of its crude to the US. This was before the Middle East became a major concern in the 50s. And 60s. You know, Venezuela has been around for a long time. It's pumped a lot of crude. When we think about the chart for Venezuela oil production, it's actually, you know, it's it's less of a, collapse in the last 20 years. If you look at it, it's more of a w Venezuela crude output goes up and up and up from the 20s all the way up to the early 70s, where it exceeds 3 million barrels a day. That is, I believe, the historic peak for Venezuela output in, in the mid 1970s, Venezuela produced production starts to fall. It falls quite sharply. There are a lot of reasons for that, one of which is the Middle East. You know, they were facing much stiffer competition, cheaper producers, you know, they had to, investment was being cut. They had to drop production. So production falls from the 70s into the 80s. In the 90s it starts to climb again. And this has to do with **PDVSA**, the Venezuelan national oil company. For a long time, **PDVSA** was kind of unique when it comes to national oil companies. You know, we talk about **Aramco** and Saudi Arabia, the **Iraqi Petroleum company**, the **Kuwaiti Petroleum company**. Almost every, big oil producer in the world has a national oil company. Venezuela's **PDVSA** for a long time was run like a, capitalist enterprise. It was run on the basis of securing profit. It was, in the 90s. It was very good at, making deals with the international oil companies both from the west and elsewhere. So, in the 90s, you know, about 30, 35 years ago, Venezuela output starts to climb again. And in the early 2000, it gets, close to 3 million barrels a day, just as prices are peaking. You know, Venezuela is making a tremendous amount of money in the early 2000. It's, I think, got the, highest per capita, income of any South American country at the time. It's extremely wealthy. It's making a lot of money, incomes. **Hugo Chavez** and **Chavez** small. You know, this this, political ideology built around, a very large socialist welfare state, lots of, public enterprise national companies, but also a lot of authoritarianism, a lot of corruption, a lot of kleptocracy. And **Chavez** pushes further nationalization of the oil industry. The oil industry had already been nationalized. And now we could go down another rabbit hole and talk about the history of resource nationalism in Venezuela. But the industry had been nationalized in the 70s. What had been done in the 90s was, you know, more joint, deals with international companies bringing in international capital. **Chavez** closes that door and demands that all companies operating in Venezuela give **PDVSA** a 60% share. He demands, much higher royalties, much pulling much more money out of the existing deals. And as a result, production starts to fall because suddenly the investment is drying up. International firms aren't as interested in operating in Venezuela. They're pulling back. In the meantime, **PDVSA** is turning from a pretty well run oil company into, basically a piggy bank for **Chavez** and his, and his government. When it turns over to **Maduro**, it gets even worse. There's more mismanagement, more corruption. Meanwhile, Venezuela's oil fields, which are tricky to manage given the nature of the crude, the technical problems that you encounter, you know, the industry falls into disrepair in the in the in the 2000, the price collapses. The oil price collapses in 2014, 2015. This coincides with lots of protests against the **Maduro** government. You know, street uprisings, violent repression. **Maduro** is cracking down and Venezuela oil production just tanks. And at the same time, the US is putting sanctions on Venezuela, considerable sanctions in connection to **Maduro**'s repression. So all of this coalesces into a story that has its peaks, it has its valleys. But when we get to 2025, Venezuela is sitting on this giant oil industry that has fallen into disrepair. It's producing a little bit less than a million barrels a day. It ostensibly has this massive reserve of crude oil that American companies actually have a lot of experience with dealing with **Chevron**, **Exxon**, the oil services companies, smaller U.S, mid-caps. All of them have been involved, or many of them have been involved in Venezuela over the last, you know, century. So they they know what's at stake down there. But they also know the risks, the costs. And I think they're going to be very wary of getting involved again, particularly as the situation remains so uncertain.

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 好的。跑题了，**格雷格**。好的，这里有一个基本问题。考虑到委内瑞拉涉及的所有风险，我记得我丈夫十几岁的时候去过一次委内瑞拉，他给我讲的故事有点令人毛骨悚然，包括他一落地就有人试图偷他的包。然后他记得去电影院，他们除了电影票还出售人寿保险。再说一遍，这些都是轶事，我无法完全证实，但考虑到在委内瑞拉运营的风险，以及你确实拥有这种难以精炼的重质高硫原油，我一直想知道的一个问题是，为什么**雪佛龙**甚至还留在那里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay. Off topic, Greg. Okay, here's a basic question. Given all the risks involved in Venezuela, and I remember my husband actually went to Venezuela once when he was a teenager, and the stories he told me were a little bit hair raising, including as soon as he landed, someone tried to steal his bag. And then he remembers going to a movie theater, and they were selling life insurance alongside the ticket to the movie theater. Again, all anecdotal. I can't exactly vouch for those, but given the risks of operating in Venezuela and the fact that you do have this heavy, sour crude that's, you know, difficult to refine, why is one question I always wondered why is **Chevron** even still there?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 那么我首先要说，石油行业对时间有着相当广阔的看法。事情需要很长时间，当你发现一个油田时，当它处于绿地阶段，你钻探测试井，你扩大和探索储量有多大，从那个时候到实际商业化生产石油，可能需要十年甚至更长时间，特别是如果它可能是一个海上油田，比如在**圭亚那**或其他地方。然后，如果你是一家大型的、相对一体化的、垂直整合的国际石油公司，你会有想要输送原油的地方，你会有炼油厂和下游资产来接收原油。而当涉及到来自委内瑞拉或加拿大的重质高硫原油时，炼油厂需要进行建设和优化以处理这种原油，否则效率会很低。你的炼油厂利用率将达不到你想要的水平。你的利润率会更低。所以**雪佛龙**花了很长时间来发展其在委内瑞拉的业务，从各个角度来看，这可以追溯到20世纪40年代，**雪佛龙**首次开始在西部盆地**马拉开波盆地**扩大其业务。他们在美国墨西哥湾沿岸建造了炼油厂，这些炼油厂经过优化以处理委内瑞拉原油。所以他们的成本，沉没成本是相当可观的。这就是问题的症结所在。其他国际石油公司愿意撤出委内瑞拉，止损，去其他地方。但**雪佛龙**没有。部分原因是他们投入了大量资金。部分原因是他们成功说服美国政府允许他们留下，授予他们制裁豁免，授予他们特殊许可证以继续运营。与此同时，他们能够利用其在委内瑞拉政府中的地位，说：“你们需要我们。你们需要我们留下，因为总有一天情况会好转，你们会获得更多的国际兴趣和投资。而我们是第一个在这里的。而且，你知道，我们希望保持这种特权地位。”所以所有这些因素结合在一起，使得**雪佛龙**在其他公司愿意撤退时仍留在委内瑞拉。而且，我认为，在**马杜罗**行动之后，**雪佛龙**已经做出了回应。他们正在谈论派他们的团队回去。他们正在谈论扩大他们在那里的业务。他们仍然非常清楚存在的安全风险和人员风险，但他们想保住他们所拥有的，并希望扩大它。而且，你知道，考虑到成本，撇开这一点不谈，如果你有很多美国下游资产，如果你在墨西哥湾沿岸有炼油厂，并且你想获得重质高硫原油，那么委内瑞拉仍然是一个地理上非常有吸引力的运营地点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So I'll start by saying the oil industry, it it has a pretty expansive approach to time. Things take a long time, when you discover a field, when it's in greenfield stage where you drill test wells, where you expand and explore how big the reserve is from that point to actually producing oil in commercial quantities. It can be a decade, decade plus, particularly if it's maybe like an offshore field, like in **Guyana** or elsewhere. Then if you're a big, you know, relatively integrated, vertically integrated international oil company, you're going to have places that you want to send that crude, you're going to have refineries, and downstream assets that you're going to send the crude to. And when it comes to heavy, sour, from Venezuela or from Canada, refineries need to be built and optimized to take that crude, because otherwise it's not going to be efficient. Your refinery utilization isn't going to be where you want it to be. Your margins are going to be tighter. So **Chevron** spent a long time developing their position in Venezuela, which from various points of view does go back, I think to the I think to the 1940s is where **Chevron** first began, to expand its operations in the western basin, the **Maracaibo basin**. They've built refineries in the US Gulf Coast that are optimized to take Venezuelan crude. So the cost, the sunken cost for them is considerable. And that's where it kind of always comes down to. Right. Other IOCs were willing to pull out of Venezuela, cut their losses, go elsewhere. **Chevron** was it. And part of that was due to how much money they had spent. Part of that was due to their success at convincing the US government to allow them to remain right, granting them sanctions waivers, granting them special licenses to continue to operate. At the same time, they were able to leverage their position with the Venezuelan government and say, you need us. You need us to stay, because at some point things are going to get better and you are going to get, increased international interest and investments. And we were here first. And, you know, we we want to maintain this privileged position. So all of that has combined to keep **Chevron** in Venezuela when other companies were willing to pull back. And there's already been, I think, a response from **Chevron** following the **Maduro**, operation. They're talking about sending their their teams back in. They're talking about expanding their, their profile there. They're still very conscious of the security risks and the risks to personnel that exist, but they want to hold on to what they have and they want to expand it. And, you know, considering the costs, putting that to one side, Venezuela is still geographically a very attractive place to operate if you have lots of U.S downstream assets, if you have refineries in the Gulf Coast and you want to get heavy sour crude to them, Venezuela is a great place to get that crude.

### 马杜罗下台后的委内瑞拉政局

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 那么，请给我们您的解读。关于政治局势，我想是因为，我的意思是，我不知道“政权更迭”这个政治学术语的确切定义是什么。我们进去把总统带走了，但看起来，至少目前，他的副总统**德尔西·罗德里格斯**已经临时接任了总统职位。没有，我的意思是，我觉得这真的很引人注目。**特朗普**甚至没有做出任何表示，比如“哦，流亡的民选领导人”之类的。然而，政府似乎对他的班底仍然在那里感到满意。正如你刚才提到的，公司也表示：“好吧，我们已经准备好派人回去工作了。”就像我假设一切都瞬息万变一样。但是你对委内瑞拉现在短期到中期的政治局势有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, give us your read. On the political situation, I guess because there is I mean, I don't know exactly what the sort of political science definition of the term regime change is. We went in and took out the president, but the party has it looks like, at least for now, his vice president, **Elsie Rodriguez**, is assumed, at least on an interim basis, the presidency. There's no I mean, I thought it was really remarkable. **Trump** didn't even sort of like, make a nod to like, oh, the democratically elected leader in exile or whatever. And yet, the administration seems cool with, like, his people still being there. And as you just mentioned, the company is like, all right, we're already ready to send people back in to get back to work. Just like I assume everything's so fluid, I suppose. But what's your read on? Like the sort of short to medium political situation now in Venezuela.

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 所以我认为，从美国的角度来看，让**马杜罗**下台是目标，这一点已经非常清楚了。是的。你知道，推翻政府。打倒政府，让它被一个全新的权力机构、一个全新的政权取代，引入反对派，民主反对派，我认为这从来都不在计划之内。这只是关于罢免**马杜罗**。而且我认为，你知道，你可以争辩说，其中一些对**特朗普**总统来说是私人恩怨。他不喜欢**马杜罗**。**马杜罗**一直在讨价还价，因为他们已经谈判了几个月，关于美国能从委内瑞拉得到什么，以及**马杜罗**能提供什么样的让步，而**特朗普**显然失去了耐心，决定做一些相当冒险的事情。但事实证明，这非常成功。**马杜罗**领导的政府，顺便说一句，他继承自**乌戈·查韦斯**，仍然在那里。它由**德尔西·罗德里格斯**等人领导。它仍然控制着军队。它仍然管理着国家的大部分地区。国家的一些地区略微超出其控制范围，由毒枭和更内陆的民兵控制。但首都、主要城市、油田仍然在过去由**马杜罗**领导的政府控制之下。接下来会发生什么，我认为取决于华盛顿和加拉加斯之间达成的某种**临时协议**。其中一些取决于**特朗普**到底想从中得到什么。我认为第一个目标是展示美国的实力，我认为他们已经做到了，向世界其他地区，特别是西半球发出信号，表明美国现在愿意比过去更果断、更积极地使用其力量。但这并不多。你知道，美国还能从这件事中获得什么？显然，现在都在谈论获得石油储备的准入权，并引入美国公司，但这将非常非常难以实现。所以我认为在短期内，加拉加斯最希望从美国看到的第一件事是解除石油封锁，允许油轮通行。这些油轮中的大多数将希望前往中国，因为中国一直是委内瑞拉石油的主要买家。这可能对**特朗普**来说不难接受，因为**特朗普**也希望与北京达成**临时协议**。他希望与**习近平**建立更好的关系。这也是本届政府一直试图优先考虑的事情。但委内瑞拉的政治局势，在**马杜罗**缺席的情况下，似乎根本没有改变。政权仍然存在。这不是政权更迭。甚至不是政权斩首，因为**马杜罗**是可以替代的，他们让其他人填补了他的空缺。而本届政府似乎对此完全满意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So I think it's it's become very clear that from the U.S. point of view, getting **Maduro** out was the goal. Yeah. You know, overtaking the government. Knocking the government down, having it replaced by a completely new power apparatus, completely new regime bringing in the opposition, the Democratic opposition, that I don't think was ever on the cards. This was about removing **Maduro**. And and I think, you know, you could make the argument that some of it was personal for President **Trump**. He didn't like **Maduro**. **Maduro** had been, driving a hard bargain because they've been negotiating for months about what the U.S. can get from Venezuela and what kinds of concessions that **Maduro** could offer and **Trump** US apparently lost his patience and decided to do something pretty risky. But it turns, it turns out, was was very successful. The government that **Maduro** led, which incidentally, he inherited from **Hugo Chavez**, is still there. It's led by **Delta Rodriguez** and others. It still controls the military. It still manages most of the country. Parts of the country are slightly out of its control on are run by essentially drug cartels and militias further further inland. But the capital, the major cities, the oil fields are still under control of the government that used to be led by **Maduro**. What happens next, I think, depends on what kind of, modus vivendi is reached between Washington and Caracas. And some of that comes down to what it is that **Trump** actually wants out of this. I think the first goal was demonstrating U.S. power, and I think they've done that, signaling to, the rest of the world, but particularly the Western Hemisphere, that the US is now willing to use its power, much more assertively and aggressively than it has in the past. But that's not much. You know, what else could the US gain from having done this? And obviously now it's all talk about gaining access to the oil reserves and bringing in U.S. companies, but that's going to be very, very difficult to do. So I think in the short term, the first thing that Caracas is going to want to see from the US is lifting the oil blockade and allowing tankers to move. Most of those tankers are going to want to go to China because that's who's been taking most of Venezuelan oil. That might not be too difficult for **Trump** to accept, because **Trump** also wants to reach, modus vivendi with Beijing. He wants to have a better relationship with **Jinping**. That's also something that the administration has been trying to prioritize. But this this political situation in Venezuela, absent **Maduro**, doesn't appear to have changed at all. The regime is still there. It's not regime change. It isn't even regime decapitation, because **Maduro** was replaceable and they filled his shoes with somebody else. And the administration seems perfectly fine with that.

### 国际石油公司重返委内瑞拉的条件

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 除了**雪佛龙**之外，您从主要石油公司那里听到了什么样的消息？要让像**埃克森**这样的公司——我了解到委内瑞拉政府仍然欠他们钱——重新回到这个国家，需要什么条件？他们正在寻找什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What kind of chatter are you actually hearing from the oil majors, setting **Chevron** aside, what would it take to get like at **Exxon**? Who I understand is still owed money by the Venezuelan government, back into the country. What are they looking for?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 所以我认为你可以分阶段考虑。第一步是解除封锁。他们必须看到这一点。他们必须看到美国公开表示，委内瑞拉可以再次出口石油，因为如果不能保证进入外国市场，没有人会愿意进入委内瑞拉投资。对。我认为美国一直试图发出信号，表示封锁是为了阻止受制裁的油轮，但它一直是不加区分的，因为它并没有具体与美国在委内瑞拉明确试图做的事情联系起来，那就是，你知道，罢免**马杜罗**并对政府施加更大压力。所以封锁必须解除，然后制裁也必须解除。对。委内瑞拉仍然受到严厉制裁。**马杜罗**政府仍然受到制裁，国际石油公司，西方公司，将不愿意进入一个面临制裁风险的国家。他们根本不会感兴趣，即使价格上涨。即使数字开始变得更有意义，这仍然是目前承担的巨大风险。价格上涨也必须发生。是的。对。目前的市场条件根本不值得投入数十亿美元开发油田。当价格在每桶60美元时，它甚至可能跌得更低。是的。如果你看看新的钻井平台图表。对。即使在美国，在每桶60美元的情况下，它也在下降。我无法想象人们会说：“好吧，现在我们将在委内瑞拉开设一些设施。”没错。是的，与此相比，我的意思是，我们再次提到了几次，但隔壁的**圭亚那**一直是**埃克森**运营的一个非常有利可图的地方。美国陆上仍然非常有吸引力。它是安全的。你知道，没有人会担心**三角洲特种部队**会进入**二叠纪盆地**或北达科他州进行秘密行动。你知道，没有人会担心这些。所以如果你有资金，并且想找个地方投资，有更好的地方可以这样做。是的。而在委内瑞拉，除了所有这些，还有基础设施问题、技术问题、重质高硫原油需要经过提质器，需要通过稀释剂，需要以某种方式处理才能变得可行。对。除了所有地缘政治风险、不确定性和市场条件之外，还需要投入大量的资金、大量的时间和大量的精力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So I think you can think of it in stages. So the first would be lifting the blockade. They would have to see that. They would have to see the U.S. saying publicly, Venezuela can export oil again, because no one's going to want to go in and spend money in Venezuela if they can't be guaranteed access to to foreign markets. Right. I think the US has been trying to signal that the blockade is about stopping sanction tankers, but it's been, it's been indiscriminate in the sense that it hasn't been specifically connected to what the US is clearly trying to do in Venezuela, which is, you know, remove **Maduro** and exert more pressure on the government. So the blockade would have to be lifted and then sanctions would have to be lifted. Right. Venezuela remains under heavy sanction. The **Maduro** government remains under sanction, and international oil companies, Western companies aren't going to want to go into a country where they're exposed to sanctions risk. They're just not going to be interested even if the price were to go up. And even if, the, the, the numbers started to make a little bit more sense, that's still too great of a risk, to take on at this time. The price coming up would also have to happen. Yeah. Right. The current market condition just doesn't justify spending billions of dollars developing fields. When, the price is at $60 a barrel, it's likely to fall even more. Yeah. If you look at, like, the new rig chart. Right. It's going down even in the U.S at $60 a barrel. I can't imagine that people are like, well, now we'll just open some facilities in Venezuela. Exactly. And yeah, compare it to I mean, again, we bring it up a couple of times, but **Guyana** Next Door has been a tremendously profitable place for **Exxon** to operate. The U.S onshore is still very attractive. It's safe. You know, there's they're you're not going to have, **Delta Force** coming in and pulling off covert operations in the Permian or, you know, in North Dakota. You know, no one's going to have to worry about that. So if you've got capital and you want to find somewhere to invest it, there are better places to do so. Yeah. And in Venezuela, add to all that, you know, the infrastructural problems, the technical problems, the heavy sour being, it needs to go through upgraders, it needs to be passed through diluent. It needs to be treated in a certain way for it even to be viable. Right. There's a lot of money and a lot of time, a lot of effort that would have to go in on top of all the geopolitical risks and the uncertainty and the market conditions.

### 圭亚那石油争议与地缘政治影响

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 更多地谈谈**圭亚那**。因为我们第一次邀请您来的时候，我想我们谈论的就是那里的石油储量。但我知道委内瑞拉政府曾声称，他们的部分或全部石油实际上是属于委内瑞拉的。这种说法是否有任何合法性？请告诉我们那里的背景故事，以及这是否会改变什么？

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 嗯，我认为，你知道，结果是，鉴于**德尔西·罗德里格斯**政府的脆弱地位，我们可能不会再听到委内瑞拉威胁**圭亚那**了。如果它能持续下去，我认为他们会想交朋友，而不是树敌。尽管最初有一些相当喧嚣的言论，但现在态度似乎更倾向于“我们想与美国合作，我们想要制裁减免。我们想解除封锁。”从威胁**圭亚那**中撤回将是其中的一部分。历史主张，你知道，就像南美洲一样，领土争端实际上非常广泛。如果他们想旧事重提，每个人似乎都对其他人有主张，而**马杜罗**政府去年和前年决定这样做。我认为没有人认真对待他们。不幸的是，**圭亚那**没有能力自卫，它是一个非常小的国家。但与此同时，我认为他们相信美国会支持他们。中国也通过中国国家石油公司参与了**圭亚那**的近海开发。他们持有少数股权。与此同时，巴西也愿意支持**圭亚那**，并在**马杜罗**提出这些主张时，对委内瑞拉进行了非常强硬的反击。所以领土主张是历史性的，但并没有太多实质内容。我认为现在**马杜罗**已经下台，我们不会再听到太多关于它的消息，但它仍然会在空气中漂浮。我想说的另一点是，你知道，正如你所指出的，市场在发生这件事时并没有太在意，对吧？油价并没有真正改变。对这场涉及封锁等戏剧的整体态度并没有真正影响到价格。部分原因是，人们并没有觉得其他来源存在太多风险。但**圭亚那**就在那里。如果情况真的变得很糟，委内瑞拉内部不稳定，封锁持续。如果美国想对加拉加斯施加更大的影响力，它可能会威胁要没收资产。这将增加局势升级的风险，从而影响邻近的产油国。**圭亚那**首当其冲。

**Gregory Brew**: Well, I think, you know, upshot is we're probably not going to hear any more from Venezuela about threatening **Guyana**, given the tenuous position of the **Delsey Rodriguez** government. If it lasts, I think they're going to want to make friends, rather than enemies. Even though there was some pretty, you know, boisterous rhetoric initially, now the attitude seems to be much more we want to work with the U.S, we want sanctions relief. We want to lift the blockade. Pulling back from threatening **Guyana** is going to be a part of that. The historical claim, you know, like South America, territorial disputes are actually pretty wide ranging. Everybody seems to have a claim on everybody else, if they want to dredge them up, which the **Maduro** government decided to do, you know, last year and the year before, I don't think anybody took them seriously. **Guyana** is not in a position to defend itself, unfortunately, it's a very small country. But at the same time, I think they were confident that the US would back them up. China is also, involved in the **Guyana** offshore developments through Chinese national oil companies. They hold a minority share. And at the same time, Brazil, was willing to back up **Guyana** and was was pushing back very hard on Venezuela when **Maduro** was making those claims. So the territorial claim is historical, but there's not a whole lot to it. I don't think now that **Maduro** has gone, I don't think we're going to hear much more about it, but it's still going to sort of float in the ether. The other point that I would make is, you know, the market, as you noted, didn't care too much when this happened, right? Oil prices didn't really change. The whole attitude to this drama with the blockade and everything like it hasn't really affected prices. Part of that is because there really wasn't a sense that there was much risk to other sources. But **Guyana** is right there. And were things to get really bad. Venezuela internal instability, continuation of the blockade. The US could threaten to seize assets if it wanted to exert even more leverage over Caracas. That would increase the risk of escalation to affect neighboring oil producing countries. With **Guyana** being first on the list.

### 美国在西半球的战略主导

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我能问一个非常基本的问题吗？考虑到我们讨论过的发展委内瑞拉石油工业面临的所有障碍，以及这似乎需要投入的巨额资金和时间。这真的是为了石油吗？我不这么认为。但我认为对总统来说，可能就是为了石油。解释一下。让我来详细说明。所以，**唐纳德·特朗普**总统似乎确实非常关注石油。他经常谈论石油，而且一直如此。我的意思是，你可以回顾他的公共记录。他是一个在公众视野中出现几十年的人，他经常谈论汽油和石油。这似乎是他对世界、全球经济和国内政治看法的核心。而且我认为在某种程度上，他的观点停留在20世纪80年代，也许是90年代初。他认为石油对地缘政治行动很敏感。他认为石油是一种令人觊觎的资源，拥有大量石油很重要。他认为油价至关重要。你必须保持低油价。所以你需要市场上尽可能多的石油，这样汽油价格才不会上涨。这种观点在目前有点过时，特别是从美国的角度来看。美国现在是世界上最大的石油生产国。它生产的石油比历史上任何国家都多，而且在可预见的未来很可能保持这种状态。美国现在进口的原油远不如以前那么多，或者说它的大部分原油进口现在来自相对安全的地区，其中加拿大是首要来源。撇开美国与加拿大双边关系中断的任何风险不谈，美国可以从非常安全、可靠的地方获得大量原油。它不需要委内瑞拉的石油。坦率地说，其他任何国家也不需要。市场上有很多供应过剩。还有来自其他更便宜、更安全、更具竞争力的来源的可用供应。所以，将此视为夺取石油的举动，我一直有点难以接受，除非是从总统的角度来看。具体来说，美国想要什么？是的，美国的官方想法，对吧。作为一个政策制定机构、一个官僚体系、一个大国。我认为这首先是为了展示美国在西半球的首要地位。你知道，我确实认为现在有一个智囊团，他们将复兴的**门罗主义**视为优先事项，或者随便你怎么称呼它。你知道，美国应该将注意力从欧洲和中东等地转移开，而应该集中在西半球。通过这样做，对一个长期以来一直是美国对手的国家施加巨大压力——撇开它是一个石油生产国的事实不谈，委内瑞拉长期以来一直有点反美——对这个国家施加巨大压力，建立石油封锁，悬赏其总统的头颅，然后派遣**三角洲特种部队**绑架总统，将其带走并在美国受审，这向所有人发出了一个非常强烈的信号：美国现在将以更具侵略性的方式行使其首要地位。我认为对于**特朗普**来说，将此事与材料、能源和能源安全联系起来具有吸引力。但归根结底，正如我们一直所说，我认为公司不会很快对此感兴趣或参与进来。汽油价格将保持低位，原因与美国在委内瑞拉的行动无关。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: Can I ask a very basic question, which is, given all the hurdles that we've talked about to developing Venezuela's oil industry, and the vast amounts of capital and time that this will seem to need to take. Is this really about oil? I don't think so. But I think for the president, it might be. Explained. Let me unpack that. So, President, President **Donald Trump** does seem to think about oil a lot. He talks about it a lot, and always has done. I mean, this is you can go back and see his public record. He's someone who's been in the public eye for decades, and he talks about gasoline and oil quite a lot. It seems to be quite central to his view of the world, the global economy and domestic politics. And I think to some extent, his viewpoint is kind of locked in the 1980s, maybe the early 1990s. He sees oil as being sensitive, to geopolitical action. He sees it as being a resource that is coveted, that is important to have in large quantities. And he sees the price as being crucial. You have to keep the price of oil low. So you need, as much oil on the market as you can, so that gasoline prices don't go up. That view is a little outdated at this point, particularly from the point of view of the United States. The US is now the world's largest oil producer. It produces more oil than any nation has done in history and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The US doesn't import nearly as much crude as it used to, or so most of its crude imports now come from relatively safe places, Canada being first among them. Putting aside the any risk of, you know, disruption of the US, Canada bilateral relationship, the US can get a lot of its crude from very safe, secure places. It doesn't need oil from Venezuela. And quite frankly, neither does anybody else. There's quite a lot of supply sloshing around. There's available supply from other sources that are cheaper that are safer, that are more competitive. So framing this as a move to seize oil has always been a little bit hard for me to accept, except from the point of view of the president. Specifically, what does the US want? Yeah, the official mind of the United States, right. As a as a policymaking, bureaucracy as, as a, as a great power. I think this was first and foremost about demonstrating US primacy in the Western Hemisphere. You know, I do think there is a brain trust now that sees a resurgent **Monroe Doctrine** or Don Rowe Doctrine, when you want to call it as being a priority, you know that the US should shift its viewpoint away from places like Europe in the Middle East, and should concentrate its attention on the Western Hemisphere and doing this, putting a lot of pressure on a state that has been a US adversary. Putting aside the fact that it's an oil producer, you know, Venezuela has been kind of anti-US for a long time, putting a lot of pressure on this state, erecting an oil blockade, putting a bounty on the head of its president, and then flying in **Delta Force** to kidnap the president, take him out and put him on trial in the US, sends a very strong signal to everyone that the US is now going to be exercising its primacy in a much more aggressive way. And I think for the for for **Trump**, I think there's an allure in making this about, you know, materials and making it about energy and making it about energy security. But at the end of the day, as we've been saying, I don't think companies are going to get interested or involved anytime soon. And gasoline prices are going to remain low for reasons that have nothing to do with what the US is doing in Venezuela.

### 美国单边行动的潜在影响

**乔·魏森塔尔**: **埃里克·莱维茨**，他曾为**Vox**工作，有两年做得很好，就像我们年轻的时候。你知道，我们打这些战争，人们会说，这是为了民主。人们会说，不，这实际上是为了石油。这就像是第一次，所以这是为了石油。就像，实际上我们并不真的相信这是为了什么，这只是非常，非常超现实。作为一个，你知道，你为地缘政治分析机构工作。现在关于**格陵兰岛**有什么传闻？在这次事件之后？因为，你知道，我们发现的一件事是，如果过去一周的事件表明了一件事，那就是任何形式的非凡单边行动突然都摆在了桌面上。所以，看，如果我们能直接进去抓走一个外国领导人，那么谁知道呢，也许有一天我们会降落在**格陵兰岛**，说：“这都是我们的。”你有没有任何关于2026年发生某种**格陵兰岛**事件的可能性，那会让我们震惊，也许是在一个不同的时代？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Eric Levitz**, who worked for **Vox**, had a good two years, like when we were younger. You know, we do these wars and people, they would say, this is about democracy. And people say, no, this is really about oil. This is like the first time or something. So this is about oil. It's like, actually we don't really believe this is about like some it's it's just very it's very surreal. As a, you know, you work for a geopolitical analyst shop. What's the buzz? What is the thinking on **Greenland** now, in the wake of this? Because, like, what, one thing that we've discovered is that just sort of like, if there's one thing that the events of the past week have shown is that extraordinary unilateral actions of any sort suddenly on the table. And so, look, if we could just go in and statue of Foreign Leader, then who knows, maybe one day we'll land over **Greenland** and say, this is all ours. Do you have like, odds of any sort of **Greenland** event happening in 2026 that would shock us and maybe a different era.

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我认为我没有个人概率。我会说，你知道，既然美国已经这样做了，每个人都在思考**特朗普**接下来可能会做什么。是的。这给了美国比一周前更大的影响力。这使得政府能够说，也许我们会对古巴做些什么。也许我们会对哥伦比亚做些什么，也许我们会推动丹麦人给我们更多进入**格陵兰岛**的权利，给我们更多的权利，允许我们建立更多的基地。或者我们可以直接吞并**格陵兰岛**，你知道，看看你会怎么做。我认为现在美国将如何使用其权力存在如此多的不确定性，这为美国提出了各种新要求并获得新让步创造了空间。即使，你知道，实际吞并**格陵兰岛**真的不在计划之内。你知道，这，我认为这不是政府想做的事情，但它喜欢威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: I don't think I have personal odds on it. I will say, you know that now that the US has done this, everybody is thinking about what **Trump** might do next. Yeah. And that gives that gives the US more leverage than it had a week ago. That puts that puts the administration in a position to say like maybe we will, do something with Cuba. Maybe we will do something with Colombia, maybe we will push the Danes to give us more access to **Greenland**, to give us more rights, to allow us to erect more bases. Or we could just annex **Greenland** directly, you know, see, see what you're going to do about that. I think now that there's so much uncertainty about how the US is going to use its power, that creates space for the US to make all kinds of new demands and get new concessions. Even if, you know, actually annexing **Greenland** is really not on the cards. You know, it's it's I don't think it's something that the administration wants to do, but it likes to threaten it.

</details>

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 是的。据我所知，这次事件的官方**TikTok**版本似乎从未在任何地方报道过，但很难观察到一个你在没有自身伤亡的情况下抓走一个外国领导人的故事，而不认为内部有相当多的人知道这件事要发生，并且实际上已经倒戈等等。我们周围的每个与**特朗普**有某种紧张关系的领导人一定都吓坏了。比如，他们大概都对自己的核心圈子里谁是真正支持他们的人感到偏执。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. The, the the official like **TikTok** of how this went down as far as I know like hasn't really been reported anywhere but it it's hard to observe a story in which you snatch a foreign leader without suffering any casualties of your own, and not assume that there were quite a few people on the inside that knew this was coming, that had a de facto flipped, etc. every leader in our neighborhood who had some sort of, you know, tension with **Trump** must be terrified. Like, presumably they're all paranoid about who in their inner circle is really with them.

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我认为他们必须如此，我还认为这里有一个被低估的因素。好的。报道的故事。那就是技术方面，对吧？美国不仅仅派出了特种作战部队，也不仅仅与**马杜罗**政府内部的知情人士联络，以促成他的罢免，尽管他们几乎肯定这样做了，他们几乎肯定有**马杜罗**核心圈子的成员合作并促成了这次罢免。美国飞机干扰了委内瑞拉的通信，委内瑞拉的防空系统要么被美国飞机先发制人地摧毁，要么通过网络手段被击溃。据报道，美国首次使用了**自杀式无人机**。这是我们将更多听到的事情，因为这是一个对更积极使用无人机感兴趣的政府。**特朗普**吹嘘他们使用网络工具切断了加拉加斯的电力。我的意思是，这不仅仅是政府的意图。这是能力。对吧？美国，我们总是谈论美国是一个全球超级大国。它确实是，它是世界上唯一能做到这一点的国家之一。如果它想更多地这样做，那么世界各国都必须将这种风险考虑在内。还有一个我们不知道的因素。我们不知道美国军方拥有哪些能力，无论是网络、非对称还是动能作战，没有人真正了解。我们仍然没有完全了解**F-35**战斗机对老一代防空系统、老一代飞机的能力。这拓宽了我们对21世纪战争面貌的理解，这正在制造更多的不确定性和担忧。

**Gregory Brew**: I think I think they have to be, I also think there's a kind of an underreported element here. Okay. Reported story. And that's the technical like the technological side of it, right? The US didn't just send in special operations teams and didn't just liaise with insiders within the **Maduro** government, to, you know, facilitate his removal, although they almost certainly did, they were almost certainly were members of Materials Inner Circle who collaborated and facilitated this removal. US aircraft jammed Venezuelan communications, Venezuelan air defenses were either destroyed, preemptively by, US aircraft or they were knocked out through cyber. Means the US reportedly used suicide drones for the first time. Which is something we're going to hear more about because this is an administration that's interested in using drones more aggressively. **Trump** bragged that they knocked power out in Caracas using cyber tool. I mean, it's it's not just the intent that the administration has. It's the capabilities. Right? The U.S, we always talk about the US being a global superpower. It is it's one of the only countries in the world that can do this. And if it wants to start doing it more, it's a risk that states around the world are going to have to take into consideration. There's also the element of what we don't know. We don't know all the capabilities that the US military has at its disposal, be it cyber, be it asymmetric, be it, you know, kinetic operations, nobody really we still don't have a fully, formed picture of what the **F-35** can do against older generations of air defenses, older generations of aircraft. This opens up the aperture of, you know, what's, 21st century warfare looks like, and that's creating even more uncertainty and even more concern.

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 新年伊始，我们已经在谈论**自杀式无人机**了，**乔**。

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 是的，我知道这将是疯狂的一年。我意识到我们在这整个对话中，我认为有一件事我们没有提到，这可能也是时代的标志，那就是我们根本没有谈论**欧佩克**。而周末发生的另一件事是，**欧佩克**举行了一次会议，他们讨论了暂停或继续暂停他们的生产配额，因为油价低迷。**欧佩克**现在还重要吗？您有没有感觉到主要的**欧佩克**成员国对委内瑞拉的行动有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I know it's going to be an insane year. I realize one thing we haven't mentioned in this entire conversation, I think, and that's probably a sign of the times, is we haven't talked about **OPEC** at all. And this was the other thing that happened over the weekend was there was an **OPEC** meeting where they talked about pausing or continuing to pause their, production quotas because of the low oil price. Does **OPEC** matter anymore? And have you gotten any sense of like what the major **OPEC** **OPEC** players are actually thinking about this Venezuela action?

</details>

### 欧佩克的未来战略

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 嗯，首先我要说，你知道，鉴于委内瑞拉的产量已经下降到如此低的水平，它现在是**欧佩克**的一个边缘成员。由于受到制裁，它被豁免了减产和生产配额。顺便说一句，伊朗和利比亚也处于同样的情况。委内瑞拉的产量确实不高。实际上，**欧佩克**现在是通过**欧佩克+联盟**，由**海湾合作委员会**加上俄罗斯组成。这些才是真正重要的成员。而且它们确实很重要。我的意思是，**欧佩克**在过去一年里所做的事情，逐步撤回减产，向市场投放更多原油，发出信号表示他们将生产更多，即使价格下跌。这是一种相当深思熟虑的策略，是在多年试图通过减产来管理市场之后出现的。他们现在发出了信号，表示他们对价格下跌感到满意，只要他们能够夺回市场份额，并减少过剩的备用产能。我的意思是，在去年，或者说在2024年，市场上可能有三到四百万桶的备用产能。当你有那么多备用原油闲置时，这将对价格形成一个相当坚实的上限。**欧佩克**正在试图解除这种状况。他们对价格下跌感到满意，我认为在2026年，布伦特原油价格可能会低至每桶50美元。在美国，**WTI**价格已经跌到50美元了，但**欧佩克**正在展望未来。他们正在展望2027年、2028年。他们认为到那时，他们将在一个更强的市场地位上出现。他们将挤压他们的竞争对手，包括美国的竞争对手，他们将拥有更大的市场份额和更少的备用产能。这将对价格形成一个上限。他们认为，你知道，2026年我们将有50美元的原油，然后2028年、2029年、2030年将有80美元，甚至可能90美元的原油。毋庸置疑，他们认为需求不会很快达到顶峰。他们认为市场将继续增长，可能比过去慢一点，但不会因为能源转型或任何其他因素而开始下降。这就是**欧佩克**正在下注的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: Well, first I would say, you know, Venezuela is a marginal member of **OPEC** at this point, given how low its production has fallen. It's excuse from production cuts and production quotas because it's under sanction. Incidentally, Iran is in the same position as is Libya. Venezuela doesn't produce very much. Really. **OPEC** is the **GCC** plus Russia at this point through the **OPEC plus alliance**. Those are really the members that matter. And they do matter. I mean, what **OPEC** has done over the last year, progressively pulling back production cuts, putting more crude on the market, signaling that they're going to produce more, even with prices falling. That's a pretty deliberate strategy coming after years of trying to manage markets by cutting production, they've now signaled that they're okay with prices falling, as long as they're able to retake market share and also reduce the amount of spare capacity that's hanging over. I mean, in the last year, or in 2024, there was maybe three, maybe 4 million barrels of spare capacity that was just hanging over the market. And that's going to put a pretty, firm ceiling on prices when you have that much spare crude just lying on the sidelines. **OPEC** is trying to unwind that. They're they're comfortable with prices falling, I think in 2026 maybe as low as, you know, in the 50s. Per barrel for Brant. It's already in the 50s here in the US. The **WTI** price but **OPEC** is looking ahead. They're looking into 2027 2028. And they reckon that by that point they'll be coming out in a stronger market position. They'll have squeezed their competitors, including their competitors in the US, and they'll have a bigger chunk of the market and less spare capacity. That will put a ceiling on prices. And they reckon, you know, we'll have $50 crude in 2026 and then 80, maybe even $90 crude 2028, 2029, 2030. Needless to say, they don't see demand peaking anytime soon. They reckon the market's going to continue to grow, maybe a little bit more slowly than it has in the past, but it's not going to start declining, due to the energy transition or any other factor. That's the bet that **OPEC** is making.

### 马杜罗事件对盟友的影响

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 那么，这次事件对委内瑞拉或**马杜罗**的一些朋友，比如伊朗、中国、俄罗斯等，有什么重要意义吗？就像，你知道，显然对中国来说，他们可以从其他地方获得石油等等，但这对他们有什么实际意义吗？或者他们只是意识形态上的朋友？他们有什么实际的利害关系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So does this, event mean anything significant to some of Venezuela's or **Maduro**'s friends? You know, Iran, China? Russia, etc.? Like, as you know, as obviously it seems like to, you know, China, they'll be able to they can get oil from other places, etc. but like, is there any real significance to that or will they just sort of like sort of ideological friends? Are there any real stakes for them?

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 那么我将从中国人开始说起。有一件事被稍微掩盖了，那就是有一个中国代表团在加拉加斯。是的。是的。就在前一天，这对他们来说太疯狂了。而且你知道，如果你是中国，如果你是**习近平**，你正处于与美国某种“软和解”之中，对吧。**特朗普**将前往中国。他们将在2026年举行会晤。将会有场边会议。他们正在努力管理他们的关系。**特朗普**想要达成协议。所有这些。他们不想要对抗。如果你处于这种境地，你派了一个代表团去委内瑞拉，然后美国突然派**三角洲特种部队**绑架了总统，而且他们事先没有告诉你，那将是令人震惊的。中国发表了一份声明，他们以非常明确的措辞表达了对这一行动的震惊。我认为这不一定是因为他们爱**马杜罗**，他们对美国进来带走他感到愤怒。我认为他们更生气的是美国没有事先告诉他们这件事会发生。但在石油方面，是的，中国可以从其他来源获得原油，包括伊朗。你知道，**乔**，你可能很清楚，**特蕾西**也一样。我也报道伊朗。是的。**欧亚集团**。所以我花了很多时间思考伊朗。伊朗人现在非常害怕。他们极度偏执，因为**特朗普**也一直在推特上谈论正在发生的抗议活动。他一直在说，你知道，美国将介入。伊朗人一直非常担心以色列会再次轰炸他们。他们对此极度担忧。他们的经济状况非常糟糕。他们极度担心，你知道，在对付**马杜罗**之后，美国会转而对付他们。所以他们正在发出信号，表示他们可能会做些什么。他们警告说他们可能会先发制人地攻击。那个地区局势正在升温。关于俄罗斯，我认为**普京**并不担心。委内瑞拉对俄罗斯来说是一个软弱的伙伴。他们有交易。他们有关系。我认为莫斯科对加拉加斯的**德尔西·罗德里格斯**政府进行了一定程度的接触。所以他们希望保持那里的关系。但我认为他们并没有为**马杜罗**被扫地出门而流太多眼泪。我也不认为**普京**担心美国会对他做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: So I I'll start with the Chinese. And one thing that got buried a little bit was that the there was a Chinese delegation in Caracas. Yeah. Yeah. Like the day before that was. Was so crazy for them. And you know, if you're China, if you're **XI Jinping**, and you are in the midst of a sort of soft rapprochement with the United States, right. **Trump** is going to go to China. They're going to meet in 2026. There's going to be sideline meetings. They're trying to manage their relationship. **Trump** wants a deal. And all of that. They don't want a confrontation. If you're in that position and you send a delegation to Venezuela, and then suddenly the US flies in **Delta Force** and kidnaps the president and they don't tell you beforehand, that's going to be alarming. The Chinese put out a statement where they they expressed their alarm in very explicit terms, regarding this action, I don't think it was necessarily that they love **Maduro** and they were, you know, mad that the US came in and took him. I think they were more mad that the US didn't tell them in advance that this was going to happen. But on the oil side, yeah, China can get their crude from from other sources, including Iran. You know, as as Joe, you probably well know and Tracy as well. I also cover Iran. Yeah. Racial groups. So I, I spent a lot of time thinking about Iran. And the Iranians are terrified right now. They're extremely paranoid, that the US because **Trump**'s also been tweeting about the protests that are happening. He's been saying, you know, the US is going to get involved. The Iranians have been very worried that the Israelis are going to bomb them again. They're they're extremely concerned about that. There's their economy is doing very poorly. They're extremely worried that, you know, after doing **Maduro**, the US is going to turn on them. So they're they're signaling that they could do something. There's they're warning that they could attack preemptively. Tensions are rising in that quarter, on Russia, I don't think **Putin** is concerned. Venezuela was kind of a soft partner for Russia. They had dealings. They had, relations. There has been, I think, a certain amount of outreach from Moscow to Caracas towards the **Delsey Rodriguez** government. So they want to retain their relationship there. But I don't think they're shedding many tears about **Maduro** being being swept away. I also don't think **Putin** is worried that the US is going to try to do the same to him.

### 伊朗与古巴的未来走向

**乔·魏森塔尔**: 您能对未来一个月美国对伊朗采取某种行动的可能性给出一个百分比吗？比如说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Can you put a sort of percentage likelihood on some sort of US action on Iran in the next, I don't know, month? Let's say

</details>

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 我会说下个月的可能性很低，低于50%。公开行动。我认为美国不会开始轰炸伊朗或派兵进入之类的。有几个原因。第一，我认为**特朗普**不感兴趣直接参与其中。我认为他会威胁，但我认为仍然对在任何地方派兵持谨慎态度。伊朗的抗议活动非常暴力。它们清楚地表明了对政府内部的不满和异议。它们也相当小规模，并且引发了伊朗警察和内部安全部门相当积极的反应。所以它们不像，比如说，阿拉伯之春中的埃及，那里有数十万抗议者走上街头，对政府施加巨大压力，并且还，你知道，让军队倒戈。埃及军队改变了立场。我们离伊朗的情况还差得很远。我认为**特朗普**不想被卷入潜在的泥潭。秘密行动是另一回事。这就是以色列真正发挥作用的地方。以色列在伊朗内部拥有比美国更多的能力。他们能够做很多事情。与此同时，以色列一直保持着一种姿态，他们说，如果伊朗试图重建其核计划，如果他们继续制造导弹，我们就会发动袭击。我们将采取行动，因为这些是我们所关心的。而伊朗人正在继续制造导弹，他们今天，1月6日，正在威胁如果压力继续增加，他们将先发制人地攻击。那里的紧张局势正在变得非常非常高。我认为美国不会直接介入，但未来一个月以色列采取更多行动的可能性肯定存在。而且我敢说，几乎肯定在2026年上半年，我认为我们将看到以色列对伊朗发动新的袭击。既然我们随意提到了其他国家，并考验您的能力，请告诉我们关于古巴的情况。这对古巴意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Brew**: I would say low in the next month, below 50%. Public action. I don't think the US is going to start, you know, bombing Iran or sending troops in or anything like that. For a couple of reasons. One, I don't think **Trump** is interested in getting that directly involved. I think he threatens it. But I think there's still, a wariness of putting boots on the ground anywhere. The protests in Iran are very violent. They, are a clear demonstration of internal dissatisfaction and dissent towards the government. They're also fairly small, and they've been they've triggered a quite, active response from Iran's, police and internal security services. So they they don't it's it's not in the realm of, say, like Egypt in the, in the Arab Spring, where you had hundreds of thousands of protesters, you know, coming out, putting huge amount of pressure on a government, and facility and also, you know, turning the military, right. The Egyptian military switched sides. We're not even close to that in Iran. And I don't think **Trump** wants to get pulled into a potential quagmire doing stuff covertly. Is another matter. And that's where the Israelis really come into play. Israel has a lot of capabilities inside Iran, more so than the US. They're capable of doing a lot. At the same time, the Israelis have retained a posture where they say, if if Iran tries to rebuild their nuclear program and if they continue to build missiles, we will strike. We will take action, because those are the concerns that we have. And the Iranians are continuing to build missiles, and they are now today, January 6th, threatening to attack preemptively if the pressure continues to build. The tensions are getting very, very high there. I don't think the US is going to get directly involved, but the possibility of more Israeli action in the next month, is, is is certainly there. And I would say almost certainly in the first half of 2026, I think we're going to see new, strikes by Israel on. Iran, just since we're throwing out random countries and sort of testing your, tell us about Cuba. What does this mean for Cuba?

**格雷戈里·布鲁**: 所以我认为，古巴很可能在议程上。可以说。我认为既然他们在委内瑞拉已经做了他们想做的事情，我们将会听到更多关于古巴的消息。显然，国务卿**马尔科·卢比奥**长期以来一直对哈瓦那政府感兴趣，即使不是推翻它，也是对哈瓦那施加更大的压力。委内瑞拉是古巴的伙伴。委内瑞拉是原油的主要来源。所以委内瑞拉成为美国对加拉加斯新政府姿态的另一个要素，将是把他们从古巴身边拉开，使古巴在西半球更加孤立。我认为短期内不太可能发生军事行动，因为他们还有很多工作要在委内瑞拉完成。而且，很快转向另一个大国，对他们来说会很困难。但我确实认为这将在未来进入美国的政策考量。

**Gregory Brew**: So I think I think Cuba is very much on the menu. So to speak. I think we're going to hear more about Cuba now that they have done what they want to do in Venezuela. Obviously, Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** has a long running, interest in, if not toppling the government in Havana, then putting a great deal more pressure on Havana. Venezuela was a partner of Cuba. A Venezuela was the main source of crude oil. So Venezuela being another element of the US posture towards the new government in Caracas, is going to be to pull them away from Cuba, to isolate Cuba even more in the Western Hemisphere. I don't think military action is likely in the near term, because they still have a lot of work to do with Venezuela. And, moving on very quickly, to another large country, it's going to be difficult for them. But I do think it's going to enter into U.S. policy moving forward.

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. De Niro. Yeah, I got it. Greg is so good. I love.

**特蕾西·阿洛韦**: 太棒了。是的。他带来了历史视角。是的，他很棒，我认为对于这样的事情你需要这种视角，这不仅仅是一个市场故事。这更是一个地缘政治故事。不，这确实是，你知道，**特朗普**总统最近有一句关于稀土的话，我今天可能会在时事通讯中写到。他说稀土其实并不那么稀有，这是真的。这是我们谈论的事情之一，就像人们喜欢说的那样。但稀有的是提炼它们并从中获得任何商业价值的基础设施。对。那才是真正稀缺的。我觉得这是很多石油对话中总是被忽视的一点，比如3000亿桶石油完全没有意义，如果你没有所有必要的方面来实际规模化生产，经济地生产。所以，我猜，从日常交易的石油市场的角度来看，我并不惊讶，至少需要数年时间，这种石油才能在某种程度上真正影响市场。对。再说一遍，我知道石油行业的工作周期很长，但当布伦特原油价格在每桶60美元，**WTI**更低时，我认为很难证明我们应该在委内瑞拉投入数十亿美元，而他们甚至没有在美国启动钻井平台。我看到的另一件事是，你知道，关于这个特定故事的头条新闻铺天盖地。我想我们应该提一下，我们是在1月6日录制这个节目的。但是，你知道，**特朗普**刚刚说，他们也许可以使用公共资金来鼓励石油公司，美国石油公司，投资委内瑞拉。这对我来说似乎也很难推销。你认为米德兰的那些人会怎么看？我们要用公共资金来扩大供应并进一步压低价格。是的。轻描淡写地说，这很难推销。顺便问一下，你看了《**大地之子**》这部剧吗？

**Tracy Alloway**: So good. Yeah. And he brings that historical perspective. Yeah he's great in which I think you need for something like this, which isn't just a market story. It's very much a geopolitical story. No, it's really you know, there was a quote I might write about it in the newsletter today. There was a quote recently from, President **Trump** about rare earths. He's like rare earths, really aren't that rare, which is true. And it's one of those things that we talk about, like people like to say. But what's rare is the infrastructure to refine them and actually get anything commercial with it. Right. That actually is scarce. And I feel like this is the thing that always gets missed. And a lot of these oil conversation, like, $300 billion of oil is totally meaningless if you don't have the all the aspects in place to actually produce it at scale, produce it economically. And so I'm not surprised, I guess, that from the perspective of like the oil market that trades day to day, it seems like at minimum it's going to be years before this oil like to the extent that there's some change actually moves the market. Right. And again, I know the oil industry does work on long timeframes, but when you have oil at $60 a barrel on Brant Lower on **WTI**, I, it seems really hard to make the case that like we should go in and spend billions in Venezuela when they're not even starting rigs in the US. The other thing I saw, you know, the headlines are flying thick and fast on this particular story. And I guess we should just mention that we're we're recording this on January 6th. But, you know, **Trump** just said that maybe they could use public money to encourage oil companies to invest in Venezuela, US oil companies. And that seems a hard sell to me as well. How do you think the guys in Midland are going to take that? We're going to use public money to expand supply and depress prices further. Yeah. Hard sell, putting it mildly. By the way, have you watched **land Man** the show?
