### 成功与权力观

**Michael Ovitz**: 我做生意不是为了赢得人气竞赛，我是为了赢。你知道，当**迈克尔·基顿**把《**侏罗纪公园**》那本书给我时，我为它找到了合适的导演——**史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格**，没有第二个选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I didn't go into business to win a popularity contest. I went into business to win. You know, when **Michael Kiteon** gave me the book of **Jurassic Park**, I put the right director with it. **Steven Spieler**, there was no second choice.

</details>

**Shane**: 你在好莱坞长期占据前排位置，你认为人们在哪里出了错？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: You had a front row seat to Hollywood for a long time. Where did people go wrong?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为他们在娱乐业制定的那些权力榜单纯粹是胡说八道。权力是转瞬即逝的东西，它稍纵即逝，不会持久。如果你不相信，看看任何曾经拥有权力的人就知道了。它就像一份租约，有终止日期，而且结局通常都不好。我被很多朋友视为世界上最好的朋友，也是世界上最糟糕的敌人。对我来说，成功是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I thought these power lists that they developed in the entertainment business were just sheer nonsense. It's an ephemeral thing power [music] and it's fleeting and it doesn't last. And if you don't believe that, take a look at anyone that's had it. It's like a lease. It has a closed end and never a good one. I have been viewed by a lot of my friends as the world's best friend and the world's worst enemy. Success to me is

</details>

**Shane**: 我认为这是我在200多集节目中听到的最美的答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I think that's the most beautiful answer I've heard in 200 and some episodes.

</details>

### 学习与知识的力量

**Shane**: 我欣赏你的一点是你对学习的强烈渴望。你从**威廉·莫里斯**的档案室开始，接触到所有这些资料，就像你、**大卫·格芬**、**巴里·迪勒**一样，都在档案室里阅读历史，走着同样的道路。你认为对于那些想在工作中出人头地的人来说，现代的等价物是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: One of the things that I admire about you is your voracious appetite for learning and you started in the **William Morris** file room and you had access to all these but it was like you **David Geffen** **Barry Diller** all the same sort of path in the file room reading the history. What's the modern equivalent of that do you think for people out there wanting to get ahead at work?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我不知道，这是一个很好的问题。坦白说，我不太确定，因为我热爱互联网，我热爱使用电脑，以至于我的另一半有时想杀了我，因为我就是喜欢在网上冲浪，深入探索各种“兔子洞”。首先，**大卫·格芬**、**巴里·迪勒**和我是非常不同的人，但我们确实有几个非常相似的特质。我们三个人都在娱乐业的早期摸爬滚打，我们三个人都对学习有着强烈的渴望，我们三个人都对阅读有着强烈的渴望。**大卫**和**巴里**是我认识的最聪明的人之二，他们对一切都了如指掌。如果你和他们交谈，你会发现他们的阅读量惊人。这些人没有上过大学，但他们的阅读量比我认识的任何领域的博士都要多。其次，我们三个人作为邮件收发室的员工，都证明了教育是通往成功的捷径。我常对与我共事的人说一句话：知识就是力量。它既能为你所用，也能对你不利。如果你拥抱它，利用它，阅读，并尝试在脑中建立上下文索引，它就能为你所用。如果它把你变成一个律师，它就会对你不利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I don't I you know it's a really great question. I'm not sure, frankly, because one of my I I love the internet and I love being on my computer to the point where um [laughter] my significant other wants to kill me sometimes because I just love surfing through the internet and going down rabbit holes. First of all, there's a **David Geffin** and **Barry Diller** and I are very dissimilar human beings, but we do share a couple of very similar traits. All three of us cut our teeth in the early years uh in the entertainment business. All three of us have voracious appetites for learning and all three of us have voracious appetite to read. **David** and **Barry** are two of the smartest guys that I know and they're on top of everything. If you talk to them, you know, it's extraordinary how well read they are. These guys didn't go to college. They're better read than most PhDs that I know in any field. And secondly, we all three demonstrated that as mail room employees where we knew the quickest path was education. I have a thing I always say to people that work with me. Knowledge is power. And it works for you and against you. And it works for you if you embrace it, use it, read, and try to index it in your head for context. Works against you if it turns you into a lawyer. And lying is a

</details>

### CA的团队协作与诚信原则

**Michael Ovitz**: 当我74年在**CA**（Creative Artists Agency）开始工作时，我清楚地认识到说谎是娱乐业的一个行业问题。每个人都不说实话。他们不说实话的原因之一是，他们不知道“知识就是力量”这个词，但他们本能地知道自己必须有一个答案。所以你可以打电话给经纪人问一个问题，他们觉得有必要给出一个答案。这样做，他们有时会，甚至超过一半的时间会编造答案。所以我们制定了一些非常简单的规则，回想起来，我震惊于它们是多么具有革命性，但它们确实很简单。对我来说，这就像是傻瓜逻辑：如果你没有答案就不要撒谎。这是你的答案：**Shane**，我会给你回电话，因为我不知道那个问题的答案，但我会去查清楚。这是高度可接受的。在娱乐业，每个人都认为自己无所不知。他们知道一切。顺便说一句，那是不可能的，根本不可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: when I started at **CA** in 74 it became very clear to me that lying was a industrial problem in the entertainment business. Everybody didn't tell the truth. One of the reasons they did not tell the truth is since they didn't know the term knowledge is power but they knew it innately that they had to have an answer. So you could call up an agent and ask them a question. They felt this necessity to have an answer. And by doing that, they'd sometimes more than half the time make it up. So we started some very simple rules which I was shocked in retrospect how revolutionary there were, but they were simple. To me, it was like simpleton logic. Don't lie if you don't have an answer. Here's your answer. Tell you what, **Shane**, I'm gonna get back to you because I don't know the answer to that question, but I'm going to find out. That's highly acceptable. Entertainment business, everybody knows everything. They know everything. It's not possible, by the way. Not possible.

</details>

**Shane**: 在大多数组织内部也是如此。每个人都会即兴编造一个答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: It's the same inside most organizations. Everybody will make up an answer on the fly. And

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我认为人们想表现出他们是知情的。但我认为，表现出你不知道并且想去查清楚是完全可以的。我们做的第二件事是坚持团队合作，这让所有人都感到震惊，因为在过去75年里，都是一个客户一个经纪人，我们不允许那样做。我们所有的客户都有多个经纪人，所以他们可以和很多不同的人交谈。我在**CA**的那些年里，我们从未失去过一个客户。原因就是如果他们厌倦了一个人，他们就会去找下一个人。但每个人都对他们的职业生涯了如指掌，我是说，实时更新。我们的内部办公室规定是，你必须先回答你的同事，然后才是客户，然后才是买家。我们基本上都是互相赋能的。如果你看看，这个论点的排列组合是无穷无尽的。你无法击败它。顺便说一句，这也是我们吸引大多数主要在职人才的原因之一。我们对谁处理谁没有丝毫的自我意识。我们对传递信息没有丝毫的自我意识。我们对任何事情都没有自我意识，因为客户才是搞自我意识的，而不是我们。他们有自我意识不是因为他们自己，而是因为他们是电影明星。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: well, I think people want to show that they're in the know. And I think it's just very fine to show that you're not and that you want to find out. And then the second thing we did was insist on teamwork, which was shocking to everybody because in, you know, for 75 years, it was one client, one agent, and we would not allow that. All of our clients had multiple agents, so they could talk to a lot of different people. In the years I was at **CA**, we never lost a client. And the reason was if they tired of one person, they'd go to the next. But everyone was up to speed. I mean, up to the minute on their career. Um, our inner office rule was you had to answer your associates first before the clients, before the buyers. And we were all basically empowered by each other. And it, if you look at it, the permutation of that thesis is to the hundth power. You can't beat it. And by the way, it's one of the reasons we attracted most of the major working talent. We didn't have any ego about who handled who. We didn't have any ego about passing information. We didn't have any ego about anything because the clients were in the ego business, not us. They had egos not on their own. It was imputed to them because they were movie stars.

### 好莱坞的挑战与艺术家的不易

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为，除了成为物理学家、脑外科医生或任何外科医生之外，世界上最困难的事情之一就是成为演员、导演或编剧。编剧是一项孤独的运动，一个孤独的职业。你通常是独自一人。有些人有搭档，但大多数没有。你必须凭空创造。我发现艺术家、画家、雕塑家也是如此。他们凭空创造事物的能力让我印象深刻。我喜欢它。这就是我热爱艺术的原因，他们可以创造出令人愉悦或具有挑战性的东西。导演每天要做300个决定。即使是小事情，比如桌子上的玻璃在第二个镜头中放错了位置，你的错误也会被后人记录下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And I think I think they have I think one of the most difficult things in the world to do besides being a physicist or a brain surgeon or a any kind of surgeon I think is being an actor or a director or a writer. Uh writers are it's a lonely sport. It's a lonely vocation. You're by yourself usually. Some have partners, most don't. And you got to create out of thin air. Um, I find artists in the same boat, painters, sculptors. They I'm I'm wildly impressed by the fact that they create things out of nothing. I love it. That's why I love art, that they can create something that's either pleasing or challenging. Directors make 300 decisions a day. And just little things like if the glass on the table's in the wrong place for the second shot, your mistake is noted for posterity.

</details>

**Shane**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Yeah. [snorts]

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 你总是能读到内容中的错误。人们喜欢抓住这些错误。作为一名演员，我记得有一次和**保罗·纽曼**坐在一起，他是一个非常可爱的人，非常渴望过正常生活。他真的想成为普通人中的一员。他开始赛车，当他在赛道上时，他不是电影明星**保罗·纽曼**，他就是普通人**保罗·纽曼**。我以前经常和他一起去看比赛，我们还一起玩卡丁车。有一天晚上，我在他居住的康涅狄格州韦斯特波特和他在一起，我们在一家当地餐馆吃饭，他讨厌人们在他吃饭时过来打扰他。其他时候他都不介意，他很乐意签名。我当时正在把人们赶走。我说：“**保罗**，我必须问你一个问题。和你在一起很有趣。你和我的其他朋友没什么不同。你只是长得好看得多，而且你会演戏，我们都不会。大家都在告诉你，你是自车轮发明以来最伟大的人，你有一双最美的眼睛，你是这个，你是那个。你如何看待这一切？”他看着我说：“**迈克尔**，你知道吗？我一点都不相信，但过了一段时间，你就会开始受到影响，你就会开始想，也许吧，你知道，我认为这是一个艰难的差事。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And you always read about mistakes in content. People love to catch it. And as an actor, I remember once sitting with **Paul Newman**, who was the loveliest man and wanted so hard to be normal. He really wanted to be one of the guys. He took up racing and he was when he was at the track, he was not **Paul Newman** the movie star. He was **Paul Newman** the guy. And I used to go with him all the time to races and we used to go race go-karts together. And I was with him one night in Westport, Connecticut where he lived and we were at a local restaurant and he hated when people came up to him while he was eating. He didn't care any other time. He was really cool about signing autographs. And I'm shoeing people away. And I said, "Paul, I got to ask you a question. You're you're fun to be with. You're no different than any of my other friends. You just happen to be a lot better looking and you can act, which none of us can. How is it that How do you take it with everyone telling you you're the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel? You have the best eyes. You're this. You're that." And he looked at me, he said, "Michael, you know what? I don't believe any of it, but after a certain amount of time, it starts to get to you and you start to think maybe, you know, and I think it's a tough gig. Really? Do

</details>

**Shane**: 也许我们把这个问题反过来问一下。你在好莱坞长期占据前排位置。人们在哪里出了错？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: is maybe let's invert this question a little bit. You've had a front row seat to Hollywood for a long time. Where do people go wrong? [sighs]

</details>

**Shane**: 他们是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What are they?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我认为每个人犯的第一个错误就是他们开始相信不真实的事情。人们倾向于欺骗自己。我发现这是所有行业中所有人的共同点。它无处不在。如果你开始相信你比别人优秀，或者你的新闻报道是准确的，无论是好是坏，或者你以任何方式优越。我们都是人类，我们都有不同的技能。有些运动员确实比其他人优秀，但这并不能使他们成为更好的人。有时，实际上，这会使他们成为更糟糕的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I think the first place everybody goes wrong is they start to believe things that aren't true. People tend to deceive themselves. I find that to be a common denominator amongst everybody across every kind of industry. It happens everywhere. If you start believing that you're better than others or that your press is accurate, good or bad, or that you are superior in any way. We're all humans and we all have different skill sets. Now, some athletes are just better than others, but that doesn't make them better people. Sometimes it makes them worse people, actually.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为在好莱坞很容易在很多方面犯错。你可能在人际关系方面犯错。你可能在自我意识方面犯错。你可能在相信自己不是什么方面犯错。你可能在日常生活中犯一些简单的错误，而这些错误在其他行业中别人可能不会犯。好莱坞也是一个极其社交化的活动。一切都是社交活动。我一直觉得好莱坞是为那些没有伴侣、没有孩子、没有家、没有家庭，除了可能有一套两居室公寓的人而生的，因为他们一年365个晚上都可以出去，找到同舟共济的伙伴，做点什么。在大多数职业中你都找不到这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And I think it's very easy to slip up in Hollywood in many directions. You can slip up in the relationship area. You can slip up in the ego area. You can slip up in uh believing you're something that you're not. you can slip up in uh just simple mistakes in daily life that others might not make in different vocations. Uh Hollywood's also an incredibly social event. Everything's a social event. Uh, I always felt that Hollywood was manufactured for people that had no significant others, no children, no home, no family, nothing except maybe a two-bedroom apartment cuz they could go out 365 nights a year and find companionship with others in the same boat and do something. [snorts] You can't find that in most vocations.

### 创业者的特质与科技投资

**Shane**: 我想回到**CA**和你的一些简单规则。所以你有团队合作和说实话。还有哪些规则？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What [snorts] are I want to come back to CIA and some of the simple rules that you had. So you had teamwork and you had tell the truth. What are the other ones?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 每个人都必须博览群书。人们不允许推荐他们不相信的角色或材料。这是我之前在经纪行业多年来的一个大弊病，就是人们会为了让你相信他们不相信的东西而冒险。那是链条上一个真正的薄弱环节。我们没有那种情况。你必须对你所做的事情充满热情。我实行开放政策。周五下午，任何人都可以进来给我一些东西阅读。但由于我一个周末只能读一定数量的剧本，所以他们必须对此充满热情。你知道，我记得我们有一个年轻的经纪人叫**艾米·格罗斯曼**。她是一名文学经纪人，非常出色。一天下午她来找我，说：“我读到了一篇你必须读的东西。”我说：“好的。”我给了每个人大约两分钟的时间来推销它，因为，顺便说一句，我现在在我的科技投资中也做同样的事情。如果你不能在20秒内告诉我你的业务是关于什么的，你就不应该做你的业务，因为你将如何向世界推销它？你必须……我不是在谈论人工智能的技术算法。我是在谈论它做什么？她走进来，说：“你的客户**鲍勃·汤恩**，他是电影界最伟大的编剧之一，他写了《**唐人街**》、《**灰姑娘自由**》和《**泰山**》，以及社区里写过的最好的剧本。我刚刚读了他兄弟**罗杰·汤恩**写的一个剧本，值得我们公司，也就是**CA**的关注，因为我们公司是一个团队。所以如果你带来一个剧本，然后几个资深人士读了并认可了它，它就会得到很多关注。所以它必须是好的，因为我们投入了大量的资产。归根结底，我们拥有的只是时间，而时间流逝得非常快。我的意思是，在……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Everyone had to be incredibly well read. Um people were not allowed to recommend roles or material that they didn't believe in. That was a big downfall of the agency business for all the years I was in it before, which is people would take a flyer to try to get you convinced of something they didn't believe in. That's a real weak link in the chain. We didn't have any of that. You had to have a passion for what [snorts] you were doing. I had an open door policy. Friday afternoons, anyone could come in and give me something to read. But since I could only read a certain number of scripts on a weekend, they had to be incredibly passionate about it. And you know, I remember a young agent we had named **Amy Grossman**. She was a literary agent and she was terrific. And she came in to me one afternoon and said, "I've read something you've got to read." And I said, "Okay." And I gave everybody like two minutes to sell it to me because, and by the way, I do the same thing in my tech investing right now. If you can't tell me what your business is about in 20 seconds, you should not do your business because how are you going to market it to the world? You've [snorts] got to and I'm not talking about that technical algorithms of AI. I'm talking about what does it do? And she walked in. She said, "Your client **Bob Town**, who was one of the great writers in the in the movie business, wrote um uh **Chinatown** and **Cinderella Liberty** and uh **Tarzan** and some of the best scripts ever written in in the community. I just read a script by his brother, **Roger Town**, that deserves attention by this company, by **CA**, because our company worked as a group. So if you brought a script in and then a couple of the senior people read it and endorsed it, it got a lot of attention. So it had to be good because we put a lot of assets on it. And at the end of the day, all we have is our time and you run out of time very fast. I mean, in the

</details>

**Shane**: 经纪业务中，我们就像单臂贴墙纸的人，你知道吗？我的意思是，根本没有时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: agency business, we were like one arm wallpaper hangers, you know? I mean, there's just no time.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 她说：“这是剧本的内容。”她说：“这是一个失意的家伙回到职业棒球队的故事。他是一个失意的棒球运动员，在晚年回来，这是他的旅程。”我对此有点心动。我还记得我脑子里有一个索引，我们的客户**罗伯特·雷德福**正在寻找一部棒球电影。所以我把剧本带回家。我读完后立刻给她打电话。我说：“这是一部很棒的电影。很棒的电影。需要一些修改，但很棒的电影。”我说：“我知道。我有一个很好的主意如何把它组合起来。”我说：“我会告诉你，然后你诚实地告诉我你的想法。”因为我们注重直接、诚实和真相。这对我们至关重要。告诉你的客户真相。娱乐业的人总是被欺骗。我会看到经纪人告诉他们的客户，他们刚刚看了一部电影，或者刚刚看了样片，但样片很糟糕，出了问题，需要重拍。他们会说：“哦，你看起来很棒。”告诉他们想听的话。我们从没那样做过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: and she said, "Here's what the script is about." And she said, "It's about a guy who's washed up and comes back to a professional baseball team. He's a washed up baseball player and at a later age, he comes back and it's his journey." I got a little tingle on that. And I also had indexed in my head that our client **Robert Redford** was looking for a baseball movie. So I took the script home. I read it and I called her the minute I finished. I said, "This is a great film. Great film. Needs some work, but great film." And I said, "I know. I have a great idea of how to put it together." And I I said, "I'm going to tell you and tell me honestly what you think." Because we were about directness and honesty and truth. That was critical to us. Tell your clients the truth. People in the entertainment business were just always lied to. We would have I would see agents tell or their clients that they had just seen a film that was where where they had just seen dailies where they were no good and something was wrong and they needed to be reshot. They'd say, "Oh, you look great." Tell them what they want to hear. We never did that ever.

</details>

**Shane**: 告诉人们真相有没有艺术性？尤其是在涉及自我意识的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Is there an art to telling people the truth? Especially when there's ego involved.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 不，你只管说出来。你知道吗？有趣的是，他们会欣赏它。我希望被告知真相。但无论如何，我对**艾米**说，我们有一个导演，他是我作为编剧的第一个客户之一，名叫**巴里·莱文森**。我是在1969年看到他在一个地方电视节目中时，把他签为喜剧编剧的。但他有眼光，他对这个行业充满渴望，他很聪明，有视觉感，我知道他身上有某种东西。我们一起制作了他的第一部电影《**餐馆**》（Diner），这部电影取得了巨大的成功，所有演员都是不知名的新星，这证明他有眼光。我知道**雷德福**想拍一部棒球电影。我也知道**雷德福**在与**西德尼·波拉克**等一些最伟大的导演合作之后，再次与一位第二次执导的导演合作的可能性很小。但我决定投入自己和公司来支持它。我同时把剧本寄给了**鲍勃**和**巴里**，这很不寻常。通常你会一次只构建一个元素。他们俩都积极回应了。我打电话给**鲍勃**说：“我想带**巴里**去**圣丹斯**见你。”当我说：“但我得提醒你，他只拍过一部电影，但我对他很有信心。”值得**鲍勃**称赞的是，因为**鲍勃**是**圣丹斯**的创始人，喜欢实验电影和年轻人，他说：“让我见见他。”没有保证，没有承诺，但我会见他。所以我记得带着我的儿子**克里斯**，他当时大概六七岁，和我、**巴里**一起去了**圣丹斯**。我们和**鲍勃**坐在**圣丹斯**小屋里，他们相处得很好，我们当天就在那里打包了《**天生好手**》（The Natural）。然后我们又加入了**金·贝辛格**、**比尔·布里姆利**和**格伦·克洛斯**这三位客户，然后我们获得了融资，剩下的就是历史了。那是一部巨大的成功之作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: No, it's just you just say it. And they, you know what? It's interesting. They appreciate it. I want to be told the truth. But in any case, I said to **Amy**, we have a director we represent was one of my very first clients as a writer. His name is **Barry Levenson** and I signed him as a comedy writer when I saw him on a local television show in 1969. And but he had an eye and he had a lust for the business and he was smart and he was visual and I knew that he had something in him. and we put his first movie together called **Diner** and it was a huge success with all unknown cast that proved to be all up and cominging young stars which means he had an eye and I knew **Redford** wanted to do a baseball movie. I also knew the odds of **Redford** working with a second time director after having worked with some of the greats like **Sydney Pollock** and you know some of the best directors around that he probably wouldn't do it. But I decided to put my self and the company behind it and I sent **Bob** the script and I sent **Barry** the script both of them simultaneously which was unusual by the way. Usually you build a package one element at a time. [snorts] And they both responded positively. And I called **Bob** and I said, "I'd like to bring **Barry** to see you up at **Sundance**." He and when I said, "But I want to warn you, he's only done one movie, but I have a strong belief in this guy." And to **Bob**'s credit, because **Bob** was the founder of **Sundance** and liked experimental films and young people, he said, "Let me meet him." no guar no commitments but I'll meet him. So I remember taking my son **Chris** who at the time was about I don't six seven years old up to **Sundance** with me and **Barry** and we went and sat with **Bob** in the **Sundance** Lodge and they really hit it off and we packaged **the natural** that day right there. Then we put uh **Kim Basinger** and **Bill Brimley** and **Glen Close**, three other clients in and then we got it financed and it the rest is history. It was a huge hit.

</details>

**Shane**: 我喜欢你书中的一句话：“不要与你的工作作对。”你能为我解释一下吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: One of the quotes that I loved in your book was don't fight your job. Can you unpack that for me?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我的意思是多年来，作为一个提供建议的人，尽管我不再是经纪人，但我仍然每天不断地为朋友、前客户或与我合作的人提供建议，他们都在寻找不同的观点。我接到这样的电话，在这些讨论中，人们最常抱怨的首先是同事，然后是交易失败，然后是不喜欢自己的工作。我坚信你必须做你热爱的事情。我的意思是，我现在正在做一些事情，我每天早上都迫不及待地想起床。所以，如果你不能那样感受，你就不应该做这份工作，或者你应该寻找另一份工作，或者你应该问自己为什么如果你曾经喜欢这份工作现在却不快乐。所以，如果出现这种情况，有一整套飞行员检查清单可以查看。这很重要，因为如果你白天上班时都在挣扎，你就无法发挥你的能力或潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I I mean over the years I as a person who is in the business of giving advice, which even though I'm not an agent anymore, I still find myself doing that constantly on a daily basis for people that are friends or former clients or people I'm in business with. uh looking for another point of view. I get that call and in the course of those discussions a more likely than not people are their first complaint is usually about an associate then about a deal gone wrong and then about not liking their job. And I'm a huge believer that you have to do what you love doing. I mean, right now I'm doing something. I can't wait to get up every morning. So, if you can't feel that way, you shouldn't do the job or you should look for another job or you should ask yourself why you're not happy in the job if you were at one time. So, there's a whole there's a whole pilot's checklist to look at if that's the case. And it's important because if you're fighting going to work during the day, you're not going to perform to your capacity or potential

</details>

**Shane**: 而且你也不会出类拔萃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: and you're not going to be exceptional.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，你不会，你不会脱颖而出。归根结底，这一切都关乎卓越、脱颖而出、做好事和帮助他人。如果你个人不快乐，你就无法做到这些。你手上有一个无法启动的项目。

<details>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, you're not going to you're not going to stand out. And at the end of the day, that's what it's all about is excellence and standing out and doing good things and helping people. And you can't do any of that if you're personally unhappy. You have a non-starter on your hands.

**Michael Ovitz**: 你是我认识的人中人际关系最广的人之一。你是如何管理并与这么多人保持联系的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You're one of the people I know with probably the most relationships. How do you manage and keep in contact with so many people?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我爱人，所以这是一点。第二，我的沟通效率很高。嗯，我基本上，我收藏艺术品和人。这是我收藏的两样东西。艺术品很容易，因为它是一成不变的。你可以看着它，做出决定。人同样迷人，可能更迷人，但需要大量时间。如果我真的觉得这段关系是双向的，我就会投入时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I love people, so that's one thing. Two, I'm very uh efficient with my communications. Um, I also basically uh I collect art and people. Those are the two things I collect. And art is easy because it's static. You can look at it, you can make a decision. People is as fascinating, probably more fascinating, but takes a lot of time. And I put that time in if I really feel that the relationship's a two-way street.

**Shane**: 你在招聘人才时会看重什么？比如你们为**MoMA**（现代艺术博物馆）招聘了一位CEO，你们是怎么做的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What do you look for with people when you're hiring people? Like you guys hired a CEO for the **MoMA**. How did you go about doing that?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，这很有趣。我的投资理念，举例来说，我的招聘理念，以及我如何与生活中的其他人接触的理念，都基于我最初对创始人的感受，以及其次对所遇到的人的感受。我喜欢结识有趣的人，我很幸运，非常幸运，能够结识世界上最有趣的人，他们来自各行各业，从事各种职业。你知道，当我在70年代从事经纪业务时，我意识到娱乐业是一个封闭的生态系统，基本上一切都围绕着娱乐业。娱乐业之外没有生活。很少有人对内容之外的其他事物感兴趣。娱乐业中很少有人收藏艺术品。很少有人在晚餐时谈论除了娱乐和一点点政治之外的任何事情，但主要还是关于八卦，关于客户，关于谁惹了什么麻烦。所有这些我都觉得毫无兴趣。我特意让自己远离这个行业，每周都去纽约，在艺术界、戏剧界、知识界建立自己的影响力，因为我不想成为那种“一匹马”的人。我一直很欣赏那些有深度和广度，能谈论很多事情的人，我也身体力行。我们在74年的经纪公司里，有一份200行的月刊杂志和书籍的参考书目清单，因为它们不在一个单一的领域。我曾经是一个杂志迷。我不知道你是否知道，你可能不知道，但以前并不是总有互联网的。你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, it's interesting. my my thesis on investing for example, my thesis on hiring people and kind of my thesis on how I reach out in my life to other people is predicated on how I feel in the first case about the founder and in the second case about people that I meet and I like to meet interesting people and I am very lucky very lucky in that I get to meet some of the most interesting people in the world from all walks of life in every profession. You know, when I was in the agency business in the 70s, I realized that the entertainment business was a closedend ecosystem and basically everything was about the entertainment business. There was no life outside the entertainment business. There were very few people with other interests other than content. There were very few people that collected art in the entertainment business. There were very few people that talked at dinner about anything except entertainment and a little tiny bit about politics, but it was mostly about gossip and about, you know, clients and about who made what trouble someone was in. All things that I found absolutely uninteresting. And I made it a point to take myself away from the business, go to New York every single week, build a presence in the art community, in the theater community, in part of the intellectual community because I didn't want to be one of those kind of onehorse people. I always admired people that had great depth and breadth and could talk about many things and I practiced what I preached. We had at the agency in 74 a 200 single line list bibliography of monthly magazines and books to look at because and they weren't in a singular space and I had at one time and I was a magazine junkie. I don't know if you know this but the you probably aren't aware of this but there wasn't always an internet. Did you know that?

</details>

**Shane**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: No.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的。我以前每月在办公室或家里，或两者兼有，收到200多本杂志。每天我都会翻阅其中10到15本，然后撕下我需要深入阅读的东西。那是长篇阅读的时代，不是像今天这样没有人有注意力广度。所以所有写的东西，除了《**纽约客**》或《**大西洋月刊**》，或《**华盛顿邮报**》或《**纽约时报**》的深度文章，那是一个学习一点点关于一切的时代。它不断地向我证明自己。我最初这样做的原因是出于实用。我们的经纪人需要在多个学科中有所涉猎，才能与有不同兴趣的人交谈。所以当我遇到**保罗·纽曼**时，我很轻松就能与他交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah. [laughter] And I used to get over 200 magazines a month at my office or house or both. And every single day I'd thumb through 10 or 15 of them and I'd I'd tear out things I needed to read in depth. Those were the days of long form, not short form, like today where no one has any attention span. So all the things that are written or except in the New York or in the Atlantic or or an in-depth piece in, you know, the Post or the Times, [clears throat] but [snorts] it was a time to learn a little bit about everything. And it kept proving itself to me over and over again. And the reason I did it at first was practical. Our agents needed to be able to be fil in multiple disciplines to talk to different people who all had different interests. So when I met **Paul Newman**, it was very easy for me to engage with him

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 因为我订阅了《**汽车与驾驶员**》（Car and Driver）、《**汽车趋势**》（Motor Trend）、《**汽车**》（Automobile）以及另一本汽车杂志《**汽车与驾驶员**》（Car and Driver）。我可能已经说过了，但我看了它们，我对汽车非常深入，但更多是从美学角度。我真的不太了解它们的工作原理，但当我见到**保罗**时，他首先想谈论的就是汽车，我们找到了共同点。我会向员工宣讲，你需要掌握多学科的职业、职能、兴趣和爱好，这样你才有话可说。你知道，我读《**科学美国人**》（Scientific America），虽然不勤奋，但我会看标题，看文章的前五段，了解大概。顺便说一句，在那些日子里，一篇详细文章中你需要的一切都在开头和结尾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: because I subscribed to **Car and Driver**, **Motor Trend** **Automobile** and one other car magazine, **Car and Driver**. I may have said that, but and I'd looked at them and I was really deeply into automobiles, but more in the aesthetic sense. I really didn't know much how they worked, but when I met **Paul** as the first thing he wanted to talk about, we laid some common denominator together. And I would preach that to the staff that you need to stay on top of multi-disciplinary careers, functions and interests and hobbies so you have something to talk about. Um, you know, I read **Scientific America** not diligently, but I read the headlines, looked at, you know, the opening five paragraphs of an article to get a sense of it. Everything you needed in those days, by the way, in a detailed article was in the opening and the closing when you get down to it.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我对医学感兴趣。所以我读《**新英格兰医学杂志**》（New England Journal of Medicine）。你知道，我非常努力地为**加州大学洛杉矶分校医学中心**筹集资金。我担任医院主席多年。我必须阅读《**新英格兰医学杂志**》才能与20个科室主任交谈。当地震后，我请**贝聿铭**设计并建造**加州大学洛杉矶分校医学中心**时，我需要对其他建筑师有流利的理解，这样我才能提供背景，并与20位科室主任，他们都是各自领域的顶尖人物，进行交流。现在你看，我没有学习如何进行医疗操作，但我至少掌握了一些词汇，并且可以在一段时间内跟上对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And I wanted I was interested in medicine. So I read the **New England Journal of Medicine**. I you know worked very hard to raise money for the **UCLA Medical Center**. I was the chairman of the hospital for many years. I had to look at the **New England Journal of Medicine** to talk to the 20 department heads. When I brought **IMP** to design and build the **UCLA Medical Center** after the earthquake, I needed to have a fluent understanding of other architects so I could give context and of the 20 department heads who were the tops of the top in their particular field. Now look, I didn't learn how to perform a procedure medically, but I at least got some vocabulary, and I could kind of stay up into a conversation for a period of time.

**Shane**: 在**CA**鼎盛时期，你们占据了市场70%的份额，如果我没记错的话。你是如何保持清醒的？你具体做了哪些事情来不让成功冲昏头脑？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: At the height of CIA, you guys had 70% of the market, I think, if I remember correctly. How did you stay grounded? What specific things did you do to not let that go to your head?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，你知道，首先，我相信我得到的所有宣传，无论是好的还是坏的，都是胡说八道。那些说我好话的人后来也会写我的坏话，然后他们又会写好话和坏话。坦白说，这一切都没有影响到我。嗯，你读了吗？是的，我读了，因为我想了解背景，但我认为他们在娱乐业制定的这些权力榜单纯粹是胡说八道，因为根本没有权力这种东西。它不存在。当人们说这个人是第二强大的，或者第十强大的，或者你是最强大的，这都是胡说八道，因为权力是转瞬即逝的东西，它稍纵即逝，不会持久。如果你不相信，看看任何曾经拥有权力的人就知道了。它就像一份租约，有终止日期，而且结局通常都不好。所以我从不相信它。我只相信我的家庭，包括我的核心家庭，我的三个孩子，以及我的事业家庭。这就是我的生活。我相信这些，并用隐私来保护两者。我们在家里非常注重隐私。我的孩子们的照片哪里都没有。我不允许给他们拍照。我不喜欢经纪公司的任何人向媒体透露八卦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, you know, first of all, I believed that all the publicity that I got, both good and bad, was nonsense. Same people that put said good things about me later would write bad things about me and then they'd write good things and bad things. None of it phased me, frankly. Um, did you read it? Yeah, I read it because I wanted to have context, but I thought these power lists that they developed in the entertainment business were just sheer nonsense because there's no such thing as power. It doesn't exist. And when people would say this one's the second most or the 10th most or you're the most powerful, it's all nonsense because it's an ephemeral thing power and it's fleeting and it doesn't last. And if you don't believe that, take a look at anyone that's had it. It's you it's like a lease. It has a closed end and never a good one. So I never believed in it. I believed in my family which composed of my nuclear family, my three kids [snorts] and my business family. That was my life. I believed in that and I protected both with privacy. We were very private at home. There were no pictures of my kids anywhere. I wouldn't allow pictures of them taken. I didn't like anyone at the agency talking to the press giving trash about stuff.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我们确实有另一条规定，那就是贬低非客户的产品是不合适的，因为那是娱乐业一个老掉牙的伎俩。试图制造负面舆论。当我22岁时，我遇到了一位在业内相当成功的经理人。我很喜欢他，但他有一个可怕的习惯，就是贬低所有人。在与他相处了六个月后，我清楚地意识到他这样做是因为他在会议中感到不安全。他认为这能让他看起来更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: We did have another rule that it was inappropriate to badmouth non-clients product because that was a age-old trick in the entertainment business. Try to start a drum roll of negativity. And when I was 22, I met a manager who was quite successful in the business. I liked him a lot, but he had a horrible habit of bad mouthing everybody. And it became clear to me 6 months into the relationship that he did that because he was insecure in a meeting. He thought it made himself look better

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 而实际上，这让他看起来非常软弱和不知感恩。我记得和他坐在办公室里，他正在贬低他的搭档，那个人其实是个好人。虽然不是最聪明的人，但人很好。不应该受到那样的对待。所以我们这里不允许你贬低任何人。如果你没有好话要说，就不要说。如果你有问题，把他们叫到办公室，关上门，把话说清楚，吵一架，然后握手言和，但不要拖延。那毫无意义。我总是，你知道，当我听到别人说别人的坏话时，我总是在想，他们会怎么说我呢？你知道，那里没有谨慎可言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: when in reality it made him look really weak and unappreciative. I remember sitting with him in his office and he was bad mouthing his partner who actually was a nice guy. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, but a very nice guy. Didn't deserve that. So we wouldn't you at our place, you weren't allowed to badmouth anybody. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. And if you got a problem, take them in their office, shut the door, and let it out and fight it out and then shake hands, but don't drag it on. It doesn't make any sense. I always uh you know, when I'm on the receiving end of this and somebody's saying something negative about somebody else, I'm always wondering like, what are they saying about me? You know, like there's no discretion there.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，你可以指望他们会说你的坏话，即使没有什么可说的。有些人生活在消极的海洋中。我们，我试图为我们创造一个积极的海洋，不贬低别人，就像我说的，更像英国人一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, you can count on them saying something negative about you even if there's nothing negative to say. Some people exist in a sea of negativity. We were I tried to set a stage for us to exist in a sea of positiveness and not to badmouth people and just try to as I say be more English, you know.

</details>

**Shane**: 嗯，所以你寻找的特质之一，回到我们刚才跑题的地方，是那种如饥似渴的阅读和学习，以及永远保持好奇心。除了这些，你还在人们身上寻找什么其他突出的特质，无论是你投资他们，还是只是想和他们共度时光？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Um so one of the traits that you look for just coming back out of this rabbit hole we get into was sort of voracious reading and learning and always curious. What are the other things that stand out that you're looking for in people whether you invest in them or just want spend time with them?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，对我来说，投资非常简单。我从1993年开始投资科技，2001年开始全职投资。我在2003年或2004年左右从媒体业务转型。我卖掉了我所有的资产，全职投入到科技投资和科技咨询中。对我来说，什么都没有改变。什么都没有改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, investing is very simple for me. I've been investing in tech now since 1993 and full-time since 2001. And I transitioned out of the media business in about 0 2003 or four. I sold every asset that I had and I went full-time into tech investing and tech consulting and nothing changed for me. Nothing changed for me.

</details>

**Shane**: 那么，你在创始人身上寻找的特质，和你会在其他人身上寻找的特质有什么？有哪些指标表明某人可能会成功？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: So, what are the attributes you're looking for in founders that you would look for in anybody else? What what indicators are there that somebody is likely to be successful?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 实际上很简单。创始人需要充满激情。他们需要深入了解自己的想法。他们需要对自己的想法有很多想法。他们需要与能帮助他们启动想法的人建立联系。他们必须乐于接受批评。他们不能傲慢。不傲慢至关重要。我发现傲慢的创始人比不傲慢的创始人更容易失败。他们必须能够简洁地表达自己的想法。他们必须真正充满热情。有趣的是，当你是一名导演，面试演员时，你也在寻找同样的东西。唯一的区别是，当你看到像**马丁·斯科塞斯**这样的人时，我对他们无比尊敬，他们教会了我大部分我所了解的电影行业知识，他们对我说，我总是看他们的眼睛。我在面试创始人时不会看那个，但他们不是演员，对吧？我也不希望他们是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: It's pretty simple actually. Founders need to be uh passionate. They need to be deep into their idea. They need to have a lot of ideas about what they want to do with their idea. They need to be connected to people that can help them get their idea started. They have to be open to critique. They can't be arrogant. It's critical they're not arrogant. I find that arrogant founders have a tendency to fail more than non-arrogant founders. They have to have the ability to tell you their ideas in succinct ways. They have to be really enthusiastic. And it's funny, when you're a director and you're interviewing an actor or an actress, you're kind of looking for the same things. The only difference is when you're looking at a [snorts] **Marty Scorsese**, who I have unbelievable respect for, taught me most about the movie business that I know, and said to me, I'm always looking at their eyes. I'm kind of not looking at that when I'm interviewing a founder, but they're not actors, right? And I don't want them to be.

</details>

**Shane**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Yeah.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 但除此之外，一部电影、一部电视剧、一张唱片或一本书的包装，与一家数字公司、一家科技公司的想法的包装没有什么不同。都是一样的。创始人是创造者，风险投资家是科技领域的资金，制片厂或发行商是娱乐业的资金，然后你进行营销。两者都需要营销，你需要找到发行商，你需要给他们提供建议。这非常相似。**本·霍洛维茨**和**马克·安德森**在1999年向我指出了这一点。他们俩都看着我说：“你做的事情和我们一模一样。”那对我来说就像是一个顿悟时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: But other than that, the packaging of a film or a television show or a record or a book is no different than the packaging of an idea for a digital company, for a company in technology. It's all the same. The founder is the creator, the VCs, the money in tech, the studio or the distributor, the money in the entertainment business, and then you go to the marketing. They both need to be marketed and you got to find a distributor and you got to give them both advice. It's very much the same. Uh **Ben Horwitz** and **Mark Andre** pointed that out to me in 1999. They both looked at me and said, "You do exactly what we do." And that was like an epiphany moment for me. [snorts]

</details>

### 与马克·安德森的相遇

**Shane**: 我喜欢你和**安德森**的第一次见面，他出现并邀请你加入董事会。也许你可以讲讲那个故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I love the first meeting you had with Andre where he showed up and asked you to be on the board. Maybe you can tell that story.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我接到了我们共同的朋友**罗恩·康威**的陌生电话。他是一位伟大的投资者，一个了不起的人，地球上最好的人之一，在旧金山备受喜爱。我们通过**加州大学洛杉矶分校**认识，因为他有一个孩子在那里，我们当时，你知道，我在医院董事会工作，我们因一些个人问题有过接触。他说：“我有一个人想让你见见。”我说：“是谁？”他说：“**马克·安德森**。”我说：“他是谁？”他说：“嗯，他非常聪明。你会非常喜欢他。他想见你。”当然，我说：“他为什么要见我？我能给他提供什么？”他说：“闭嘴，去见他就是了。”我说：“好的。”因为**罗恩**就是那种人。如果他说：“见他。”我就会去见他。顺便说一句，这在我的生活中一直延续着。如果我尊重的人对我说：“去见那个人。”即使我不想，我也会去。这对我最近刚宣布孵化的一家公司也奏效了，我遇到了一个我拒绝见面的人，但我尊重的人说你最好见见他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I got a cold call from a mutual friend of ours, **Ron Conway**. great investor, fabulous human being, one of the nicest men on the planet, great well-loved up in San Francisco. And we knew each other through **UCLA** because he was he had a kid down there and we had uh I was, you know, running the board at the hospital and we had had some contact on some personal issues and he said, "I've got a guy I want you to meet." And I said, "Who's that?" He said, "**Mark Andre**." And I said, "Who is it?" He [snorts] said, 'Well, he's really smart. You're going to really like him. He wants to meet you. And of course, I said, 'Why would he want to meet me? What do I have to offer this guy? He said, "Shut up and just meet the guy." And I said, "Okay." Cuz **Ron** was that kind of guy. If he said, "Meet him. I'm going to meet him." And that, by the way, is continued in my life. If people I respect say to me, "Meet the guy." Even if I don't want to, or the gal, I will do it. And it just worked for me on a company which we can talk about later that we just announced last week that we incubated where I met someone that I refused to meet but someone I respect said you better meet him. [clears throat]

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 但**安德森**下来见我，他选了一家餐厅。我只为这次会面安排了一个小时，因为我觉得这完全是在浪费我的时间。他穿着一条条纹短裤和一件夏威夷花衬衫走了进来。嗯，我从未在好莱坞见过那种打扮，但我们坐下来开始交谈。我们一起聊了三个小时。我被这个人迷住了。然后他让我见了**本**，我也被他迷住了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: But **Andre** came down to meet me and he picked a restaurant someplace and I budgeted an hour for the meeting because I thought it was a complete waste of my time. [snorts] and he came in a pair of shorts that were striped with a kind of flower Hawaiian shirt. And um I had never seen that look in Hollywood, but [laughter] we sat down and we started talking. We spent three hours together. I was mesmerized by this guy. And then he had me meet **Ben** and I was mesmerized by him.

</details>

**Shane**: （笑）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: [snorts]

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 他们都是非凡的人，生活在一个我不知道存在的世界里。他们邀请我加入这家新公司的董事会，我问他们是做什么的，他们告诉我了，我说我不明白。我当时真的不明白。我之所以不明白，是因为这是1999年，他们开发了一个云。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: They were extraordinary people who were in a world I didn't know existed and they asked me to go on the board of this new company and I asked them what it did and they told me and I said I don't understand I really didn't understand it at the time. The reason I didn't understand it this is 1999 they developed a cloud.

</details>

**Shane**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Mhm.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我不明白他们在说什么。它在哪里？你知道，它怎么插电？它从哪里获得电力？它是什么？他们在1999年就已经想通了这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I I couldn't understand what they were talking about. Where is it? You know [laughter] where how do you plug it in? Where does it get power? What is it? And they had thought this through in 1999.

</details>

**Shane**: 我的天啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Oh my god.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 他们开发了一家名为**LoudCloud**的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And they developed a company called **LoudCloud**.

</details>

**Shane**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Yeah.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 然后他们对我说：“我们希望你加入董事会。”我说：“伙计们，我真的很喜欢和你们聊天，但我对这些东西一窍不通。你们为什么要我加入董事会？我甚至不明白我们公司在卖什么产品。”值得称赞的是，他们说：“我们想要一个不依附于硅谷任何人的人，一个思维跳脱的人，一个敢于对抗董事会其他成员的无所畏惧的人。”我说：“好的，我能做到。”然后我就做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And then they said to me, "We'd like you on the board." And I said, "Guys, I'm really enjoying talking to you guys, but I'm an idiot about this stuff. What do you want me on the board for? I don't even understand what product we're selling at this company." And to their credit, they said, "We want someone who's not beholding to anyone in Silicon Valley, someone who thinks out of the box, and someone who's fearless at going up against the other people on the board." And I said, "Okay, I can do that." And I did it. [snorts]

</details>

### 无畏精神与忠诚

**Shane**: 这种无畏精神从何而来？你似乎从不回避冲突。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Where does that fearlessness come from? You have never seemed to shy away from confrontation.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 你知道，这很有趣，**Shane**。顺便说一句，我不知道这是好是坏。直到今天我还没决定。你问这个问题很有趣，因为我昨天和**塔玛拉**讨论了这个问题，她是我在一起的女士，她是个英国人，非常优雅迷人，非常有礼貌。我不是英国人。有时我很有魅力，有时我没有魅力而且很强硬。我们在谈论冲突。她不喜欢冲突，但如果被逼急了也会这样做。对我来说，它只是工具箱里的一种工具。仅此而已。我为很多遇到麻烦的朋友做了很多事情，因为我被很多朋友视为世界上最好的朋友，也是世界上最糟糕的敌人，因为我就是黑白分明的忠诚。我一生都是这样。我对我的朋友、家人和帮助过我的人非常忠诚。你知道，在**CA**，我们保留了一份名单，列出了在最初三到五年内帮助过我们，后来遇到麻烦的每一位高管。我们为每个人都找到了工作。如果我们找不到工作，我们就会确保他们有钱，因为我们在一无所有的时候他们帮助了我们。天哪，名单上的人很多，因为娱乐业对老年人并不友好。它不是日本，它没有好的记忆力，但我们有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You know, it's funny, **Shane**. I don't know if that's good or bad, by the way. I have to this day haven't decided. It's funny that you asked that question because I was discussing it yesterday uh with **Tomorrow**, the woman that uh [snorts] I am with and uh she's English and very uh elegant and charming and uh very mannered. Uh I'm not English. Um, days I can be charming, days I can be not charming and tough. Um, we're talking about confrontation. So, she doesn't like it, but will do it if pushed. Uh, for me, it's a tool in the toolkit. That's all it is. I do a lot of things for friends of mine that are in trouble because I have been viewed by a lot of my friends as the world's best friend and the world's worst enemy because I'm just black and white loyal. It's the way I've been my whole life. I'm very loyal to my friends, to my family, and to people that have done things for me. You know, at **CA**, we kept a list of every single executive that helped us in the first three or five years that then had trouble. And we got everyone a job. And if we couldn't get them a job, we made sure they had money because they helped us when we had nothing. And boy, there were a lot of people on the list because the entertainment business is not good to elderly people. It's not Japan and it's not uh it doesn't have a good memory and we did.

**Michael Ovitz**: 名单上有一位编剧，他在60年代的电视界是一位非常重要的编剧。我们曾在他非常重要的时候，请他为一个我们刚签下的、急需这份工作的客户写一集半小时的喜剧。他照做了。20年后，那个人打电话给我，非常简单地说他走投无路了。他找不到任何工作，任何地方。他年纪大了，人很好，但他的时代过去了。他的风格已经过时了。

**Michael Ovitz**: There was a writer that we had on the list that was about as important a writer as there was in the television business in the 60s. And we had asked him when he was really important to write an episode of a halfhour comedy for a client that we had just signed that really needed the the job. And he did it. And 20 years later, the guy called me and he said very simply that he had hit a dead end. He couldn't get a job anywhere, any place. And he was older and he was very nice, but he timed out. His kind of style

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，在一次员工会议上，我把刚才告诉你的这个故事告诉了大家。我说：“我们要为这个人争取一份工作。这不仅仅是给他一张支票。他需要找回他的尊严。”我们出去，两周内就为他找到了一份工作。那是我们的职责。那不是我们的选择。是的，那确实有一些冲突，因为人们试图挂断电话，说他们不会做。我们使用了对抗策略来为他争取到这份工作。所以你必须问自己，什么更重要？有些人会说冲突很可怕。我有很多朋友不会卷入冲突。而我属于那种认为偶尔冲突是必要的学派。当你真的面临冲突时，我认为我们别无选择，只能回应。你不能就让它过去。你不能让别人践踏你或你的客户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And um in a staff meeting, I told everyone this story that I just told you. I said, "We're going to legislate a job for this guy. This is not just giving him a check. He needs his dignity back." And we went out and in two weeks we got him a job. And that was our duty. That wasn't our choice. And yeah, in that was some confrontation cuz people tried to blow us off the phone saying they wouldn't do it. And we used the confrontational tactic to get him the job. So you have to say to yourself, what's more important? Some people will say confrontation's horrible. I have a lot of friends that won't get into a confrontation. And I'm in the school that occasionally it's necessary. When indeed you're confronted, I don't think any of us have any choice but to respond. You can't just let it go. You can't let people walk all over you or your clients.

**Shane**: 那真是个不可思议的故事。你认为这让你成为了一个难以对付的目标吗？

**Michael Ovitz**: 哦，我不会赢得任何受欢迎度竞赛，但我会告诉你我对人们说的话。我做生意不是为了赢得受欢迎度竞赛。我做生意是为了赢。我是一个垄断者。我信奉**彼得·蒂尔**的垄断理论。我不认为应该有竞争。竞争必须被淘汰。在我看来，这就是美国的方式。每个人都说总有竞争的空间。我不认为有任何竞争的空间。我不想让任何人像我们一样优秀。我希望我们是最好的。如果你想有第二或第三选择，那没关系。但我们是第一选择。所以，我们必须是最好的。我没有，我没有，我不是在竞选高中学生会主席，你知道。我早就做过了。我在一个有4000名学生的高中赢得了那个职位。我是主席。我不认为我当上主席是因为我受欢迎。坦白说，我当上主席是因为我能把事情办成。人们都知道这一点。我一生都是这样。你让我做一件事，我就会把它办成。当我需要把事情办成时，我就会找我认识的最忙的人去做，因为他们会把它办成。找那些时间太多的人，事情永远也办不成。

**Michael Ovitz**: Oh, I was I wasn't going to win any popularity contest, but I will tell you what I said to people. I wasn't I didn't go into business to win a popularity contest. I went into business to win. And I'm a monopolist. I believe in **Peter Teal**'s theory on monopoly. I don't believe that you should have competition. They have to be eliminated. That's the American way in my opinion. Everyone says there's always room for competition. I don't think there's any room for competition. I don't want anyone to be as good as us. I want us to be the best. If you want to have a second or third choice, that's okay. But we're the first choice. So, we had to be the best. And I don't I didn't I wasn't running for high school president, you know. I had already done that. I won that at a 4,000 kid high school. I was president. I don't think I was made president cuz I was popular. Frankly, I was made president cuz I got stuff done. And people knew that. I've been that way my whole life. You ask me to do something, I'll get it done. When I need something done, I ask the busiest person I know to do it because they'll get it done. Ask someone with too much time, it never gets done.

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，当人们帮助你时，这在娱乐业的长期文化中并不存在。短期来看，你知道，娱乐业是一个交易型友谊的行业。这些人真的是你的朋友吗？我不太确定，你知道，但只要他们能帮助你，他们就是你的朋友。但如果有人帮助我们起步，我们是从零开始，在牌桌上，身无分文。我们在开业第三周就没钱了，还被前雇主起诉，我们甚至没有钱为自己辩护。我不得不自己处理，没有律师。你必须伸出援手，你必须帮助别人。这个人在我们需要的时候帮助了我们，10年后他找不到工作，对自己感觉也不好。你知道，时间过去了，这种情况发生在我们所有人身上，你知道，但除非你保持与时俱进，这就是我的论点，只要我还在学习，还在为年轻的创始人提供咨询，我就会保持与时俱进，因为我每天都在学习新东西，每天都迫不及待地想在早上起床，我每天都会遇到地球上最有趣的人，每天都会有年轻的创业者向我推销他们的想法，这让我真正相信这个国家。你知道，我不担心外国竞争。

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, when people help you and it wasn't [clears throat] in the long-term culture of the entertainment business, short-term, it's try, you know, the entertainment is a transactional friendship business. Are these people really your friends? I'm not so sure, you know, but while they can help you, they're your friends. But if someone helped us get started and we started from scratch on card tables with no money, we ran out of money the third week we were in business and we got sued by our former employer and we didn't even have money to defend ourselves. I had to handle that without a lawyer. You have to reach out and you have to help people. here's a guy who helped us when we needed it and 10 years later he's he can't get a job and he doesn't feel too good about himself. um you know time passed by that happens to all of us you know but unless you stay current see that's my thesis as long as I'm learning and consulting for young founders I'm going to stay current because I learn something every day every single day I can't wait to get up in the morning I meet with the most interesting humans on the planet every day I get pitched ideas by young entrepreneurs that make me really believe in this country. You know, I am not worried about foreign competition.

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的，中国可能有很棒的机器人，但我们有非常聪明的人。我们的系统运作得非常好。你知道，我当时在伦敦和**塔玛拉**在一起。她是伦敦的英国人，一群商人要求和我进行一次圆桌会议，因为他们有一个朋友遇到了问题，他们朋友圈中的一个朋友很了解我或者认识**塔玛拉**，所以他们为我安排了一顿午餐。这个话题让我着迷，这也是我接受午餐的原因。午餐的主题是：为什么美国商人比世界上其他人都优秀得多？为什么会这样？这是我一生中第二次被问到这个问题。另一次是在日本，我每月去那里一次，处理我咨询的媒体和消费品业务中的所有日本公司。我们去吃午餐，安排午餐的那个人主持了会议，并向餐桌上的人提出了这个问题。我问每个人是做什么的。我们轮流发言。当我们问到最后一个人时，我知道他是做什么的，因为我之前已经得到了简报，我把他留到最后。他说：“我叫某某某，我以前从事这个行业，这是我做的事情。”我说：“你现在在做什么？”他说：“嗯，我正在搬到**托德**。”我说：“哦，你喜欢滑雪，是吗？”他当时大概四五十岁，我不记得了。他说：“不，我不太喜欢滑雪。”我说：“你有孩子吗？”他说：“是的，我打算让他们在那里上学。”我说：“你过去20年住在哪里？”在伦敦。我说：“你为什么要离开？”他说：“嗯，我的生意刚刚倒闭了。”我说：“哦，好的。”你为什么要离开？他说：“嗯，我完了。”我说：“你什么意思，你完了？”他说：“嗯，我太尴尬了。我们破产了。”他说：“我不得不解雇了大约800人。”我说：“是啊，那又怎样？”他说：“你什么意思，那又怎样？”我说：“那又怎样？你破产了。你不是故意破产的，对吧？”他说：“不，我们遇到了一个糟糕的商业周期。我们的一个产品销量一落千丈。我们有一个很棒的产品，但我们没有支持它。我们犯了一些根本性的错误。”他说：“所以，我我想离开这个城市。我有点尴尬。”我说：“嗯，我们的晚餐，我们的午餐结束了。”所有人都说：“你在说什么？我们还没上菜呢。”我说：“嗯，你问我，为什么美国商人比其他人优秀？我说，我们刚刚得到了一个证明。在美国社会，失败是荣誉的徽章。我们都会失败。我在很多事情上都失败过。**Shane**，你失败了，你只会重新振作起来，继续前进。我经历过无数次失败，但这并没有阻止我再次尝试变得伟大。这个人，等我说完，他完全振奋起来，取消了搬家，又开始了一项新业务，因为他认为他走来走去，人们都在议论他。我说：“是的，他们都在议论所有人，因为如果他们能看到你的弱点，贬低你就会让他们感觉更好。那和你有什么关系？你为什么要关心？让他们爱说什么说什么。你只管证明他们错了。”归根结底，失败是生活的一部分。你知道，**迈克尔·基顿**是我一生中最亲密的朋友之一，直到他去世。我们每周七天都会通话。他给了我最好的建议。他说，你知道，每当我犯错或遇到一些负面宣传时，他都会打电话给我，并把它轻描淡写。他总是对我说：“**迈克尔**，记住一件事。我的电话。”我说：“什么？”他说：“总有另一场竞技。”我说：“真的吗？我说，你什么时候成了牛仔了？”他说：“相信我，你做了那件事，它没成功，下一个案子。”我相信他，我一生都这样生活。

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah, China may have robots that are great, but we got people that are unbelievably smart. And our system just works really well. You know, I was um I was in London with **Tamara**. She's English from London and a group of businessmen asked to have a roundt session with me because they a one of their friends was having a problem and one of the friends in their friend group knew me pretty well or knew **tomorrow** and they set up a a lunch for me and [snorts and clears throat] the subject fascinated me and it's why I took the lunch. It was a subject of the lunch was why are American business people so much better than everyone else in the world? Why is that? And that was the second time in my life that I'd been approached with that question. The other time was in Japan when I would go there once a month to deal with all the Japanese companies that I consulted for in media and in consumer businesses. And we went to the lunch and the guy who set up the lunch opened the meeting and posed the question to the table. And I asked each guy what they did. And we went around the table. And when we got to the last guy, which I knew what he did because I had been briefed and I saved him till the end, he said, "My name's so and so and uh I was in this business and this is what I did." And I said, "And what are you doing now?" He said, "Well, I'm moving toad." I said, "Oh, you like to ski, huh?" And he was in his mid4s, late 40s, I think. I don't remember. And he said, "No, I don't like skiing particularly." I said, "You have kids?" He said, "Yeah, I'm going to put them in school there." I said, "And where have you lived the last 20 years?" In London. I said, "Why are you leaving?" He said, "Well, my business just went under." I said, "Oh, okay." And why are you leaving? He said, "Well, I'm done." I said, "What do you mean you're done?" He said, "Well, I'm so embarrassed. We went bankrupt." And he said, 'I had to fire like 800 people or something. I [snorts] said, 'Yeah, so what?' He said, 'What do you mean, so what? I said, 'So what? You went bankrupt. You didn't do it on purpose, did you? He said, no, we had a bad business cycle. Our one of our products fell off a cliff. We had a great product, but we didn't back it up. We made some fundamental mistakes. He said, "So, I I want to get out of the city. I I'm kind of embarrassed." I said, 'Well, our dinner, our lunch is over.' And everyone said, 'What are you talking? We haven't even gotten served. I said, 'Well, you asked me, why are American businessmen and women better than others? And I said, we just got a demonstration of it. Failure in American society is a badge of honor. We all fail. I've failed in a lot of things. You fail, **Shane**, you just get back up on your horse and you keep riding. I've had tons of failures, but doesn't stop me from trying to be great again. And this guy, by the time I got done, got all pumped up and actually cancelled his move and went and started another business because he thought that he was walking around. People were talking about him. And I said, "Yeah, they're talking about everybody because if they can see a weak spot, it makes them feel better to badmouth you. What has that got to do with you? What do you care? Let them say whatever they want. Just prove them wrong. [snorts] And bottom line, failure's part, you know, **Michael Kiteon** was one of my closest friends in my life till the till he passed away. We talked every day of the week, seven days a week. And he gave me the best advice. He said, you know, every time I made a mistake or I got some bad publicity or something, he'd call me and he'd make light out of it. And he'd always said to me, "Just remember something, Michael. My call." I said, "What?" He said, "There's always another rodeo." I said, 'Really? I said, 'Since when are you a cowboy? And he said, trust me, you did that. It didn't work next case. And I believed him and I lived that life my whole life.

### 成功的多元定义

**Shane**: 是什么驱动着你今天？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What drives you today?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 哦，只有一件事。有两件事驱动着我。一是我的五个孙子孙女，我爱他们，我喜欢和他们在一起。我的四个孩子，我有两个儿子，两个女儿。他们都长成了了不起的人，坦白说，他们比我当年做得更好。简直难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Oh, only one thing. There are two things that drive me. Uh, one are my five grandchildren who I'm in love with and I love um, I just love hanging out with them. My four kids who are I have two boys, two girls. They're they've grown into just amazing human beings and they're parenting so much better than I did, frankly. It's unbelievable.

</details>

**Shane**: 但如果你的孩子都成了了不起的人，你怎么能这么说呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: How can you say that though if your kids turned into amazing human beings?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 因为他们对待孩子比我当年对待他们更好。因为我来自二战后的家庭，有一个非常严厉的父亲，而且我在50年代、60年代、70年代、80年代的育儿方式与今天非常不同。我看到我的孩子们如何处理他们的孩子，他们做得很好。只是与我当年不同。但对我来说另一件重要的事情是，我每天早上都迫不及待地想起床，去见一位创始人，他刚刚，你知道，开发了一艘没有船员的潜艇，具有国家防御能力，而且你看不见它。它是隐形的。或者我有一个年轻人，我已经和他合作过一家公司。我正在做另一家。他叫**内马·加姆萨里**。我17年前认识他。当时我是**亚历克斯·卡普**的顾问之一，**亚历克斯**是个非常聪明的人。**彼得·蒂尔**把我介绍给他，**彼得**在**Palantir**投资了很多钱，但当时没有收入。他请我帮助将其变现，这表明你不必完全是技术人员才能进入科技界。**内马**被指派给我，回答技术问题，因为他是一位天才工程师。我们一起创办了一家公司。他有一个想法，可以组建一家公司，名为**Blend**，现在已经上市，它可以在10次点击内通过手机完成抵押贷款。现在，他又提出了另一个想法。我刚刚为他争取到了所有资金，包括我们自己的，而且我正在做营销，他雇佣了合适的工程师，这是一个完整的孵化项目。我无法告诉你这有多有趣，也无法告诉你我学到了多少，因为我不是工程师，但我热爱这个想法，我可以在非技术方面提供帮助，这对于，你知道，如何构建一个企业的基本要素至关重要？如何建立企业文化？如何编写预算？你知道，如何推销产品？如何销售？雇佣谁来销售？雇佣谁作为你的前10名员工？你知道，有很多事情要做。这些年轻人让我学到了一些迷人的东西，那就是这一代科技人。他们只想知道。他们不想知道你做了什么。那很棒。他们想知道你失败了什么，以及如何避免它。这太棒了，他们的思维方式是如此反直觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: because they're just better with their kids than I was with them. Because I came from a household post World War II with a very strict father and I parenting in the 50s,60s,7s, 80s was very different than parenting today. I see it with my kids how they handle their children and they're doing a great job. just different than the way I did it. But the other thing that's important to me is I can't wait to get up in the morning and meet with a founder who's just, you know, developed a submarine that has no crew that has defense capabilities for the country and you can't see it. It's stealth. or I've got a young guy I've done I've already done one company with him. I'm doing another one. His name's **Nema Gamsari**. I met him 17 years ago. He was assigned to me at **Palunteer** when I was one of the adviserss to **Alex Karp** who's a brilliant guy. I was introduced to him by **Peter Teal** who had invested a lot of money in **Palunteer** and there was no income. He asked me to help monetize it, which shows that you don't have to be totally technical to be in the tech world. And **Nemo** was assigned to me to answer technical questions cuz he was a genius engineer. [snorts] We started a company together. He had an idea that he could put a company together uh called **Blend**, it's now public, that does mortgages on your phone in under 10 clicks. Now, he came up with another idea. I just got him all the funding including from us and uh we're I'm doing the marketing and he's hired the right engineers and it's a total incubation. I can't tell you how much fun it is and I can't tell you how much I'm learning because I'm not an engineer but I love the idea and I can help in the non-technical stuff that's critical to you know how do what are the nuts and bolts of building a business? How do you build a culture? How do you write a budget? You know, how do you market the product? How do you make sales? Who do you hire to do sales? Who do you hire to be your early 10 employees? You know, there's so many things to be done. And these are young people that I've learned something fascinating, which is this generation in tech. They just want to know. They don't want to know what you've done. That's great. They want to know what you failed at and how to avoid it. It is so fantastic that the way they think is so counterintuitive.

</details>

**Shane**: 能举个例子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What would be an example of that?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 举个例子，五年前我出版我的书时，**Stripe**的**帕特里克·科里森**给我打了个电话。

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为**科里森**兄弟是业内最聪明的两个人。**帕特里克**邀请我共进午餐。我去了，在自助餐厅排队后，我坐在一张野餐桌旁，他说：“你准备好了吗？”我说：“是的，我饿了。”我看到我的书放在那里，上面贴满了无数的便利贴。他说：“好的，我们开始吧。”我说：“我们开始什么？”他说：“我标记了你书中所有你提到自己犯错的地方。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And I think the **Collinsson** brothers are two of the smartest guys in the business. And **Patrick** invited me to lunch. I went over and I sit down at a picnic table after going through the cafeteria line and he said, "Are you ready?" I said, "Yeah, I'm hungry." and I see my book sitting there with a zillion postit sticking out of it. He said, "Okay, let's start." I said, "What are we starting?" He said, "I have marked every place in your book where you said you made a mistake."

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我说：“哦，好的。”他说：“我想知道你做出那个决定时的环境，你可能做了哪些不同的事情，以及如果你做了不同的事情会发生什么。”我们坐在那里聊了三个小时。我意识到他根本不在乎我做了哪些好事，也不在乎那些成功或在娱乐界具有革命性的事情。他没兴趣。一点兴趣都没有。他想知道错误，这样他就不会犯同样的错误。对我来说，那不是聪明。那是智慧。那比普通水平高了一个档次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I said, "Oh, okay." And he said, "I want to know the conditions that you were under when you made the decision, what you might have done differently, and what would have happened if you did it differently." And we sat there for three hours. And what I realized is he didn't care about any of the good things I did or any of the things that turned out to be successful or kind of revolutionary in the entertainment. Wasn't interested. No interest. Wouldn't know the mistakes so he wouldn't make them. That to me was not smart. It was wise. That was a grade above normal.

We live in what I think is the greatest country in the history of mankind. And it's all about what you can do and pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Don't give up. You know, create that momentum. It's okay to be competitive. It's okay to be in a capitalist system. I I must say I marvel. I got into a huge I shouldn't talk about this on your podcast, but I got into a huge argument with a friend of my daughters. Um she's a rising young executive at **Vogue**.

I've seen a lot of his uh I've seen a lot of information on him because I'm fascinated by this dynamic and I've listened to all of his campaign promises and I'm not a socialist. I believe in charity toward helping people and I do a lot of that. But I believe that capitalists create jobs and that creates a system. And I said to the guy, "What school did you go to?" And he named a big fancy Ivy League school. and probably one I couldn't get into. And I said, "Well, did you take any history?" He said, "Yes, quite a bit." I said, "Great." I said, "Can you name me one system in the last 2,000 years that has worked that's not capitalism, socialism, communism, dictator?"

**Michael Ovitz**: 随便说一个你在常春藤盟校学到的。一片死寂，因为没有。任何，你知道，独裁者可以统治很长时间，有些比另一些长，但最终他们都会失败。独裁者都会失败。而民主资本主义社会会赢。现在，我们会不会有起有落？当然会。但这是最好的制度吗？毫无疑问。有一个社会主义者好吗？我不这么认为。我们以前看过那部电影，它行不通。

Any, you know, dictators can have long runs, some longer than others, but at the end they all lose. Autocrats all lose. And democratic capitalist societies win. Now, will we go up and down? Absolutely. But is this the best system? Unequivocally. Is it good to have a socialist? I don't think so. We've seen that party, that movie before, and it doesn't work.

### 对政治与文化的看法

**Shane**: 你认为“觉醒文化”不仅影响了大学，你亲身经历过，还影响了电影和电视等领域吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: How do you think that woke culture has influenced not only universities, which you're seeing firsthand, but also like film and TV and

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我认为“觉醒文化”的根源有一些优点，它的根源。然后就像西洛杉矶的其他任何事情一样，他们把它推得太远了。他们没有让它从节拍器的一边回到中间，而是把它一直推到了另一边。我认为这导致了好莱坞内容业务的衰落。我认为内容业务现在处于有史以来最糟糕的境地。我认为这种强迫性的“觉醒”并没有起到积极作用。我认为最初的想法很棒。我不认为人们应该互相掠夺。顺便说一句，这就是娱乐业的历史。它需要停止。你知道，它需要停止。但一旦被揭露，它就不需要继续下去了。但它却继续下去了。我认为这导致了糟糕的创意决策。它迫使我们的观众，他们并非都那样思考，对我们采取狭隘的态度，不想看我们制作的东西。好莱坞的自由左派认为很棒的东西，可能对这个国家的另一半人来说行不通。当我成长的时候，我们制作的电影是每个人都想看的。我们不关心你的政治立场。当我们制作《**捉鬼敢死队**》时，我不在乎你是自由派还是保守派。我们只是想让你笑。你知道，《**肉丸**》、《**条纹**》。当我们和**马蒂**一起制作《**赌场**》或《**好家伙**》时，我们对你的政治不感兴趣。我们只是想让你看电影并享受它。所以，我们不参与政治讨论。我甚至不允许在会议中进行政治讨论。我不想卷入我们客户的政治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I think that look, the roots of woke culture had some merit, the roots. And then like anything else in West Los Angeles, they just carried it too far. They took it instead of letting it go from one side of the metronome to the middle, they took it all the way to the other side. And I think it contributed to the demise of the content business in Hollywood right now. I think the content business is in the worst place it's ever been. [snorts] And I think this forced wokeness has not been productive. I think at the beginning the ideas were wonderful. I don't think that people should be predatory on each other. By the way, that's the history of the entertainment business. It needed to stop. You know, it needed to stop. But once it was made known, it didn't need to keep going. And it did. And I think it forced bad creative decision. And it forced our audiences who don't all think that way to go narrow on us and to not want to see the things that we did. Things that the liberal left in Hollywood think are fantastic may not work for the other half of the country. When I grew up, we made movies that everyone wanted to watch. We didn't care what your political persuasion was. When we did **Ghostbusters**, I don't care if you're a liberal or a conservative. We just want you to laugh, you know, Meatball Stripes. When we did **Casino** or **Good Fellows** with **Marty**, not interested in your politics. We just want you to watch the movie and enjoy it. So, we didn't enter political discussions. I didn't even allow political discussions to take place in meetings. I didn't want to get involved with our clients politics.

</details>

**Shane**: 你认为未来会不会出现这样一个世界：你我都在看同一个节目，但实际节目内容却不同，即使我们都认为自己在看同一个节目，因为内容点播和人工智能会根据你的政治倾向以及我对你的了解，给你提供一个版本，而根据我的政治倾向以及我对你的了解，给我提供一个略有不同的版本？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Do you think there's a world in the future where you and I are watching the same show and the actual show is different even though we think we're watching the same show with content on demand and AI and it goes your uh your political dispositions and what I know about you. I'm going to give you this version and my political dispositions and what I know about you, I'm going to give you a slightly different version.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 你知道，这是一个很好的问题，因为我今天午餐时刚刚进行了这场辩论。嗯，我给你打个比方。首先，答案是：在技术领域，我从不排除任何可能性。所以，它会发生吗？绝对会。因为技术实际上已经具备了实现它的能力。**Netflix**已经进行了实验，你可以改变结局。这里有，你知道，四种不同的结局。你可以把自己的结局放在电影上，但我认为所有这一切的现实，我们现在在人工智能中看到了一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You know, it's a it's a great question because I just had this debate at lunch today. Um, I'll give you the analogy. First of all, the answer is I I don't ever in technology count anything out. So, could it happen? Absolutely. Because the technology is actually there to do it. **Netflix** is already uh done experiments with you change the ending. Here's, you know, four different endings. you put that your own ending on the film, but I think that the reality of all of this we see a little bit now in AI.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为当你访问人工智能网站时，不同的人工智能公司都带有编程它们的工程师的个性。我认为你会看到你在获得的信息中存在这种偏见。你在早期肯定看到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I think when you go to the AI websites, I think the different AI companies have the personalities of the engineers that are programming them. And I think you see that bias in the information you're given. You sure saw it in the early days.

</details>

**Shane**: 哦，当然。我认为他们只是更好地隐藏了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Oh, definitely. I think they just do a better job of hiding it,

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 但我认为它仍然存在。

<details>

### 信息过载与日常阅读

**Shane**: 你是如何跟上信息流的？你是如何优先排序的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: How do you manage to keep up with the information flow? How do you prioritize?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I don't.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我没有。我 overwhelmed 了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I don't. I'm overwhelmed.

</details>

**Shane**: 你有吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Do you have

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我现在在纽约的办公室里。是的。我在家里的办公室，在麦迪逊大道的办公室里，堆满了要读的文章、论文和思想片断。我是**外交关系委员会**的成员。我从来没有按我希望的那样读完每月的刊物。我有一些从《**大西洋月刊**》上撕下来的文章堆在那里。我被信息淹没了。我热爱发现。所以，一天中没有足够的时间。我有一个坏习惯，喜欢深夜开始深入研究。你从你的年轻工程师那里学到了这一点，因为他们熬夜，但他们会睡觉。我熬夜，但不睡觉。那很累人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, I have in my office right now here in New York. Yeah. my office at home in my office in the in on Madison Avenue stacks of articles to read and treates and thought pieces. I'm on the **Council of Foreign Relations**. I never get to finish the monthly as much as I want to. I I got articles from the Atlantic stripped out of the magazine sitting in a pile. I'm overwhelmed with information and um I I love discovery. So, there's just not enough hours in the day. And I've got a horrible habit of wanting to start going down rabbit holes late at night. And you learn that from your young engineers cuz they stay up all night, but then they go to sleep. And I stay up all night. I don't go to sleep. That's pretty taxing.

</details>

**Shane**: 你也是个早起的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Are you an early riser, too?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的，我是。我是一个非常早起的人。我早上思维最活跃。我早上思维最活跃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah, I am. I'm a very early riser. And I do my best thinking in the morning. my very best thinking in the morning.

</details>

**Shane**: 你起床后的日常是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What's your routine after you get out of bed?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，我一生中每天都一样。每周七天，我起床。嗯，如果我在这里，会更容易。我的意思是，更难，因为我必须带我们的狗出去散步，否则公寓里就会出事。如果我在洛杉矶，我们只需开门。那容易多了。省了我10分钟。嗯，我立刻回来。我给它喂食。我给自己倒点喝的。然后我坐在书桌前，每天早上都读同样的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Um, it's the same every day of my life. Seven days a week, I uh get up. Um, if I'm here, it's easier. I mean, harder cuz I have to take our dog around the block or we have an accident in the apartment. If I'm in LA, we just open the door. It's a lot easier. Saves me 10 minutes. Uh, I come right back. I get his food. I get something to drink for myself. And then I sit down at my desk and I read the same things every single morning.

</details>

**Shane**: 那些是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What are those things?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我读的第一件事，信不信由你，是《**纽约邮报**》（New York Post）。我读《**纽约邮报**》是因为我喜欢他们报道新闻的方式。它很简短。我可以很快地了解正在发生的事情。我认为**基思·普尔**是一位了不起的编辑。他是英国人。他非常聪明。他们有一些非常好的记者。我能快速简短地获取信息，然后笑几声，我不会花很多时间在上面，因为没有什么长篇大论，你知道，所以我可以在很短的时间内完成。然后我直接去看**TechCrunch**。我读两三个科技网站，它们给我提供正在发生的事情的信息。我喜欢阅读这些信息。我认为**杰西卡·莱森**非常聪明。然后我，嗯，我读，信不信由你，我浏览**德拉吉报告**（Drudge Report）的头条。这花了我两分钟，因为我喜欢看他们的观点，因为它和我的太不一样了。我总是喜欢保持平衡。所以当我明天看新闻时，我不会只看一个新闻来源，而是看三个。我们会看**CNN**、**福克斯**和**天空新闻**，因为你可以有同一个新闻记者，你每天都这样做，但对这三个新闻都有不同的解读。所以我不同意这三个中的任何一个。所以我想我们从**天空新闻**那里得到了最中立的解读。嗯，然后我直接跳到《**金融时报**》（Financial Times）、《**华尔街日报**》（Wall Street Journal）、《**纽约时报**》（New York Times）、《**洛杉矶时报**》（LA Times）和《**华盛顿邮报**》（Washington Post）。我像热刀切黄油一样，以数字方式快速浏览这些报纸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: First thing I read, believe it or not, is the **New York Post**. I read the **New York Post** because I love the way they report the news. It's short. I can get a snapshot of what's going on very quickly. I think **Keith Pool**'s an amazing editor. He's English. He's very smart. They have some very good reporters. And I get it short and fast and then I get a few laughs and I don't spend a lot of time on it because there's nothing long, you know, so I can do it in very short time frame. I then go right to **TechCrunch**. I read two or three tech websites that give me information about what's going on. I like to read the information. I think **Jessica Lesson**'s really smart. And then I um I read, believe it or not, I scan the headlines of the **Drudge Report**. Takes me two minutes cuz I like to see their point of view cuz it's so different than mine. I always like to be balanced. So when I watch news tomorrow and I watch three news sources instead of one. We won't watch one news source. So we'll watch **CNN**, **Fox**, and **Sky News** cuz you can have the same news reporter, which you do daily, and a different spin on all three. So I don't agree with any of the three. So I guess we get the most neutral spin out of **Sky News**. Um, and then I jump right into uh the **Financial Times**, **Wall Street Journal**, the **New York Times**, the **LA Times**, and the **Washington Post**. And I go right through those like a hot knife through butter digitally.

</details>

**Shane**: 你在浏览时寻找什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: What are you looking for when you're you're skimming?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我在寻找头条新闻。我在寻找图片，因为如果编辑不认为重要，它们通常不会出现。我喜欢通过编辑的视角来看待问题。报纸和杂志的编辑比人们认为的要聪明和智慧得多，因为他们会告诉你什么重要。他们通过在出版物中的位置告诉你。他们会告诉你是否有更大的头条、副标题和图片。你可以为此进行自我编程。所以，这些是我倾向于首先注意到的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I'm looking for headlines. I'm looking for pictures because they often wouldn't appear if the editor didn't. I'm I like to look through the lens that the editor does. Editors of newspapers and magazines are really much smarter and wiser than they're given credit for because they kind of tell you what's important. They tell you by the placement in the publication. They tell you if there's a bigger headline, a sub headline, and a picture. You can program yourself for that. So, those are things I tend to notice first.

</details>

**Shane**: 我喜欢这些线索。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I like those tells

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，它们就像，你知道，它们是线索。仅此而已。它们教育了我。我，你知道，有人问我是否认为，你知道，新闻业会消亡。我说：“不，恰恰相反。我认为品牌新闻比以往任何时候都更重要。地球上最重要的人是记者和编辑。他们以一种奇怪的方式为我们提供菜单。我不同意那些坐下来从头到尾阅读所有东西的人，因为你无法平等地衡量封面之间的所有内容。那是不可能的。坦白说，这很愚蠢。我听过对这个问题最有趣的答案之一是**沃伦·巴菲特**。他说他阅读时，不是为了你的观点而阅读。他是为了事实而阅读。所以，他阅读是为了收集事实信息并形成自己的观点，但他基本上忽略了作者的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: and uh they're it's like, you know, they're tells. That's all they are. And they educate me. And I'm I you know, someone asked me if I thought that, you know, journalism would be dead. I said, "No, just the opposite. I think branded journalism is more important than ever. The most important people on the planet are journalists and editors. They kind of feed us our menu in a strange way. I don't agree with people that sit and read things cover to cover because you can't equally weight everything between the covers. It's not possible. It's stupid. Frankly, one of the most interesting answers I've heard to that question is **Warren Buffett**. And he says when he's reading, he's not reading for your opinion. He's reading for the facts. So, he's reading to collect factual information and formulate his own opinion, but he basically ignores the opinion of the writer.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我非常同意他。我对任何人的观点都没有兴趣，除非是评论文章。那样我就知道那是观点，那没关系，因为我就是为了找观点。我不想在事实新闻中看到观点。我对，你知道，当有人写中东发生的事情时，他们认为这不是这个，那不是那个，我没兴趣。所有这些都有原因。我同意他们吗？不。或者有时同意。但我不想看到作者的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I couldn't agree with him more. I have zero interest in anybody's opinion unless it's an op-ed piece. Then I know it's an opinion, and that's okay cuz I've looked for it. I don't want an opinion in a factual news piece. I'm not interested in what, you know, somebody thinks when they're writing about something that's happened in the Middle East that it's not this, it's not that. There's reasons for all of it. Do I agree with them? No. Or sometimes yes. But I don't want the writer's opinion.

</details>

**Shane**: 你的书里有一句话，我在这里转述一下，它基本上是说：“平庸是隐形的，直到激情照亮它。”你是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: There's a quote in your book, and I'm going to paraphrase here, but it basically says, "Mediocrity is invisible until passion shines a light on it." What did you mean by that?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 说的就是字面意思。嗯，首先，平庸对我来说是一种疾病，你必须不惜一切代价摆脱它。我受不了和那些患有这种疾病的人交谈，他们对任何事情都没有兴趣。你知道，有时你盲目地坐在晚宴上某人旁边，你试图和他们交谈，但他们对任何事情都没有兴趣，我就是受不了，因为我想要被挑战。我想要被推动。我想要被提问。我想要被告知我错了。我希望那个孩子在晚宴上，在我女儿的另外10个朋友面前，捍卫他的立场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: exactly what it says. Um, first of all, mediocrity to me is a disease that you have to get rid of at all costs. I can't stand talking to people that suffer from that disease where they have no interest. You know, sometimes you sit blindly next to someone at a dinner party and you try to talk to them and they have no interest in anything and I just can't deal with it because I want to be challenged. I want to be pushed. I want to be asked questions. I want to be told I'm wrong. I wanted that kid at that dinner in front of the other 10 young people, my daughter's friends, to defend his position.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 但结果是，我只说了一句话，他就无法捍卫它。它是站不住脚的。但我希望在所有人面前和他争论。我会说，如果你要走社会主义道路，我更喜欢纽约的方式，就像你从资本主义走向极端社会主义，因为我觉得系统会拒绝那种方式，而不是像加拿大那样缓慢地走向某种社会主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: But what happened is in one sentence that I gave him, he couldn't defend it. It was indefensible. But I wanted to argue with him in front of everybody. I will say if you're you're going to go socialist, I much prefer the New York path of like you go from capitalism to extreme socialism because I feel like the system will reject that versus Canada which is like a slow march into kind of socialism.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的，我对此有意见，在任何层面都有，因为我认为一件事会导致下一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah, I I have a problem with it at any level because I think one thing leads to the next.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我非常讨厌共产主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I'm a huge hater of communism.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 它从未奏效过。我读过**马克思**。我读过**列宁**。你知道，理论上听起来都很棒，但它行不通。就像其他任何事情一样。并非所有医生都一样好。有些只是更有天赋。有些是更好的外科医生。有些是更好的诊断医生。有些对你的肠道了解更多，而不是对你的心脏。有时你需要一个专科医生。在任何事情上都没有绝对的平等主义。我高中时的一些老师比另一些更好。他们就是这样。他们更有趣。他们做的事情与众不同。你知道，领导者中有些比另一些更有趣。你知道，我们现在在洛杉矶的领导层很糟糕。我们发生了那场火灾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: It's never worked. I've read **Markx**. I've read **Linen**. You know, it all sounds great in theory, but it doesn't work. Just it's like anything else. Not all doctors are as good as each other. Some are just more gifted. Some are better surgeons. Some are better diagnosticians. Some know more about your intestines than they do about your heart. Sometimes you need a specialist. It's there's no such thing as ealitarian in anything. Some of my teachers in high school were better than others. They just were. They were more interesting. They did stuff that was different. You know, leaders are some of them are more interesting than others. You know, we've got horrible leadership in in Los Angeles right now. We had that fire.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 你知道，我们的市长是一位女士，她人很好，但她不知道自己在做什么。她从未经营过一家企业，却在管理这个国家最大公司之一的预算。它叫洛杉矶。你知道，纽约也是一样。我们这里有一个竞选市长的人，他从未经营过，他从未有过工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You know, a woman who's our mayor who is very nice, but she has no idea what she's doing. She's never run a business and she's running a budget of of one of the biggest corporations in the country. It's called LA. You know, it's the same with New York. We've got a guy running for mayor here who's never run a he's never had a job.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 他从未有过工作。我的论点，很多人在讨论中，我走到哪里都提，我觉得如果你在这个国家竞选市长、州长、总统或副总统，你最好有五年经营企业的经验，任何一种企业都可以。你可能有一个有五个员工的夫妻店。但必须是有资产负债表、销售、营销、医疗保健计划的企业。你必须知道如何做。我们在洛杉矶有一位市长，她什么都解决不了。不是她不想，而是她不知道怎么做。这个城市拒绝了一个竞选市长的商人，因为他可能太有钱了，或者他的西装太贵了，但那个人是警察局长。就像我们昨晚在这个城市晚餐时谈到的。我无法理解任何一个有“削减警察经费”运动的城市。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: He's never had a job. My thesis, which a lot of people in discussions, and I bring it up everywhere I go, I feel that if you're going to run in this country for mayor, governor, president, or vice president, you better have five years of having run a business, any kind of business. You could have a mom and pop store with five employees. But something with a balance sheet, sales, marketing, health care plan. You got to know how to do it. We have a mayor in LA that is not getting anything fixed. And it's not she doesn't know how to. She doesn't know how to. and the city rejected a guy that ran for mayor that was a businessman because maybe he was too rich or his suits were too expensive or but the guy was head of the police commissioner. It's like we were talking at dinner last night in this city. I can't understand any city that has a defund the police

**Shane**: 哦，是的。那是。

**Shane**: Oh yeah. That's

**Michael Ovitz**: 削减警察经费的运动。

**Michael Ovitz**: a defund the police campaign.

**Michael Ovitz**: I walk around London, I don't feel safe.

**Michael Ovitz**: 不。因为那里的政府正在把警察从街上撤走。我在纽约走动，我感觉很棒。我感觉很棒，因为有很多警察在外面。警察是世界上最受诋毁的服务人员。谁想要那份工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: No. Because the government there is taking the police off the street. I walk around New York, I feel great. I feel great because there's a lot of police out. The police are the most maligned service people in the world. Who wants that job?

</details>

**Shane**: 多么糟糕的工作。他们，我们有这些男人和女人来做这份工作。嘿，他们会犯错吗？是的。但这些错误值得我们抛弃整个系统吗？我不这么认为。我不这么认为。

**Shane**: What a terrible job. And they we get these men and women that do it. Hey, do they make mistakes? Yeah. But are the mistakes worth throwing out the whole system? I don't think so. I don't think so.

**Shane**: 我喜欢**迈克尔·布隆伯格**担任纽约市长时。我喜欢这样一个事实，无论你是否同意他的政治观点。我喜欢这样一个事实，一个在商业上如此经验丰富、如此成功的人来担任市长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I liked uh **Michael Bloomberg** when he was mayor of New York. I loved the fact whether you agree with his politics or not. I love the fact that somebody so experienced and so successful in business came in.

**Michael Ovitz**: 你知道吗？我喜欢**迈克·布隆伯格**这个人，也喜欢他作为市长。**迈克·布隆伯格**把事情办成了。**迈克·布隆伯格**白手起家建立了一家企业。我第一次见到他时，他刚开始那家企业。说实话，**迈克·布隆伯格**被**所罗门兄弟**解雇后，创办了美国最大最好的创意企业之一。他带着同样的激情、精神和组织能力来到这个城市。你谈到动力。**迈克·布隆伯格**在这个城市把事情办成了，他没有拘泥于形式。甚至有些他无法通过的事情，他都自己掏钱解决了。你在城市里感到安全。你不会觉得有人会过来抢劫你，因为你知道**布隆伯格**是警察的后盾。我认为**杰西卡·蒂什**在这里做得非常出色。你知道，有些人说她来自一个富裕的家庭。嗯，我说谁在乎呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You know what? I love **Mike Bloomberg** as a person and as a mayor. **Mike Bloomberg** got stuff done. **Mike Bloomberg** built a business from scratch. I met him when he first started that business. **Mike Bloomberg**, truth be known, was fired from **Solomon Brothers** and started what's one of the biggest and best creative businesses in the country. He comes into the city with the same passion, ethos, and organization. You talk about momentum. **Mike Bloomberg** got stuff done in this city and he didn't stand on ceremony. And even things that he couldn't get through, he paid for himself. and you felt safe in the city. You didn't feel like somebody was going to come up and and rob you because you knew **Bloomberg** had the police's back. And this concept, I think **Jessica Tish** has done a phenomenal job here. You know, there are those that say she comes from a wealthy family. Well, I say who cares?

**Shane**: 是的。

**Michael Ovitz**: 你知道，她一直很棒。而这位现任候选人甚至没有谈论他是否会留用她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: You know, she's been amazing. And the fact that this current candidate hasn't even talked about whether he'd keep her or not

**Shane**: 而且他想削减警察经费，把这个地方变成混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: and that he wants to defund the police and turn this place into chaos.

**Michael Ovitz**: 我不明白。我就是看不懂这种逻辑。我不在乎他多有魅力。对我来说，这毫无意义。你认为如果像**迈克·布隆伯格**这样的人上任，从外部看，至少从我的角度看，他一上任就立即成功了。就像动力立刻建立起来了。我好奇生活的其他方面，你认为如果某件事有效，它是否倾向于立即奏效，你能感觉到，能看到，动力正在建立，还是一个缓慢的过程，就像，给我更多时间。给我更多时间。我认为动力就像一列火车驶出车站。它不会瞬间发生。你必须建立它。这是一个有意识的积木游戏。就像你小时候玩积木一样。你必须有基础才能建造房子。**布隆伯格**做到了。它不是在前六个月就全部发生的。这是一个，它确实花时间才能达到速度，他做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I don't get it. I I just can't see the logic. I don't care how charismatic is. It doesn't make any sense to me. Do you think if somebody like **Mike Bloomberg** comes in, it seems from the outside, at least from my perspective, he's immediately successful when he comes in. like the momentum builds right away. And I'm curious as to other aspects of life, like do you think if something works, it tends to work right away and you can feel it, you can see it, and the momentum's building, or is it a slow process where it's like, give me more time. Give me more time. I think momentum is like a train coming out of a station. It doesn't happen instantaneously. You have to build it. It's a conscious building block game. It's like when you were a kid, you had blocks to build. You have to have foundation before you can build the house. And **Bloomberg** did it. It didn't all happen the first six months. It was a It literally took time to get up to speed and he did it.

</details>

**Shane**: 但关键是他直到离开才停止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: But the key is he didn't stop till he left.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 当你建立动力时，你不能放弃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And when you're building momentum, you cannot quit.

</details>

**Shane**: 这就是反问题，与我们之前谈到的削减的反驳。当你建立动力时，你不想停止。即使是10%的时间，你也不想停止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: And that's the counter problem, counterargument to when we talked about cutting back. When you're building momentum, you don't want to stop. even for 10% of your time, you don't want to stop.

### 动能与杠杆

**Shane**: 我很好奇，如果你要设计一门商业教育课程，课程内容会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I'm curious if you were putting together a business education, what would be on the curriculum?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 这是一个引人入胜的问题。嗯，我实际上正在思考这个问题，因为我的孙子昨天在**Tribeca**开始了一所新学校，叫做**Alpha School**。它是一个完全不同的教育角度。我真的很喜欢我所看到的。其中很多是实践学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: It's a fascinating question. Um, I was actually thinking about that cuz my grandson started a new school here in **Tribeca** yesterday that's called the **Alpha School**. And it's a completely different um angle on education. I really like what I saw. And a lot of it's practical learning.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 很多都是通过你感兴趣的事物来学习。我只是相信，在一个人的生命中，他们必须在任何事情上都处于一个持续进步的学习曲线中。我曾经在山谷里，**马克斯·列夫钦**是一个很棒的人，**PayPal**的联合创始人。我记得坐在他的办公室里。我们本来要去喝咖啡。他说：“跟我来。”他带我去了咖啡室，然后花了10分钟向我解释如何冲泡一杯完美的咖啡。我意识到那太棒了。他研究了所有的一切。他确切地知道什么时候该做什么，如何烘焙咖啡，如何研磨咖啡，在哪里放咖啡，使用什么样的水。所有这些我们都不会考虑的事情。我对自己说，那是一个人生的隐喻，冲泡一杯咖啡。它有点像日本的茶道。他把所有组件拆开并单独分析，然后把它们组合成一个流畅的动作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: A lot of it's learning by with things you're interested in. And I just believe that in one's life, they have to be on a constant and progressive learning curve period about anything. I was up in the valley once and **Max Levchin** is a great guy, founded a firm in **PayPal**, co-founder of **PayPal**. And I remember sitting in his office. We were going to have coffee. He said, "Come with me." And he took me to the coffee room and then proceeded to spend 10 minutes explaining to me how you brew the perfect cup of coffee. [snorts] And I realized it was so fantastic. He had studied it all. He knew exactly what to do when, how to roast the coffee, how to grind it, where to put it in, what kind of water to use. All stuff that none of us think about. And I said to myself, that is a metaphor for life, making a cup of coffee. It's kind of like a Japanese tea ceremony. [snorts] He took all the components apart and isolated them and then put [clears throat] them into a fluid movement.

</details>

**Shane**: 太不可思议了。我也爱咖啡。所以我能理解。你是如何看待动力的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: That's incredible. I love coffee, too. So, I I could relate to that. How do you think about momentum?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 对我来说，动力是我们做任何事情中最重要的一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Momentum to me is the single most important thing in in anything we do.

</details>

**Shane**: 再详细说说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Double click on that.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 在生活中保持你的兴趣和家庭的动力很重要。在商业中，如果你没有动力，你就没有生意。在体育中，动力会改变。第二名球队变成第一名球队。动力可能是生活中最被低估、最关键的事情之一。如果你想教别人如何获得动力，你会告诉他们什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: It's important in in life to keep momentum going of your interests and your family. In business, if you don't have momentum, you have no business. In sports, momentum changes. Second place teams to first place teams. Momentum may be one of the most underutilized, most critical thing in life. If you were trying to teach somebody how to get momentum, what would you tell them?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我不认为获得动力是一门科学。它更像是一种艺术形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I don't think getting momentum is a science. It's more an art form.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为动力在于极其努力的勤奋工作。它在于深入学习你的领域，深入学习你领域的外围知识，了解你的竞争对手是谁。你如何招募那些真正优秀但不在你这边的人？我认为我所参与的任何业务中，没有一次会议我没有问在座的人，你看到外面有什么优秀的人，谁上周、昨天或今天击败了你，谁脱颖而出了？我们就是这样招募了一些最优秀的高管。事实上，我们大约80%的高管都是这样招募的。我们要么在内部培养他们，要么从竞争对手那里挖走他们，因为他们符合我们的标准，而且在我们看来，他们身处错误的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I think that momentum is about extraordinarily hard industrious work. It's about deeply educating yourself in your field, deeply educating yourself in the peripheries of your field, knowing who your competitors are. How do you uh recruit people that are really good that aren't on your side of the ledger? I don't think a meeting went by in any business I've ever been in where I don't ask the people around the table, who have you seen out there that's good, who beat you last week or yesterday or today, who's standing out? We recruited some of our best executives that way. Matter of fact, we recruited I'd say 80% of our executives like that. We either grew them inside or recruited them from the competition because they had our standards and they were at the wrong place in our mind.

</details>

**Shane**: 你如何看待杠杆？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: How do you think about leverage?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，这很难。这是一个有争议的话题。嗯，有些人认为杠杆在商业中至关重要，有些人则认为杠杆非常糟糕。嗯，我倾向于认为杠杆是建立企业的一个非常重要的原则，因为如果你拥有杠杆，你就能为你的客户或产品提供服务。你在营销中需要杠杆。你在销售人员时需要杠杆。你在包装内容时需要杠杆。你需要杠杆来谈判。杠杆的含义并不是一件坏事。我不确定它是否那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, it's tough. It's a controversial subject. Um, there are those who feel leverage is critical in business and there are those that feel leverage is really nasty. Um, I come down on leverage as a very important principle of building a business because if you have leverage, you can deliver for your client or your product. And you need leverage in marketing. You need leverage when you're selling people. You need leverage when you're packaging content. You need leverage to negotiate. Leverage is a connotation of leverage isn't a is a bad thing. And I'm not sure it's so bad.

</details>

### 包装与知识产权保护

**Shane**: 你如何看待包装，以及包装对电影成功的重要性？有没有哪些电影包装得很差，但本应成功？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: How do you think about packaging and how important is packaging to a movie's success? Are there movies that [snorts] were packaged poorly but should have like otherwise been a success or

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，你可以对任何事情都这么说。对我来说，包装是生活的必需品。我包装我生活中的一切。我不断地将各种元素组合在一起。我刚刚通过结合两个不同的元素，把一个本来不是生意的东西变成了一个生意。这和包装一个电视节目没有什么不同。我告诉过你，当**迈克尔·基顿**把《**侏罗纪公园**》那本书给我时，我为它找到了合适的导演——**史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格**，没有第二个选择。嗯，我非常尊敬的一个朋友，**斯坦福大学**人工智能教授**克里斯·雷**给我打电话说：“**迈克尔**，我有一个朋友，他也是**斯坦福大学**的教授，非常聪明，我想让你见见他，他有一些非常有趣的技术，但他正在努力让它起步。”我说：“好的，**克里斯**，那是什么？”他说：“嗯，他有一家NFT公司。”他说：“**克里斯**，我没兴趣。”他说：“为什么？”我说：“我不喜欢NFT。我只是不喜欢。我是一个艺术收藏家，而不是NFT收藏家。”它们曾经很火。他说：“我以我的名义请你见见他。”我立刻回答“是”。没有丝毫犹豫。一个如此有地位的人请我见一个人，就像**罗恩·康威**请我见**安德森**一样，我不知道他为什么要见我，我也不知道任何关于云或技术的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, you could say that about anything. To me, packaging is a sinquon of life. Uh I package everything in my life. I put elements together constantly. I I I just put a a business together by combining uh two disperate elements and it turned out to be a business from something that wasn't a business. It's no different than packaging a television show and I told you, you know, when **Michael Kiteon** gave me the book of **Jurassic Park**, I put the right director with it, **Steven Spieler**, there was no second choice. Um, a friend of mine who I have unbelievable respect for, professor of AI at **Stanford** named **Chris Ray** calls me up and said, "Michael, I got a friend who's also professor at **Stanford**, really bright guy, and I want you to meet him, and he's got really interesting technology, but he's having some trouble getting it off the ground." And I said, "Okay, Chris, what what is it?" He said, "Well, he's got a NFT company." He said, "Chris, I'm not interested." And he said, "Why is that? I don't like NFTTS. I just don't like I'm an art collector. I'm not a NFT collector." And they were hot at one time. He said, "I'm asking you from me to you. Please meet him." The answer was instantaneously yes. Wasn't a hesitation. guy of that stature asked me to meet with someone like when **Ron Conway** asked me to with **Andre** it I didn't know why he wanted to meet with me I didn't know anything about clouds or technology

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 所以我见了一个人，**沃尔特·德·布鲁尔**博士，**斯坦福大学**人工智能教授，他有一家NFT公司。我们通话15分钟后，我只想知道如何结束通话，因为时间是我的敌人。时间是我生活中唯一关心的事情，因为总有一天你会用完它。我热爱我现在的生活。我正处于我人生中最好的阶段。这主要是因为我正处于一个可以想象到的最史诗般的学习曲线中。总之，**Shane**，我不知道发生了什么，但当他描述这项技术及其作用时，我脑子里突然灵光一闪。他在谈话中提到，他用神经指纹技术给这些NFT打了水印。我没有丝毫犹豫。我不知道我怎么了。我说：“你能用歌曲来做吗？”他说：“哦，那很简单。”我觉得这个回答太棒了，因为它既是对我的轻视，又非常完美，因为他有博士学位，而我什么都没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: so I meet with a guy **Dr. for Walter De Brewer**, **Stanford** AI professor, and he's got an NFT company. We're 15 minutes into the call and all I can do is think about how do I end this because it's time is my enemy. Time is the only thing in my life I am concerned about cuz at some point you run out of it. And I love I love my life right now. And I'm in the best place I've ever been in. And it's mostly because I'm on the most epic learning curve imaginable. Anyways, I don't know what happened, **Shane**, but a light bulb went off in my head when he described the technology and what it does. He mentioned to me in the course of it that he watermarked with neural fingerprinting these NFTTS and I didn't skip a beat. I don't know what came over me. I said, "Can you do that with songs?" And he said, "Oh, that's elementary." Which I thought was such a great answer cuz it was such a put down of me and it was so perfect because he has a PhD and I have nothing.

</details>

**Shane**: （笑）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: [laughter]

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 所以，你知道，我，多么一个纠正器，对吧？因为我坐在那里试图弄清楚如何挂断电话，而这个人却做出了一个终极声明，说我连一垒都上不了的事情，他却觉得很简单。我说，好的，我们进入了一个新业务。我说，假设你能做到这一点，他说，相信我，我能做到。我说，我们进入了一个新业务。关闭旧公司。让我们雇佣新的工程师。我们现在从事的是保护知识产权的业务。然后我说，你能对视频也这样做吗？他说，很简单。我说，你能对体育比赛也这样做吗？很简单。我们开创了一项业务。我职业生涯的大部分时间都在媒体领域与知识产权盗窃作斗争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: So, you know, I what a what a what a course corrector, right? [laughter] Cuz I'm sitting there trying to figure out how to get off the phone and this guy just makes the ultimate statement that something that I couldn't get to first base on. He thinks is elementary. I said, okay, we're in a new business. I said, assuming you can do this, he says, trust me, I can do this. I said, we're in a new business. Fold up the old company. Let's hire new engineers. We are now in the business of protecting intellectual property rights. And then I said, can you do this for video? He said, elementary. I said, can you do this for athletic games? Elementary. We started a business. I have spent most of my career in media fighting intellectual property theft.

</details>

**Shane**: 是的。96年，我带领**克林顿总统**的贸易代表团去了北京。我见了中国总理**江泽民**，以及二号人物，财政部长**朱镕基**，因为他们当时在制作录像带，人们在电影院里用摄像机拍摄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Yeah. In 96, I led a trade delegation for **President Clinton** to Beijing. I met with the premier of China, **Jung Min**, and **Zuang Xi**, the number two, the head of finance, because they were making videotapes [snorts] from people holding up video cameras in theaters.

</details>

**Shane**: 是的。他们正在扼杀这个行业，他们偷窃唱片，复制磁带，我带着20位商业巨头领导代表团。我们一无所获。而现在我正在和一位**斯坦福大学**的博士通电话，他告诉我他解决了这个问题。我们组建了这家公司。我打电话给**环球音乐集团**的**卢西安·格兰奇爵士**。我说：“**卢西安**，你我与知识产权盗窃作斗争多久了？”他说：“我们一辈子都在做。”我说：“我想我找到了答案。”他说：“告诉我，给我看看。”我做了。他说：“我加入。”现在**环球音乐集团**，然后是**索尼音乐**的**丹尼斯·科克**和**罗布·斯特林格**。所以我们有两家最大的音乐公司，我们正在给歌曲打水印，很快就会上线。接下来我们要做的是流媒体，我们会做电影，我们会做体育比赛。我完全不知道。我正在和**伦敦英超联赛**的一位负责人通电话，他给我打电话是因为我认识其中一位老板，他说：“我们听说你有一些技术可以帮助我们。”我说：“嗯，你为什么需要帮助？”因为我很好奇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Yeah. And they were killing the business and they were stealing records and they were duplicating tapes and I made I went with 20 mega business people to lead the delegation. We got nowhere. And here I am on the phone with a PhD from **Stanford** telling me that he's solved the problem. And we put this company together. And I called up **Sir Lucian Graange** who runs **Universal**. [clears throat] And I said, "Lucian, how long have you and I been working on in IP theft?" And he said, "Our whole [snorts] lives." I said, "I think I have the answer." He said, "Tell me, show me." I did. He said, "I'm in." And now **Universal** and then uh **Dennis Koker** and **Rob Stringer** at **Sony**. So, we have the two biggest music companies and we're watermarking songs and we will go live very shortly. Next thing we do is uh streaming, we'll do film, we will do uh athletic games. I I had no idea. I was on the phone with one of the heads of the **Premier League** in London and he he called me because I know one of the owners and he said, "We hear you have some technology that can help us." I said, "Well, why do you need help?" Cuz I was curious.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 他说：“很难相信，但我们有超过30支球队。每支球队，每场比赛，有75万次非法下载。”我说：“这怎么可能？哇。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: He [snorts] said, "Hard to believe, but we have over 30 teams. We have 750,000 illegal downloads every team, every game." I said, 'How's that possible? Wow.

</details>

**Shane**: 他说：“你可以在**谷歌**上找到如何通过非常简单的说明来避免为体育赛事付费。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: He said, 'You could literally go on to **Google** and find out how to get around paying for a sporting event with very simple instructions.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 坦白说，我有点震惊，而且我们这项技术的用例完全符合所有这些情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I was kind of shocked, frankly, and the use case for what we have fits all of this.

</details>

### 时间管理与信任

**Shane**: 我想回到你谈到的时间管理。你会回去告诉年轻时的自己什么？你希望年轻时就知道哪些关于时间管理或优先排序的事情，而你现在知道了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I want to come back to something you said about time management. What would you go back and tell your younger self? What do you wish you knew when you were younger about managing your time or prioritization that you know now?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 嗯，这是一个好问题。答案很简单，因为我经常思考这个问题。我本可以削减10%的业务时间，在那段时间里我只做业务，让动力推动它前进，让与我合作的其他人来做。然后我把那10%的时间用于我的家庭、我的艺术收藏、阅读以及其他对我重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Well, that's a good question. It's a simple answer because I think about it so much. I I could have cut back 10% of my business time where I did nothing but business and let momentum carry it forward and other people that worked with me and used that 10% of my time for my family, for my art collecting, for reading, for other things that were important to me.

</details>

**Shane**: 你认为这是真的吗？因为我总是在想，事后看来，你回过头看，你会说：“当然，我本可以放弃10%或20%的时间，并获得相同的结果，但正是你这个人，让你付出了那额外的10%或20%。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Do you think that's true? Because I always wonder with this in hindsight, you're looking back and you're like, "Sure, I could have gave up 10 or 20% of my time and had the same result, but it's who you were as a person that gave you that extra 10 or 20%."

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为你百分之百正确，那正是阻碍。但现实是，有办法做到这一点。就像我现在会在我的日程表上预留出我的空闲时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: And and I think you're 100% right and that's the stopper. But the reality is there's ways of doing it. like I now book out my free time on my own calendar

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 它就在那里，它不会被预订。作为一名成功的商人，这有一个负面影响，你沉浸在完成所有这些美妙事情的多巴胺中，因为你处于这种状态并且拥有动力，你可以完成更多的事情，所以你一天中的每一秒都想去做，但你必须足够成熟，能够审视它并说，也许我一开始只削减2%的时间，然后做X、Y和Z，这很难，因为你会陷入一种矛盾的境地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: and I just it's there and it's not you it doesn't get booked there's a negative in that as a successful business person where you're feeding on the dopamine of getting all these wonderful things done and because you're on this role and you have momentum you can get so much more done that you want to do it every second of the day but you have to be mature enough to look at it and say maybe I'll just cut 2% back at the beginning and do X Y and Z and it's hard because you get it's a conflicted

</details>

**Shane**: 你脑子里的一个矛盾情景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: scenario in your own head

</details>

**Shane**: 当人们推荐会议时，你接受会议，听起来你是在说，我信任这个人，所以通过代理，我信任我正在见面的人。信任有多重要？也许你可以花几分钟谈谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: when you take meetings when people recommend them it sound like what I hear when you're saying that is I trust this person so by proxy I trust the person I'm meeting with how important is trust and maybe you can spend just a few minutes sort of

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的，我的意思是这并不复杂。对我来说，信任是人与人之间最重要的事情。我对此非常直言不讳，而且在我生命中发生过几次。我无法很好地处理背叛。我不是在谈论男朋友、女朋友。我是在谈论商业中的背叛。我无法很好地处理背叛。我不认为在任何情况下它有任何正当理由，我对此反应非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: yeah I mean it's not complicated Trust to me is the most important thing between human beings. And I have and I've been very viciferous about this and it's happened to me uh a couple of times in my life. I don't handle betrayal well. And I'm not talking about boyfriend, girlfriend. I'm talking about in business. I don't handle betrayal well. I don't think that there's any justification for it under any condition and I I react very badly to it.

</details>

**Shane**: 所谓背叛，你是指恶意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: By betrayal, you mean malicious intent.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的。是的。或者被设计陷害失败，或者被欺骗然后掉进陷阱。我的意思是，我们已经在电视上看到了所有的情节，你知道，**Shane**，我可以给你看20个节目，但它不是，我不是在谈论男性女性之间的背叛，或者男性，我不是在谈论夫妻之间的背叛，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah. Yeah. Or being set up for something to fail or uh being lied to and then walking into a trap. I mean, we've seen all the plots in on television, you know, **Shane**, there I can give you 20 shows to watch, but it's it's I'm not talking about male female betrayal or male I'm not talking about couples betrayal, you know?

</details>

**Shane**: 不，你身边的人背叛过你。比如，你当时怎么办？你是如何从那次经历中恢复过来的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: No, you've had people close to you betray you. Like, how how do you what do you do in that moment? Like, how do you bounce back from that?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 之后你如何信任其他人？嗯，你不能，你不能，你知道，一概而论。所以你必须像我告诉你伦敦那个人一样，重新站起来。你必须回去，你必须忍受，然后穿好衣服，穿着你的制服去球场，拿到球然后跑。这不容易，因为你的腿不像以前那么稳健了，但你必须这样做。而且可能，就像在我生命中发生过几次一样，我对信任的人变得更加敏感了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: How do you trust other people after that? Well, you can't you can't, you know, stain everyone with the same brush. So, you have to kind of get back up on your feet like I told you about the guy in London. And you got to go back and you got to kind of suck it up and [snorts] get dressed and go out to the playing field in your uniform and get the ball and run with it. Again, not easy cuz your legs aren't quite as sure as they were before, but you got to do it. And probably as it's happened to me a few times in my life, I've gotten a little more sensitive to the people that I trust.

</details>

**Shane**: 你觉得发生这种事后你会穿上更多盔甲，然后保持？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: Do you find you put on more armor after that happens and like keep you

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 哦，我变得非常防御。是的。我花了很长时间才卸下那层盔甲。这会发生在每个人身上，还是只发生在特定的人身上？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: Oh, I got very defensive. Yeah. Took me a long time to get that armor off. Does that happen with everybody or just the person?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我不知道。每个人对它的理解都不同，每个人，它对每个人来说都是独一无二的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I don't know. Everyone Everyone has different interpretations of it and everyone it's unique to each human being.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我认为，因为我的成长经历，它对我来说变得非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: I I think because of how I was raised that it became a a very important thing to me.

</details>

**Shane**: 我认为这是一个很好的结束点。我们总是以同样的问题结束，那就是：对你来说，成功是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I think that's a great place to end this. We always end with the same question which is what is success for you?

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 对我来说，它不是一个单一的定义。我对成功的定义非常广泛。对我来说，成功是拥有一个了不起的家庭，因为归根结底，那是你的遗产。除非你是**乔纳斯·索尔克**（Jonas Salk），否则别无他物。你知道，每亿人中才有一个那样的人。嗯，成功是你一生中在教育方面取得了巨大的成就。是你学到了比你想象中多得多的东西。它是从零开始创造一些东西，这就是我再次开始工作的原因。我喜欢创造东西。有人问我为什么在我人生的这个阶段还在工作，我看着他们，就像他们有什么问题一样。因为他们怎么会问我这个问题呢？但他们接着说：“那么，你人生中最有趣的时光是什么？”我说：“从零开始建立我创办的企业。”我正在再次这样做。我和几个年轻的合伙人已经合作了一年。我的意思是，你知道，我有一个叫**阿里·哈米德**的年轻人和我在一起，他现在30岁了。他32或33岁了。我还有我的儿子，他也加入了。我花了10年才说服他这样做。他不想做，但我和他的搭档**亚历克斯**在一起，创造很有趣。然后，对我来说，成功是，我认为成功是在这个国家的感恩节餐桌上定义的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: It's a it's not a singular definition for me. I have a very broad um definition of what success is. Success to me is having an amazing family because at the end of the day that's your legacy. Nothing else unless you're **Jonas Sulk**. You know, there's one of those for every hundred million people. Um, it's having had a great run in your life in education. It's having learned so much more than you ever thought you'd learn. It's building something from scratch, which is why I started working again. I love building things. Someone asked me why I'm working at this stage of my life, and I looked [clears throat] at them like there was something wrong with them. because how could they even ask me that question? But they then said, "Well, what's the most fun time of your life?" I said, "Building businesses that I started from scratch. I'm doing it again. I'm a year in with a couple of young partners." And I mean, you know, I've got a young guy named **Ali Hammed** with me who's 30 now. He's 32 or three. And I've got my son uh who joined me. It took me 10 years to convince him to do that. He didn't want to do it, but I've got his partner, **Alex**, with me, and it's fun to build. And then success to me is I find success defined at the Thanksgiving dinner table in this country.

</details>

**Shane**: 我甚至不知道加拿大有没有感恩节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: I don't even know if you have Thanksgiving in Canada.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 我们有。我们有。在星期一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Ovitz**: We do. We do. It's on Monday.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 所以我们，我们，这是我一年中最喜欢的节日。它比任何其他节日都更受喜爱。生日、圣诞节、光明节，任何节日，因为它完全是关于你的家人。它不是关于强制送礼。

**Michael Ovitz**: I just love Thanksgiving. To me, it's the most important holiday of the year.

**Shane**: 我喜欢这个。但成功是所有这些事情，成功是完成了某件事，你知道，它不是一个定义上的东西，但它可以是。当我为**加州大学洛杉矶分校医学中心**的建设做出贡献时，我非常自豪。当我让**贝聿铭**建造它以及我们**CA**的建筑时，我非常自豪。当我从零开始建造我的房子之一时，你知道，我能做到这一点。有时当我买到一件对我的生活有巨大影响的艺术品时，我非常自豪，有人真正与我产生了共鸣。嗯，成功有很多参数。它不是一件单一的事情。当人们对我说，这就是我对成功的定义，他们给我一个，你知道，一个词的定义时，我无法接受，因为对我来说，情况并非如此。

**Shane**: I love that. But success is all those things and success is having accomplished something you know and it's not definitionally a thing but it can be. I was very proud when I contributed to the **UCLA medical center** being built. I was very proud when I got I am pay to build that and our building for **CA**. I'm very proud when I built one of my houses from scratch, you know, that I could do. I'm very proud sometimes when I buy a piece of art that has a huge huge impact on my life where someone's really connected with me. Um, success has a lot of parameters. It's not a single thing. And when people say that to me like this is my definition of success and they give me a you know a one word definition I can't cope with that because it's just not the case for me.

**Shane**: 它是多方面的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shane**: It's multifaceted.

</details>

**Michael Ovitz**: 是的。它是由很多事情累积起来的，对我来说，成功就像一幅伟大的**修拉**画作。**修拉**是伟大的点彩派画家。所以如果你看他作品的一英寸，它们都是点。你看一英寸，什么也看不到。两英寸，什么也看不到。三英寸，什么也没有。四英寸，也许你看到某个附肢。六英寸，也许是某个东西，一个肢体，一株植物。十英寸，哦，那是一张脸。然后当它达到四英尺或三英尺乘两英尺时，你看到眼前是一幅完整的画面。对我来说，这就是成功的定义，我们的生活是由许多小点组成的，当它们描绘出正确的画面时，你就成功了。

**Michael Ovitz**: Yeah. It's a lot of things that add up and it's it to me [clears throat] success is a great **Sarra** painting. **Sarra** was the great pointalist. So if you looked at an inch of his work, they were all dots. You look at an inch, you don't see anything. Two inches, you don't see anything. Three, nothing. Four, maybe you see an appendage of something. Six, maybe something, a limb, a plant. 10, oh, there's a face. Then when it gets to be 4 feet or 3 feet by 2 feet, you see an entire picture in front of your eyes. And that to me is the definition of success is that our lives are made up of a lot of little dots and when they tell the right picture, you hit it.
