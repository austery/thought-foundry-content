### 关税退款的个人经历与市场预期

**Jill Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的Odd Lots播客。我是**Jill Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Jill Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你觉得你和我能拿到退款吗？因为他们取消了关税，对吧？根据经济学家的说法，消费者支付关税。所以如果消费者支付关税，而他们又取消了退款，我们是不是应该拿到钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Do you think you and I are going to start getting checks because they struck down the tariffs? Right. And according to economists, consumers pay the tariff. So if consumers pay the tariffs and they strike down the refund, shouldn't we get the money?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我经常说，**Joe**，我买很多东西，特别是从国外买很多稀奇古怪的东西。有时我觉得自己像在经营一家小型物流公司。我要说的是，我知道是**记录进口商**（importer of record）实际支付关税，并且理应获得退款。然而，我有几次经历，比如邮政服务会把东西送到我家，特别是在康涅狄格州，他们会在那里说：“你欠我们50美元现金作为关税支付。”我当时就站在门口，真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I have often said, Joe, I buy a lot of stuff. Yeah. Especially from abroad, a lot of weird stuff. Sometimes I feel like I'm running a small logistics company. And I will say, so I know it's the importer of record who actually pays the tariffs and is supposedly supposed to get the refund. However, I've had a few instances where like the postal service will deliver something to my house, especially in Connecticut, and while they're there, we'll say, "You owe us like $50 in cash as a tariff payment." And I'm literally standing on my door

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: really

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我付了现金，钱就这么走了。所以，我感觉自己确实是直接向**特朗普政府**支付了关税。这是一种非常直观的感受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: paying out cash and it's going somewhere. So, I feel very much like I actually have paid the tariffs pretty much directly to the Trump government. Like, there is something very visceral.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我有个坏消息要告诉你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I have some bad news to

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我知道，我知道。那个人是个骗子，他出现了，然后他们就骗你相信了，因为我从来没听说过有人要付现金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I know. I know. The person who did that was a con artist who showed up and they said and they they duped you into thinking that because I have never heard of someone having to pay cash.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你从国外买的东西不够多。不，这绝对是真的。我是在网上收到账单的，然后你可以选择在线支付，也可以付现金给邮递员。这很奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: You're not buy you're not buying enough from abroad. No, it's definitely true. I got the bill online and then you can either pay online or you can pay the postal guy in cash. It's very strange.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我从没听说过这种事。总之，所有人都想把钱要回来。这会怎么发生？时间框架是什么？会有重大的法庭斗争。今天早上《华尔街日报》有篇文章说，追回退款的诉讼规模将达到“石棉级别”，众所周知，那可是长达数十年的诉讼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I've never heard of that. Anyway, everyone wants their money back. How that's going to happen? What the time frame is? There's going to be major court fights. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning and it said that the scale of the suits to recover it is going to be quote the same level is at isbestous levels which famously was you know multiple decades of lawsuits

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这也催生了整个法律行业的一部分，有很多间皮瘤律师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: also gave birth to an entire portion of the legal industry lots of messtheloma lawyers out there

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 之后我会告诉你，我曾短暂地作为数据收集员参与过那个行业，这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: some time later I'll tell you I was briefly part of that industry as a data collector for it that's interesting

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的，这很有趣。总之，我们得弄清楚这一切会如何发生，因为我们知道所有这些大公司都想把钱要回来。当然，**特朗普政府**在输掉一项关税后，又推出了另一项可能也会引发法庭纠纷的关税。我们还知道，华尔街银行曾促成了一个热门的索赔二级市场。所以，这会是一团糟，可能会持续多年。我们得弄清楚公司到底如何才能拿回钱，以及他们是否能拿到，或者钱会不会都进了律师的口袋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: yeah it's fun anyway we got to figure out how it's all going to happen because we know all these big companies they want their money back. Of course, you know, there's new tariffs already in the like the Trump administration after losing one tariffs, they're like putting in a different one that's probably going to have court fights, etc. We also know that there was a popular secondary market in claims that Wall Street banks were facilitating. And so, this is going to be a mess. It's probably going to stand for years. We got to figure out how companies are actually in the process of get getting their money back and whether they'll ever see it or whether it all go to the lawyers.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，这是另一回事。我知道你和我一直都害怕文书工作和官僚主义，而这件事尤其让我觉得是文书工作和官僚主义的噩梦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, this is the other thing. I know you and I live in perpetual fear of paperwork and bureaucracy and this in particular just strikes me as like the biggest nightmare of paperwork and bureaucracy.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我讨厌那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I hate that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你知道，对于某些关税，你需要根据你购买的商品中关税项目的比例来计算。比如钢铁和铝，这个东西到底有多少是钢铁？这简直就是一场噩梦。整个海关的事情就像一场噩梦。仍然非常陈旧。我们必须更多地了解这场噩梦，这场混乱。当我们想了解更多关于贸易的实际操作细节，而不是经济学家谈论的理论知识时，我们应该和谁聊聊呢？当然，我们请来了完美的嘉宾，**Flexport**的创始人兼首席执行官**Ryan Peterson**。**Ryan**，感谢你再次来到Odd Lots。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know, for some of the tariffs you're like calculating them by like the proportion of like the tariff item in the thing you're buying. So like steel and aluminum, how much of this thing is actually steel? It just seems like a nightmare. The whole thing of customs seems like a nightmare. Still very antiquated. We got to learn more about this nightmare, about this chaos. And who do we talk to when we want to learn more about not the theoretical stuff that about trade that, you know, economists talk to talk about, which I love them too, but the actual nuts and bolts of moving things of course uh perfect guest Ryan Peterson, founder and CEO of Flexport, joins us today. So Ryan, thanks for coming back on Odd Outlaws. It

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 很高兴再次和你们在一起。**Tracy**，那个人可能是一个邮递员的冒充者，但冒充邮递员是违法的。我万圣节时想扮成邮递员，但你买不到邮递员的制服，我不得不借了一套。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: is great to be with you. And Tracy, that person may have been an impersonator of a postman, but it is illegal to impersonate a postman. I tried to be one for Halloween and you can't buy a postman's outfit. I had to borrow one.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我和邮递员成了朋友，他把他的制服借给了我，但他当时说，如果有人发现，我就会被解雇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I made friends with the mailman and he gave me his to borrow, but he was like, I will get fired if anyone finds out.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 各位，我只想说清楚，那不是骗局。那个人拿着我的包裹，我收到了账单，也收到了包裹。海关没有因为未付账单而追究我。只是很奇怪，但我觉得这说明很多美国人会觉得他们是直接支付了这些关税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Guys, I'm just going to be very clear. It wasn't a scam. The guy had my package. I had the bill. I've received the package. Customs isn't going after me for unpaid bills. It's just weird. It's weird. But I think it speaks to like a lot of Americans will feel like they have paid these tariffs extremely directly.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的，**Ryan**，我们从大局开始。你和很多公司合作，等等。2月26日，他们现在都在忙些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: All right, Ryan, let's just start big picture. You work with a lot of companies, etc. February 26, what are they all up to right now?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 每个人都想知道他们是否能拿到退款。这是个大问题。如果能，什么时候，怎么拿？我们一直在告诉大家，**Flexport**是美国最大的报关行之一，我认为也是自动化程度最高的一家，拥有最好的系统来计算这些东西。这是我在这里唯一要做的推销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Everybody wants to figure out if they're going to get a refund. That's the big question. And if so, when and how? and my ad what we've been telling. So Flexport is a one of the bigger customs brokers in the United States and and I think the most automated one the best systems for calculating this stuff and all that. That's my the only sales pitch I'll do here. But the um

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这是允许的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: it's allowed.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 所以，这是一个巨大的问题。然后他们还想知道，我能现在就卖掉这个吗？你提到了二级市场，一个非常有趣的事实是，三周前，这些交易的价格大约是面值的25美分，而在最高法院裁决的同一天，周五，它涨到了面值的52美分。市场对这些事情的反应非常迅速。所以，我上周与很多公司交流，他们的首席执行官都说：“是的，他们今天会以面值70美分的价格出售，他们正在考虑以52美分的价格出售。”所以我认为这个市场真的会升温。但这些都是要问的大问题，我确实有自己的看法。我相信，我非常有信心，几乎是确信，会有退款，而且我认为不会等太久。我认为今年你就会看到退款，我愿意为此预测押上我的声誉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: So that is the giant question. And then they also want to know hey can I sell this now? You know, you mentioned the secondary market that the very interesting fact fun fact there is that that was those were trading at about 25 cents on the dollar three weeks ago and it went to 52 cents on the dollar on Friday the same day of the Supreme Court. Markets move very fast on this stuff. So, a lot of the companies I talked to in the last week have said the CEOs had said, "Yeah, they would sell at 70 cents on the dollar today and they're considering it at 52 cents." So, I think that market's really going to heat up. Um, but yeah, those are the big questions to ask and I do have opinions. I think I believe I have a very high degree of certainty like bordering on certainty, conviction bordering on certainty that there will be refunds and I don't think it's going to take that long. I think you're going to see refunds this year would be I'm going to put my name put my reputation on the line with that prediction.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的。那么，最高法院……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Well, okay. So, the Supreme Court

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: **Tracy**，不是为你。抱歉。我不知道怎么……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Not for you, Tracy. Sorry. I don't know how

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我已经认命了。我其实需要雇一个报关行，这就是我需要做的。像**Ryan**这样的人。但是，最高法院推翻了大部分关税，但他们没有做的是说明接下来会发生什么？退款到底如何运作？你有没有觉得他们对如何运作有任何想法，只是没有说出来，或者他们只是把决定这个过程的权力留给了其他人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I've already resigned myself. I need to hire a customs broker actually is what I need to do. Someone like Ryan. But okay, so the Supreme Court struck down the majority of the tariffs, but the thing they didn't do is say like what happens next? How do refunds actually work? Do you get a sense of like did they have any idea of how it should work that they just didn't say or like they're just leaving it open to who exactly to decide the process of how this actually happens?

</details>

### 关税退款的法律依据与流程

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，这里有一些背景信息。这个案子最初是在**国际贸易法院**（Court of International Trade）审理的，政府败诉了。然后它上诉到了**上诉法院**（appellet court），这是低于最高法院的级别。在上诉法院，原告，一家叫做**Voss Selections**的公司（我忘了具体是什么，我应该记住的），这家小企业提起了诉讼，他们实际上要求暂停执行一项行政禁令，要求停止征收这些关税，直到案件审理完毕。你们输了官司，现在必须停止。而司法部（DOJ）在上诉法院提交了一份动议，称如果他们输掉这个案子，如果政府输掉这个案子，就会有退款。这来自**司法部**。他们提交了动议，你可以在案卷中读到。然后他们在那儿又输了官司，案子到了最高法院，他们又输了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah. So, a little backgrounds here. So this started in as a case in the court of international trade which the administration lost. It then went to the appellet court which is the level below the Supreme Court in the appeal there at the appellet court. The plaintiff this company called Voss Voss something I forget I should have but there the plaintiff is a small business that was suing and they actually asked for a stay an administrative injunction a stay to say hey you have to stop collecting these tariffs while this gets worked through. You lost the case you need to stop now. And the DOJ in that appellet court filed a motion that said if we lose this case, if the government lose this case, there will be refunds. Like that's from the DOJ. They filed the motion. You can read it in the docket. They then lost the case there. It went to the Supreme Court. They lost again.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 最高法院已将其发回最初的初审法院，即**国际贸易法院**，并表示：“好吧，你们决定是否有，你知道，退款将如何进行。”他们没有提及退款的任何事情，只是将其发回给他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: The Supreme Court has sent it back down to the original first court, the Court of International Trade, and said, "Okay, you decide if there's, you know, how the refunds are going to." They didn't say anything about refunds. It just goes back to them.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 如果你读了这份文件，我不是律师，但我能读懂并形成自己的看法。我之所以如此确定，是因为我咨询了三位不同的国际贸易律师，他们都百分之百确定会有退款。我这辈子从没听过律师对任何事情说百分之百确定。顺便说一句，我正在查这家提起诉讼的公司，**Voss Selections**，它是一家纽约的葡萄酒进口商。他们的网站看起来很不错，非常有趣，上面有许多精美的图片，写着葡萄酒、清酒和其他烈酒，然后有一个大大的标题叫“对抗关税”。这在他们的网站上看起来有点突兀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: It it's just if you read the thing and I'm not a lawyer, okay, but I can read it and I make my own opinion. But the more the reason I really have certainty is I've talked to three different international trade attorneys who all told me 100% certainty that there would be refunds. And I've never heard a lawyer say 100% certainty of anything before in my whole life. So, by the way, the company that filed I'm looking it up, Voss Selections, it's a it's a wine importer in uh in New York. It looks like they have a really nice website. Their website is very funny because it has all these beautiful pictures and it says wines and then saki and other spirits and then there's a big thing called fighting the tariffs. It sort of looks ugly on their website.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这太棒了。我得从这家伙那里买点酒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: That's epic. I got to buy some wine from this guy.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 他们通过承担这个案子，为大家做了一件大好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: They've done everyone a big solid here by taking this on.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这就是未来的Odd Lots嘉宾，来谈谈这个案子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: That's a future OddLots guest right there with this case to talk about it.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这个贸易法院，它不像某个联合国法院。它是一个设在纽约的美国法院。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: This court of trade, it's not like some UN court. It's a New Yorkbased US court.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 听起来它会像是**WTO**或其他什么组织，但这是一个地方性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: It sounds like it would be like the WTO or something like that, but this is a local

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 不，不。它是一个美国法院，他们会把这类案件送到那里。事实上，还有另一个案件是在**哥伦比亚特区巡回法院**（DC circuit case），第六巡回法院提起的，他们把这些案件捆绑在一起，送到了**国际贸易法院**。目前，法院面前有超过2000个案件，挑战**AIPA**（即要求退款，实际是挑战他们应该获得退款）。所以，我认为这些案件很可能会合并成一个，然后提交法院审理。现在，**国际贸易法院**从2月20日最高法院裁决之日起，只有30天的时间来做出关于下一步如何处理的裁决。所以，我认为我们很快就会知道退款的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: No. No. It's a US court where they send these types of cases. In fact, there was another case that was brought in the DC circuit case, six circuit court, and they bundled them together into the court of international trade. Now, currently, there are over 2,000 cases before the courts before the court challenging AIPA, sorry, requesting refunds, effective challenging that they should get a refund. So, I think those will likely all get rolled into one and it'll go to court. Now, the Court of International Trade has only 30 days from February 20th was when the Supreme Court came out and they have 30 days to to make a ruling of what happens next. So, I think we're going to know pretty quick how the refunds, you know, that there will be refunds.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 只是为了澄清，这种信心的一部分原因，我的意思是，法律就是法律，我想，但它是否因为**司法部**在最高法院之前发表的评论，预先表明如果你们推翻这个决定，我们将不得不退款？这是律师们如此自信的一部分原因吗？因为他们已经将其作为反对推翻的论据之一陈述了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Just to be clear, is part of the reason that there is this confidence, I mean, the law is the law, I guess, but is because of that DOJ comment prior to the Supreme Court pre-indicating that if you guys reverse this, we're going to have to make refunds. Is it is that part of the reason that the lawyers have such confidence because they've already stated that as part of their arguments against striking down?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 没错。我的意思是，你想想看，我不是律师，你总会找到一些律师会指出一些灰色地带，但我已经和三位律师谈过，他们都非常确定。你知道，想象一下你回到同一个法官面前，你说：“嘿，你知道，你正在试图阻止退款。”而你的法官会说：“嗯，你向我的法庭提交了这份文件，这份动议说如果你输了，你会退款。你为什么不兑现这个承诺呢？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Exly. I mean, just think about, look, I'm not a lawyer and you're always going to find some lawyers that will show some gray area, but I've talked to three that had just pure certainty and you know, just imagine that you're going back to the same judge and you're saying, hey, you know, you're trying to fight the refunds and your judge is going to go like, well, you filed this paper, you know, this motion in my court that said you would give a refund if you lost. Like, why are you not honoring that saying? So,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 但这里面有复杂性。我不是法律专家，我更像是一个海关关税专家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: but there's there's complexities here. I'm not a legal expert. I'm more of a customs tariffs expert. So,

</details>

### 谁是关税的实际支付者？

**Tracy Alloway**: 那么，在我们深入讨论之前，我们先来谈谈当一件商品在国外制造，然后由一家运输公司进口，再通过报关行，最终到达商店，然后被消费者购买时，到底是谁支付了关税？那么，所谓的**记录进口商**（importer of record）是谁，他们理应获得退款？是的，这是它的法律术语，**记录进口商**，它通常是一家美国企业。在你的案例中，你是以个人身份进行的。你可能在那次交易中是或不是**记录进口商**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: so maybe before we go any further, let's just talk about who actually is paying the tariffs when like, you know, an item gets made abroad and then it gets imported by, I don't know, a shipping company and then it goes through a customs broker and then it actually ends up at a store and then it gets bought by whoever. Who is the entity that is actually paying the tariff? So, the importer of record that supposedly is going to get this refund. Yeah, it is that's the legal term for it is the importer of record and it's generally a US business. In your case, you did it as an individual. You may or may not have been the importer of record on that transaction.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的，我很确定那是实际的运输公司，但随便吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was like the actual shipping company, but whatever.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 对于小包裹，情况就是这样。这非常重要，因为**FedEx**本周起诉政府要求退款。我最初的反应是，等等，我不明白。**FedEx**不支付关税，他们的客户支付。但事实证明，对于小包裹，我以前没有意识到这一点，因为我不在小包裹业务领域，但如果你收到一个包裹，尽管**FedEx**会给你寄送关税账单，但**FedEx**是**记录进口商**，他们支付关税。所以退款会给他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: And with small parcel, that was that's what happened. And that's very relevant because FedEx this week sued the government for a refund. And my initial reaction was like, wait, I don't understand. Like FedEx doesn't pay the tariffs. Their customers do. But it turns out for a small parcel, what I didn't I'm not in the small partial business, small parcel business, so I didn't realize this really, but is that if you're getting a parcel delivered, although you are sent a tariff bill by FedEx, FedEx is the importer of record, they pay the tariff. So the refund comes to them,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 他们没有法律义务把钱还给你，直到他们可能会被一群像**Tracy**和你的朋友以及其他所有人提起集体诉讼。或者，你知道，如果他们从政府那里拿到钱却不还给你，那也会损害品牌形象。所以，这看起来不是一个好主意。这就是小包裹的情况。如果你进口集装箱，那是我们从事的业务，运输大宗货物，**记录进口商**是美国实体，但它不一定在美国境内。英国、香港是世界上唯一允许非居民进口商的国家（如果我们把香港算作一个国家的话）。直到去年4月，这大约占美国贸易的9%，从4月开始，这个比例上升到了20%。外国公司进口的贸易额激增了11%。所以，实际上，大约20%的退款（我不知道具体金额，但20%获得退款的公司将是外国公司），没有什么比这更让**特朗普**恼火的了。我们真的要把这笔钱汇到海外。你能解释一下自“解放日”以来发生了什么变化，使得很多外国公司在美国设立自己作为进口商变得合理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: they don't have to give it to you legally until they'll probably get class action lawsuit by a bunch of Tracy's and your friends and everybody else out there. or you know it's also just brand damage if they don't if they get the money from the government and don't do it I don't know it seems like a bad look so that's the case of small parcel in you're importing containers that's the business that we're in ship large volume stuff the importer of record is is a US entity but it doesn't have to be in in actually United States UK Hong Kong are the only countries in the world if we want to count Hong Kong as a country the only places in the world that allow non-resident importers so it's a foreign importer of record until April of last year that was about 9% of US trade since April it went to 20%. Uh it's been an explosion of companies 11% of trade flipped to where the foreign company imports it and so actually about 20% of the refunds I don't know in dollar value but 20% of the companies getting a refund will be foreign companies and that nothing is going to piss Trump off worse than that. We're literally going to wire this money overseas. Can you explain what changed since liberation day such that it made sense for a lot of foreign companies to establish themselves as importers in the US?

</details>

### 供应链重组与关税欺诈

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，发生变化的是一个巨大的**欺诈**动机。如果你是一家从海外购买商品的美国公司，你必须支付关税，对吧？你申报你的商品，然后按照商品价值的一定百分比支付关税。但如果你说：“嘿，我只在美国境内从我的工厂购买商品。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah. So what what changed was a massive incentive to commit fraud. And if you're a US company that was buying goods from overseas, you have to pay the tariffs, right? And you you declare your goods, you pay the tariff as a percent of the value of those goods. If instead you say, "Hey, I'm just going to buy the goods in the United States from my factory

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 他们会处理关税，而那家外国公司可以低估商品价值，说：“嘿，这个东西实际上只值1万美元。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: and they'll take care of the tariffs and that foreign company can just undervalue the goods and say, "Hey, this thing that you know, it's actually only $10,000."

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 哦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Oh,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 不是10万美元。你就把你的关税减少了90%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: not a h 100,000. And you just reduce your duties by 90%.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 哦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Oh,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 而且美国公司正在大规模地这样做，他们洗手不干，说：“嘿，我不知道，我没看到任何东西。我只是从这家外国公司购买商品，这不是我的问题。”所以我们看到了这种现象的大规模爆发。顺便说一句，所有那些美国公司，他们不进口任何东西，所以他们根本拿不到任何退款。我一点也不为他们感到难过。

**Jill Weisenthal**: and the US companies are doing this in mass and washing their hands and saying, "Hey, I you know, I didn't know any better. I didn't know they I don't see any of that. I'm just buying the goods from this foreign company and it's not my problem. And so we've seen a huge explosion of that. And all those people are not those US companies, by the way, they don't import anything. So they're not getting any refunds at all. And I don't feel bad for them.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，你必须想象，当这些关税生效时，你会看到一些“创造性的”工作，你知道，对于听众来说，这里有“创造性”的引号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Uh yeah, you got to imagine when you have something like these tariffs come into play, you're going to see some creative work creative, you know, with for listeners with air quotes around there.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的。我们从你**Tracy**谈论的个人案例开始，你从国外购买了一些东西。但当然，大规模的情况是，你只是从国内的公司购买。在很多情况下，他们确实因为关税而提高了价格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah. And where we started, Tracy, was you were talking about an individual case where you actually bought something from abroad. But of course, the massive things is, hey, you just buy it domestically from a company. They did raise their prices for the tariffs in a lot of cases.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 他们不会得到任何退款。但真正有趣的“敲诈”正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: They're you're not going to get any refunds. But the really interesting shakeddown that's happening

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 好的，假设你实际上是一个批发商，你卖给**沃尔玛**（Walmart）、**塔吉特**（Target）这类公司。你的关税上涨了，你提高了价格。我昨晚和一家在**沃尔玛**销售的大公司，一家**沃尔玛**的批发商谈过，他们说周一早上**沃尔玛**打电话说：“嘿，我们需要谈谈这个关税退款。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: is, okay, let's say you actually are a wholesaler and you sell to Walmart, Target, these types. Your tariffs went up, you raised prices. Walmart. I talked to a company last night who's a big seller on Walmart, wholesaler to Walmart, and they said Monday morning Walmart called and said, "Hey, we need to talk about this tariff refund."

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 哦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Oh.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 以及我们如何获得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: And how we're going to get

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 因为他们没有法律义务把钱给**沃尔玛**，但**沃尔玛**也没有法律义务继续在商店里销售他们的产品，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: because they, you know, they don't have a legal obligation to give money to Walmart, but Walmart also doesn't have a legal obligation to keep carrying their product in the stores, right?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以他们可以施加一些影响。实际上，这让我想起一件事。我一直在想，这又来自我个人将奇怪物品带入美国的经历。我最近买了一个古董盒子，我相当确定古董应该免征关税。但我仍然被征收了关税，因为出口商，就是寄给我的人，没有把它标记为古董。他们把它标记为盒子，这非常，它是一个盒子里的盒子，非常烦人。所以它被征收了高额关税。美国进口商在实际物品的标签上有多少灵活性？这是否是你可以潜在地尝试降低关税负担的一种方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, there's some influence they could exert. Actually, this reminds me. So, one of the things I was wondering, and again, this comes from my personal capacity of bringing strange items into the US, but I bought like an antique box recently, and antiques I'm pretty sure are supposed to be exempt from the tariffs. But I still got slapped with a tariff charge because the exporter, the person sending it to me, did not label it as an antique. They labeled it as box, which was very, it was a box within a box. It was very annoying. And so, it got a big tariff. How much flexibility do importers in the US have over like the actual labeling of the items that they're bringing into the US? Is that one way that you could potentially, you know, try to lower your your tariff burden?

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Peterson**的欺诈建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Fraud advice from Peterson.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 这是非法的。所以每个产品都有一个且只有一个**协调分类**（harmonized classification）。我们称之为**协调税则号**（harmonized schedule code）。它是一个分类。话虽如此，正确的分类并不总是显而易见的，而且分类本身就是一门艺术。这非常困难，但根据税率选择分类是违法的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: It is it is uh it is illegal. So you you each product has one and only one harmonized classification. We call it harmonized schedule code. It's a classification. That said, it is not always obvious at what the right one should be and there's a whole art of classification. It's a very difficult and it but it's illegal to choose your classification based on duty rate.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你知道，你必须根据正确性来选择。现在，如果正确的税率碰巧低于不正确的税率，那么你做得很好。所以，这完全是一门艺术和科学，就是你如何证明你确实获得了正确的**HS编码**分类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: You know, you got to choose it based on what's correct. Now, if the correct duty rate should happen to be lower than the incorrect one, then you're doing a great job at life. And so, that's a whole that's a whole art and science is how do you make the case prove it that you that you did in fact get the right HS code classification.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我显然想更多地谈谈未来几周和几个月的物流情况，但就目前而言，也许不一定是欺诈本身，尽管那很有趣。自去年4月以来，你还看到了哪些公司在重新规划他们的供应链方向？主要趋势是什么？因为在我看来，部分问题在于关税未来的不确定性持续存在，而且已经有了新的关税，**特朗普**可能会试图通过其他方式重新全面恢复旧关税等等。贸易流向是否发生了变化，你认为公司会继续保持这种变化，因为现在这已成为新常态，不值得再回头了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I want to talk more obviously about the logistics of the next several weeks and months about how this is going to be, but just in terms of maybe not necessarily fraud per se, although that was very interesting. What else have you seen basically since last April in terms of companies rerouting any of their, you know, what are the big trends in terms of restructuring the direction of the supply chain? Because part of the question to my mind is going to be with ongoing uncertainty about the future of tariffs and there's already a new tariff and Trump may try to restore the old tariffs in aggregate through other means and so forth. Have there been changes in trade flows that you expect companies are just going to keep because at this point this is the new normal and it's not sort of worth going back.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 当然。许多制造业已经转向东南亚和拉丁美洲，这两个是主要的赢家。土耳其还有其他一些地方，你看到可以转移的货物正在转移。我认为最有趣但并非显而易见的趋势是，在许多情况下，实际上是中国公司在这些国家设立工厂。所以，这就像你仍然在与以前合作的同一家公司合作，他们克隆了生产线。在许多情况下，他们派中国工人管理生产线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: For sure. Lots of manufacturing has been moving towards Southeast Asia and Latin America kind of the two big winners. Turkey a few other locations where you're seeing stuff that can shift move. I I think the most interesting and not immediately obvious, the most interesting trend has been that it's actually in many cases Chinese companies setting up factories in these countries. And so it's like literally you're working with the same company you worked with before and they've cloned the line. In many case, they've sent Chinese workers to manage the line.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 所以，就资金流而言，它仍然有点直接流回中国。在很多情况下，人们感到沮丧，因为质量差了很多。仅仅搬迁商店和制造业并不容易。我的意思是，你只是在这里增加了成本层。很多正在发生的事情是为了改变原产国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: And so it's not that as far as the money flows, like it's still kind of going straight back to China. In a lot of those cases, people are frustrated because the quality is just a lot worse. It's not easy to just pick up shop and move the manufacturing. I mean, you're just adding layers of cost here. And a lot of what's happening is in order to change the the country of origin.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你不能只是把它运到那个国家，然后再运到美国。那会被称为**转运**（trans shipment）。美国最近的一项行政命令对**转运**征收了新的关税。但这只是一个荒谬的概念，表明政府不了解自己的规则，因为如果你只是把它运到越南，然后再运到美国，它仍然是中国产品。所以**转运**没有关税，只有中国商品的关税。所以那项法律是无稽之谈，那项行政命令完全是无稽之谈。你必须实际创造并证明你进行了**实质性改造**（substantial transformation）。你必须证明你在这个国家组装了产品，你增加了足够的价值，无论是通过劳动力还是其他组件，使其成为越南产品。但当然，从定义上讲，这只是增加了成本，然后还有运输时间，因为越南比中国更远。直达海运航线也更少。所以人们很难应对。我之前说过那将是我最后一次推销，但我们也有一个免费工具，网址是**atlas.flexport.com**。你可以在上面看到世界上任意两个港口之间的实际运输时间，比如它是如何移动的。所以，这对人们导航很有帮助。而且**tariffs.flexport.com**可以帮助你查看关税税率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: It's not just you can't just ship it to that country and then ship it to the US. That would be called trans shshipment. And the US, one of these recent executive orders did this like new tariffs on trans shipments. But it was just a ridiculous concept that shows that the government doesn't understand their own rules because if you just ship it to Vietnam and then ship it to the United States, it's still a product of China. So there's no tariff on trans shipments. It's just the tariff on the Chinese goods. So that that law was nonsens that executive order was totally nonsensical. You have to actually create and show that you have trans it's called substantial transformation. You have to show that like okay I've assembled products in this country. I've added enough value whether it's through labor or other components to make it a product of Vietnam. But of course by definition that's just adding costs and then transit times too because Vietnam is further away than China. There are less direct ocean sailings etc. So it's been very difficult for people to navigate. We've I said that would be my last sales pitch earlier, but we do have a free tool for this as well. It's at atlas.flexport.com. You can see the tra transit time between any two ports in the world like the actual like how it moves. So, this has been quite helpful for people to go navigate. Uh, and tariffs.flexport.com helps you see what the tariff rate is.

**Ryan Peterson**: 没关系。

### 关税的政治与经济影响

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以，这个故事之所以如此有趣，显然是因为它有物流元素、经济元素，但也有政治元素。我觉得现在所有的经济学都相当政治化。但无论如何，**特朗普**曾说过美国消费者不支付关税，然而现在我们似乎要大谈特谈美国消费者可能从关税退款中获得多少钱。你有没有觉得有些公司左右为难？比如他们可能想把一部分退款支付给客户，但同时又不想大张旗鼓地宣布退还**特朗普**声称从未征收过的钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, one of the reasons the story is so interesting is obviously there's a logistical element. There's an economics element, but there's also this political element. I feel like all of economics nowadays is pretty political. But in any case, you know, Trump has said that the American consumer doesn't pay the tariff and yet it seems we are very much about to talk a whole lot about how much money American consumers might be owed from tariff refunds. Do you get the sense that any companies are sort of caught between a rock and a hard place where you know like maybe they would like to pay out some of their refund to their customers, but at the same time they also don't want to make huge announcements about returning money that Trump says was never taken away in the first place.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，我的意思是，**FedEx**、**UPS**、**DHL**这类公司肯定处于这种状况。**USPS**会是一个有趣的例子。我不确定，你知道，看看他没看到的那些包裹会很有趣。那到底是**USPS**还是**FedEx**？因为如果是**USPS**，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah, I mean it's definitely those the FedEx, UPS, DHLs of the world that are in that condition. I USPS will be an interesting one. I'm not sure if, you know, it'd be interesting to go look at those parcels he didn't see. Was it actually USPS or was it FedEx? Because if it was USPS,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 估计你就是**记录进口商**，但也许是**USPS**。如果**USPS**不退还他们向你收取的钱，那实际上会是一个很疯狂的案例。那会是一场很棒的集体诉讼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: presumably you are the import of record, but maybe it's USPS. That would be a kind of a crazy case actually if USPS doesn't give back the money that they charged you. That would be a great class action.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，那些可能就是。但这真的更像是一个品牌和商业问题，而不是法律问题。我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah, those are probably the one. But it's really just like a brand and business question more so than a legal one. I think

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 也许他们想惹恼**特朗普政府**。顺便说一句，我可能会在接下来的谈话中只听一半，因为我现在正在玩**atlas.flexport.com**。它真的很酷，可以点击所有这些港口，查看所有航线，并查看从一条航线到另一条航线通常需要多长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: maybe they want to piss off the Trump administration. By the way, I might just spend the rest of this conversation only half paying attention because I'm now playing a playing at atlas.flexport.com. It's really cool like clicking all these ports and seeing all the routes and seeing how long it typically takes from one route to another.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 就像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Like

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 我知道，这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: I know it's amazing.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我觉得你做得很好，这很有帮助。你建立的这个网站真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I think you've done a is very helpful. This is really fun website you you built.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 几个世纪以来，全球贸易一直是一个神秘的黑箱，现在你可以看到它是如何运作的。船只去哪里？就像公交路线一样，你知道，它们停靠哪些港口？需要多长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Global trade has been this mysterious black box for centuries and now you can just see how it actually works. Where do the ships go? It's like the bus routes, you know, what's what ports do they stop at? How long do they take?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 不，这是一个非常有趣的网站。所以，谢谢你推广它。那么，好的，实际上告诉我们，我想是因为你高度自动化和数字化等等，所有公司都有很好的记录吗？从过去一年来看，你认为绝大多数公司都明确知道他们支付了多少钱吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: No, this is a really fun uh website. So, thank you for plugging it. So, okay, tell us actually about I guess because you're you're highly automated and digital, etc., do all companies have really good records on this stuff? Is it very clear just from a sort of over the last year? Would you say the vast majority of companies know exactly how much they've paid unambiguously?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 我会说他们没有，但他们可以很容易地做到。所以美国海关的技术系统叫做**ACE**（自动化商业环境）。报关行喜欢抱怨这个。它就像**healthcare.gov**的百万倍，就工程灾难而言，但它确实有效。他们花了比预期多十年才推出这个系统。每个进行商业报关的进口商，而不是像**Tracy**那样给自己寄包裹的个人，而是真正的正式报关。所有这些报关记录都对你开放。所以你可以查看你的历史记录。你只需要去，并且你必须有一个**ACE账户**。如果你没有，你必须去创建一个。如果你想要退款，你必须有一个**ACE账户**。直到大约两个月前，不，直到2月6日，所有退款都是通过财政部从海关发出的纸质支票。在过去的5年里，**Flexport**已经为我们的客户从海关获得了超过9亿美元的退款。这是我人生中最引以为傲的成就之一。所有这些都是通过纸质支票完成的。其中许多在邮件中丢失了。有些被骗子兑现了等等。所以，在2月6日，他们更新了系统，现在退款将是电子化的，这实际上可能是一个迹象，表明他们对即将发生的事情有所预感。但是的，你的**ACE账户**确实会显示你所有的进口历史记录。如果你去**tariffs.flexport.com**，在顶部，你可以上传这些信息，我们就会准确地告诉你你应得多少钱。我们上周有大约70家财富500强公司注册了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: I would say they do not, but they can very easily. So the US customs technology system is called ACE automated commercial environment and customs brokers love to complain about this. It's like healthcare.gov like times a million in terms of debacle of engineering problem but it works. It took them like a decade longer than it should have to launch the thing. And you can every importer that does entries like commercial customs entries not the Tracies of the world shipping a package to themselves but like real customs entries of of formal entry. All those entries are available to you. So you can see your past history. You have to just go to and you have to have an ACE account. If you don't, you got to go create one. And if you want a refund, you must have an ACE account. They've until about two months ago, no, until February 6th, all refunds were done via paper checks from the Treasury Department from customs. And we Plexport has gotten over $900 million worth of refunds for our customers in the last 5 years from customs. One of my most proud life achievements. And all of those came via paper checks. Many of them got lost in the mail. Some of them got cashed by scammers, etc. So, this was on February 6. They updated so that now refunds will be electronic, which was actually maybe a sign that they kind of had a sense of what was here to come. But yes, your ACE account does show you your entire past history of all your imports. And if you go to tariffs.flexboard.com at the top, you can upload that and we will just show you exactly how much money you're owed. And we got about 70 Fortune 500 companies signed up in the last week.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你从客户那里有没有感觉到，他们对潜在的退款感到兴奋，但你有没有感觉到他们打算如何处理这些钱？是仅仅填补最初支付关税留下的空缺，还是这算是一笔意外之财，他们可以保留并用于投资或其他用途？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Do you get any sense from your clients of you know I I'm pretty sure they're excited about potential refunds but do you get any sense of what they're going to do with them? Is it just you know fill the hole that was left from paying the tariffs in the first place or does this count as like a windfall payment that they could potentially hold on to and use to invest or whatever?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，这些人是沉迷于购买库存的病态之人，他们只会购买更多的东西，并试图发展他们的业务。不，我开玩笑的。但我认为会发生的是，每个人都是乐观主义者。你得到了很多钱。大多数彩票中奖者都会破产。尽管那可能不是，那可能是一个都市传说，但我认为他们会以可能没有意义的方式再投资于他们的业务。我一直在建议人们，你知道，把钱存到你的银行账户里，买点东西，你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah, these are uh sick and demented people who have an addiction to just buying inventory and they're going to just buy a lot more stuff and try to grow their business. No, I'm joking. But I assume that that's what'll happen is you everyone's an optimist. You get a lot of money. Most lottery winners go broke. Although that might not be it might be an urban legend, but I think they will go reinvest in their business in ways that may not make sense. And I've been advising people, you know, keep put it in your bank account, buy something, you know,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 估计是留到下一轮关税。所以，这就是我本来要问的问题，就是已经有了这个新的10%关税。我好像看到他最新的**Truth Social**帖子说15%。但实际上，正式的是10%。你认为目前的关税状况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: save it for the next round of tariffs presumably. So this is a So this is actually what I was going to ask which is so already there's this new 10% tariff. One of the things I think I saw was that in his latest truth social post he said 15%. But that actually it's 10 like the actual formal thing is 10%. What is the current state of tariffs as you see them?

</details>

### 新关税与贸易政策展望

**Ryan Peterson**: 目前是10%，**第122条**（section 122）是10%。他们有一个15%的法律上限，那是他第二天做的事情。首先，他在最高法院裁决后的一两个小时，周五宣布了10%，然后第二天，周六，涨到了15%。我以为他至少会等到冰球金牌赛，如果加拿大赢了，再征收15%，但他在这方面抢先了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: It's currently 10% that section 122 is 10%. They was a legal limit of 15 and that's what he did the next day. First, he announced 10 on Friday after the Supreme Court, like an hour or two after, then the next day on Saturday went to 15. I thought he was going to wait at least until the hockey gold medal match and just like if Canada won then put the 15% in, but like he jumped the gun on that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但他真的征收了15%吗？因为关税是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But did he put the 15% on cuz what is the ter?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 他确实这样做了，但他是通过**Truth Social**或其他帖子发布的。法律不是这样运作的。所以，你必须通过《联邦法规汇编》（Code of Federal Regulations）正式发布，他们还没有这样做。所以，我们正在等待官方消息，你知道，通常他说了什么之后会有几天的延迟。所以，截至今天，仍然是10%，但我预计，你知道，也许到这期节目播出的时候，它会变成15%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: He did, but he did it via I think Truth Social or some other post. That's not how the laws work. So, you have to actually publish it through the Code of Federal Regulations and they haven't done that yet. So, we're waiting for like official word, which you know, usually it's a couple of days lag from when he says something. So, it's still 10% as of today, but I would expect, you know, maybe by the time this episode airs it goes to 15.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，你知道吗，说到公告和正式文件之间的差距，**Kevin Worsh** technically还没有被提名？因为他还没有提交，他的**Poly Market**赔率在公告后的第二天是99%，现在是96%。所以人们都在想怎么回事。总之，我只是提一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Tracy, did you know, speaking of the gap between announcement and formal thing that technically Kevin Worsh hasn't been nominated yet? Because there's a part he has like send it to it hasn't been sent and his odds on Poly Market were at 99% the day after the announcement and they're now like 96%. So people are wondering what's up with Anyway, just throwing that out there.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我应该说，我们是在2月26日录制这期节目的，因为所有这些事情似乎每天都在变化，甚至每小时都在变化。所以这是讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I should just say we're recording this on February 26 because again all of this stuff seems to change day by day if not hour by hour. So that's the discuss

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 变化非常快。**第122条**是1974年《贸易法》的**第122条**。这就是赋予总统关税权力的几种工具之一。我会说**特朗普**可能在最高法院输掉了**AIPA**。他至少还有其他四项国会法案，在某些条件下将贸易关税权力下放给了总统。我指的是那些以前从未用于关税，而总是用于制裁和彻底禁止贸易的法案。他们喜欢它的原因是，根据他们的解释，它赋予了他们全面的权力，可以随时随地做他们想做的事情。比如他早上醒来，如果他觉得你看着他的方式不对，你就会被征收关税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: it's very fluid and the the section 122. It's the section 122 of the trade act of 1974. And that's what gives the that's one of the several tools. I I would say that Trump probably he lost AIPA in the Supreme Court. He has at least four other acts of Congress that have delegated trade a tariff authority to the president under certain conditions. I was the one that they never been used before for tariffs always for sanctions and b outright bans and on trade that the reason they liked it it was under their interpretation. It gave them blanket authority just to do what they wanted whenever they wanted on demand. like he could just wake up in the morning and just like you get a terror if you know you look at him the wrong way and you get a terror.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这似乎是专门针对瑞士的，对吧？他不是专门说他只是恼火吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: That seems like it was in Switzerland specifically, right? Didn't he say specifically he was just annoyed but or

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 我忘了。是的，我不会感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: I forgot. Yeah, I wouldn't surprise

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你描述的并不是一个假设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: what you're describing was not actually a hypothetical.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 不，我的意思是，他基本上就是那样做的，对加拿大好几次等等。所以其他的需要更正式的机制，需要商务部或**USR**做一些，你知道，做一些事情，去运行一份报告，去证明这个国家和这个行业确实存在反竞争行为，他们正在做一些事情，然后惩罚他们。现在**第122条**是他提出的。它具有相对全面的权力，但它有两个限制。一个是最高15%，我们刚刚谈过，另一个是最高150天，这将持续到今年7月20日。所以你接下来应该预期的是，从现在到7月20日之间，他会使用其他机制，其中有**第301条**（section 301），这是他第一任期内著名的中国关税，就是**第301条**关税。这些没有受到挑战。他能够维持这些关税，然后是**第232条**（section 232），**第232条**是基于国家安全理由。钢铁和铝关税就是根据这个条款征收的。这些没有受到挑战，或者如果受到挑战，他们赢了官司或将赢得官司。可以说钢铁和铝从国家安全角度来看是重要的。然而，他还使用**第232条**以国家安全理由对家具征收关税。我个人认为这有点牵强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: No, I mean that was basically what he was doing Canada a couple of times etc. So the other ones require they have much more formal mechanisms that will require like the commerce department or USR to do some re you know do something and go run a report go demonstrate that in fact this country and this sector are being anti-competitive and they're doing something and then punish them. Now 122 is the one that he put in. It has relatively blanket authority but it has a it has two limits on it. One is that it's a maximum of 15% which we just talked about and the other is that it's a maximum of 150 days and that'll go until July 20th of this year. And so then what you should expect is like between now and July 20th that he was he'll be using these other mechanisms of which there's section 301 that's the famous China tariffs from his first term were section 301 tariffs. Those have not been challenged. He's been able to maintain those and then section 232 and 232 is on national security grounds. That's what the steel and aluminum tariffs have come in on. They that's not getting challenged or if it has they won the case or will win the case. It's reasonable to say that steel and aluminum are na important national from a national security perspective. However, he also used section 232 to impose furniture tariffs on national security grounds. And I think that's a little bit of a stretch. Personally,

**Jill Weisenthal**: 沙发，舒适的沙发是一个安全问题。我会争辩。我想象在7月20日会发生什么，我们会有一个一天的关税大赦，或者15分钟的关税大赦，然后它们又会延长120天。对吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: couches, comfy couches are a security issue. I would argue. I imagine on July 20th what's going to happen is we'll have like a one day tariff jubilee or a 15minute tariff jubilee and then they just get re-extended for another 120 days. Right.

**Ryan Peterson**: 那是我的预测。我想我跟几个贸易律师谈过那个预测，他们告诉我，是的，他可能会那样做，但那在法庭上是站不住脚的。

**Ryan Peterson**: That was my prediction. I think I talked to a couple trade lawyers about that prediction and they told me that yes he might do that but there's no way that that would hold up in a court. So

**Ryan Peterson**: **特朗普**所做的事情与法院认定合法的事情是两码事。我们会发现它们。

**Ryan Peterson**: It's one thing what Trump does versus what a court finds to be legal. We we'll find them

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 回到这些关税最初由政府描述的方式。整个想法是把就业和工业带回美国。而且一些理由似乎从那时起就发生了变化。在国情咨文演讲中，**特朗普**当时在谈论他如何利用关税作为一种政治权力工具来影响其他国家，让它们做他想做的事情。但再次，当你审视你的客户时，你有没有觉得这些关税在实现其最初目标——将经济活动转移回美国方面——是成功的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: going back to the way these tariffs were originally described by the administration. The whole idea was bringing jobs and industry back to America. And like some of the justification seems to have morphed since then. At the State of the Union address, Trump was talking, I think, about how he used tariffs as like a tool of political power to influence countries and get them to do other stuff that he wanted. But again, when you look at your customers, do you get the sense that these tariffs have been successful in their original goal in shifting economic activity back to America?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 有点难以分辨。我的意思是，我们很多客户都在进口商品，所以他们不是那些。出口商，你知道，我遇到过很多出口公司说这些关税实际上伤害了他们，因为他们进口零部件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: It's a little hard to parse out. I mean, like a lot of our customers are importing goods, so they're not the ones. The exporters, you know, I've met as many companies that export that said that these tariffs actually hurt them because they import components,

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: right?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 这使得它缺乏竞争力。你进口一个零部件，你必须支付关税。如果他们把工厂设在墨西哥，他们就不必支付同样的关税。他们可以进口商品。然后，如果他们在美国销售，那很好。这就像殊途同归。但如果你把它卖到欧洲，或者你把它运到国外，那么它真的会使制造业竞争力下降。不过，这可能有点难以分辨，因为我们正在经历这场令人难以置信的**AI资本支出**（AI capex）建设，你知道，有很多工业化正在发生。很多事情，比如在理论上，关税对制造业是有益的，在纯粹的经济理论世界中，但这些事情，我认为，太复杂了，无法由国家集中管理，这是上个世纪的伟大教训。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: And it makes it uncompetitive. You import a component, you got to pay a duty on it. And if they were to put that factory in Mexico, they wouldn't pay the same duty. They could import the goods. And then if they're if they're selling in the US, fine. It's like one way or the other, it's the same. But if you're selling it into Europe or you're shipping it abroad, then it really makes that manufacturing less competitive. It's probably a little hard to parse out though because we we're going through this incredible AI capex buildout that you know there's a lot of industrialization happening. A lot of a lot of stuff like in general in theoretical grounds like tariffs are good for manufacturing in purely economic theoretical world but these things are like I think much too complex to be centrally managed by the state is like the great lesson of the last century.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我确实认为，对进口零部件征收关税这一点，你知道，因为理论上我们不想只在这里建造东西。我们想建造复杂的、高附加值的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I do think the point about tariffing imported components for you know because we don't in theory we don't want to just build stuff here. We want to build complex highv value ads

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 然后卖给其他人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and then sell it to other people

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 并且据说要卖掉。但是，是的，如果你的投入成本上升，因为这里有一块金属或其他什么东西，那么这确实会使在美国做生意的成本更高。但是关于**AI**，我很好奇，撇开所有关税不谈，既然你提到了**AI**热潮正在创造新的贸易流，从韩国进口大量的存储芯片。所以这些价格正在飙升。我想我看到一个统计数据，我们从台湾进口的纯粹水平令人震惊，都是因为芯片等等。但是，你还看到了哪些有趣的贸易流，因为所有这些**AI**活动正在进行，或者你看到了任何迹象吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: and sell it supposedly. But yeah, if your input costs go up because here's this one piece of metal or whatever it is, then that does uh make the cost of doing business higher in the United States. But on the AI, I'm curious just setting aside all the tariffs since you brought up the AI boom that's creating its new different trade flows, incredible imports from Korea, right, for memory chips. So those prices are going insane. And I think I saw a stat just uh the pure level of importing that we're doing from Taiwan uh is just staggering all because of chips etc. But what else are you seeing interesting in terms of trade flows because of all this AI activity that's going on or do you see any fingerprints of that?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，你在空运市场看到了很多，特别是由于**特朗普政府**的打击之一是结束了**微量运输**（diminimous shipping），即如果你运输的货物价值低于800美元，你就不必支付关税。这曾是一个巨大的繁荣，占世界空运的50%。所以当它在去年5月（我想是中国）结束时，所有专家，包括我，都公开表示空运价格将暴跌，因为世界空运的50%是来自亚洲，主要是中国的**微量运输**，而这些都将消失，所以价格会暴跌。然而，事实证明，空运价格保持稳定，甚至居高不下，因为有如此多的数据中心建设组件在全球范围内运输。这完全弥补了**微量运输**下降带来的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah, you see a lot in the air freight market especially because the one of the Trump administration crackdowns was the end of dimminimous shipping which was if you ship something less than $800 you didn't have to pay customs duties on it and that was just this huge boom it had been 50% of the world's air freight and so when that ended back in I think it was in May for China they stopped they ended that program all the experts including me went on the record and said hey the price of air freight is going to collapse because it's 50% of the world's air freight is dimmin ous shipments from Asia, from China mostly and that's all going away and so the price going to collapse. Well, it turns out price of air freight has stayed sta stable stayed high because there's so much so many components for data center buildouts getting flown around the world. It's more than made up for the drop from the dimminimous shipping.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 那个**微量例外**（diminimous exception），800美元的例外，总是让我想起你看到的男性自报身高的图表，没有人是5英尺8英寸或5英尺9英寸。每个人要么更矮，要么5英尺10英寸及以上。就像所有货物要么低于800美元，要么远高于800美元，中间什么都没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: that dimminimous exception, the 800 exception, that always reminds me of, you know, the charts that you see of men's like self-reported heights where like no one is 5'8 or 5'9. Everyone is either like shorter or 510 and above. Like all the shipments were either, you know, like less than 800 or a lot more than 800 and like nothing just around there.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但后来发生了什么？因为我以为他们会用**微量运输**来扼杀像**Shein**和**Temu**这样的公司。那些公司发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What happened though? Cuz I thought they were going to kill like Shien and Timu and some of these things with the dimminimous stuff. Did any what happened with those businesses?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 那些家伙实际上做得很好。事实证明，这不仅仅是关税套利。所以这也是我们在空运市场搞错的一部分，就是他们做得还不错。他们在美国建立了履约中心。他们建立了一些相当大的自动化网络，现在可能相当于**亚马逊**网络规模的20%，这些履约中心由中国电商公司运营，这真的是一个巨大的、被低估的事情。而且他们仍然从中国空运货物，他们支付关税。我今年学到的最有趣的事实之一是，**Shein**去年销售额达到400亿美元，而**Shein**向其工厂发出的采购订单中，没有一份超过200件商品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Those guys are actually do they're doing pretty well. It turns out it wasn't just tariff arbitrage. So that's also part of the story on the air freight market that we got wrong is like they're doing okay. And that one thing they've set up fulfillment centers in the US. They've set up some pretty big automated networks that probably like 20% of the size of Amazon's network now is these fulfillment centers for Chinese ecom run by Chinese e-commerce companies. is really a massive kind of an under reportported thing there. And they're also they're still flying it from China. They're paying the duties. One of the most interesting facts I learned this year actually is that Sheen does they 40 billion of sales 40 billion of revenue last year and no purchase order that was made from Sheen to its factories was more than 200 items.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 所以你谈论的是数千万笔微小、细碎的采购。这意味着他们永远不必打折，因为他们不保留太多库存。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: So you're talking like tens of millions of little tiny granular purchases. And that means they never have to discount because they don't keep much stock.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 你知道，他们每样东西只有200件。而如果你去很多网站，或者零售店，他们总是打折，因为他们买了太多东西，正在倾销。所以这种商业模式实际上有一些吸引人的特点。我们当时已经开始建立这项服务。我们为很多客户提供类似的服务，我们可以从海外发货，然后直接注入邮政服务或其他最后一英里承运商。我们停止了在那里的投资，因为我觉得这会随着**微量运输**的结束而消亡，但事后看来，这可能是一个错误。我们看到实际上这种模式仍然有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: You know, they only have 200 of each thing. Whereas if you go to like a lot of websites are like retail stores are always running a sale because they got too they bought too much stuff and they're dumping it. So the business model actually has some attractive features for it. And um I had we had started to build that service. We were offering it for a lot of we do still offer a similar service where we can ship from overseas and then we'll just inject it directly to the postal service or other last mile carriers. We stopped investing there because I was like this is going to die with the end of dimminimus but probably a mistake in hindsight. we're seeing like actually that model is still working. So

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 实际上，这让我想起，回过头看，天哪，我简直不敢相信才过了一年。但当你回顾过去一年和你的客户时，那些处理关税得当的公司和处理不当的公司之间最大的区别因素是什么？仅仅是规模和他们从供应商那里争取让步的能力吗？还是数据记录和非常好的律师？你看到了什么让一家公司比其他公司更好地处理了这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: actually that reminds me when you look back at gosh I can't believe it's only been like a year basically. But when you look back at the past year and your customers what was the biggest differentiating factor between those who handled the tariffs well and those who didn't? Was it just like size and their ability to squeeze out concessions from suppliers or was it I don't know data records and really good lawyers I guess. What did you see that made a particular company handle this better than others?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的，我的意思是，你可能需要在一个行业内进行观察，因为某些行业天生就具有行业优势或劣势，比如电子产品很难从中国搬走。然后其中一些行业被豁免了关税。实际上，你知道谁做得最好吗？是那些设法在**白宫**开会，握手并说服他们的人，你知道，比如**苹果公司**，不要对**iPhone**征税。但那是非常少数享有特权的人才能获得的访问权限。但就较小的公司而言，在所有其他条件相同的情况下，我认为那些更具创业精神的公司能够迅速行动并做出良好决策，比如“好吧，我们要在墨西哥或拉丁美洲或其他地方建立制造业”，并相对迅速地行动。但这不仅仅是速度，你必须做出好的决策。你知道，比如那些匆忙搬到印度，然后发现印度被征收了50%关税的人，他们做得并不好。所以也许其中一些只是运气。我的意思是，很难预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah, I mean you have to look probably within an industry because they're certain industries are just have sectoral advantages or disadvantages like it's hard to move electronics out of China. Um and then some of those industries were exempted from the tariffs. Actually, you know who did the best was the guys who went to uh managed to get a meeting at the White House and shake hands and convince them, you know, like Apple don't tax don't tariff the iPhone. Um, but that was a very privileged small number of people that had that kind of access. But smaller, all other things being equal, I think that like more entrepreneurial companies that could just move quickly and make good decisions and just like, all right, cool. We're going to set up manufacturing in Mexico or Latin America or some of these places and actually move relatively quickly. But it's not just speed. You got to make good decisions. You know, like people who moved to India in a hurry and then found out India got hit with a 50% tariff like not doing that great. So maybe some of it's just luck too. I mean, it's very hard to forecast how the

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这件事会如何发展，接下来会发生什么，谁也说不准。所以有时最好的办法是什么也不做，让事情保持稳定。我遇到过几家公司说这就是他们的计划，我当时觉得这有点大胆，在某种程度上我喜欢它。所以，好的，你相当乐观地认为这不会像有些人想象的那样耗时，但公司现在正在做什么？请我们了解一下获得退款的实际细节，现在正在发生什么，时间线如何运作，以及他们必须做什么才能实际获得退款等等。请我们了解一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: how this thing would did play out and what's going to happen next is kind of anybody's guess. So sometimes the best thing to do is nothing and just let things go stable. I met a couple of companies that said that was their plan and I was like that's kind of bold and I like it on some level. So okay, you're fairly optimistic that this is not going to take as long as perhaps some people think, but what is what are companies doing right now? walk us through the actual nuts and bolts of getting the refunds and what's happening right now and how the timeline works and what they have to do to actually get them and so forth. Walk us through that.

### 退款的实际操作与二级市场

**Ryan Peterson**: 这有点技术性，但你们的听众很专业。所以，我认为它会这样运作，首先，退款的时间安排存在一些不确定性。如果真的有退款，它仍然没有得到保证，尽管我感觉确定性很高。它很可能这样运作：你需要拉取我之前提到的**ACE报告**。从海关拉取它，计算你欠了多少钱。然后你需要提交，目前还不清楚你是否需要提交抗议。通常，获得退款的方式是，你提交一份抗议。你向政府陈述你的案子，说：“嘿，我们这个分类错误了。我们正在抗议，你会得到退款。”这通常就是它的运作方式。我们就是这样设置的，代表你提交这些抗议，挑战**AIPA**抗议，并说：“嘿，你从来就不应该向我收取这笔钱。”然后我就会得到退款。所以，我们现在正在为公司实施这个计划，让它变得简单，省去文书工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: It it's a bit of a technical thing, but you guys have a nerdy audience. So, I think the way that it'll work, it's there's first of all, there's some uncertainty of how the timing is going to work. If there are refunds at all, it's still not guaranteed, although I feel pretty high certainty. The way that it's likely to work is you're going to need to pull that ACE report that was I was talking about earlier. pull it from customs, calculate how much you're owed. You then are going to need to file, it's unclear if you'll need to file protest. Typically, the way that it works to get a refund is you go, you file a protest. You make your case to the government that, hey, we've got this mclassified. We are protesting and we and you'll get a refund. That's typically how it works. And that's how we're set up to go do that is go file these protests on your behalf to go challenge the AIPA protest and say, "Hey, you never should have paid me this." and I'll get a refund. So, we're putting that program in place right now for companies to go just make that easy, take away the paperwork.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 稍微复杂一点的部分是人们在二级市场出售这些东西，我之前提到过。所以，至少有三家大银行在那里。我不知道它们是否真的很大，但至少有三个团体在那里。可能还有更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: The piece that's a little bit more sophisticated is where people are selling these things in the secondary market that I mentioned earlier. So, there's at least three big banks that are out there. I don't know if they're big, but there are three groups that are out there, at least three. There's probably more

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 正在购买这些东西。就像我说的，市场价格涨到了52%。所以现在有很多谈判，关于“好了，这个钱的时间价值是多少？你对何时以及如何实现这个目标有多大的相对确定性？”这是一个我正在密切关注的市场。到目前为止，那些家伙只在公司退款至少1000万美元的情况下进行交易。我想做的事情之一是说：“嘿，我们可以把这些家伙召集起来。”有没有银行来找你，说：“与其试图召集所有这些成千上万的公司，不如直接来找货运代理，说‘把你们的人召集起来，我们来做批量销售’？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: that are buying these things. And like I said, the market price went to 52%. So, there's a lot of negotiating right now of going, "All right, what's this time value of money? what's the what's your relative certainty of when and how this is going to play out. That's a market that I'm tracking very closely. Thus far, those guys have only transacted where company's refund is at least $10 million. One of the things I would like to be able to do is say, "Hey, we can pull a bunch of these guys together." Do any of the bank have any of the banks come to you and said like rather than trying to ga gather all of these you know tens of thousand however hundreds of thousands of companies did they just come to any of the freight brokers and say like assemble your crew and we like do a batch a batch sale.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 是的。直到上周五，我们和他们所有人都谈过。直到上周五，不确定性太大了，我们无法投入精力去构建这个东西。我们构建了一个计算器。这就是为什么我们能够在退款生效的同一天推出计算器，因为我们一直在构建它。但是就处理而言，我们直到周五才真正投资于构建这种能力。我们认真地启动了这些。所以，这就是我希望能够尽快构建的。我真的很想能够把这些东西整合起来，我与很多公司谈过，他们说：“嘿，如果你能给我70%，甚至60%，我明天就做。”所以，我认为我们可以，我认为我们可以在那里为每个人创造很多价值。我的意思是，我认为我的估计远高于60%。所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Yeah. Until last Friday we have we've talked to all of them. Until last Friday there was just a little too much uncertainty for us to put in the effort and like to build the thing. We built a calculator. that's why we were able to go live with the calculator, you know, the same day as the refunds went live because we'd been building that. Um, but as far as the processing, we didn't really invest in building that capability until Friday. We kicked off those, you know, like in earnest. So, that's what I'm hoping to be able to build in a hurry. Uh, I really like to be able to pull these things and I've talked to so many companies that said, "Hey, if you could get me 70%, I would 60% even, I would do it tomorrow." So that would be I think we could I think that we could create a lot of value there for everybody. I mean I think my estimate is much higher than 60%. So there's

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 如果我对事物的估值与你不同，那应该是一个双赢的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: if I value the thing differently than you are, there should be a win-win.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，这就是我本来要问的。所以，只是为了澄清，目前这些关税退款的索赔以50%或60%的价格交易，但我们预期会全额退款，对吧？没有加上律师费，我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, this is what I was going to ask. So just to be clear, like those claims on tariff refunds are trading at 50 or 60% at the moment, but we are expecting the full refund amount to actually come back, right? There's not plus legal fees, I think.

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 嗯，我不知道律师费，但加上利息，你应该能拿到6%，我想目前的利率是6%年化。所以，是的，当我们说我们预期时，那是指我和我的团队以及我谈过的一些律师，但品牌方可能没有预期那么高，否则他们就不会以60%的价格出售，或者他们现在就需要钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Uh well I don't know about legal fees but plus interest you're supposed to get six I think 6% is the current rate on that 6% annualized. So yeah that when now we say we are expecting that's me and my team and some lawyers I've talked to but the brands probably aren't expecting it that high or else they wouldn't sell it for 60% or they need the money right now.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 如果它们是非法的，比如整体都是非法的，那么不获得全额退款的理由是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: The justification for not getting the full refund if they're illegal like the totality is illegal right?

</details>

**Ryan Peterson**: 嗯，全额退款会到账，但在那种情况下，钱会给从你那里购买索赔的人，而不是你。所以，这只是一个金钱的时间价值和不确定性问题，有人愿意接受较低的利率。但是的，我个人认为，如果你以60%的价格出售，你可能就亏了。再等一年吧。我的意思是，一年40%的回报率相当不错。应该建立一个小的对冲基金，一个小小的侧袋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryan Peterson**: Well this the full refund would come but in that case they would go to the person who bought it from you not you. So, it's just a time value of money and a uncertainty question that someone's willing to take a lower rate. But yeah, I think I personally I think if you sell it for 60%, you're probably leaving money on the table. Just wait a year. I mean, 40% for a year is a pretty good return. Should set up a little uh side hedge fund, a little side pocket.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Joe**，我把我的关税索赔卖给你。

And it's fascinating to look at some of those solutions.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: It's also illegal. It's business. But the fact that you see it's like that it shows up in the data, right? That there's like all that a foreign company can theoretically apply for the refund and etc. or could establish what was the importer of

**Tracy Alloway**: record that it can a foreign company can establish itself as the importer of record and that it shows up in the data like that shows how much uh creativity was underway since liberation day.

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我的意思是，从更广阔的宏观角度来看，我知道这不是本期节目的重点，但也许我们会在某个时候做一期。看看退款接收者到底会如何处理这笔钱，这真的会很有趣，对吧？我觉得如果你现在是一名企业分析师，或者如果你是一名投资者，这会告诉你很多关于那家特定公司的方向，他们会如何处理这笔钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I mean just from a broader macro perspective and I know that wasn't the focus of this episode but maybe we'll do one at some point. It is going to be really fascinating to see what refund recipients actually do with that money, right? I feel like if you're a corporate analyst at the moment or if you're an investor, like it's going to tell you a lot about the direction of that particular company, what they do with that money.

**Tracy Alloway**: 我认为一个大问题将是会有多少公司宣布降价或类似的事情，因为会有一些压力要求向消费者退款，对吧？看看是否有公司会做某种名义上的回扣会很有趣。我的意思是，显然他们没有法律义务这样做，但你知道，我认为很多人会感到非常恼火，特别是如果有些类别明显是因为关税导致消费者价格上涨，或者如果公司在某些情况下可能已经说：“哦，我们正在向你收取关税附加费”，对吧？他们可能已经在某种账单上明确列出了。

<details>

**Tracy Alloway**: I think a big question is just going to be how many announced sales or something cuz like there's going to be some pressure to refund money to consumers, right? And it'll be interesting to see if any do some sort of nominal rebate of some sort. I mean, obviously they're not legally obliged to, but you know, I think a lot of people it's going to really annoy people if especially if there are categories where it's obvious that consumer prices went up because of the tariffs or if companies in some cases may have, oh, we're putting a tariff sir charge on you, right? And they might have spelled it out on some sort of bill.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 嗯，他们可能确实这样做了，因为他们不想被视为在涨价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Well, they probably did because they don't want to be seen to be raising prices.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以，如果你是那种公司，说：“看，我们不想涨价。我们只是不得不这样做，所以我们告诉你，你支付的50美元中，X金额是我们要收取的关税附加费。”他们最好给你退款，否则那会非常烦人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, if you were the type of company that's like, look, we weren't raising we didn't want to raise prices. We just have to we so we're telling you that part of this $50 that you paid x amount is a tariff sir charge that we're applying. They better give you a refund otherwise that's going to be really annoying.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我猜那对他们来说就像是一种事实上的意外之财。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I guess that other it's like a de facto windfall for them.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，你知道谁处理得很好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, you know who handled it pretty well?

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 说吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Go on.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 综合考虑目前的情况，**Costco**似乎处理得相当好，因为我想他们明确表示不会将关税费用转嫁给客户。他们只是承担损失，但也对**特朗普政府**提起了诉讼。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: All things considered at this moment in time. It seems like they handled it pretty well at Costco cuz I think they didn't they explicitly said they weren't going to pass on the tariff charges to customers. They were just going to like eat the loss. but also file suit against the Trump administration. Yeah.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 说关税是非法的。所以现在，你知道，他们得到了退款。他们不必实际把钱还给客户，但他们也不会因为不这样做而损害品牌形象，因为他们反正从未向客户收取过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Saying the tariffs are illegal. And so now, you know, they get the refunds. They don't have to like actually pay them back to customers, but they don't take the brand hit from not doing that because they never charge them anyway.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 他们说他们从未收取过，但你知道，理论上，他们可能保持了价格稳定，也许在另一个平行宇宙中，价格会下降，对吧？所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: They say they never charge them, but you know, in theory, they could have held a price steady and maybe in a in the alternate universe, the prices would have come down, right? So,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 当然。我们会看到。至少从公关角度来看，这是一个很好的策略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: sure. We'll see. At least from I'm saying from a PR perspective, it was a good play.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。是的，完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Yeah, totally.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我这么说只是因为我是**Costco**里那种巨大的西班牙火腿的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I'm only saying that because I'm a big fan of the um giant Spanish hams that you can get at at Costco,

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那大概是被征收关税的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: which were presumably tiff.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我猜是吧，但这是我第一次买**Costco**火腿，所以我不能告诉你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I I guess, but I This is the first year I ever bought a Costco ham, so I can't tell you.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 它太好吃了。我不能告诉你前一年是什么情况，它是否真的涨价了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It was so good. I can't tell you what it was the year before if it actually went up. But

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我能给那些坚持听到对话最后的人一个小窍门吗？如果你参加派对时带上一块西班牙火腿，人们会非常喜欢你。你知道，它们可能要几百美元，但西班牙火腿里有很多食物。如果你是那个带着一大块西班牙火腿去派对的人，你就会成为派对的焦点。这是一个非常强劲的举动。我的一个朋友这样做过，所有人都喜欢他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: can I tell if a little life hack for the people that are still listening to the very end of the conversation? If you ever like show up at a party and you bring a Spanish ham, you people will just love you. And like, you know, they're a couple hundred dollars or whatever, but there's a lot of food in the Spanish ham. And if you're the guy who shows up at a party with a big Spanish ham on the whole on the spit or whatever it is, like that, you're be the life of the party. It is a very strong move. A friend of mine did that and everyone loved him.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我觉得这是个绝妙的主意。我圣诞节给我丈夫买了一个，我要说，我觉得它持续了我们大约三周，我们吃了很多火腿。你就把它放在那里，对吧？你就，是的，它们保存得很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I think that's an excellent idea. I bought my husband one for Christmas and I will say I think it lasted us like a good three and we ate a lot of hats. You just leave it out there, right? Like you just Yeah, there's They preserve very well.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 晚餐吃点奶酪和火腿，持续了大约3周。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Some cheese and ham for dinner for like 3 weeks.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你就一直切。是的，它确实是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You just keep carving at it. Yeah, it's Yeah, it actually is.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的，我们就在这里结束吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: All right, shall we leave it there?

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们就在这里结束吧。
