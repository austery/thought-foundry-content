title: 特朗普推出Trump RX网站：药价改革的希望与现实
summary: 本文分析了美国总统特朗普推出的Trump RX网站，该网站旨在降低处方药价格。文章探讨了美国高昂药价的成因，特朗普政府为解决此问题所采取的策略，以及Trump RX网站的实际效果。分析指出，该网站在减肥药和生育药物方面为无保险人群提供了显著折扣，但对大多数有保险的美国人帮助有限，且未涵盖癌症等关键药物。专家认为，该计划并非解决医疗费用负担的全面方案，更多是特朗普式销售策略的体现。

### Trump RX 推出

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Rachel Abrams，欢迎收听《每日播报》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 各位女士们先生们，美利坚合众国总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 上周，特朗普总统公布了 **Trump RX**。几十种最常用的处方药将在 **trumprx.gov** 这个新网站上，以大幅折扣提供给所有消费者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Last week, President Trump unveiled Trump RX. Dozens of the most commonly used prescription drugs will be available at dramatic discounts for all consumers throughout a new website. It's called trumprx.gov.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这是政府为应对**处方药高昂成本**而提出的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The administration's answer to the high cost of prescription drugs.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这次上线代表了**处方药价格**有史以来最大幅度的降低，而且差距非常大。你将看到你难以置信的数字。总统称该网站为一项“变革性的医疗倡议”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: This launch represents the largest reduction in prescription drug prices in history by many, many times. And it's not even close. You're going to see numbers that you're not going to believe. The president hailed the website as a quote transformative healthcare initiative.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 祝贺你，以及你们节省的所有这些钱。好的。谢谢。非常感谢大家。很感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Congratulations to you and all that money you're saving. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Appreciate it.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 今天，我的同事 **Margot Sanger-Catz** 将解释这个网站如何运作，以及它是否真的能为美国人省钱。今天是 2 月 11 日，星期三。Margot，欢迎你再次来到节目。很高兴回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Today my colleague Margot Sanger-Catz explains how the site works and whether it will actually save Americans money. It's Wednesday, February 11. Margot, welcome back to the show. It's nice to be back.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我觉得我听说了这个 Trump RX 的事情已经好几个月了，但一直没搞清楚它到底是什么。比如我不知道它是一个在线药房，还是一个特朗普品牌旗下的在线药房。上周，这个网站终于正式上线了。所以，Margot，请先告诉我们，Trump RX 是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I feel like I have been hearing about this Trump RX thing for probably months now without having a good sense of what this thing actually was. like I didn't know if it was an online pharmacy, a Trump branded online pharmacy perhaps. And last week the website was actually unveiled. So Margot, start off by telling us what is Trump RX.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 我觉得从某些方面来说，说它不是什么更容易理解。它不是一个你可以购买处方药的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So I think in some ways it's easier to say what it's not. It's not a place that you can buy prescription drugs.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这不是一个药房。它不是一个由联邦政府运营的商店。它是一个你可以去的地方，如果你想购买某些处方药的话。它会帮助你弄清楚如何以**折扣价**获得它们。所以，这是联邦政府努力帮助你找到好价格的药物，但不是直接卖给你药物。这很有趣，因为我敢肯定，在我有生之年，几乎每一位总统候选人都曾或多或少地谈论过降低药价。而这个 **Trump RX** 网站，似乎是解决一个非常棘手问题的不寻常一步。那么，总统现在是如何得出这个解决方案的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: This is not a pharmacy. It is not a store that's run by the federal government. Instead, it's a place that you can go if you're looking to buy certain prescription drugs. It will help you figure out how to get them at a discounted price. So, this is the federal government's effort to help you find drugs at a good price, but not to sell you drugs directly, which is so interesting because I'm pretty sure that pretty much every presidential candidate in my lifetime has talked at some point and in some form about bringing down drug prices. And this website, Trump RX, seems like an unusual step toward addressing a very intractable problem. So, how did the president arrive as this as the solution right now?

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 我认为有两方面原因。一方面，**特朗普**现在显然面临着巨大的压力，需要做些什么来解决**可负担性**问题，特别是**医疗保健的可负担性**。民主党一直在猛烈抨击特朗普政府，而许多美国人也对**医疗保健成本**的**高企和上涨**感到担忧。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So, I think there's two things going on. One is that Trump is obviously under a lot of pressure right now to do something about affordability and particularly about the affordability of healthcare. Democrats have just been hammering the Trump administration on this and a lot of Americans are concerned about high and rising costs for healthare. Mhm.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 另一方面，**药价**一直是特朗普的一个“执念”。甚至在他 2015 年开始竞选总统的时候，他就经常在竞选集会上谈论这个问题。在这个问题上，他听起来甚至有点像伯尼·桑德斯。他总是抱怨说，美国人支付的**药品价格**是全世界最高的，这是事实。平均而言，我们支付的价格是我们**其他富裕国家**支付的**处方药价格**的大约三倍。在他第一个任期内，他试图采取一些行动来解决这个问题，但都没有真正奏效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: The other thing is that drug prices have sort of been an obsession of Trump's. Even from the time he started running for president in 2015, this was something that he would talk about on the campaign trail a lot. He almost sounded a little bit like Bernie Sanders on this issue. He was always complaining that Americans pay the highest prices for drugs in the world, which is true. On average, we pay about three times as much as what other rich countries pay for prescription drugs. And in his first term, he tried to take some actions to do something about it, but they didn't really work out.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你能提醒我们一下吗，Margot，为什么美国人支付的药价比其他国家高？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And can you just remind us, Marggo, why do Americans pay more than other countries for drugs?

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 答案有点复杂，但我想最简单的解释是，大多数其他国家，该国政府会直接与**制药公司**进行谈判，他们会说：“如果你想把你的药卖给我国的所有病人，你需要给我们一个好价格。”美国没有这样的体系。政府通常不参与设定药品价格。相反，我们有很多不同的**保险公司**在为不同的客户群体单独谈判。另一个区别是，在许多其他国家，如果一家**药企**有一种新药，效果很好但价格昂贵，那些国家愿意说：“如果你不把价格降到足够低，我们愿意退出谈判桌。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So, the answer is a little bit complicated, but I think the simplest way to answer it is that most other countries, the government of that country negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies, and they say, "If you want to sell your drug to all of the patients in my country, you need to give us a good price." We don't have a system like that in the United States. The government in general is not involved in setting the price for drugs. Instead, we have lots of different insurance companies that are making separate deals for different groups of customers. The other difference is that in a lot of other countries, if a drug maker has a new drug that's really great but really expensive, those countries are willing to say, "If you don't bring the price down enough, we are willing to walk away from the negotiating table." M

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 而在美国，我认为我们有一种文化、一种政治和一种期望，那就是如果一种新药有效，我们就希望能够在这里提供给病人。这意味着，政府在一定程度上参与其中，以及所有那些单独的保险公司，由于它们不能退出谈判桌，因此在压低价格方面**议价能力**稍弱。**制药公司**在这里拥有更大的权力来设定它们想要的任何价格。如果你仔细想想，这意味着我们美国在某种程度上是在为其他国家的**药品成本**买单，对吧？因为我们的国家愿意支付，这可能让**制药公司**更容易去法国、英国或其他任何地方说：“当然，没问题。我们就接受你们要求的价格。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: whereas in the United States I think we have a culture and a politics and an expectation that if a new drug works that we want to be able to offer it to patients here and so that means that the government to the degree it's involved and all of those individual insurance companies just have a little bit less leverage to pull the price down because they can't walk away from the table. The drug companies have a lot more power here to set whatever price they want for those drugs. Which if you think about it means that we as the United States are in some ways underwriting the cost of drugs for other countries, right? Because our country is willing to pay

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 某种程度上，这使得**制药公司**更容易去法国、英国或任何其他地方说：“好的，没问题。我们就接受你们要求的价格。”我认为这是完全正确的。美国市场对**制药行业**来说极其重要。我们支付这些超高价格。而且，我们是一个非常大的国家，所以很多商业模式都基于这样一个理念：**药企**将在一款新药上赚取几乎所有的利润都来自美国市场，然后他们从其他国家获得的任何收入都算是“额外的红利”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: kind of whatever that probably makes it easier for drug companies to go to France or the United Kingdom or wherever else and say, "Sure, fine. We'll take whatever you're demanding we take for this drug." I think that's absolutely true. The United States market is incredibly important to the pharmaceutical industry. We pay these super high prices. Also, we're just a really big country and so a lot of the business model is sort of predicated on the idea that the drug compan is going to make almost all of its money on a new drug in the United States market and then anything that they get from these other countries is kind of gravy,

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对吧？好的。那么，你说特朗普在他的第一个任期内未能降低药价。现在，他显然又回到了办公室。有什么变化吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: right? So, okay. So, you said Trump couldn't bring down the drug prices in his first term. Now, he's obviously back in office. What has changed?

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 有一件事没变，就是他一直认为这是一个非常重要的问题。但有几件事是不同的。首先，**药品市场**发生了一些变化。**GLP1 药物**（用于治疗**肥胖症**）的爆炸式增长，导致了更多的消费者直接购买药品，绕过了他们的**健康保险**。所以，这是一种新的消费者药品市场，以前并不存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So, one thing that hasn't changed is he's continued to think that this is a really important issue, but here are a few things that are different. One is that the market for drugs has changed a little bit. The explosion of these GLP1 drugs that treat obesity has led to many more consumers buying drugs directly and going around their health insurance. So that's kind of a new consumer market for drugs that didn't exist before.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 另一个是特朗普面临的关于**医疗保健可负担性**的政治压力，美国人觉得**医疗保健**太贵了。例如，他有一个重要的竞选承诺，他要成为**IVF（体外受精）**的“父亲”，他要帮助很多有生育困难的夫妇让**IVF**变得更**可负担**。此外，国会在其大规模的税收法案中，大幅削减了为许多低收入人群提供保险的州**Medicaid（医疗补助）计划**。去年年底，国会允许帮助数百万美国人购买**Obamacare（奥巴马医保）**健康保险计划的**补贴**到期。这增加了购买此类保险的人的**保费**，并增加了没有保险的人数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: And the other thing is the political pressures around healthcare affordability that Trump is facing that Americans feel like healthcare is too expensive. For example, he had this big campaign promise that he was going to be the father of IVF and he was going to help a lot of couples that were having trouble with fertility make IVF more affordable. And then on top of that, the Congress, as part of its big tax bill, made major cuts to state Medicaid programs that provide insurance to lots of low-income people. And at the end of last year, Congress allowed subsidies to expire that help millions of Americans buy Obamacare health insurance plans. And so that's increasing the premiums for people who buy that kind of insurance and increasing the number of people who don't have coverage.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯。我认为所有这些都在给他施加压力，让他试图开始寻找解决**医疗保健成本上涨**的方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm. I think all of this is creating pressure for him to try to start to find solutions around rising health care costs.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 关于处方药，它们并不是医疗支出最大的原因。我们的大部分医疗支出都用于支付**住院费**和**医生诊疗费**，但我认为**药品成本**对很多人来说尤其**显著**，因为这是人们每个月都会遇到的**医疗成本**。所以，特朗普决定他要关注**制药公司**及其在系统中的作用。他开始对这些公司施加直接压力。这意味着什么？他实际开始做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And here's the thing about prescription drugs. They are not the largest cause of health care spending. Most of our health care spending goes to pay for hospitalization and doctor's visits, but I think that drug costs are particularly salient for a lot of people because it's the one health care cost that people kind of deal with every single month. And so Trump decides that he wants to focus on the pharmaceutical companies and their role in the system. And he begins a pressure campaign on these companies directly. What does that mean? like what does he actually start doing?

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 他让他的贸易官员进行调查，并确定他们可以对**药品**征收高额**关税**。然后他去找**制药公司**的首席执行官。他基本上对他们说：“看，我可以对你们征收高额关税。我可以让你们在这个国家继续经营变得非常困难。我真的需要你们和我达成协议。”于是他开始一家一家地与所有这些**药企**进行谈判，并公开地、在镜头前召集他们宣布达成协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So he has his trade officials do an investigation and determine that they can impose major tariffs on pharmaceutical products and then he goes to the CEOs of individual pharmaceutical companies. And he basically said to them like look I could put a big tariff on you. I could make it really hard for you to continue to do business in this country. I really need you to make me a deal. So he starts negotiating with all these drug companies one at a time and he begins hauling them out in public in front of the cameras to announce deals.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我认为这是本部门有史以来最重大的医疗公告之一，因为我们正在谈论……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I think this is one of the biggest medical announcements that this office has ever made because we're talking about

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 他开始与**Fizer**这家**药企**合作。**Fizer**已同意以大幅折扣价向所有消费者提供其一些最受欢迎的**药物**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: so he starts with the drug company Fizer. Fiser has agreed to provide some of their most popular current medications to all consumers at heavily discounted prices of any

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 他与该公司首席执行官召开了新闻发布会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: and he has this press conference with the CEO of that company.

</details>

**CEO of Fizer**: 总统先生，这是我的荣幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CEO of Fizer**: Mr. President, what what an honor to be here

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 新闻发布会感觉有点像“人质视频”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: and the press conference like it has a little bit of like a hostage video kind of feel to it.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 他有一个漂亮的办公室，但椭圆形办公室是最酷的，对吧？你觉得呢？我绝对认为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: He has a beautiful office but the oval is the coolest, right? What do you think? I I think by far

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 你看到 **Fizer** 的首席执行官在镜头前谈论他很高兴能提供这些**产品**的大幅折扣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: you see the CEO of Fizer get up in front of the camera and talk about how delighted he is to offer these big discounts on his products.

</details>

**CEO of Fizer**: 现在我们对美国的定价框架有了清晰的认识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CEO of Fizer**: Now we have clarity about what is the framework for the US pricing

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 当然，他们以前从未想过这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: which of course they never would have wanted to do before.

</details>

**CEO of Fizer**: 从今往后，这就是在美国和海外的定价方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**CEO of Fizer**: And going forward this is how things will be priced in the US and abroad.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 正是在那场新闻发布会上，特朗普提到了 **Trump RX** 网站的想法。**药物**将可通过联邦政府运营的网站直接购买。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: And it's at that press conference that Trump mentioned the idea of this Trump RX website. drugs will be available for direct purchase online at a website operated by the federal government where

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这些协议将汇总并公开给美国人民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: where all of these deals are going to be pulled together and made public for the American people to find

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 然后在接下来的几周和几个月里，一个接一个地……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: and then over the next weeks and months one by one

</details>

**President Trump**: 特朗普总统，很高兴再次见到你，自从……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: so President Trump it is really a pleasure to see you again since uh

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 许多**制药公司**的高管都出来参加这些新闻发布会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: they have executives from numerous drug companies

</details>

**President Trump**: 特朗普总统，谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Mr. President thank you

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 总统先生，很荣幸来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: thank you Mr. President, it's a true honor to be here.

</details>

**President Trump**: 来参加这些新闻发布会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Come out for these press conferences.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们将大幅降低他们所依赖的**药物**成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: We're going to be significantly lowering the cost of the medicines they rely on

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 宣布了这些协议，并表示他们将为美国消费者提供更好的**价格**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: announced these deals and say that they're going to be offering much better pricing to American consumers

</details>

**President Trump**: 那是 **70% 的价格降幅**，而且也将可以在 Trump RX 上获得。我们也非常……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: and that's a 70% price reduction and that also will be available on Trump RX. We're also very

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 在每一次新闻发布会上……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: and at each one of these press conferences

</details>

**President Trump**: 现在你将看到一些难以置信的数字。想想看。特朗普用这种极其夸张的语言来描述所提供的**交易**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: now you're going to see numbers that nobody would believe possible. Think of this. Trump is using this incredibly hyperbolic language to describe the kinds of deals that are being offered.

</details>

**President Trump**: 500%、600%、700%、800%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: 500, 600, 700, 800%.

</details>

**President Trump**: 他说，这些不是 50% 或 80% 的折扣，而是 700%、800%、1000% 的折扣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Saying, you know, these are not discounts of 50 or 80%, but they are 700, 800, 1,000% discounts.

</details>

**President Trump**: 你说的是在某些情况下**降幅**达到 1400%、1500%、1600%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: You're talking about 14, 15,600% reductions in some cases.

</details>

**President Trump**: **折扣**在数学上是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Discounts that are mathematically not possible.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我认为基于这一点，我今天甚至不回答问题，因为我无法回答任何能与你刚才所见相提并论的问题。你刚刚目睹了**药价**将降至前所未有的水平。Marty，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And I think based on that, I won't even take questions today because there's no way I can take questions that are anywhere comparable to what you just witnessed. You just witnessed drug prices that will go down at levels never thought even possible. Marty,

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 到这个网站上线时，上周，已经有了一连串的新闻发布会。我认为这导致了一种期望，认为这将是一件大事，会有各种各样的**药物****折扣**。但如果你看看这些**交易**的细节，现实与此大相径庭。我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: so by the time this website rolls out last week, there's been this drum beat of press conference after press conference and I think it's led to this expectation that it's going to be this huge deal and there are going to be all of these wonderful discounts on drugs. But if you look at the details of these actual deals, the reality is very different than that. We'll be right back.

</details>

### Trump RX 网站分析

**Rachel Abrams**: Margot，你在休息前说，特朗普谈论这个网站的方式，已经树立了很高的期望，但当你查看网站上的**交易**时，这些期望并没有得到满足。所以，能多告诉我们一些你深入了解后发现的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So, Margot, you said before the break that the way that Trump had been talking about this website had set up huge expectations that weren't necessarily met when you actually looked at the deals represented on this site. So tell us a little bit more about what you found when you looked into this more.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 当你查看这个网站时，它绝对没有革新大多数美国人服用的**大多数药物**的价格。首先，这个网站上只有 **43 种药物**。有成千上万种处方药。所以，这只是人们所需**药物**中一小部分中的一小部分。这在**药品市场**中所占比例很小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: So when you look at this website, it is absolutely not revolutionizing the price of most drugs that most Americans take. First of all, there are only 43 drugs on this website. There are thousands and thousands of prescription drugs. So this is this tiny tiny little fraction of the drugs that people need. Right. That is not a lot of the drug market.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 是的。而且对于有**保险**的人来说（占所有美国人的 85%），这个网站并没有真正为他们提供比他们已经拥有的更好的价格。但有两种**药物**类别，其**交易**实际上相当不错。那就是**生育药物**和**减肥药物**。我想我们应该一起看看这个网站，大致浏览一下你可能会看到的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Yeah. And for people who have insurance, which is 85% of all Americans, this website is really not offering them a better price than what they already have. But there are two categories of drugs where the deals are actually pretty good. Those are drugs for infertility and for obesity. I think we should take a look at this website together and just kind of like walk through what you might actually see.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 是的，我们来看看。我将访问 **trumprx.gov**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: Yeah, let's do it. So, I'm going to go to trumprx.gov.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对，就是那个网站。我也在访问。好的。所以，我看到的第一件事是醒目的大字：“寻找世界上最低的**处方药价格**。”“Drugs”这个词后面有一个小药丸图标，而不是句号。价格这个词上方悬浮着一个药瓶图标。让我们看看，你可以向下滚动。我们看到美国和加拿大的**价格**比较。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Right, that's the website. I'm going there, too. All right. So, the first thing that I see is in big letters, it says, "Find the world's lowest prices on prescription drugs." And there's like a little pill instead of a period after the word drugs. There's a vial kind of hovering over the word prices. And let's see, you can scroll down. We see comparisons between the USA and Canada.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 好的，继续往下看，因为这是我最喜欢的部分。有一个旋转的地球，美国是金色的。它非常吸引人，并且写着：“感谢特朗普总统，**大型制药公司**的**价格欺诈**时代已经结束。利用美利坚合众国的全部力量和影响力，总统确保了每一位美国人都能获得发达世界中最低的**处方药价格**。你知道，我觉得这是一个非常漂亮的网站。设计非常简洁。令人愉悦。易于理解。但它仍在继续做出那些非常夸张的承诺，而它实际上并没有兑现。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: Okay, so keep going though, cuz this is my favorite part. There's a spinning globe with the United States in gold. It's very catching and it says, "Thanks to President Trump, the days of big pharma price gouging are over. Leveraging the full weight and power of the United States of America, the president has ensured every American gets the lowest prices on prescription medications in the developed world. You know, I think it's a very beautiful website. The design is very clean. It's enjoyable. It's easy to understand. but it is continuing to make these very hyperbolic promises that it really just doesn't deliver on.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 好的，让我们看看实际的**药物**。我将向下滚动直到找到一种**药物**。好的，列出的第一种**药物**是 **Wiggoi**，一种**减肥药**。对吧，Margot，告诉我我们看到的是什么。所以，Wiggoi，这是 **GLP1 药物**之一。这是一种用于治疗**肥胖症**的**药物**。它写着 Wiggo Vi Pen，**优惠 74% 至 85%**。然后有一个小图表显示，根据你购买的**药物**剂量，价格是多少。所以，这种**药物**的标价**每月超过 1000 美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Okay, so let's look at the actual drugs. I'm going to scroll down until I find a drug. Okay, so the first drug listed here is Wiggoi, a weight loss medication. Right, Margot, tell me what we are looking at. So Wiggoi, this is one of these GLP1 drugs. This is a drug that is used to treat obesity. and it says Wiggo Vi Pen 74 to 85% off. And then there's this little chart that shows you depending on what dose of the drug you're going to buy, what is the price. So the list price for this drug is more than $1,000 a month.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 在这个网站上，它显示**原价**是 **1349.2 美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: On this website, it says original price $1,3492.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那是你需要在药房支付的价格，每月 13.50 美元。而使用 Trump RX 的**定价**，他们向你展示的是，对于最高剂量的**药物**，价格仅为 **349 美元**。所以，对于服用这种**药物**、没有**保险**覆盖、并且自掏腰包支付的人来说，这是非常显著的**节省**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: That is what you would have to pay at the pharmacy, $13.50 a month. And with the Trump RX pricing, what they are showing you is for the highest dose of the drug, the price is only $349. So this is some really significant savings for people who take this drug, don't have insurance coverage for it, and are paying with their own money out of pocket.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 我想看看这个网站上的其他**药物**，因为我注意到列出的 43 种**药物**中有许多是**生育药物**，这些**药物**人们通常需要自掏腰包购买。我问了一个最近做过 **IVF** 的女朋友，让她把最近从在线药房购买的**药物**清单发给我，因为我想比较她支付的价格和 Trump RX 上宣传的价格。我的朋友花了大约 300 美元。如果我们把它输入 Trump RX，我们可以看到，对于她使用的相同剂量，价格是 **168 美元**。所以，这是一个显著的**折扣**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: I want to look at some of the other drugs on this website because I noticed that a lot of the drugs listed of these 43 are fertility drugs, which are drugs that people often have to pay for out of pocket. And I'd actually asked a girlfriend of mine who recently went through IVF to send me the list of drugs she had to purchase out of pocket from an online pharmacy recently because I wanted to compare the prices that she paid to the prices being advertised on Trump RX. My friend paid about $300 for it. And if we just type it into Trump RX, we can see that it starts at the same dosage that she had for $168.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 是的，这是一个显著的**折扣**。是的，我认为你朋友的价格很有说明性，对吧？Trump RX 网站说**原价**是 966 美元。你朋友支付了大约 300 美元。所以这是一个很大的**节省**。168 美元低于 300 美元。我认为对于这些**生育药物**来说，这是特朗普政府在**谈判**达成比以往**更好折扣**的另一个例子。而且，我认为一些**不孕症药物**成本的降低，将使这些治疗对需要它们的女性来说更加**可负担**，但这并不像网站承诺的那样大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So that's a significant discount. Yeah, I think your friend's price is kind of illustrative, right? The Trump RX website is saying that the original price was $966. Your friend was paying around $300. So this is a big savings. $168 is less than $300. I think for these fertility drugs, it's another example where the Trump administration did negotiate better discounts than were available before. And I do think that the reduced cost of some of these infertility drugs is going to make these treatments more affordable for women who need them, but it is not quite as big as what the website is promising. M

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 所以，如果你考虑**减肥药**和**生育药**，这两个例子是 Trump RX **实际发挥作用**的地方。好的，**减肥药**，**IVF 药**，明白了。但其他所有药物呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: so if you think about obesity drugs and infertility drugs, these two examples are the places where Trump RX is actually doing the most work. Okay, weight loss drugs, IVF drugs, got it. But what about literally everything else?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 所以，其他所有药物就有点令人失望了。原因如下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So the literally everything else is a little bit more disappointing. And here's why.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 这些其他**药物**是治疗更常见疾病的**药物**，如**哮喘**、**高胆固醇**、**糖尿病**。这些是几乎所有人的**保险**都能很好覆盖的**药物**。所以，如果你有**保险**，那么你支付的不是全价。你支付的是**共付额**，在很多情况下可能每月是 25 美元。这几乎肯定比 Trump RX 的**价格**要好。而 85% 的美国人都有**保险**覆盖他们的**药物**。所以，这确实是大多数人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: These other drugs are the kinds of drugs that treat more common conditions like asthma, high cholesterol, diabetes. These are the kinds of drugs that almost everyone's insurance covers really well. And so if you have insurance, then you're not paying the full price. You're paying a co-payment, which in many cases could be like $25 a month. That's pretty much going to beat the Trump RX price for all of these drugs. And 85% of Americans have insurance coverage that covers their drugs. So that really is most people.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，即使你考虑那些没有**保险**、需要**现金**直接支付**药物**费用的人，我的同事 Rebecca Robbins 和我一起查看了这份**药物**清单。在这 43 种**药物**中，我们发现大约一半的**药物**已经有了**仿制药**，而且**仿制药**比 Trump RX 上提供的**价格**更便宜。所以，即使对于那些没有**保险**的人来说，通过这个系统购买**药物**也不会让他们更划算。他们最好去药房直接购买**仿制药**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Then even if you're thinking about the people who don't have insurance and who have to pay for their drugs directly with cash, my colleague Rebecca Robbins and I went through this list of drugs. And of the 43 drugs, we found that about half of them already have generics that are on the market that are cheaper than the prices that are being offered on Trump RX. So even for those people who don't have insurance, they would not be better off buying the drugs through this system. They would be better off going to their pharmacy and just paying for a generic.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 这个网站是否会清楚地告诉人们，它可能无法为他们寻找的**药物**提供最优惠的价格？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: Is it going to be clear to people that this website might not give them the best deal for the drug that they're looking for?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 该网站有一些**免责声明**。当你进入每个单独的页面时，你会看到一个**免责声明**，例如，你应该检查一下你是否有**保险**，**共付额**可能更便宜。所以，这不是一个“一站式”服务。即使是设计这个 Trump RX 网站的人也承认这一点，并告诉消费者。但同时，让我们诚实地说，人们需要花费多少时间和资源来调查自己的**医疗保健**。比如，如果你全职工作，如果你是**护理人员**，如果你做多份工作，你可能花在研究如何通过查看**保险**等方式获得最便宜**药物**上的时间是有限的。所以，如果你从我们谈过的**新闻发布会**或其他地方得到一个普遍印象，那就是这将是获得**药物**最便宜的方式，你可能就会使用 Trump RX，即使它实际上不是最好的**交易**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The website has some disclaimers on it. When you go on each individual page, you will see that there is a disclaimer, for example, that you should check and see if you have insurance, it might be cheaper with a co-payment. So, this is not a one-stop shop for people. And even the people who have designed this Trump RX website acknowledge that and are telling consumers that. At the same time though, let's just be honest about the amount of time and resources people have to investigate their own healthcare. Like if you are working full-time, if you are a caregiver, if you are working multiple jobs, the amount of time that you're likely to invest in whether you can get the cheapest drug by like looking this up, looking at your insurance, etc., etc., is probably kind of limited. So, if you have the general impression from the press conferences we talked about or others that this is going to be the cheapest version of the way that you get your drugs, you might just end up using Trump RX, right? even if it's not actually the best deal. You

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 可能吧，但我认为大多数美国人习惯于使用他们的**保险**来购买**药物**。他们不习惯直接用**现金**支付并像这样货比三家寻找最优惠的价格。但我们采访的一些人表示，他们担心人们会认为 Trump RX 提供的是最优惠的价格，而他们不会去了解其他选择，最终会**多付药费**。所以，底线似乎是，如果你在美国**支付处方药费用**有困难，这个网站可能无法解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: might, but I think that most Americans actually are used to using their insurance for drugs. They're not used to paying directly with cash and shopping around for the best price in the way that this website is encouraging them to do. But some people that we talked to said that they're worried people are going to think that Trump RX is offering them the best deal and they are not going to look into these other options and they're going to end up overpaying for drugs. So, the bottom line here, it seems from everything you've said is that if you have trouble paying for your prescription drugs in the United States, this website is probably not going to fix that problem.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 是的，这个网站对大多数为**处方药价格**而苦恼的美国人来说，真的没有多大帮助。例如，目前市场上一些最昂贵的**药物**，以及美国人和**保险公司**难以支付的**药物**，是**癌症药物**。这个网站上没有任何**癌症药物**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Yeah, this website just isn't really doing very much for most Americans who struggle with their prescription drug prices. For example, some of the most expensive drugs on the market right now, and the ones that Americans and insurance companies struggle to pay for are drugs for cancer. There are not any drugs for cancer on this website.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 而且值得注意的是，这仅仅是开始。预计未来会有更多**药物**添加到该网站。但就目前而言，很明显，这并不是解决美国**处方药成本高昂**问题的**解决方案**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: And it's worth noting that this is just the beginning. More drugs are expected to be added to this website over time. But for right now, it's very clear that this is not the solution to the problem of high prescription drug costs in America.

</details>

### 动机探究

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么 Margot，如果这个网站真的只能帮助那些想减肥或想生更多孩子的人，这确实让人怀疑为什么一开始要专注于这两类人群，尤其是因为候选人特朗普曾将“壮大家庭”作为他竞选活动的重要组成部分。你认为这个 Trump RX 项目更多是出于**意识形态**和**竞选承诺**的驱动，而不是真正希望提高**可负担性**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So Margot, if this website is really only going to help people who either want to lose weight or have more children, it does make me wonder about the decision to focus on those two groups to begin with, especially because candidate Trump made growing the American family such a big part of his campaign. Do you think that this Trump RX program is motivated more by ideology and perhaps campaign promises than by a desire to truly improve affordability?

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 我不这么认为。我认为这更像是一个“意外的惊喜”，因为这些**药物**是特朗普乐于**邀功**的，因为它们与他的**竞选承诺**（在**生育**方面）以及**减肥药**的流行度有关。但它们也是**药企**已经有很大**动力**提供**折扣**的**药物**，因为有大量人群已经自掏腰包购买。而 **Trump RX** 上线的宣传可能会帮助他们吸引更多客户，以弥补**价格**的降低。但整个过程我认为非常符合我们对特朗普的**销售技巧**的预期。他并没有真正解决**医疗保健可负担性**这个更广泛的问题。他没有一个全面的计划来降低**医院**、**医生**或其他大多数美国人面临最大账单的地方的**医疗成本**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: I don't really think it is. I think it's more of a happy accident that these are drugs that Trump would love to take credit for lowering the price of because they connect to his campaign promises in the case of infertility and they're really popular in the case of weight loss drugs. But they're also drugs where the drug company already had a pretty big incentive to offer a discount that there is this big market of people who are already paying for it with their own money. And the publicity of the Trump RX launch might help bring them more customers that will compensate for the lower prices. But the whole exercise I think very much fits into the kind of salesmanship that we expect from Trump. He does not really have a solution to the broader question of healthcare affordability. He does not have a comprehensive plan to lower health care costs at the hospital or at doctors or any of the other places where most Americans are faced with the biggest bills.

</details>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: 甚至更重要的是，他的政府已经采取了**措施**，这些**措施**正在提高许多美国人的**医疗成本**，并可能导致数百万美国人失去**健康保险**。所以，这不仅仅是一个小**解决方案**，而是一个针对在他任期内不断恶化的问题的小**解决方案**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margot Sanger-Catz**: And even more than that, his administration has taken actions that are raising the cost of healthcare for a lot of Americans that could cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance. So, this is not just a small solution, but it is a small solution to a problem that is getting worse on Trump's watch.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 在周二的国会听证会上，代理**ICE（美国移民及海关执法局）**局长 **Todd Lions** 拒绝说明是否有人在**ICE**特工上个月在明尼苏达州枪杀并杀死 **Renee Good** 后被解雇。你能告诉我们，至少，我希望至少有一个人因为这些行动开始以来的行为而被解雇吗？你是在告诉我，你甚至不能说有一个人被解雇了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: During a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Todd Lions, the acting ICE director, refused to say whether anyone had been fired after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota last month. Can you tell us if at least God I hope at least one person has been fired for their conduct since these operations have begun? Are you are you telling us you can't even say one person's been fired?

**Todd Lions**: 先生，我不会谈论人事行动，但我们会给你答复。

**Todd Lions**: Sir, I'm not going to talk about personnel actions, but we will get back to you.
