### 特朗普的仇外言论

本期《**The Daily**》（《每日》：由《纽约时报》制作的每日新闻播客）节目由**Natalie Kitroeff**主持。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitrov. This is the Daily.</p>
</details>

特朗普总统曾发表言论，称这些人“不工作，他们不会说‘来吧，让我们把这个地方变得伟大’。这些人除了抱怨什么都不做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These aren't people that work. These aren't people that say, "Let's go. Come on. Let's make this place great." These are people that do nothing but complain.</p>
</details>

在周二的一次内阁会议上，特朗普总统发表了他政治生涯中可能最露骨的**仇外**（xenophobic: 对外国人或外来文化的恐惧和厌恶）公开言论，称“如果我们继续把垃圾带进我们的国家，我们就会走错路。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump delivered perhaps the most blatantly xenophobic public remarks of his political career. and we're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.</p>
</details>

他攻击了明尼苏达州的**索马里裔美国人**（Somali Americans: 拥有索马里血统的美国公民），称他们为“垃圾”。

特朗普还说：“你知道，他们来自天堂，他们说这不是天堂。但当他们来自地狱，他们只会抱怨，除了抱怨什么都不做，我们不希望他们留在我们的国家。让他们回到他们来的地方，去解决那里的问题。”

### 明尼苏达州社区的震动与恐惧

Natalie: Ernesto，本周总统关于索马里移民的言论，我认为对我们许多人来说，确实令人震惊。即使对于一位以对移民发表极端言论而闻名的总统来说，他在一次全国电视直播的内阁会议上，将一整个群体的人称为“垃圾”。作为一名驻明尼苏达州的全国记者，请告诉我们，这些言论在那里是如何被接收的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ernesto, the president's comments about Somali immigrants this week were, I think for a lot of us, truly shocking. Even for a president who's known for making extreme comments about immigrants, he called an entire group of people garbage in a nationally televised cabinet meeting. You're in Minnesota as a national correspondent. So tell us, how were these comments received there?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 我认为这里的人们对这些言论感到震惊。他们可能并不惊讶总统会说出贬低索马里社区或其移民理念的话，但我确实认为白宫昨天所说的话的语气和基调，让这里的人们觉得简直是“过分了”。这在居住在该州的约八万索马里裔居民中引发了一种普遍的恐惧感，其中绝大多数是美国公民或合法的永久居民。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think people here have been shell shocked by the comments. I think they're not surprised that the president would say things that are disparaging of the Somali community or about his immigration philosophy, but I I do think the tone and tenor of what was said at the White House yesterday struck people here as just beyond the pale. And it's induced a prevailing sense of terror among the 80,000 or so people of Somali ancestry that live in the state. The vast majority of whom are American citizens or legal permanent residents</p>
</details>

Natalie: 而且他们是明尼苏达州社会结构的重要组成部分。他们在政治上崭露头角，有许多索马里裔美国人是州议员并担任其他地方职务。他们是企业主，从事蓝领工作，也在医疗保健领域工作。一夜之间，他们的总统称他们为“垃圾”，并说他希望他们都回家，这确实令人不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they're a big part of the fabric of Minnesota. They're ascendant in politics. There's many Somali Americans who are in the state legislature and hold other local office. They are business owners. They work bluecollar jobs. They work in healthcare and the idea that overnight their president refers to them as garbage and says that he wishes they would just all go home was truly jarring.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 告诉我你所描述的恐惧。具体是什么引发了社区的这种担忧？本周我们了解到，特朗普政府已部署了大约一百名移民官员，显然是为了寻找那些面临**驱逐令**（deportation orders: 要求非公民离开国家的官方命令）的索马里人。据我们了解，这只是一个相当小的群体。我们谈论的可能是几百人，他们有待决的庇护案件，或者出于某种原因合法来到这里，但由于可能犯了罪而失去了合法身份。所以现在发生的情况是，人们感到明尼苏达州正在开始实施移民打击，企业和家庭可能成为移民突袭的目标。到目前为止，这意味着人们在考虑即使他们有合法身份，是否还觉得上班安全，以及人们是否还觉得去杂货店购物自在。这种恐惧不仅仅是遇到移民官员。这种恐惧也变成了，这种关于索马里人和索马里文化的普遍有毒言论，已经赋予了种族主义者权力，去做和说构成骚扰和仇恨的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me about the terror that you described. What is prompting the fear in the community specifically? This week we learned that the Trump administration has deployed roughly 100 immigration agents to come in and apparently look for Somalis who are subject to deportation orders. As we understand that this is a fairly small pool of people. We're talking about maybe a few hundred people who have pending asylum cases or for whatever reason came here legally but fell out of status because they may have committed a crime. So what's happened is there's a sense that a crackdown on immigration is starting to take root in Minnesota and that businesses and homes may become the targets of immigration raids. What this has meant so far is that people are thinking twice about whether they feel safe going to work even if they have legal status and just people kind of mulling whether they even feel comfortable going to the grocery store. And the fear is not merely about running into immigration agents. The fear also has become that this prevailing toxic rhetoric about Somali and Somali culture has empowered people who are racist to do and say things that amount to harassment and hatred. Hm.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 我采访了一位索马里裔美国移民律师，他说他接到了大量电话，其中包括来自美国公民的电话，他们报告说在街上遭到嘲讽和骚扰。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I spoke to a Somali American immigration lawyer who said he's been flooded with calls, including from American citizens who report just being taunted and harassed on the street.</p>

Natalie: 你是说人们认为这可能是在给那些想要表现出最糟糕本能的人开绿灯。这是一种许可结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're saying people are seeing this as potentially giving people permission to act on their worst instincts. It's a permission structure.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 正是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct.</p>
</details>

### 敌意的根源：明尼苏达州的欺诈案

Natalie: 好的。我想谈谈为什么会发生这种情况，为什么联邦政府将注意力转向了这个拥有八万人口的社区。在特朗普的激烈言论中，他暗示了这种敌意的原因。他说索马里人“偷了所有的钱”。这是一个你一直在报道的故事，对吗？请告诉我们索马里人是如何成为总统这种恶毒攻击的目标的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I want to talk about why this is happening. why the federal government has turned its attention to this community of 80,000 people. In his diet tribe, Trump hinted at the reason for the hostility. He said that Somali had stolen all of this money. This is a story you've been covering, right? Walk us through how Somali became the subject of this vitriolic attack from the president. Yeah,</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，我认为这个事件的起源可以追溯到2020年。当时，在疫情爆发的最初几周，州政府官员非常担心人们是否能吃饱饭，是否能有地方住，因为许多人失去了工作。我们所有人都在**COVID-19**（新型冠状病毒肺炎）引发的恐惧时刻中集体陷入困境。当时有一个具体的项目，州政府官员正在管理，以确保在疫情期间弱势儿童能够获得食物。结果，这个项目却吸引了欺诈者，他们开始注册为供餐点，声称他们正在为成千上万的儿童提供食物，而实际上他们所做的只是提交虚假发票，窃取了惊人的金额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the origin of this saga dates back to 2020. And what happened was, you know, during the early weeks of the pandemic, state officials were really worried about whether people were being fed, were people going to be housed as many lost their jobs. And as we all sort of collectively descended into this fearful moment induced by COVID 19. And there was one specific program that state officials were managing to keep vulnerable kids fed during the pandemic. What happened was that turned into a magnet for fraudsters who began registering as meal sites saying that they were feeding tens of thousands of children when in reality what they were doing was submitting bogus invoices and stealing a staggering amount of money.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对，这是我们已经知道的事情，对吧？这是我们看到的广泛欺诈的一部分，疫情期间的项目被利用了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. This is something we've known about, right? This was part of the widespread fraud that we saw where pandemic programs were taken advantage of.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 没错。即使在疫情期间人们窃取了惊人数量的资金，目标涉及广泛的项目，包括商业贷款和失业福利，明尼苏达州发生的事情在规模上仍然是独一无二的。官员们称其为同类案件中最明目张胆的一起，仅仅是因为涉案人数之多和被盗金额之巨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And even in the context of the stunning amount of money that people stole during the pandemic, targeting a wide range of programs, including business loans and unemployment benefits. What happened in Minnesota was unique in just the scale and officials have described it as the most brazen case of its kind just by the sheer number of people involved and the amount of money that was stolen.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 实际情况有多严重？我们谈论的规模和范围是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How far did it actually go? Like what are we talking about here in terms of scale, in terms of scope?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 目前，联邦法院已对该计划中的78人提出指控。其中绝大多数是索马里裔美国人。超过50人已在这些案件中被定罪。最初，我认为许多地方官员对发生此事感到愤怒，但他们基本上认为这可能只是疫情期间的一次性滥用，当时人们确实迫切需要获得资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, 78 people have now been charged in the scheme in federal court. The vast majority of them are Somali Americans. More than 50 have already been convicted in these cases. And initially, I think many local officials were outraged that this happened, but they essentially said this probably was a one-off abuse during the pandemic when there was a real sense of urgency about getting money to people who needed it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 然而，近年来，随着检察官深入调查法庭记录并开始采访证人，他们注意到了一些真正令人不安的事情。这实际上并非一次性事件。他们发现，一些人组成的网络在其他非疫情时期的常规**社会保障项目**（safety net programs: 旨在帮助弱势群体的政府福利项目）中发现了漏洞，这些项目旨在帮助面临无家可归风险的人，以及患有自闭症的儿童。他们对未提供的服务收取了惊人的费用。根据联邦检察官的说法，仅在这三项计划中，总共被盗窃的金额高达10亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in recent years, as prosecutors dug into court records and as they started interviewing witnesses, something really jarring came to their attention. This was not, in fact, a one-off. What they found was that networks of people had found loopholes in other programs that weren't COVID pandemic era programs, but just run-of-the-mill safety net programs designed to help people at risk of homelessness, kids with autism, and that they were charging a staggering amount of money for services that weren't rendered. And collectively, according to federal prosecutors, up to $1 billion has been stolen just in these three schemes.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 真是惊人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Remarkable.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 州政府官员表示，欺诈基本上已经成为一种商业模式，这些人行事相当公开。他们在镇上租赁了办公空间，有网站，有名片。他们以惊人的金额在光天化日之下窃取资金，而负责监督这些项目的州政府官员只是支付了收到的发票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what state officials have said was that fraud essentially became the business model and that these people were acting kind of above board. They had office space that they leased all around town. They had websites. They had business cards. and they were sort of stealing staggering amounts of money in plain sight and state officials tasked with overseeing and supervising these programs were just paying the invoices that came in.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 我采访了一位曾代表涉案人员的辩护律师，他说多年来，那些窃取资金的人渐渐认为，利用这些资金并以欺诈手段致富变得如此容易，以至于他们几乎认为州政府官员是容忍甚至公然授权这种行为的。他形容说，这就像人们今天从饼干罐里偷东西，第二天早上饼干罐又被重新装满了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I spoke to a defense lawyer who has represented people involved in some of these schemes and he said that among the people who were stealing money over the years they kind of came to think that it had become so easy to tap into these funds and you know get rich fraudulently that they kind of assumed state officials were tolerating this if not outright authorizing it. And the way he described it was, you know, it was like people were stealing from the cookie jar one day and the next morning they had refilled it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 你是说这远远超出了疫情欺诈的范围，而且几乎所有涉案人员都是索马里裔美国人。但如果金额如此巨大，怎么会没有被发现呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're saying this went far beyond just pandemic fraud and that almost everyone involved in these schemes was Somali Americans. But if the figures were so big, how did it go unnoticed?</p>
</details>

### 种族主义指控与政治影响

Ernesto: 这是一个州政府官员正在努力回答的重大问题，但我认为回顾一下当时的情况会很有帮助。在2020年，当大量资金涌入儿童供餐项目时，出现了危险信号。当州政府官员被大量希望参与该项目、希望提供餐食并获得报销的企业主所淹没时，当他们开始审查收到的发票时，他们产生了疑问。而这些疑问却遭到了一个非同寻常的指控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is a great question that state officials are really struggling to answer, but I think it's useful to go back in time a little bit and kind of remember the context in which this took hold. So, there were red flags that emerged in 2020 when money was gushing into this program to feed children. And when state officials felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of business owners who wanted in on the program, who wanted to be serving meals and be reimbursed for them, and when they started reviewing the invoices that were coming to them, they had questions. And those questions were met with an extraordinary accusation</p>
</details>

Natalie: 那是什么指控？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which was what</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 在这个项目中组织供餐提供商的最大团体叫做“**Feeding Our Future**”（喂养我们的未来：一个非营利组织）。他们回应州政府官员的质疑时，基本上说州政府之所以拖延处理那些希望参与项目的新申请，是因为他们对东非移民存在种族歧视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the largest group that was organizing meal providers in this program was called feeding our future. It was a nonprofit organization and in response to questions from state officials. They essentially said the state was sloww walking these new petition for people who wanted in on the program because they were being racist against East African immigrants. Hm.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 我认为记住当时该州正在发生什么很有用。这场斗争发生时，明尼苏达州正在努力应对**乔治·弗洛伊德**（George Floyd: 一名非裔美国人，2020年在明尼阿波利斯被警察杀害，引发了全国性的抗议）被杀事件的余波，这当然引发了全国范围内对种族问题的反思。所以当时在该州，没有人愿意被称为种族主义者，即使这完全没有根据。我认为现在，那些关注事件发展的人普遍认为，这确实对州政府中的人们产生了瘫痪效应，他们知道有些不对劲，但不想冒风险去阻止它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think it's useful to remember what was happening in the state at the time. This fight is unfolding as Minnesota is grappling with the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, which of course set off a national reckoning over race. So in the state at that time, nobody wanted to be called a racist, even if it was wholly unfounded. And I think the consensus now among people who have watched the sequence of events was that that really had a paralyzing effect on people in state government who knew something funny was going on but didn't really want to stick their necks out and stop it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对。这发生在一个非常特殊的时间和地点，当时种族紧张关系非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. This was happening in a very particular place at a very particular time when tensions over race are extremely high.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 没错。但我认为这还有另一层原因，那就是索马里裔美国人在该州在政治上变得相当强大，我认为民主党议员将他们视为一个非常重要的选民群体。在某些情况下，一些欺诈计划的负责人会去找州议员寻求帮助，寻求干预，或者成为他们竞选活动的重要捐助者。所以，我认为除了被指控为种族主义者的威胁之外，该州的一些民主党民选官员确实担心，他们采取任何质疑或干预的行动，可能会阻止这些计划，并疏远一个非常重要的选民群体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. But I think there's another layer to this and that is that Somali Americans have become politically quite powerful in the state and I think Democratic lawmakers have seen them as a really vital constituency and there were instances in which the people who were responsible for some of these fraud schemes came to state lawmakers and asked for help, asked for intervention or became important donors. to their campaigns. So, I think there is a sense that beyond the threat of being called racist, some Democratic elected officials in the state were just really worried that any action they took to question or intervene in a way that would maybe stop these schemes could have alienated a really important constituency.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 明白了。所以，那里存在潜在的政治风险。不过，最终检察官还是开始调查此事，对吗？那么，随着这个长达数年、涉及数十亿美元的丑闻细节逐渐浮出水面，明尼苏达州的人们是否开始反思，指控他人种族主义的威胁是如何被用作工具，从而让这种欺诈得以持续的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got it. So, there was a perceived political risk there. Eventually though, prosecutors do start to go after this, right? So, as the details of this yearslong billion dollar scandal start to spill out into the open, do motans start to reckon with how this threat of accusing people of racism was used as a tool to allow this fraud to go on?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 嗯，这当然在该州引起了巨大的愤怒，但我认为在事发后并没有立即发生任何实质性的改变。实际上是在后来，就在今年夏天，明尼苏达州当地的美国检察官办公室发生了人事变动。当时，一直领导这些欺诈案件的检察官**Joe Thompson**成为了代理美国检察官。他主动承担起责任，真正提高了对问题性质和范围的关注度。他开始召开新闻发布会和接受采访，这让人感觉他不仅仅是在起诉那些实施欺诈的个人。他开始以一种似乎在起诉整个系统的方式发言，这个系统允许欺诈行为蔓延。他的论点是，我们无法通过起诉来解决这个问题。窃取资金的人太多了。现在有太多项目容易受到攻击。除非州内的人们真正开始正视已经根深蒂固的问题，并开始实施更强有力的保障措施，否则该州将失去向真正需要帮助的人提供服务的能力。在我的采访中，他首次提到了这个问题的种族层面，并表示从他的角度来看，在事件发生期间，在明尼苏达州将种族主义指控武器化，在很大程度上阻碍了那些本可以在前端阻止此事的人做出更强有力的回应。所以，在这一点上，这是一个正在进行深刻反思的地方，反思当其自身围绕这些自由主义政策的规则和法规执行如此松懈时，这些政策就会被利用，并可能最终导致人们反对它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that certainly caused a huge amount of outrage in the state, but I don't think anything necessarily changed in the immediate aftermath. It was actually later, it was this year, this summer, when there was a change of guard at the local US attorney's office in Minnesota. And what happened was the prosecutor who had been leading these fraud cases, Joe Thompson, became the acting US attorney. And he took it upon himself to really turn up the volume on the nature and the scope of the problem. He started giving press conferences and interviews in which it started feeling like he was doing more than just indicting individuals who were committing fraud. He started speaking in a way that felt like he was indicting the whole system that had allowed this to metastasize. And his argument was we can't indict our way out of this problem. There's just too many people who are stealing. There's too many programs that are now vulnerable. And unless and until people in the state truly start wrestling with what has taken root and start implementing stronger safeguards, the state is going to lose its ability to provide services to people who actually need them. And in my interview with him, he for the first time addressed the racial dimension of this and said that from his vantage point, weaponizing allegations of racism in Minnesota during the period when this happened played a big role in inhibiting a more forceful response from the kind of people who could have stopped this on the front end. So it is at this point a place that's doing some soularching about what happens when you know it's so lacks in the enforcement of its own rules and regulations around these liberal policies that those policies start to get taken advantage of and and potentially end up turning people against them.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="p-english-text">Correct.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 近几周，我们开始看到立法者提出一些正确的问题。我们开始看到州长实施更强有力的保障措施，以试图预防和检测其他项目中的欺诈行为。所以，我认为我们正在看到一个建设性反思的早期阶段，这里的人们希望这能减少欺诈。然而，一旦这个问题进入白宫的视野，一旦它吸引了特朗普总统的想象力，这种反思就开始呈现出非常不同的形态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in recent weeks we start seeing lawmakers start asking some of the right questions. we start seeing the governor implement stronger safeguards to try to prevent fraud and to detect fraud in other programs. So, I think we're seeing kind of the early phases of a constructive reckoning that people here were hoping would lead to less fraud. However, once this issue crosses the radar of the White House, once it's something that captures President Trump's imagination, that reckoning starts to take a very different shape.</p>

### 特朗普的政治动机与“美国性”的质疑

Natalie: Ernesto，你刚才告诉我们，自从特朗普开始关注此事以来，明尼苏达州当地的情况发生了非常大的转变。我想了解这一点。但首先，我们能否先探讨一下为什么特朗普决定现在抓住这个问题不放？因为你描述的这个丑闻已经持续了一段时间，多年来，不断有新的揭露。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ernesto, you just told us that things on the ground in Minnesota have taken a very different turn since Trump started to focus on this. And I want to understand that. But first, can we just get to the question of why Trump decided to seize on this right now? Because you've described this scandal that's been playing out in the background for a while now, for years, with this steady drum beat of revelations coming out over time.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，我认为一系列事件使这个问题成为白宫的“头等大事”。第一个是保守派活动家**Chris Rufo**的一份报告，该报告暗示明尼苏达州这些计划中被盗的一些资金最终落入了非洲恐怖分子手中，即索马里**青年党**（al-Shabaab: 索马里一个伊斯兰极端主义恐怖组织）的成员。所以，这个人曾与大学对抗，并在保守派圈子中变得非常有影响力。因此，他引起对此事的关注，使其传到了华盛顿特区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there were a sequence of events that turned this into a front burner issue for the White House. The first one was a report by Chris Rufo, the conservative activist, which created the inference that some of the money that had been stolen in these schemes in Minnesota had wound up in the hands of terrorists in Africa, namely members of the group al-Shabaab in Somalia. So, this is a figure who has taken on universities and has become very influential in conservative circles. So the fact that he drew attention to this made it land in Washington DC</p>
</details>

Natalie: Rufo在这里明确表示，这些欺诈资金与恐怖主义有关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Rufo here is specifically saying that this money from the fraud that it has a link to terrorism.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 没错。需要澄清的是，检察官并未发现这种关联。这些联邦案件中没有任何与恐怖主义的关联。但尽管如此，这篇报道的标题是：“**青年党**最大的资助者是明尼苏达州的纳税人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And to be clear, prosecutors have drawn no such link. None of these federal cases have featured any link whatsoever to terrorism. But nonetheless, the headline on this piece was quote, "The largest funer of al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer."</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哇。好的。所以，无论真假，这都引起了很大的关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Okay. So, that got a lot of attention whether it was true or not.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 没错。几天后，我们发表了一篇文章，向读者介绍了欺诈行为如何在明尼苏达州如此普遍，并探讨了种族主义和政治在多年来使其蔓延中所扮演的角色。所有这些都发生在国内首都的人们正从两名**国民警卫队**（National Guard: 美国武装部队的一个分支，通常由州政府管理，在紧急情况下可由联邦政府征召）成员遭遇的可怕枪击事件中恢复过来的时候。该案件中的枪手是一名近年来被允许进入美国的阿富汗男子。我认为这增加了一个因素，即政府有更多的政治掩护，可以在移民打击方面采取更严厉的措施，特别是在涉及那些饱受不稳定和冲突困扰的国家时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And then a few days later, we published a piece that walked readers through how fraud got so pervasive in Minnesota and that examined the role racism and politics played in allowing it to metastasize over the years. And all this was happening at the same time as people in the nation's capital were reeling from that horrific shooting of two members of the National Guard. The gunman in that case was an Afghan man who had been admitted in recent years into the country. And I think that added an element that the administration had more political cover to be more draconian in its immigration crackdown, particularly as it pertained to countries that are riven with instability and conflict.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对吗？这确实成为了一个时刻，政府将重点转向了来自那些如你所说，以不稳定和冲突著称的地方的特定移民群体。白宫一直在传递关于这些人的信息是，他们正在将不受欢迎的文化引入美国。你知道，特朗普的国内政策顾问**Stephen Miller**最近在社交媒体上发布了这条信息。他写道：“当来自失败国家的人跨越边境时，不会发生神奇的转变。”然后，在周二的评论中，特朗普似乎接续了米勒的论调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? This has really become a moment where the administration has turned its focus to specific groups of immigrants from places that, as you said, have a reputation for instability, for conflict. And the message the White House has been sending about these people is that they're importing cultures into America that are not welcome. You know, Steven Miller, Trump's domestic policy adviser, recently posted this on social media. He said, quote, "No magic transformation occurs when people from failed states cross borders." And then in his comments on Tuesday, Trump seems to pick up right where Miller left off.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 没错。特朗普总统及其圈子中限制来自特定国家移民的愿望，显然可以追溯到他的第一个任期，并遭到了公众和法院的巨大反对。但我认为现在他们可能觉得他们有更多的筹码来推动此事，让更多人被戴上手铐并离开这个国家，并根据国籍关闭美国移民的大门。在周二的内阁会议上，特朗普总统表示美国正处于一个十字路口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And the desire by President Trump and people in his circle to limit immigration from specific countries dates back to his first term, obviously, and was met with tremendous push back both from the public and from the courts. I think now though they may feel that they have a little more leverage to push this through, to get more people in handcuffs and out of the country and to close the door to American immigration based on nationality. And at that cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump said the United States was at a crossroads.</p>
</details>

特朗普: “你知道，我们的国家正处于一个临界点。我们可能会走向糟糕。我们正处于一个临界点。我不知道人们是否介意我这么说，但我还是要说。嗯，我们可能会走向一个方向或另一个方向。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, our country is at a tipping point. We could go bad. We're at a tipping point. I don't know if people mind me saying that, but I'm saying it. Uh, we could go one way or the other.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 他说他受够了那些来自贫困、冲突国家的人来到这里，在他看来，他们是在吸食福利国家的资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He said that he was fed up with people coming here from impoverished, conflictridden countries and as he sees it, leeching off the welfare state.</p>
</details>

特朗普: “福利领取率高达88%。他们毫无贡献。我不想让他们留在我们的国家。老实说。好吧。有人会说，‘哦，那不符合政治正确。’我不在乎。我不想让他们留在我们的国家。他们的国家不好是有原因的。他们的国家很糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The welfare is like 88%. They contribute nothing. I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you. Okay. Somebody would say, "Oh, that's not politically correct." I don't care. I don't want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stakes.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 这也让我觉得，所有这些对话都比特朗普第一个任期时更加公开。我的意思是，我想我们很多人都会记得特朗普关于“粪坑国家”的评论。那是在幕后进行的。那是在私下里发表的评论，后来才被披露。现在他是在他的内阁面前，在摄像机滚动的情况下做这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It also just strikes me that this is all happening, this conversation so much more out in the open than it was in Trump's first term. I mean, I think a lot of us will remember the comment that Trump made about hole countries. That was behind closed doors. That was a comment made in private that was later revealed. Now he's doing this in front of his cabinet, in front of the cameras rolling.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，我认为有一种感觉是，在当前这个时代，他们觉得有胆量把那些“不宜公开”的话大声说出来，说出那些在不久的过去对于主流政治家来说是不可想象的、会断送职业生涯的话。但突然之间，我们看到这些想法和观念成为主流政策和主流辩论话题。需要明确的是，特朗普在这里谈论的人是索马里人，你告诉我们其中大多数人拥有合法身份或已经是公民。所以我想问，鉴于此，你预计**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民和海关执法局）的行动会是什么样子？我的意思是，他们会怎么做？他们在寻找谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there's a sense that in this current era, they feel emboldened to say the quiet part out loud and to say things that would have been unimaginable and careerending for mainstream politicians in the not tooistant past. But all of a sudden, we are seeing these ideas and these notions become mainstream policies and mainstream subjects of debate. And to be clear, the people that Trump is talking about here are Somali, most of whom you've told us have legal status or are citizens. So I want to ask given that, what do you expect the ICE operations to look like there? I mean, what are they going to do? Who are they looking for?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，我认为这对ICE来说是一个非常具有挑战性的任务，而且我认为它很可能与我们今年早些时候在芝加哥或洛杉矶等地看到的非常不同。首先，可能面临驱逐的人数似乎相当少。我们可能只谈论几百人，他们可能有未执行的驱逐令，并且可以被纳入系统。还有一个更世俗的挑战，那就是本周明尼苏达州天气异常寒冷，人们在街上停留的时间尽可能短，而特工们如果外出敲门、监视企业和住宅，我认为他们将面临真正的困难。这本身对ICE来说将是一个巨大的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think this is a very challenging mission for ICE and I think it's likely to look very different from what we've seen earlier this year in places like Chicago or Los Angeles. You know, for starters, the number of people who may be subject to deportation appears to be pretty small. We may be talking about just a few hundred people who may have outstanding deportation orders and who can sort of be put into the system. And there's kind of a more mundane challenge and that is that this week has been bone chilling in Minnesota and people are spending as little time as possible on the streets and agents I think are facing real pain if they're out and about knocking on doors, staking out businesses and residences. That in and of itself is going to be a monumental challenge for ICE.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 我们能在这里暂停一下吗？因为值得一提的是，我们在这里看到的不仅仅是一次移民行动。特朗普的言论和这些行动似乎更多地是为了否定一群人的合法性，这些人要么移民到这里并成为美国公民，要么他们的父母是这样。总统正在质疑他们的“美国性”，并真正质疑你作为移民或移民子女，称自己为美国人的能力是否取决于你来自哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we pull back here for a minute? Because it's worth saying what we're seeing here isn't just an immigration operation. Trump's comments and these actions seem to be just as much about delegitimizing a group of people who either immigrated here and became American citizens or their parents did. The president is calling into question their Americanness and really calling into question whether your ability as an immigrant or a child of immigrants to call yourself an American depends on where you're from.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，我认为这是一个索马里移民现在正在努力解决的非常痛苦的问题，那就是，你需要做些什么来证明你是美国人？你需要付出多大的努力才能真正感受到你属于这里，并且你是这个国家结构的一部分？我们谈论的是许多情况下出生在这里，从未知道其他家园的人。其他人几十年前来到这里，长期以来一直认为自己是爱国者，一直在帮助建设这个州，纳税，从事非常困难的工作。所以，是的，我认为这确实给人们留下了令人不安的问题，即在这个政治时代，他们需要做些什么才能被这个国家接纳，以及这种打击和这种怀疑的阴云会蔓延多远？未来几个月这会呈现出什么形态？我想象，他们的“美国性”是否会因为他们社区中一个人或几个人犯了错误而随时受到质疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think this is a really painful question that Somali immigrants are now wrestling with is, you know, what do you do to prove that you're an American? like to what length do you need to go to truly feel like you belong and that you're part of the fabric of this nation? We're talking about people in many cases who were born here and have known no other homeland. Others arrived here decades ago and have long considered themselves patriots who have been helping build the state, paying taxes, working in really difficult jobs. So yeah, I think this really leaves people with unsettling questions about what they need to do to be brought into the fold of this country in this political era and just how much further will this crackdown and this cloud of suspicion reach? What shape could this take in the months ahead? And I'd imagine whether their Americanness could be called into question anytime a single or a few members of their community make a mistake.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 绝对是。你知道，我们听到了地方民选官员的担忧，他们说他们深感忧虑，因为大规模侵犯公民权利的舞台已经搭建好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. You know, we've heard from local elected officials who say they're deeply concerned that the stage is set for widespread civil rights violations.</p>

一位官员: 我们索马里社区的绝大多数人都是公民。所以他攻击的不仅仅是索马里人。他攻击的是索马里裔美国人。他攻击的是美国人。

### 未来展望：欺诈与仇外言论的交织

Natalie: Ernesto，那么你描述的明尼苏达州围绕最初引发所有这一切的丑闻——欺诈——所发生的反思又如何呢？我的意思是，你说过该州确实开始就这种害怕被视为或被称为种族主义者的恐惧，这种害怕遭到反弹的恐惧，如何导致这个本意良好的系统被彻底腐蚀进行对话。现在这种对话进展如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Ernesto, what about the reckoning that you described happening in Minnesota around the original scandal that prompted all of this, the fraud? I mean, you had said that the state was really starting to have a conversation about how this fear of being perceived as racist or called racist, the fear of a backlash had led to this very well-intentioned system being totally corrupted. Where does that conversation stand now?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 是的，未来几个月这将如何发展，将非常引人入胜。一方面，我们正处于一个没有人能对欺诈是明尼苏达州一个巨大且系统性问题的事实视而不见的时刻。明年将举行州长选举。民主党人**Tim Walz**如果右翼的共和党挑战者成功地将欺诈作为竞选的决定性议题，他可能会输掉那场竞选。我认为人们普遍认为需要系统性变革，需要强有力的保障措施。而且我认为，我们也在索马里社区中开始看到一种反思，关于这是一个大问题，并且已经造成了严重的认知问题，许多人现在正在为此付出代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's going to be fascinating to watch how this unfolds in the months ahead. You know, on the one hand, we're in a moment where nobody can turn a blind eye to the fact that fraud is a huge and systemic problem for Minnesota. There's going to be a governor's election next year. And Tim Walls, who's a Democrat, could lose that race if the people who are challenging him on the right from the Republican party succeed in making fraud the defining issue in the race. I think there's broad agreement that you need systemic change and that you need strong safeguards. And I think also we're starting to see a reckoning among people in the Somali community about the fact that this is a big problem and has created a significant perception issue that many people are now paying the price for.</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 但就在明尼苏达州似乎准备好开始就种族问题进行更坦诚和建设性的对话，甚至只是谈论索马里人对这些欺诈案件负有主要责任的事实之际。现在，它已经被关于移民的辩论和我们从总统那里听到的仇外言论所冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But just as you know, Minnesota seemed ready to start having a more frank and constructive conversation about race and even to just talk about the fact that Somali were largely responsible for these cases of fraud. It's now been bulldozed by the debate over immigration and the xenophobic rhetoric that we're hearing from the president.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right?</p>
</details>

Ernesto: 要将这两个问题分开将非常困难。我认为未来几个月可能会发生的务实变革，将很难与国家政治脱钩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's going to be really hard to disentangle these two issues. And I think the pragmatic change that you know will likely happen in the months ahead is going to be really hard to divorce from the national politics.</p>

### 其他新闻

Natalie: 以下是您今天还需要知道的其他新闻。周三，特朗普总统宣布了一项计划，旨在削弱数千万辆新车和轻型卡车的燃油效率要求，称其为“骗局”。这是他最新一次旨在削弱拜登政府为应对气候变化而实施的燃油限制的举动。特朗普表示，燃油效率要求使得汽车制造商的制造成本过高，也使得美国人购买成本过高。政府声称，新规定将使一辆新车的成本降低1000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, President Trump announced a plan to weaken fuel efficiency requirements for tens of millions of new cars and light trucks, calling them a scam. It was his latest move to gut fuel restrictions put in place by the Biden administration to help address climate change. Trump said the efficiency requirements made cars too costly for automakers to build and too expensive for Americans to buy. The administration claimed the new rules would shave $1,000 off the cost of a new car.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 此外，根据一份定于周四发布的报告，五角大楼代理监察长表示，国防部长**Pete Hgsith**今年早些时候在使用私人通讯应用讨论军事计划时，冒着危及美国军队的风险。五角大楼的内部调查集中在Hgsith在**Signal**（Signal: 一款加密通讯应用）群聊中的角色，他在其中与其他特朗普高级官员讨论了也门的紧急打击行动。该群聊之所以公开，是因为一名记者被错误地添加到了群组中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in a report that's scheduled to be released on Thursday, the Pentagon's acting inspector general said that defense secretary Pete Hgsith risked endangering American troops earlier this year when he used a private messaging app to discuss military plans. The Pentagon's internal inquiry centered on Hexath's role in a group chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, where he discussed imminent strikes in Yemen with other senior Trump officials. The chat became public because a journalist was added to the group by mistake.</p>
