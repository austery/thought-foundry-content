### 美伊紧张局势升级

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Rachel Abrams，这里是《每日》节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 数周以来，**美国**一直在**伊朗**周边集结庞大的军事力量，尽管两国谈判代表计划在本周晚些时候会晤，希望能为不断升级的紧张局势找到外交出路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: For weeks, the United States has been building up an enormous military presence around Iran, even as negotiators from both countries plan to meet later this week in the hopes of finding a diplomatic off-ramp to the escalating tensions.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 现在，随着**总统特朗普**发出潜在攻击的信号，我们的同事**David Sanger**解释了总统希望通过军事行动达成什么，以及他为何选择此刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Now, as President Trump signals a potential attack, our colleague David Sanger explains what the president hopes to achieve through military action and why he's chosen this moment.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 现在是 2 月 24 日，星期二。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: It's Tuesday, February 24th.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: David Sanger，欢迎回到《每日》节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: David Sanger, welcome back to the Daily.

</details>

**David Sanger**: Rachel，很高兴能和你一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Rachel, great to be with you.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 上次我们在节目中谈论伊朗时，正值一场残酷镇压反政府抗议者之际，他们当时正在抗议这个政权。那时，一个巨大的疑问是美国是否会采取某种军事行动。显然，那并没有发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The last time we talked about Iran on the show, we were in the middle of this brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters who were protesting the regime. And at the time, there was a huge question about whether the United States would take some kind of military action. That obviously did not happen.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 但在接下来的几周里，我们看到该地区出现了大规模的军事集结。那么，David，你能否先描述一下这次集结是什么样的，以及我们对此刻究竟发生了什么有什么了解？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: But in the weeks since, we have seen this massive military buildup in the region. So, David, can you just start by describing what that buildup looks like and what we understand about what exactly is going on in this moment?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嗯，Rachel，这次集结是自 2003 年**伊拉克**战争前夕以来，我们在**中东**地区看到的规模最大的集结。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, Rachel, the buildup is the largest we've seen in the Middle East since the run-up to the war in Iraq in 2003.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Wow.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 该地区有两艘航空母舰，**亚伯拉罕·林肯号**和**杰拉尔德·R·福特号**，后者刚从**委内瑞拉**返回。还有战斗机、空中加油能力、轰炸机。它们都在从约旦到我们该地区所有基地的位置上就位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: There are two aircraft carriers in the region, the Abraham Lincoln and the Gerald R. Ford, which has come back from Venezuela. There are fighter jets, refueling capability, bombers. They are all taking up positions from Jordan all through our bases in the region.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 与此同时，还有一项外交轨道正在进行中。周四，我们预计伊朗人将与两位主要的美国谈判代表，呃，**Steve Witoff**和**Jared Kushner**会面，提交一份可能满足特朗普总统要求的方案。但总统已经明确表示，他正在考虑从对伊朗进行有限打击到可能进行更大规模的军事行动，后者可能持续数天或数周。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And meanwhile, there's the last gasp of a diplomatic track underway. On Thursday, we expect that the Iranians will be meeting with the two main American negotiators, uh, Steve Witoff and Jared Kushner, to present a package that might satisfy President Trump's demands. But the president has made clear that he is thinking of everything from a limited strike on Iran to what could be a much larger military action that could take days or weeks.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你提到总统提出了要求。那些要求具体是什么？比如美国现在想要什么，以及他们试图通过这些谈判或任何潜在的军事行动来实现什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: You mentioned that the president has made demands. What are those demands exactly? Like what does the United States want right now and what are they trying to achieve either through these talks or through any kind of potential military action?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你知道，这个问题有点模糊。通常，当总统遇到这种情况时，他们会很清楚自己要寻求什么，但在这种情况下，总统一直不明确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: You know, there's a bit of a murkiness on this issue. Usually, when presidents get to a situation like this, they're pretty clear about what it is they are seeking, but in this case, the president has not been clear.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 总统为我们可能看到的军事行动提供了一系列令人眼花缭乱的理由。唐纳德·特朗普敦促伊朗人继续抗议，他说：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The president's offered a dizzying array of rationale for the military action that we may see. Donald Trump is urging Iranians to keep protesting, saying,

</details>

**Donald Trump**: “如果伊朗开枪并暴力杀死和平抗议者，这是他们的惯例，美利坚合众国将前来救援。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Donald Trump**: "If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue."

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了支持抗议者。当然，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He's talked about supporting the protesters. Of course,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我们谈到了**哈马斯**，我们也谈到了裁军。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: we talked about Hamas and we talked about disarmament.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了停止支持像**真主党**和哈马斯这样的代理人。没有什么比伊朗领导人 renouncing 恐怖分子、停止威胁邻国、停止资助其武装代理人更能造福这个世界了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He's talked about cutting off support for the proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. There's nothing that would do more good for this part of the world than for Iran's leaders to renounce terrorists, stop threatening their neighbors, quit funding their militant proxies. And

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了摧毁伊朗的导弹能力，那些能够打到**以色列**的导弹。这些都是常规武器，但它们对美国的一个主要盟友构成了巨大威胁。然后，当然，还有他不断回归的一个重要原因。在中东，如果他们拥有核武器，就无法实现和平。他们不能拥有核武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: he's talked about taking out Iran's missile capability, the missiles that can reach Israel. These are all conventional weapons, but they pose a big threat to a major American ally. And then, of course, there's the one big reason he keeps returning to. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon. And they can't have a nuclear weapon.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 而那正是针对伊朗的**核计划**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And that is going after the remnants of Iran's nuclear portfolio.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我希望他们不要再次试图建造，因为如果他们这样做，我们将别无选择，只能非常迅速地根除这种建设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: I hope they're not trying to build up again because if they are, we're going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 核计划，我们应该提到，总统之前曾声称美国在夏天已经将其全部摧毁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The nuclear portfolio, we should mention, which the president had previously claimed that the US had wiped out back in the summer.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 是的，Rachel。你知道，让我们回顾一下，你可能还记得，六月份以色列对伊朗发动了一场为期 12 天的战争，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That's right, Rachel. And you know, just to wind back the clock for a moment, you may remember that in June there was a 12-day war that the Israelis initiated against Iran,

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: right?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 那是以美国袭击伊朗已建立数十年的三个主要核浓缩设施而告终的。这三个设施只有美国空军拥有能够深入地下并试图摧毁它们的能力，使用的是**钻地炸弹**。在这样做过程中，他们最终将伊朗的浓缩铀库存掩埋在瓦砾之下，这些铀的纯度仅差一点就能制造核武器。需要明确的是，在美国进行了整个行动后，现在还剩下什么可以进行某种军事打击？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And that it ended with a US attack on the three major nuclear enrichment sites that Iran has built up over the decades. And these were three sites that only the US Air Force had the capability with bunker busters to get down deep enough to try to destroy. And in the course of doing that, they ended up burying under the rubble Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium that was enriched to a purity just shy of what you would need to make a nuclear weapon. And just to be clear, after the US conducted that whole campaign, what would be left now to hit through some kind of military action?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯，还有目标。伊朗制造核离心机的地点，那些以超音速旋转并生产铀的机器。你可以摧毁其中一些目标。David，上次美国对伊朗采取军事行动时，是以色列的密切协调下进行的，以色列显然是我们该地区最大的盟友。他们对伊朗的核武器和导弹计划深感担忧。我们对以色列此次的介入了解多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Well, there are still targets. There are places where the Iranians have made nuclear centrifuges, the machines that spin at at supersonic speeds and produce uranium. You could wipe out some of those targets. David, the last time that the United States took a military action against Iran, it was in close coordination with Israel, which is obviously our biggest ally in the region. They have grave concerns about Iran's nuclear and missile programs. What do we know about Israel's involvement this time around?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嗯，我们知道**总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**一直与特朗普总统频繁通话。他大约两周前来访，从那次会谈中泄露出来的一点信息表明，以色列政府非常担心美国没有足够重视导弹问题。正是那些能够打到以色列的导弹，上次穿透了导弹防御系统，击中了平民目标并造成了以色列人死亡。同时，总统身边也有一些人，包括**国会**中的伊朗强硬派，他们说：“你现在不会再有机会了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, we know that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been talking frequently to President Trump. He came for a visit about two weeks ago and what little leaked out from that session indicated that the Israeli government was quite concerned that the US wasn't paying enough attention to the missiles. And it's the missiles that can reach Israel that actually pierced the missile defenses last time and struck some civilian targets and killed some Israelis. And you know, at the same time, the president has got some people in his ear, including Iran hardliners in Congress saying, "You will never have an opportunity like you've got right now."

</details>

**David Sanger**: **伊朗**和**阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊**从未如此虚弱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That Iran and Ayatollah Hami have never been weaker.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他们经济上已经走投无路了。街头有抗议活动。人们厌倦了他们的政府和周围的压迫。而且，自六月战争以来，他们在军事上从未完全恢复。抓住这个时机，将他们推下悬崖。所以总统可能在心里盘算着抓住这个时机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: They're economically on the ropes. There are protests in the streets. People are sick of their government and the repression surrounding it. and that after the war in June they have never fully recovered militarily. Just take the moment to push them over the cliff. So the president may have in the back of his mind a great desire to seize the moment.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 但同时，这是有风险的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: But at the same time this is risky business.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这是一个拥有 9000 万人口的国家。他们不仅有能力用导弹反击，还有一个遍布欧洲的恐怖网络，并在一定程度上显示出在**美国**境内运作的能力。他们还有强大的网络能力。所以，这几乎不能保证会像六月份你们袭击核设施那样，是一场一夜之间的袭击。伊朗人很可能做出回应。美国随后升级。伊朗人随后升级，你们就会陷入一场比任何人希望在中东看到的冲突都要大的冲突。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: This is a country of 90 million people. They have considerable ability not only to strike back with missiles, but with a terror network that runs throughout Europe and to some degree has shown some capability to operate inside the United States. They've got significant cyber capabilities as well. So, it's hardly guaranteed that this is going to be a like one night attack like you saw in June when they went after the nuclear sites. It's very possible that the Iranians could respond. The US then escalates. The Iranians then escalate and you're into a bigger conflict than anyone wants to see happen in the Middle East.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 好的。所以，听起来总统身边现在有很多人的意见。有内塔尼亚胡。有国会的伊朗鹰派。但有一件事我认为一直非常重要，至少自一月份的抗议活动以来，那就是政权更迭，以及你提到的许多目标，这些目标是政府现在可能正在考虑的，可能会导致政权更迭，这取决于他们采取何种军事行动。这是计算的一部分吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Okay. So, it sounds like there are a lot of people in the president's ear right now. There's Netanyahu. There are the Iran hawks in Congress. But one thing that I think has been very top of mind, at least since the protests in January, is regime change and how a lot of these goals that you mentioned that the administration could be considering right now could lead to that depending on what kind of military action they take. Is that part of the calculation here?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我们必须假设这是计算中最重要的部分之一，但事实是，总统已经停止了仅仅停留在这一点上。当这个话题与国务卿**Marco Rubio**以及一些参议员的证词在上次会议上被提及时，他说：“嗯，这将是大事，而且很复杂，我们必须仔细考虑它会是什么样子。”嗯，现在才得出我们需要仔细考虑这个结论，有点晚了。事实是，美国政府几十年来一直在考虑伊朗的政权更迭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: We have to assume that it's one of the biggest parts of the calculation, but the fact of the matter is the president has stopped just short of that. And when the topic came up with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and some Senate testimony last month, he said, "Well, this would be big and complicated and we'd have to give a lot of thought to what that would look like." Well, a little late to come to the conclusion we have to think that through. The fact of the matter is the government of the United States has been thinking about regime change in Iran for decades.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Right?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 那么，这里有几个大问题，Rachel。第一个是，你能通过空袭实现政权更迭吗？目前还不清楚这是否一定有效。第二，如果有效，有什么保证新上台的政府会比美国更友好？它可能只是另一个压迫性政权。当然，另一个风险是，这可能会升级为一场更大的地区冲突，如果伊朗人决定政权处于危险之中，他们将全力反击，这将是完全可以理解的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So, there are a couple of big questions here, Rachel. The first is, can you bring about regime change with an air campaign? It's not clear at all that that's necessarily going to work. Second, if it does work, what's the assurance that the government that would come in would be any friendlier to the United States? It could just be another repressive regime. And the other risk, of course, is that this could just escalate into a much larger regional conflict, which would be entirely understandable if the Iranians decided that the regime was at risk and they were going to throw everything into the retaliation.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: We'll be right back.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: David，当我们想到对伊朗的潜在军事打击以及它可能意味着的政权更迭时，我当然会想起美国最近在**委内瑞拉**采取的行动，当时他们推翻了总统**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**。我的感觉是，至少这真的让其他国家在面对美国压力时坐直了腰板。所以，我想知道这是否与美国此刻与伊朗的互动有关？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: David, when we think about a potential military strike in Iran and what that might mean for regime change, I am of course reminded about the recent action that the US took in Venezuela when it removed the president Nicholas Maduro. My sense is at least that that really caused other countries to sit up a little straighter in the face of US pressure. And so I wonder whether that is coming into play here at all with how the US is interacting with Iran in this moment.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嗯，Rachel，我认为这绝对是计算的一部分。我的意思是，首先，这与这里的炮舰外交有相似之处，对吧？你集结一支海军舰队在海岸线上，你提出一系列要求。如果要求未被满足，你就动用军事力量迫使该国按照你想要的方式改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, Rachel, I think it's definitely part of the calculation. I mean, first of all, there is a just overall similarity to the gunboat diplomacy here, right? You mass a naval fleet off a country's coast. You issue a set of demands. And if the demands are not met, you then use that military force to compel the country to change the way you want it to change.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但这里也有真正的区别，因为在委内瑞拉，这是一次非常有针对性的行动。他们瞄准的是一个人，马杜罗。当他们把他弄出来送往布鲁克林拘留中心时，他们让他的其余政府成员完全留在原位。但在伊朗，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But there's also a real difference here as well because in Venezuela, it was a very targeted operation. They were aiming for one guy, Maduro. And when they pulled him out of there and sent him off to the Brooklyn detention center, they left the rest of his government fully in place. In Iran,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 似乎那种模式不太可能奏效。首先，这是一个大得多的国家。有 9000 万人口。其次，它复杂得多。它武装得更好。它拥有马杜罗从未有过的防空能力。它的人民可能会接受推翻政府，但他们也对**CIA**在 20 世纪 50 年代试图发动政变的努力怀有痛苦的回忆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: it seems very unlikely that that model would work. First of all, it's a much larger country. It's 90 million people. Second, it's a lot more complex. It's a lot better armed. It's got air defenses that Maduro never had. It's got a population that may go along with the removal of the government, but also has bitter memories of CIA efforts to bring about coups in Iran in the 1950s.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 最后，如果美国成功了，还不清楚你是否能像在委内瑞拉那样保留现有政府。你必须摧毁由**伊斯兰革命卫队**运营的整个结构。你必须消灭几乎所有那些忠于**阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊**的人。所以，还不清楚你是否会有合适的人来管理国家并回应美国的这些要求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And finally, if the US was successful, it's not clear that you could leave the existing government in place the way they have in Venezuela. You'd have to take out that entire structure run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. You'd have to eliminate almost all of those loyalists to Ayatollah Hominee. So it's not clear that you would have someone in place to go run the country and to respond to those American demands.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 好的。那么，考虑到在伊朗采取军事行动将极其复杂，美国实际上正在考虑的更“有限”的打击会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Okay. So given the fact that a military action would be extremely complicated in Iran, what would a more quote unquote limited strike look like that the United States is actually considering?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这是个好问题，因为有各种各样的目标。他们可以针对**巴斯基**，也就是那些用来镇压抗议者的当地民兵组织。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: It's a good question because there are all kinds of targets. They could go after the besiege, which is the local militia groups that have been used to put down the protesters.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这样至少总统可以兑现他的承诺。他们可以针对伊斯兰革命卫队。你可能还记得，在 2020 年，在他的第一个任期内，特朗普总统下令无人机袭击了伊朗最精锐的军事部门**圣城旅**的头目，并成功将其击毙。所以你可以想象更多针对伊斯兰革命卫队领导层的袭击。你可以想象袭击仅限于那些导弹和导弹基地以及以色列最担心的发射器。但所有这些大多只能获得战术优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That way at least the president could say he's making good on his commitment. They could go after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. And you may remember that back in 2020 in his first term, President Trump ordered a drone strike on the head of the Kuds force, the most elite part of the Iranian military, and managed to kill him. So you could imagine more attacks on the leadership of the IRGC. You could imagine attacks that were just limited to those missiles and missile sites and the launchers that Israel's most worried about. But all of those would gain mostly a tactical advantage.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 如果政府不改变，军事领导人会被替换。最终，伊朗会制造更多导弹或购买它们。所以真正的问题是，你只是在“割草坪”，还是在带来真正的改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: If the government didn't change, the military leaders will get replaced. Eventually, Iran will build more missiles or buy them. So the real question is, are you just mowing the lawn or are you bringing about real change?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 伊朗对这一切或其中任何一部分有多担心？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: How concerned is Iran about all of this or any of this?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嗯，Rachel，伊朗人已经说得很清楚，他们非常担心。我的意思是，首先，我们看到他们在掩埋和加固一些与核相关的地点或疑似核相关地点，这些地点在六月份没有被击中。其次，他们已将相当数量的导弹和其他武器转移到边境地区，以便更容易打到美国基地或以色列，以此表明如果他们受到攻击，他们将进行反击。第三，**阿亚图拉·哈梅内伊**（他 86 岁，本应有继任计划）采取了奇怪的行动，但正如我们在《泰晤士报》报道的那样，他最近加深了这些计划。所以，最高领袖显然意识到美国可能要推翻政权，他想要一份保险单来对抗这一切。这些是我们以前从未真正见过伊朗人采取的准备措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, Rachel, the Iranians have made it pretty clear they're deeply concerned. I mean, first of all, we've seen them burying and reinforcing some nuclear related sites or suspected nuclear- related sites that hadn't been hit back in June. Second, they've moved a good number of their missiles and other arms to the borders where they could more easily reach American bases or Israel to make the point that they're going to get some shots off if they get attacked. Thirdly, there's the strange action by Ayatollah Hami, who is 86 years old and presumably has some succession plans anyway, but as we've reported in the Times, he's deepened those in recent times. So, the Supreme Leader is clearly aware that the US may be going for regime change and he wants an insurance policy against that. These are all the kind of preparations we've not really seen the Iranians take at this level before.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 同时，当然，还有外交谈判。目前正在考虑哪种“下车道”，如果有的话，以便我们不看到这种升级？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: At the same time though, of course, there are these diplomatic talks. What kind of off-ramp, if any, is being considered right now so that we do not see this kind of escalation?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嗯，谈判受到了一些阻碍，因为美国要求禁止铀浓缩。换句话说，要求伊朗完全退出核燃料制造业务。有一个有趣的提议是，允许伊朗拥有非常有限的浓缩能力，纯粹用于医疗和医学研究相关目的。这带有一种良好的人道主义色彩。这基本上是允许伊朗生产一种小型研究反应堆的燃料，该反应堆自 1967 年以来就一直在伊朗，当时，历史的巨大讽刺之一是，美国将这个反应堆赠予了伊朗国王。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, the talks have been stymied a bit by the problem that the US is demanding that there is no uranium enrichment. In other words, that Iran get completely out of the business of making any nuclear fuel. And there's an interesting idea that's been floated, which is to allow the Iranians to have a very limited enrichment capability purely for medical and medical research related purposes. It's got a nice humanitarian tone to it. It would be basically allowing the Iranians to produce fuel for a small research reactor that's been in Tran since 1967 when in one of those great ironies of history, the United States gave the reactor to the Sha of Iran.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 它主要用于生产药物。对癌症治疗等很有用。这将允许伊朗人说：“我们仍在浓缩。”并允许美国说：“我们已经停止了他们所有的核武器活动。”但尚不清楚伊朗人是否会放弃如此大的能力。也不清楚特朗普总统是否会接受任何形式的任何目的的持续浓缩。考虑到这一切，David，有没有可能我们看到的军事集结并非外交的替代品，而是总统用来加强其外交手腕的手段？比如，他是否可能利用军事行动的威胁作为筹码，在下周的会谈中推动外交解决方案？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And it's used mostly for production of pharmaceuticals. It's useful for cancer treatments and so forth. And this would allow the Iranians to say, "We're still enriching." And allow the United States to say, "We've stopped all their nuclear weapons activity." But it's not clear the Iranians will give up that much capability. And it's not clear that President Trump would accept any continued enrichment of any kind for any purpose. Given all of that, David, is it possible that the military buildup that we've seen is not necessarily an alternative to diplomacy, but actually something that the president is using to sort of strengthen his hand diplomatically? Like, could he be using this threat of the military action as leverage to push for a diplomatic solution at the talks later this week?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这非常有可能。这就是炮舰外交中的外交部分。当然，反过来说，Rachel，如果你花费了数亿甚至数十亿美元在某国海岸集结了一支庞大的军队，那么使用它的诱惑力就会非常大。如果他真正的目标是政权更迭，那么他可能并不真正对外交解决方案感兴趣，因为外交解决方案只会巩固现有政权。它将继续存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: It's very possible. That's the diplomacy part of gunboat diplomacy. Of course, the flip side of that, Rachel, is if you have spent hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars assembling a huge force off a country's coast, the temptation to go use that is extraordinarily high. And if his real goal here is regime change, then he may not really be that interested in a diplomatic solution because a diplomatic solution would, if anything, bolster the existing regime. It would remain in place.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 让我们退一步看，美国多年来一直将伊朗视为威胁。所以一方面，它继续成为一个优先事项是有道理的。但另一方面，在特朗普的第二个任期内，美国确实制定了我们节目中经常谈到的势力范围的世界观。即大国可以划分世界，并认为其中一部分属于自己的管辖范围。我们从美国方面看到，这意味着西半球。所以，我想知道你觉得中东在这个世界观中处于什么位置。

<details>

**Rachel Abrams**: Just to take a step back here, the United States has viewed Iran as a threat for many, many years. So on the one hand, it makes sense that it would continue to be a priority. But on the other hand, during the second Trump administration, the United States has really kind of laid out this worldview of spheres of influence, which we've talked about a lot on the show. The idea that the great powers can carve up the world and consider sections of it to be under their own purview. We've seen from the US side that that has meant the Western Hemisphere. So, I wonder where you feel like the Middle East fits into that worldview.

**David Sanger**: Rachel，你说得完全正确。这与总统 11 月份发布的国家安全战略并不完全吻合。一方面，正如你所暗示的，美国总统几十年来一直在反对伊朗及其核计划。自 1979 年伊朗革命后发生的伊朗人质危机以来，美国一直在破坏伊朗的核计划。多年来，它对伊朗的核基础设施发动了一些历史上最复杂的网络攻击。所以，一直以来都有一个持续的努力来阻止伊朗获得核武器的那一天。如果你从这个角度来看，那么特朗普总统今天所做的就是升级和扩大了跨越民主党和共和党政府的长期美国政策。

**David Sanger**: Rachel, you're exactly right. This does not fit comfortably into the president's national security strategy that came out in November. On the one hand, as you suggest, American presidents have been pushing back on Iran and the Iranian nuclear program for decades. Ever since the Iran hostage crisis, right, which came right after the Iranian revolution in 1979, the United States has sabotaged the Iranian nuclear program. Over the years, it's mounted some of the most sophisticated cyber attacks in history against Iran's nuclear infrastructure. So, there's always been a consistent effort to push back the day when Iran could get a nuclear weapon. And if you view it that way, then President Trump in what he's doing today is escalating and expanding what has been a long running American policy across Democratic and Republican administrations.

**David Sanger**: 但如果你从他的国家安全战略的角度来看，嗯，伊朗并不完全在西半球，对吧？所以他可能只是看到了一个机会，来对付一个长期的对手，而这个对手正经历着显著的军事、经济和政治弱点。我认为这才是真正发生的事情。伊朗人现在并不处于能够攻击我们的位置，对吧？他们的核计划已经被掩埋了。他们的经济濒临崩溃。他们不会主动去挑起与美国的冲突。

**David Sanger**: But if you view it in the context of his national security strategy, well, Iran isn't exactly in the Western Hemisphere, right? And so he may just be seeing a moment to deal with a longtime adversary that is going through a period of remarkable military, economic, and political weakness. And I think that's really what's happening here. It's not as if the Iranians are in a position right now to attack us, right? Their nuclear program has been buried. Their economy is at a point of near collapse. They are not about to go out of their way to pick a conflict with the US.

**David Sanger**: 相反，总统可能正在参与法律和外交历史学家所说的**预防性战争**。一场我们强大、对手虚弱的战争，所以我们要现在就打击他们，因为我们有机会。在国际法理论中，这被认为是非法使用武力。这可能不会阻止总统。总统可能认为他将作为那个解决美国与伊朗自 1979 年以来长期冲突的人而载入史册。但如果总统决定在未来几天或几周内采取军事行动，我怀疑历史学家会将这一刻视为一场**选择的战争**，而非**必要的战争**。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Instead, the president might be engaging in what legal and diplomatic historians call a preventive war. A war where we are strong, our adversary is weak, and so we're going to hit them now because we've got a good chance. That is in international just war theory considered to be an illegal use of force. That may not stop the president. The president may believe that he'll go down in history as the one who solved America's long running conflict with Iran that goes back to 1979. But if the president decides to take military action in the next few days or weeks, I suspect that historians will look back at this moment as a war of choice, not a war of necessity.
