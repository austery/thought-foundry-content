title: DoorDash CEO徐迅达：从美国梦到全球配送巨头，一位创业者的成长与思考
---

### 美国梦的缩影：一位创业者的非凡旅程

今天，我与**DoorDash**（DoorDash: 美国最大的第三方外卖平台）的首席执行官徐迅达（Tony Xu）坐在一起。他的人生经历非常令人惊叹：年幼时从中国来到美国，努力工作，做过各种各样的工作，最终考入**斯坦福**（Stanford: 位于美国加利福尼亚州的私立研究型大学），创立了这家令人难以置信的公司，如今它已成为美国最大的食品配送公司，并即将征服世界，创造了数十亿美元的财富，其中大部分用于慈善事业。可以说，我正坐在一个活生生的“**美国梦**”（American Dream: 指通过努力工作、勇气和决心，在美国取得成功和繁荣的信念）面前。

<p class="english-text">Today, I'm here with Tony Xu. Pretty amazing, actually, you came from China really young, worked very hard, did all kinds of jobs, you know, got to Stanford, started, you know, this incredible company which is now kind of the biggest food delivery company in America, about to conquer the world, made billions, gave lots of them away in philanthropy. I mean, basically, I'm sitting here in front of the American dream. What are your reflections about your journey?</p>
</details>

我认为，预测事情会如何发展是不可能的。回顾这些经历，我发现这只能是倒叙的故事。当我七岁时割草坪，试图攒钱买**任天堂**（Nintendo: 日本著名的电子游戏公司）游戏或**打鸭子**（Duck Hunt: 任天堂公司于1984年推出的一款光枪射击游戏），或者在我母亲的餐馆里洗碗时，我不可能预测到后来会发生什么。但这正说明了，如果你专注于某事，努力工作，并获得一些运气，事情可能会变得多么不可思议。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I, I, I think that it's impossible to predict how things go for you, you know, as you think about these things. I think it's, you know, as you recounted that list of experiences, it's only one that can be told backwards. It's not one that when I was, you know, mowing lawns and at the age of seven trying to save up money for Nintendo games or Duck Hunts, uh, or washing dishes in my Mom's restaurant, could I have predicted what would have happened later on. But I think it's just, you know, how incredible, you know, can can be if you you know, put your mind to things, work hard, and get lucky.</p>
</details>

### 早年经历：独立、适应与家庭的奋斗

我可能没有很多人那么努力，但我非常幸运。努力工作无疑是我家族的传统。这真的源于我的父母：他们都来到美国，在我五岁时把我从中国带到伊利诺伊州。我很少见到他们，不是因为疏忽，而是因为他们努力维持生计。我们来到美国时银行里只有250美元。我父亲在攻读**PhD**（Doctor of Philosophy: 哲学博士，一种高级学术学位）期间是一名全职服务员，而我母亲在12年里每天打三份工，才攒够钱去实现她一直想做的事情——开一家医疗诊所。我的家人花了一段时间才在美国站稳脚跟，但多亏了他们，我才能享受他们劳动成果，开辟自己的道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How hard have you worked? Probably not as hard as as as as a lot of people, but um, now I've been very fortunate, you know, I, I, I, I think that working hard certainly is something that has um, always really been in my family. I mean, I think this really comes from my parents, right? Both of them came to the US, um, brought me from China to Illinois when I was five, and you know, I really didn't get to see them that much, not because of neglect or anything, but because they were trying to put food on the table. We came to the US with $250 in the bank, and my dad was a full-time waiter as he was getting his PhD. My mom was working three jobs a day for, you know, 12 years before she actually can save up enough money to, you know, practice what she always wanted to do, which was open up a medical clinic. But it took a while for her family to kind of get our foundation and footing in the US, but you know, thanks to them, I got to, you know, really live off of the fruits of their labor, and um, you know, carve out my own path.</p>
</details>

这种通过努力奋斗而成功的经历对抱负有什么影响？我认为它可能产生多种影响。有时，当你成长在一个看不到太多出路或无法改善现状的环境中时，这可能会有些打击士气。但同时，我认为它也赋予你很大的独立性。我小时候大部分时间都是独自一人度过的。我通过打篮球和看电视学会了英语。我给自己取名托尼，是受电视剧《谁是老板》（Who's the Boss）中托尼·丹扎（Tony Danza）的启发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what do you think, what do you think it does to ambitions to come from kind of, uh, you know, to work to work one's way up like that? I think it can have multiple effects, you know, I think sometimes when you grow up in a situation where you don't necessarily see a lot of outs or a lot of ways to progress your current situation, that can be somewhat demotivating. But at the same time, I think, um, you know, it also gives you a lot of independence. You know, when I was a kid, I spent most of the time by myself, right? I learned English by playing basketball and watching TV. You know, I named myself Tony after Tony Danza, you know, from who's the boss.</p>
</details>

是的，这是你主动做的。没有人能念出我的中文名字，所以……但这种早期的独立性让我学会了如何做出好的和坏的决定。它让我置身于需要非常**敏捷**（Agile: 指在快速变化的环境中，通过迭代和适应性方法来应对挑战的能力）的环境中，去适应任何情况。我小时候经常转学，因为我的父母总是努力改善我们的经济状况，这样我就可以上更好的学校。在小学到中学期间，我大概转了四五次学校。因此，这些经历并没有大幅提升我的抱负，但它确实在很小的时候就培养了我独立思考的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and that you did on your own initiative. Found extraordinary. Well, nobody could pronounce my name, you know, nobody could pronounce my Chinese name, that is. And so, but but you know, from from being independent, you know, early on, um, you know, I learned both about good good decisions and and bad decisions, right? And I think, um, it put me in environments where I had to be quite agile, um, you know, to to adapt to whatever the circumstances. I I changed schools a lot when I was a kid growing up because my parents were always trying to progress our economic situation so that I can attend better schools. I moved probably four or five schools in my, you know, Elementary to middle school years, um, and as a result, I think of those experiences, it it it it wasn't as if like it increased massively my levels of ambition, but it's certainly increased the practice at a very young age for independent thinking.</p>
</details>

转学意味着什么？我们从一些首席执行官那里听说，他们经常搬家，这有助于他们的敏捷性等等。你对此有何看法？我认为这很艰难，尤其是在你很小的时候。但回顾过去，它几乎总是让你体会到作为**局外人**（Outsider: 指不属于某个群体或社区的人）或**弱势群体**（Underdog: 指在竞争中处于劣势或被低估的一方）的感觉。在你成为“圈内人”之前，你总是在“圈外”，无论是建立友谊，还是进入学校内部的某些特权圈子。对我来说，它教会了我每一次互动都有价值。你可以和那些不幸以青少年怀孕闻名的学校的人成为朋友，也可以和那些以天才儿童闻名的学校的人成为朋友，或者介于两者之间。因此，这只是加快了我学习的速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first of all, what do you think it's uh, what do you think it means to change schools and we we we hear that from C from some various CEOs that they moved quite a bit, they talk about it uh, as helping their agility and so on. What what are your what what is your view on that? Well, I think it's pretty tough, you know, to to to to know this when you're you know, a very young person, um, but you know, I guess looking backwards, it almost always made you appreciate feeling like what it meant to be the outsider, um, or the underdog if you will, right? You're always in the out Community before you can become a member of the in community in terms of you know, gaining friendship or you know, getting privileged to certain circles inside the school, um, but I I I I think it you know, for me, it taught me that, you know, there's value in every interaction that you can be friends with people in a school that's known for teen pregnancy sadly or a school that's known for gifted children or everything in between, and I think as a result of that, it just increased the rate at which I learned probably I I don't think I intentionally knew this when I was a child, um, but whether it was, you know, playing lots of basketball or doing lots of math and um, you know, I got to play in different spheres and I think, you know, probably develop in a way that was, you know, quite healthy, um, it, you know, again, showed me the value of interaction, every interaction, um, that there is a superpower in everybody, uh, and to look for that, and I think if you can do that collectively, you can do great things.</p>
</details>

### 从学术到商业的转折

在进入斯坦福之前，你有哪些重要的经历？我记得成年后的第一个重要时刻是大学毕业，当时我的专业是数学，我想成为一名**癌症研究员**（Cancer researcher: 专门从事癌症研究的科学家或医生）。因此，我在实验室做了很多工作，从事数学和生物学交叉领域的研究。当时这是一个相当年轻的领域，大概只有二三十年的历史。今天，我认为它已经相当先进，特别是随着**大型语言模型**（Large Language Models, LLMs: 一种基于深度学习的人工智能模型，能够理解和生成人类语言）、计算和人工智能的最新发展。但那时，它才刚刚起步。我以为我会继续从事这项工作，攻读研究生，等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What were the important steps before you started as Stanford? Well, one of the first moments I I remember in adulthood is really graduating from college where my background was in math. I wanted to be a cancer researcher and so I did lots of work in Labs, um, where the work was done at the intersection of mathematics and biology, you know, it was a fairly young field at the time, maybe 20 to 30 years old or something like that. Today, I I I think it's quite Advanced especially with the recent developments in large language models, compute, AI, um, but back then I I I think it was it was just kind of in its Inception or its formation, um, and I thought I was going to do that and and and and do and pursue graduate step studies and and and all of that jazz, um.</p>
</details>

然而，我的世界在毕业时发生了180度大转弯，我决定不开始我已经获得录取的**研究生项目**（Graduate program: 指大学本科毕业后继续深造的课程或学位项目），而是转向了一个我毫无经验的商业世界。为什么会这样？在一次录取周末活动中，我可以参观我将要加入的实验室，我意识到在将成为该实验室成员的四五个学生中，我感觉自己并不是最投入的。对于一个长达12年的旅程，作为一个21岁的年轻人，我决定可能还有其他事情适合我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But my world actually 180d um at graduation where I decided to not um start the graduate program in which I was accepted, um, but instead uh 180 into a world of business which I had no experience in. I had why did that happen? Well, I in one of the um uh admit weekend activities where you get to visit you know, the lab that you would be, you know, a part of, I realized that you know, of the four or five students that would be um members of that lab, I didn't feel the most committed and for something that would be a 12year journey actually that would have been a 12-year Journey, um, as a 21-year-old, um, I, you know, made the decision that I, you know, that there might be something else for me.</p>
</details>

当时这对我来说非常可怕，因为在学术界，有一套相当直接、明确的晋升路径，你可以通过长期专注于某个领域来获得越来越高的专业性，最终做出重大贡献。但对我来说，我选择了当时看来是“少有人走的路”，那就是做一些我以前从未做过的事情。当我大学毕业加入**麦肯锡**（McKinsey: 世界著名的管理咨询公司）时，我记得第一周穿着T恤和牛仔裤去上班，我不明白**商务休闲装**（Business Casual: 一种介于正式商务装和休闲装之间的着装风格）是什么意思。我不知道**微软Excel**（Microsoft Excel: 微软公司开发的一款电子表格软件）是什么，也不知道**PowerPoint**（PowerPoint: 微软公司开发的一款演示文稿软件）是什么。我甚至对“**营收**”（Revenue: 公司在销售商品或提供服务后所获得的总收入）这个词都知之甚少。我的背景更多是在数学和生物学的交叉领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Now that was quite scary for me at the time where I think, you know, for a while, especially in the world of academics, um, it's a fairly straight laced, um, well understood set of progressions that you can take, um, into getting to, you know, greater and greater Specialties where you have to concentrate on an area for a long period of time before, you know, you um, make a large or significant contribution, um, but for me, um, I I took I suppose at the time the path Less Traveled, which was doing something I've never done before, you know, when I joined MacKenzie out of college, I remember showing up um, in the first week in t-shirts and genes and I didn't understand what business casual aware meant, I didn't know what Microsoft Excel was, I didn't know what PowerPoint was, I barely understood the word Revenue, you know, my background was more in the intersection of mathematics and and biology.</p>
</details>

你一定学得很快，做得很好。是的，多亏了那些出色的队友和同事，我确实做到了。但那段经历教会我的是，我认为对我来说，能够去**伯克利**（Berkeley: 加州大学伯克利分校，世界著名的公立研究型大学），在那里完成了我的**本科学习**（Undergraduate studies: 指在大学或学院攻读学士学位的学习阶段），在很多方面，生活已经给予我比其他人多得多的东西，所以我知道我会没事的。我认为这对我形成了一个重要的观点，提醒我，承担更多**风险**（Risk: 指可能导致损失或负面结果的不确定性）可能没关系。而麦肯锡的工作对我来说进展顺利，这进一步证实了我的这种信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You must have learned science, you must have picked this up pretty fast, done well. Yeah, you know, thanks to the awesome teammates and and colleagues I had of I did, but but you know, I think it it what that experience taught me was that I think for me to have gone to Berkeley, which is where I completed my undergraduate studies that in many ways, life had already given me so much more than maybe what it's given some other people that I'm going to be okay, and and I think that had a pretty formative opinion, um, for me in terms of just something to remind me that it's probably okay to take, you know, more risk and the fact that McKenzie actually worked out pretty well for me, um, just, you know, added more confirmation to that bias.</p>
</details>

### 斯坦福的团队协作学习

那么你在斯坦福做了什么？我认为斯坦福是一段奇妙的旅程，让我更多地思考自己，而不是仅仅发展专业技能。我的意思是，一方面，我认为这是一种相当昂贵的时间利用方式，我指的不仅仅是学费或其他类似的东西，而是你有时在20多岁时效率最高，所以那些年对我职业生涯来说是极其昂贵的。但另一方面，我为**商学院**（Business school: 专门提供商业管理教育的学院或大学）设定的目标是思考我想要发展哪些其他类型的技能，以及我真正想做什么，并花一些时间，而不是每天只是努力工作，去弄清楚这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you do at Stanford then? I think Stanford was a fantastic um journey into thinking about actually myself more so than developing necessarily professional skills, and what I mean by that is um, on one hand, I thought it it was a fairly, you know, expensive use of time. I don't necessarily just mean in terms of tuition or or things like this, but you know, you're sometimes your most productive in your 20s, and so those disproportionately expensive years of my career, um, but on the other hand, you know, the thesis that that I had made for Stanford U or or just for business school, I should say in general, um, was really to think, you know, what are what are other types of skills that I want to develop as well as what are um, things that, you know, I I I truly would want to go and do, um, and and and to take, you know, maybe a little bit of time away from just, you know, working hard every single day, um, to actually go and figure that out.</p>
</details>

你当时想获得哪些技能？当我回顾我的旅程时，很多经历，无论是作为**独生子女**（Only child: 指家庭中唯一的孩子）长大，然后经常搬家，还是高中时从伊利诺伊州搬到加利福尼亚州，或者在实验室做研究，或者在麦肯锡或**eBay**（eBay: 美国著名的电子商务平台）担任**分析师**（Analyst: 指对数据、信息或问题进行分析和解释的专业人员），这些工作经历大多是**孤立经历**（Isolated experiences: 指个人独自完成的，缺乏团队协作的经历）或**个人旅程**（Solo Journeys: 指个人独自完成的旅程或项目），我的贡献主要通过我个人所做的工作来衡量。我通过努力工作学到了很多东西，但同时我也认识到，伟大的事情是通过**团队**（Teams: 指为了共同目标而协同工作的一群人）来实现的，而我与他人合作的经验并不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the skills that you wanted to acquire there, what were they? Well, so, you know, when when I thought about my journey, a lot of the journey, whether it's growing up as an only child and then moving around a lot, um, or moving in high school from Illinois to California, um, or um, even working in a lab, you know, in research, most or as working as an analyst at McKenzie or um, or or or or or at eBay, most of those work experiences were um, isolated experiences or or or or very solo Journeys, if you will, where most of my contributions um, were measured by what I individually contributed, right? And and I learned a lot by doing hopefully what was considered great work, um, and and uh, but at the same time, I also learned that great things, you know, get accomplished with teams, and I didn't have that much experience working with other people.</p>
</details>

商学院本身并不能提供这些，但特别是在斯坦福，他们强调与他人良好合作，以及如何激励那些与你不同或激励方式不同的人。这是课程的一个重要卖点，也是我每天都在努力提高的方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now business school, you know, in of itself does not offer that, but you know, particularly at Stanford, there was this emphasis um, that you know, working well with others and figuring out how to motivate, you know, not just people that are similar to you or motivated similarly the way that I'm motivated, um, that was a big, um, selling point of uh, the curriculum, and it's something that uh, I still try to get better at every day.</p>
</details>

### DoorDash的创立与早期挑战

后来你和一些朋友一起创立了当时的**Palo Alto Delivery**（帕洛阿尔托配送），也就是现在的**DoorDash**。你是怎么想到这个主意的？我们聚在一起是因为我们都对**本地商家**（Local businesses: 指在特定地理区域内运营，服务当地社区的企业）充满热情。这是我们每个人的共同主题。很多人都知道我的背景，但如果你看看我的**联合创始人**（Co-founders: 指共同创立一家公司或组织的人）及其家族历史，他们也有小企业经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now then you um, set up with some friends what was then Paulo Alto delivery and now door Dash, how did you come up with that? Yeah, so all of us came together because we were excited about local businesses, that's the motivating theme for each of us, and I know A lot's been told about my background, but if you were to look at the backgrounds of my co-founders and their family histories, you know, they also have experience with small business too.</p>
</details>

我们四个人采访了数百名本地商家，其中一些是**餐馆老板**（Restaurateurs: 指拥有或管理餐馆的人），另一些则销售**零售商品**（Retail items: 指通过零售渠道销售给最终消费者的商品）。有趣的是，当我们请他们展示一天的工作时，我们跟着他们。有一位在帕洛阿尔托大学大道（University Avenue）经营**马卡龙店**（Macaroon shop: 专门销售马卡龙的商店）的面包师，她给我们看了一本她拒绝的配送订单簿。这让我们非常惊讶：首先，你会拒绝顾客付款的意愿；其次，考虑到她是一家**一人商店**（One-person shop: 指由一个人独立经营的商店），这些订单对于支付**工资单**（Payroll: 指公司支付给员工的工资总额）或为企业储备一些额外的**保险金**（Insurance money: 指保险公司在发生保险事故后支付的赔偿金）至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the four of us kind of spoke with hundreds of local business owners, you know, some of these people were restaurant tours, others sold retail items, and it was interesting when we asked them, hey, show us all of what you do in a day that when we followed them around, um, there was this one Baker, um, who ran a macaroon shop on University Avenue in Pal Alto, um, who showed us a booklet of delivery orders she had she had refused which to us was quite surprising, you know, a that you would turn down people wanting to pay you and B the significance of that decision given the fact that she was a oneperson shop and that you know, those orders really were the difference of making payroll or having some extra padded, you know, insurance money, you know, for the business.</p>
</details>

因此，我们从这个发现开始，与更多商家讨论这个问题。令人惊讶的是，在2013年，虽然配送并不是一个新概念，但除了**披萨店**（Pizza places: 专门销售披萨的餐馆）或纽约市等特定城市之外，美国没有人提供配送服务。这在餐馆业是如此，在餐馆以外的领域更是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and so we started um, you know, from that Discovery talking to more businesses about this issue and and and it was surprising this was 2013 that while delivery was not a new idea that no one in America outside of pizza places um, or certain cities like New York City offer delivery and that was true in restaurants and that was certainly true Beyond restaurants.</p>
</details>

那么你和你的伙伴们坐下来，决定“好吧，我们来开一家公司”？我们当时考虑了几件事。我们说：“好吧，如果我们的目标是帮助本地商家，并且我们发现配送可能是一个需求，那么问题是消费者真的想要这个产品吗？”因为我们生活在美国一个非常**资本主义市场**（Capitalistic Market: 指以私有制为基础，通过市场机制配置资源，追求利润最大化的经济体系）中，很多时候，商业创意之所以没有启动，是因为没有人想要它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then you sit down with your with your mates and figured okay, let's start at company. Well, well, so there are few there are a few things that we were thinking about and and so we said, okay, well, if our goal is to help local businesses and we found this discovery that delivery could be a need, the question is, well, do consumers actually want this product because you know, we live in a very capitalistic Market in the US and so a lot of times business ideas um, perhaps were not started because nobody wanted them to be started.</p>
</details>

所以我们想测试几个不同的想法。首先，**消费者**（Consumers: 指购买和使用商品或服务的个人或群体）真的想从以前不提供配送的商店获得配送服务吗？其次，商店真的愿意与我们**合作**（Partner: 指与他人合作或建立伙伴关系）并支付我们费用，以帮助他们获得**新客户**（New customers: 指首次购买产品或服务的客户）吗？第三，我们能否吸引和招募一群**司机**（Drivers: 指驾驶车辆进行配送的人），他们愿意以我们能负担得起的**工资**（Wage: 指按小时、日或周支付的劳动报酬）工作？这就是我们思考问题的方式。在很多方面，这是一个关于要创立公司需要满足哪些条件的**假设**（Hypothesis: 指基于现有知识提出的一种可验证的解释或预测）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and so you know, we wanted to test a few different ideas, you know, the first is do consumers actually want delivery from stores that never offer delivery before, you know, second would stores actually want to partner with us and you know, pay us, you know, to help them get new customers, and three, could we attract and recruit, you know, a group of drivers who would be willing to work for a wage that we could afford, and so that was really how we thought about it. In many ways, it was a hypothesis of what needed to be true in order to start the company.</p>
</details>

我们选择餐馆的原因是，我们认为如果配送是我们为本地商家带来改变的方式，并且我们想建立最大、最高质量、成本最低的配送网络，那么你需要最大的**订单密度**（Order Density: 指在特定区域和时间内，单位面积或单位时间内产生的订单数量）。而要实现订单密度，你需要两样东西：高**活动频率**（Frequency of activity: 指在一定时间内某项活动发生的次数）和广阔的**覆盖范围**（Coverage: 指服务或产品所能覆盖的地理区域或用户群体）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the reason why we chose restaurants was because we thought well, if delivery was going to be the way in which we made a difference for local businesses and we wanted to build the largest um, you know, delivery Network or and with the highest quality and the lowest cost, well, you need the most amount of order density and with order density, you kind of need two things, you need lots of frequency of activity and you need lots of coverage.</p>
</details>

这两个要求中，一个是我们的观察，另一个是我们的押注。我们的观察是，如果你审视美国**本地零售**（Local retail: 指在特定区域内经营，服务当地社区的零售业）的每个品类，餐馆拥有最高的门店数量。当时它没有最高的销售额，但例如，有100万家餐馆，而杂货店只有几十万家。这就是我们从餐馆开始的原因。我们的押注是，如果从餐馆开始，就会有最高的活动频率和最多的门店数量，这将产生最高的订单密度，从而更容易为其他任何品类建立**最后一公里网络**（Last Mile Network: 指将商品从配送中心送达最终客户手中的物流环节）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one uh, of these two um, requirements was an observation we made and the other was a bet. So the observation we made was if you looked across every category of local retail in America, restaurants has the highest count of stores. It didn't at that time have the highest dollar spend, but there's a million restaurants as an an example versus say just, you know, a couple hundred thousand grocery stores as a as a Counterpoint, um, so that's why we started with restaurants, but and the bet would be that if you can start with restaurants that there would be the most frequency of activity with the most number of stores that that would generate the most order density, which would make it easier to build the last mile Network for any other category.</p>
</details>

讲讲你收到的第一笔订单。我们收到的第一笔订单发生在2013年1月12日星期六。我们上线了PaloAltoDelivery.com。这是一个**最小可行产品**（Minimal Viable Product, MVP: 指具有最少功能但足以满足早期用户需求的产品版本，用于快速验证市场）的最简化版本。我们在45分钟内建立了一个带有八个**PDF菜单**（PDF menus: 指以PDF格式呈现的菜单）的**网站**（Website: 指在互联网上提供信息或服务的网页集合）。当时没有在线订购功能，唯一的订购方式是拨打一个**Google语音号码**（Google Voice number: 谷歌提供的一项电话服务，可将多个电话号码整合到一个号码下），这个号码会同时响铃到我们四位**创始人**（Founders: 指创立公司或组织的人）的**手机**（Cell phones: 移动电话）上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tell me about the first order you got. The first order we got actually happened on a Saturday, January 12th, um, 2013. So we um, shipped pal alod delivery.com. Okay, this was the most minimal version of a minimal viable product where in 45 minutes we built a website with eight PDF menus, right? There's no way to order, the only way you can order is to call a Google Voice number that rang the cell phones of the four Founders. Yeah, so a customer in in Menlo Park actually placed an order. I think the only way he found us because the order was placed 45 minutes or so after we launched the website was literally by typing in Palo alod delivery.com in the browser because Google I don't think would have, you know, indexed our our name at the point yet, um, but he placed um, you know, for himself a, you know, an order from Bangkok Cuisine, um, and and and and it was it was two items, it was um, chicken Pat thae and it was spring rolls, and so pretty good basically it sounded delicious.</p>

门洛帕克（Menlo Park）的一位顾客下了一份订单。我想他找到我们的唯一方式是直接在浏览器中输入PaloAltoDelivery.com，因为订单是在我们网站上线大约45分钟后下的，而那时谷歌可能还没有收录我们的名字。他为自己点了一份**曼谷美食**（Bangkok Cuisine: 一家提供泰国菜的餐厅）的订单，包括两样东西：**泰式炒河粉**（Pat Thai: 泰国著名的炒面食）和**春卷**（Spring rolls: 一种亚洲传统小吃）。听起来很美味。他打电话过来，我的一位联合创始人接了电话，他当时和我一起坐在我的2001年**本田**（Honda: 日本著名的汽车制造商）车里。我们正准备从**校园**（Campus: 大学或学校的场地和建筑物）开车回家，但我们改道去了曼谷美食，点了一份**外卖订单**（Takeout order: 指顾客在餐厅点餐后带走食用的订单），然后把订单送到了他家。

So you did it yourself? We did it ourselves. And then we um, went in and and I I I was an intern um, the previous summer at square and so I had a lot of these Square card readers it at the time it was this white register product that you can insert into the Jack of the iPhone and so that's how we accept the payments.</p>

</details>

那么它是如何规模化的呢？我们当时实际上是为**斯坦福校园**（Stanford campus: 斯坦福大学的校园区域）提供**配送服务**（Delivery service: 指提供商品或服务送达指定地点的服务）。你必须记住，当时我们仍然是**学生**（Students: 指在学校或大学学习的人）。所以我们是学生，我们运营着这项服务，白天上**课程**（Classes: 指在学校或大学进行的教学活动），**午餐**（Lunch: 午饭）时轮流做**配送**（Deliveries: 指将商品或服务送达指定地点的行为）。我们会打电话，轮流通过打电话下订单进行**调度**（Dispatching: 指安排和发送人员或车辆执行任务），然后使用**iPhone应用**（iPhone app: 专为iPhone手机设计的应用程序）“**查找我的朋友**”（Find My Friends: 苹果公司开发的一款定位服务应用）来追踪我们四位**创始人司机**（Founder drivers: 指既是公司创始人，又亲自进行配送的司机）的位置。我们是这项服务唯一的司机，然后我们自己调度订单。我们是幕后的**人工算法**（Human algorithm: 指由人工而非计算机程序完成的复杂决策或调度过程）。

<p class="english-text">So we effectively were a delivery service at the time for the Stanford campus, right? So we're still students, you got to remember at the time, um, and so we're students, we're running the service, so we're taking classes, you know, in the daytime and at lunch, we take turns, you know, doing deliveries, we would call and take turns dispatching by calling in the orders and then using find my friends, the iPhone app to track where you know, each of us four founder drivers were, we're the only drivers you you know, of the service were, and then we would dispatch the orders ourselves, right? Um, we were the human algorithm, you know, behind the scene, and um, we we did this for about four or five months before we um, applied to Y combinator and um, we launched uh, officially as door Dash June 21st of 2013 in the summer 2013 batch out of YC.</p>

我们这样做了大约四五个月，然后申请了**Y Combinator**（YC: 硅谷著名的创业孵化器，为初创公司提供资金、指导和支持）。2013年6月21日，我们作为DoorDash正式上线，加入了YC 2013年夏季批次。

<p class="english-text">When you when you set it up, what was kind of the the Dre The Dream? What what was the biggest that you thought could happen to this? So it's funny you ask that question because that's literally the question why commentator asks you in the application. So I wrote the application just to feel that why commentator that's Sam that's samman's at one point right? Yeah, so so so Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, and others founded why combinator um, which is this incubator program in Silicon Valley um, that helps, you know, start companies um, uh, Sam mman to your point um, at one point ran YC today Gary tan leads YC um, and uh, but one of the questions um, as as part certainly in the 2013 era that they asked in the application was how big can this service be or how big can your product be? How much revenue do you think you'll earn by year seven or I think it was some version of the question and I think at the time for Consumer companies, we were we were studying, you know, achieving a 100 million I dollar of Revenue was a very significant Milestone and so I just remember writing uh, you know, doing some sanity math about well today we launched in paloalto or we operate in paloalto how many paloalto do there have to exist and how many orders in each pal Alto do we have to complete such that we can generate $100 million of Revenue and that was the math I remember answering so $100 million is kind of what I answered thankfully I was off by a couple orders of magnitude dude um, but you know, these are things that are hard to predict.</p>
</details>

当你创立它时，你的梦想是什么？你认为它能发展到多大？你问这个问题很有趣，因为这正是Y Combinator在**申请**（Application: 指正式的请求或申请，通常用于入学、工作或项目）中会问你的问题。我写这份申请只是为了感受Y Combinator。**萨姆·奥特曼**（Sam Altman: OpenAI的首席执行官，曾任Y Combinator总裁）曾一度管理YC，对吧？是的，**保罗·格雷厄姆**（Paul Graham: Y Combinator的联合创始人）、**杰西卡·利文斯顿**（Jessica Livingston: Y Combinator的联合创始人）和其他人创立了Y Combinator，这是一个在**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 位于美国加利福尼亚州北部，以高科技产业闻名）的**孵化器项目**（Incubator program: 指为初创企业提供支持和资源的计划），旨在帮助**创办公司**（Start companies: 指建立新的企业）。萨姆·奥特曼曾一度管理YC，现在**加里·坦**（Gary Tan: Y Combinator的现任总裁）领导YC。但在2013年，申请中问的一个问题是这项服务能有多大，或者你的产品能有多大？你认为到第七年能赚多少**营收**（Revenue: 公司在销售商品或提供服务后所获得的总收入）？当时对于消费公司来说，实现1亿美元的营收是一个非常重要的**里程碑**（Milestone: 指发展过程中的重要阶段或事件）。我记得我做了一些**合理估算**（Sanity math: 指通过简单的计算或逻辑推理来验证某个数字或结果的合理性），比如我们今天在**帕洛阿尔托**（Palo Alto: 位于美国加利福尼亚州的一个城市，硅谷的中心地带）上线或运营，需要有多少个帕洛阿尔托，每个帕洛阿尔托需要完成多少**订单**（Orders: 指顾客购买商品或服务的请求），才能产生1亿美元的营收。这就是我当时回答的计算结果，所以我回答的是1亿美元。幸运的是，我估算错了几个**数量级**（Orders of magnitude: 指数量上的巨大差异，通常以10的幂次表示）。但这些都是很难预测的事情。

<p class="english-text">So what what are the important Milestones from that stage until now? There are many along the way, you know, and I think it it you know, it it really helped that when we started the company, we did have this organizing framework that was really centered on our audiences, our customers, right? So we have we have three kinds of customers, we have consumers, we have Merchants at the time, there were restaurants, today, they span all of retail, and then there are um, there are Dashers, the drivers on our platform, and we really, you know, for door Das to work from day one, we had this you know, belief that it has to work for all of these audiences, it can't just work for one of the audiences or or two of the audiences, it really has to work for everyone, and so that was a nice organizing framework for us to figure out okay, great, you made it work at Stanford, can you make this work in Palo Alto, then can you make this work in a larger area like San Jose, um, you know, and and and and and how extensible is the service, right? Can you repeat this in places of all social economic backgrounds and populations, and so that was really the journey I would argue between 2013 and 2016 where we proved to ourselves that a we could make it work for all the audiences and make a dollar doing it and B that we can actually launch this in a mainstream way.</p>
</details>

从那个阶段到现在，有哪些重要的里程碑？一路上有很多。我认为，当我们创立公司时，我们有一个以**受众**（Audiences: 指特定信息、产品或服务的接收者或目标群体），也就是我们的**客户**（Customers: 指购买商品或服务的人或组织）为中心的**组织框架**（Organizing framework: 指一种结构化的方法或系统，用于组织和理解信息或任务），这非常有帮助。我们有三类客户：**消费者**（Consumers: 指购买和使用商品或服务的个人或群体）、**商家**（Merchants: 指销售商品或服务的企业或个人）（当时是餐馆，现在涵盖所有零售业），以及平台上的**配送员**（Dashers: 指在DoorDash平台上提供配送服务的司机）。我们坚信，从第一天起，DoorDash就必须对所有这些受众都**运作**（Work: 指正常运行或发挥作用），而不仅仅是对其中一个或两个受众。它必须对每个人都有效。因此，这是一个很好的组织框架，帮助我们弄清楚：“好的，你们让它在斯坦福运作了，你们能在帕洛阿尔托运作吗？然后你们能在圣何塞这样更大的区域运作吗？”这项服务**可扩展的**（Extensible: 指系统或服务能够通过添加新功能或适应新环境来扩展其能力）程度如何？你们能在所有**社会经济背景**（Social economic backgrounds: 指个人或群体的社会和经济地位，包括收入、教育、职业等因素）和**人口**（Populations: 指特定区域内居住的所有人）的地方复制这种模式吗？我认为2013年至2016年期间的旅程，我们向自己证明了：第一，我们可以让它对所有受众都有效，并且从中盈利；第二，我们可以以主流方式推出这项服务。

<p class="english-text">And what were the set what were the main setbacks? Oh, there are many, um, so did you like nearly die during this period? Sometimes, many times. I mean, between 2013 and 2018, you know, the company almost always felt broke, and you know, I was singularly responsible for it because as CEO, one of my key or maybe sole job responsibilities, top priorities is to make sure we never run out of cash, but it was really hard. The fundraising process, you know, I remember there were three years between 2016 and 2018, you know, it's about a thousand days where I felt like I was wandering in the desert asking for money from investors, um, uh, you know, for people to to fund door Dash, and it was it was so so what kept you going?</p>

主要的**挫折**（Setbacks: 指阻碍进展或导致倒退的困难或问题）是什么？有很多。你在这段时间里差点“死掉”吗？有时，很多次。我的意思是，在2013年到2018年之间，公司几乎总是感觉要**破产**（Broke: 指没有钱或资金耗尽）。作为**首席执行官**（CEO: Chief Executive Officer，首席执行官，公司最高行政职位），我对此负有全责，因为我的主要甚至唯一的**工作职责**（Job responsibilities: 指在工作中需要完成的任务和义务），首要**优先事项**（Priorities: 指需要优先处理或关注的事情），就是确保我们永远不会耗尽**现金**（Cash: 指实物货币或银行存款）。但这真的很难。**融资过程**（Fundraising process: 指为公司或项目筹集资金的过程）中，我记得2016年到2018年有三年，大约一千天，我感觉自己像是在**沙漠中徘徊**（Wandering in the desert: 比喻在困境中迷茫、找不到方向），向**投资者**（Investors: 指投入资金以期获得回报的个人或机构）寻求资金，希望他们能为DoorDash提供资金。

<p class="english-text">On there's never one answer, you know, I I I think because you know, at some point, you know, willpower gives out, right? And and you need something beyond that, and for us, you know, I think one of the lessons I learned, you know, through throughout that journey and and and even in some of the tough moments early on in the company's life is that while you have this Grand Vision and Mission as the entrepreneur that you're always holding on to, it's really the team that dictates your day-to-day satisfaction, and if you can build a culture where it feels like yes, you want to win and yes, you want to do all the things for the customer and it feels like you're playing for one another and playing, you know, for the team versus just playing for yourself, um, it's a lot easier to get through whatever the moments are because it's a lot easier to have, you know, at the time there's about 250 of us, you know, go through this together versus just me singlehandedly trying to do this on my own.</p>
</details>

是什么让你坚持下去？从来没有一个单一的答案。我认为，因为在某个时候，**意志力**（Willpower: 指控制自己的行为、思想和情绪的能力）会耗尽。你需要超越它。对我们来说，我认为我在那段旅程中，甚至在公司早期的一些艰难时刻学到的一个教训是，作为**创业者**（Entrepreneur: 指创建和经营新企业的人），虽然你始终怀揣着宏伟的愿景和使命，但真正决定你日常满意度的是**团队**（Team: 指为了共同目标而协同工作的一群人）。如果你能建立一种**文化**（Culture: 指一个组织或群体共享的价值观、信仰、行为模式和实践），让大家觉得“是的，我们想赢，是的，我们想为客户做所有的事情”，并且感觉大家是**为彼此而战**（Playing for one another: 指团队成员之间互相支持、共同努力），**为团队而战**（Playing for the team: 指为了团队的整体利益和目标而努力），而不是仅仅**为自己而战**（Playing for yourself: 指只为个人利益而努力），那么度过任何艰难时刻都会容易得多。因为当时我们大约有250人，大家一起经历这些，比我**独自一人**（Singlehandedly: 指独自一人，没有他人的帮助）努力要容易得多。

<p class="english-text">And look I mean it doesn't mean that there weren't losses, right? We you know, we had a quarter of the team, you know, maybe a little less but close to a quarter of the team who decided that maybe there were greener pastures elsewhere because you know, you see the bank account declining every single week where highly transparent High ownership company where we report out on numbers and and and I understand that and and but but if you think about the people that remain and and stuck with it and perhaps this is you know, one version of survivorship bias, but for the people that remained that you know, hung in there long enough and won by building a product because we didn't have any access to Dollar so there was no marketing spend or things like this that had a product that had higher retention and Order frequency so that we can then get lucky enough to get an investor or two to say Yes, um that you know, that group of people um, I think share a bond that is very very very difficult impossible to break.</p>

当然，这并不意味着没有**损失**（Losses: 指财务上的亏损或人员的流失）。我们有大约四分之一的团队成员（可能略少一点，但接近四分之一）决定去寻找**更好的机会**（Greener pastures: 比喻更有利或更有前途的环境），因为每周你都会看到**银行账户**（Bank account: 指在银行开设的用于存款和取款的账户）余额在下降。我们是一家高度透明、**高度主人翁精神的公司**（High ownership company: 指员工对公司有强烈归属感和责任感的公司），我们会**公布数据**（Report out on numbers: 指公开报告公司的财务或运营数据）。我理解这一点。但是，如果你想想那些留下来并坚持下去的人，也许这是一种**幸存者偏差**（Survivorship Bias: 指在评估事物时，只关注那些成功“幸存”下来的案例，而忽略了那些失败的案例，从而得出错误结论的认知偏差），但对于那些坚持足够长时间并最终通过打造**产品**（Product: 指提供给市场以满足需求或欲望的物品或服务）而获胜的人来说，因为我们没有任何**资金**（Access to Dollar: 指获得资金的能力），所以没有**营销支出**（Marketing spend: 指用于推广产品或服务的费用）或其他类似的东西，我们只能依靠一个具有更高**留存率**（Retention: 指客户或员工在一段时间内继续使用产品或服务或留在公司的比率）和**订单频率**（Order frequency: 指客户在一定时间内购买产品或服务的次数）的产品，这样我们才能足够幸运地获得一两个**投资者**（Investor: 指投入资金以期获得回报的个人或机构）的肯定。我认为那群人之间分享着一种非常非常难以打破的**纽带**（Bond: 指人与人之间深厚的情感联系）。

### 业务拓展与“比特之战”和“原子之战”

如果你能把冰淇淋冷藏配送，或者把披萨热腾腾地配送，你基本上就能配送任何东西。所以，这又是我们从预制餐食开始的论点之一，不仅是从订单密度的角度，也是从你所说的**物流能力**（Logistics capability: 指企业在物流管理和运营方面的能力）的角度。我们已经有效地建立了最复杂的点对点系统，任何商家都可以配送给任何消费者，反之亦然，任何商家也可以配送给任何其他商家。当然，还有很长的路要走。我认为，当你从一个**品类**（Category: 指具有共同特征或属性的事物类别）扩展到另一个品类时，物流方面的挑战是巨大的。但还有一点是组织**线下**（Offline: 指不连接到互联网或物理世界中的状态）信息。这些信息都不存在。如果我们今天坐在**洛杉矶**（Los Angeles: 位于美国加利福尼亚州南部的一个大城市），如果我们想知道**洛杉矶市中心**（Downtown LA: 洛杉矶市的中心区域）最后一个**停车位**（Parking space: 指用于停放车辆的区域）在哪里，这对想要进行配送的配送员来说是一个非常重要的问题。或者如果我们想知道在哪里能以特定**价格点**（Price point: 指商品或服务销售的特定价格水平）找到最后一**瓶可乐**（Bottle of Coke: 一瓶可口可乐），很少有商店知道这些信息。我认为，虽然今天**线上**（Online: 指连接到互联网或数字世界中的状态）正在发生一场惊人的**革命**（Revolution: 指重大的、根本性的变革），特别是随着大型语言模型的出现，但仍然有大量的**线下信息**（Offline information: 指存在于物理世界中，尚未被数字化或组织起来的信息）需要被**组织**（Organizing the information: 指对信息进行分类、整理和结构化）和**整合**（Assembled: 指将分散的部件或信息组合成一个整体）。

We don't analyze a lot, um, or debate a lot, we tend to ship um, lots of experiments, you know, hundreds to thousands of experiments per week, recognizing that most of them will not make it to our audiences, most of them will not make it to customers, consumers, merchants, or Dashers.

我们学到的一点是，你如何能够**尝试和失败**（Trial and fail: 指通过不断尝试和从失败中学习来进步）并**继续前进**（Move on: 指继续进行或发展）？我的意思是，通过实验，这可能在几**小时**（Hours: 小时）内发生。但**业务建设**（Business building: 指创建和发展新企业的活动）需要不止一种技能。我们在这里谈论的一种技能是**学习敏捷性**（Learning agility: 指快速学习、适应新情况和从经验中成长的能力）和**执行速度**（Speed of execution: 指快速有效地完成任务或实现目标的能力），以及**勇于尝试和失败的意愿**（Willingness to try and fail: 指敢于尝试新事物并接受失败可能性的态度）。但还有另一方面，我认为在业务建设中，有时很难与这种学习意愿结合起来，那就是拥有**耐心**（Patience: 指在面对困难、延迟或挑衅时保持冷静和忍耐的能力）和**长期信念**（Long-term conviction: 指对某个目标或方向长期坚定的信念），即我们所走的**道路**（Path: 指实现目标的方法或途径）可能不是正确的，但至少我们所去的方向是正确的。

Well, I mean, I think with experiments that can probably happen in hours, but but but building businesses you you need more than one type of skill, one type of skill we're talking about here is this learning agility and speed of execution and the willingness to try and fail, but there also you know, is I I would say, you know, another side of business building which is really hard sometimes to keep, you know, um, uh, in conjunction, you know, with this willingness to learn, which is the ability um, to have the patience and the long-term conviction um, that you know, perhaps the um, path that we're traveling on is the wrong one, but at least where we're going is the right place.</p>

我认为，作为**运营者**（Operator: 指负责管理和运行业务或系统的人），你需要在某种程度上拥有两种**管理系统**（Management Systems: 指组织用于规划、执行、监控和控制其活动以实现目标的框架）。一种是用于管理你对方向有相当清晰认识的事物，甚至可以非常准确地预测沿途的**差异**（Variance: 指数据点与均值之间的离散程度）。这可能是你的一些**规模化业务**（Scaled businesses: 指已经成功扩展并拥有大量客户和市场份额的企业），或者你已经超越了**产品市场契合**（Product Market Fit: 指产品能够很好地满足市场需求，并被目标客户广泛接受的状态）并正在寻找**高效增长方式**（Efficient ways to grow: 指以最小的资源投入实现最大增长的方法）的业务。这需要一套与**创造新业务**（Inventing new businesses: 指开发和推出新的商业模式或产品）截然不同的**管理技术**（Management techniques: 指用于管理组织、团队或项目的各种方法和策略）。在创造新业务时，你需要对你想去的**愿景**（Vision: 指对未来状态或目标的清晰构想）和为客户**待完成的任务**（Job to be done: 指客户试图通过购买产品或服务来解决的根本问题或需求）保持**固执**（Stubborn: 指坚持己见，不轻易改变），但你必须对实现目标的**路径**（Path: 指实现目标的方法或途径）保持超级**有创造力**（Creative: 指具有创造新思想或新事物的能力）、**耐心**（Patience: 指在面对困难、延迟或挑衅时保持冷静和忍耐的能力）和**开放心态**（Open-minded: 指愿意接受新思想、新观点或不同意见的态度）。

<p class="english-text">And and I think you know, that's been true in door das's life in each one of the businesses we have about five businesses now that we we operate, but as we think about inventing business numb 6789 etc etc etc, you know, we have to keep an open mind to have two different systems in which we operate.</p>
</details>

我认为这在DoorDash的生命周期中一直如此，我们现在运营着大约五项**业务**（Businesses: 指从事生产、销售商品或提供服务以获取利润的经济活动）。但当我们考虑创造第六、第七、第八、第九等等业务时，我们需要保持开放的心态，拥有两种不同的运营系统。

<p class="english-text">So now I work for you and you say, hey, Nikolai, um, could you go and check out this thing? I do this experiment, it's a failure. I come back to you and say, t Tony, I'm really sorry, I've, you know, screwed it up there. How do you react?</p>
</details>

现在我为你工作，你说：“嘿，尼古拉，你去看看这个东西。”我做了这个**实验**（Experiment: 指为了验证假设或发现新事物而进行的有控制的测试），它**失败**（Failure: 指未能达到预期结果或目标）了。我回来对你说：“托尼，我真的很抱歉，我搞砸了。”你如何**反应**（React: 指对某事做出回应或表现出某种行为）？我会问你**学到**（Learn: 指通过经验、研究或教学获得知识或技能）了什么。我认为，作为一位新旅程上的创业者，非常重要的一点是，你必须**情境化**（Contextualize: 指将某事物置于其特定背景中进行理解和解释），总是有**技能**（Skill: 指通过学习和实践获得的做某事的能力）和**运气**（Luck: 指偶然的好运或坏运）的成分。作为创业者，你需要两者兼备。

<p class="english-text">I would ask what is did you learn? And you know, I think one of the things that is, you know, so important to contextualize as the entrepreneur, um, on a New Journey is that there's always elements of skill and elements of luck, and you need both as the entrepreneur, you know, I think that when we were founding door Dash, we made some good decisions about what to prioritize, how much to bet on certain dimensions of how a consumer will judge us versus a merchant versus a a Dasher, and there's some points, you know, that we scored from the skill category, but there was a lot of luck around how large these categories could be or that if we made certain decisions to, you know, invest more in this market versus that market, um, you know, it's it's not always something that you get to know in advance otherwise it wouldn't be an entrepreneurial Journey.</p>
</details>

我认为，当我们创立DoorDash时，我们做了一些很好的决定，关于**优先考虑**（Prioritize: 指将某事置于更重要的位置，优先处理）什么，在消费者、商家和配送员如何**评判**（Judge: 指对某事做出判断或评价）我们的某些**维度**（Dimensions: 指事物的不同方面或特征）上**押注**（Bet: 指冒险或下注）多少。我们在技能方面取得了一些分数，但在这些**品类**（Category: 指具有共同特征或属性的事物类别）能有多大，或者如果我们决定**投资**（Invest: 指投入资金、时间或精力以期获得回报）更多在这个**市场**（Market: 指商品或服务进行交易的场所或系统）而不是那个市场方面，有很多运气成分。你不可能总是提前知道这些，否则它就不是一次**创业旅程**（Entrepreneurial Journey: 指个人或团队从零开始创建和发展新企业的整个过程）了。

### AI与未来发展

稍微转换一下话题，**人工智能和技术**（AI and Technology: 指人工智能及其相关技术领域）对公司来说下一步能做什么？我认为现在答案是我们不知道，我们正在尽最大努力尽快**学习**（Learn: 指通过经验、研究或教学获得知识或技能）。我们当然一直在尝试**大型语言模型**（Large Language Models, LLMs: 一种基于深度学习的人工智能模型，在过去两三年里，它变得越来越**普及**（Popularized: 指使某事物变得流行或广为人知）。我们看到了很多**成功的迹象**（Glimpses of success: 指偶尔出现的成功迹象或短暂的成功），特别是在我们思考如何帮助**组织物理世界**（Organize the physical world: 指对物理世界中的信息和资源进行系统化的整理和管理），并从中建立**数据集**（Build data sets: 指收集和整理数据以创建可用于分析或训练模型的数据集），以及使用人工智能来**填充目录**（Fill out those catalogs: 指完善或补充产品或服务目录）方面。我们还在其他**用例**（Use cases: 指产品或系统在特定情境下的应用场景）中看到了人工智能，无论是帮助我们进行**客户支持**（Customer support: 指为客户提供帮助和解决问题的服务）还是**检测欺诈**（Detecting fraud: 指识别和预防欺诈行为）。有很多用例，我认为我们现在所处的位置，只是**进度条**（Progress bar: 指显示任务完成进度的视觉指示器）上很小的一部分。我们非常**看好**（Bullish: 指对市场或某个事物持乐观态度）这项**通用技术**（General technology: 指可以应用于多个领域或行业的广泛技术），但在寻找“**本垒打**”（Home Run: 比喻取得巨大成功或突破）方面，我们现在的**座右铭**（Mantra: 指经常重复的口号或信念）是确保有足够的**射门次数**（Shots on goal: 比喻为了实现目标而进行的尝试次数）。我们不知道关于大型语言模型的一些进展在应用于我们这类业务时，其“**银弹**”（Silver Bullet: 比喻解决所有问题的万能方法）或“**杀手级应用**”（Killer application: 指一款具有颠覆性、能够吸引大量用户的应用）是什么，但我们正在快速学习。

<p class="english-text">I think right now the answer is we don't know and we're trying our best to learn as fast as possible so we certainly have been playing um, with a lot of the advancements in large language models, you know, pretty much for the last you know, two or three years and certainly it's become even more popularized over that period of time and we've seen glimpses of of a lot of um, success um, especially as we think about how can we help organize the physical world um, and build data sets from that and use AI to understand how to fill out those cataloges, um, we've seen AI in in in in other use cases whether it's, you know, helping us with customer support or detecting fraud, um, there's lots of you know, use cases and I think, you know, the best way to kind of think about where we are is just we're very small percentage of the progress bar. It's one we're very bullish on in terms of the general technology, but you know, in terms of you know, Finding, you know, the the the the Home Run I guess that the Mantra we have right now is about making sure that it's about having enough shots on goal where we don't know the Silver Bullet, you know, answer to your question about what is the, you know, know killer application with respect to some of the advances in llms as it applies to our kind of business, um, but we're learning quickly.</p>
</details>

还有谁像你们一样在组织物理世界？我认为这正在**局部**（Pockets: 指在某个大范围内的局部区域或特定群体）发生。我认为这之所以如此困难，是因为除非你的**使命**（Mission: 指一个组织或个人存在的根本目的和目标）是发展和**赋能本地经济**（Empower local economies: 指通过提供支持和资源来增强本地经济的活力和能力），进行一场**数十年旅程**（Multi-decade Journey: 指持续数十年之久的漫长旅程），并且这是你唯一的**来源**（Sole source: 指唯一的来源或供应者），否则我认为这真的很难。这就是为什么我认为过去这大多是在局部完成的。有些人会组织**零售业的某些部分**（Parts of retail: 指零售行业中的特定细分领域），有些人可能会组织**服务业的某些部分**（Parts of services: 指服务行业中的特定细分领域），还有些人可能会组织**百货商店的某些部分**（Parts of department stores: 指百货商店中的特定部门或商品类别）。我认为对DoorDash来说，既**艰巨的**（Daunting: 指令人望而生畏或感到困难的）又**令人兴奋的**（Exciting: 指令人感到兴奋或激动人心的）是这个**挑战的巨大性**（Enormity of the challenge: 指挑战的规模和难度非常巨大）。我们希望成为我们运营的每个**城市**（City: 指人口密集、经济发达的地区）的**物理世界**（Physical world: 指物质存在的现实世界）的**基础设施**（Infrastructure: 指支持系统或服务运行的基础设施），我们也希望连接每个**本地商家**（Local Merchant: 指在特定区域内经营的本地商家）和每个**本地消费者**（Local Consumer: 指在特定区域内购买商品或服务的本地消费者）。我认为做这两件事，虽然只有两件事，但需要几十年的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who else is trying to organize the physical world the way you are? Well, I think it's happening in Pockets, you know, I think what's so hard about this is that um, unless it's your mission to grow and to empower local economies where you know, you're on this many multi-decade Journey where that is the sole source of what you want to do, I think it's really hard um, and and and and that's why I think in the past, it's mostly been done in Pockets, right? You know, some people will organize I don't know parts of retail, other people might organize, you know, parts of services, other people might organize parts of department stores and and I think what's what's um, you know, both daunting as well as exciting for us at door Das is just the enormity of the challenge that you know, we see ahead of us where we do want to be both the infrastructure in the um, in in the physical world for every city we operate in and we also want to connect every local Merchant with every local consumer and I think, you know, doing these things are just it's only two things but it's going to take many decades.</p>
</details>

同时，你们也在努力**淘汰自己**（Put yourself out of business: 指通过创新或改进使自己的现有业务变得过时或不再需要）。我们总是在努力**发明更好的产品**（Inventing a better product: 指创造出比现有产品更优秀的新产品）。我学到的一点是，**消费者永不满足**（Consumers are never satisfied: 指消费者对产品或服务的期望和需求是不断增长的）。没有消费者会记住我们今天比一年前**配送更快**（Delivered faster: 指配送速度比以前更快）的事实，他们只会期望我们一年后甚至明天配送得更快。没有消费者会要求我们**提高价格**（Increase our prices: 指提高商品或服务的售价），或者**减少选择**（Lower our selection: 指减少可供选择的商品或服务的种类），或者**降低客户支持质量**（Worse our customer support: 指降低客户服务质量）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, you try to kind of put yourself out of business. Well, we're always trying to make sure that we're inventing a better product. One of the things that I've learned is that consumers are never satisfied, there is all like no consumer is going to remember the fact that you know, we've delivered faster today than a year ago, they're just going to expect us to deliver faster, you know, a year from now or or even tomorrow, right? And and no consumer is going to ever, you know, ask us to increase our prices or lower our selection or make worse our customer support.</p>
</details>

因此，我认为建立这种**毅力**（Fortitude: 指在面对痛苦或逆境时表现出的勇气和坚韧），以及拥有这种**心态**（Mentality: 指一种特定的思维方式或态度）的团队非常重要，即我们总是需要**创造新业务**（Invent new businesses: 指开发和推出新的商业模式或产品），但我们也必须理解不断**改进**（Keep getting better: 指在某方面不断提高或进步）**核心业务**（Main thing: 指主要或最重要的事物）的重要性。这就像你一方面有**优化**（Optimization: 指使某事物达到最佳状态或效率的过程），另一方面有**创新**（Innovation: 指引入新思想、新方法或新产品），它们需要非常不同的**管理系统**（Management Systems: 指组织用于规划、执行、监控和控制其活动以实现目标的框架），也需要你**同时兼顾这两件事**（Hold both of these things in your head: 比喻同时考虑并处理两个看似矛盾或不同的概念）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think, you know, instead it's I I think building the fortitude as well as the team with the mentality that um, we always have to invent new businesses, but we also must understand the importance that we always have to keep getting better at the main thing too, right? It's it's like you have optimization on one side and Innovation on the other and they require very different Management Systems, they also require to hold both of these things in your head at the same time.</p>

### DoorDash的企业文化与人才观

DoorDash需要什么样的**文化**（Culture: 指一个组织或群体共享的价值观、信仰、行为模式和实践）才能实现这些？我认为需要几件事共同作用，因为我很高兴你问到了文化，这可能是唯一能让你实现所有这些**抱负**（Ambitions: 指强烈的愿望或追求，通常指成功或成就）并打造所有**产品**（Products: 指提供给市场以满足需求或欲望的物品或服务）的东西。我认为首先，它始于一种**高度主人翁精神**（High ownership: 指对工作或任务有强烈的责任感和归属感）和**高度责任感**（High accountability: 指对自己的行为和结果负有高度责任）的文化。如果你思考我们所做的事情，它更像是一种**公用事业服务**（Utility service: 指提供基本公共服务的行业，如水电煤气），而不是**娱乐系统**（Entertainment system: 指提供娱乐内容的系统或设备）。如果我们搞砸了，没有把你的产品送达，这在消费者眼中是极其**令人失望的**（Disappointing: 指未能达到预期或令人感到沮丧的）。对商家来说，这是一次**销售损失**（Lost sale: 指因某种原因未能完成的销售），而对于**利润微薄**（Thin on margins: 指利润空间很小）的**业务**（Business: 指从事生产、销售商品或提供服务以获取利润的经济活动）来说，这可能是一次**工作机会损失**（Lost work opportunity: 指因未能完成任务或抓住机会而失去的潜在工作）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What kind of culture do you need at door Dash to achieve this? I think you need um, you know, several things to come together because I'm I'm glad you asked about um, you know, the culture that that might be the only thing that actually allows you to achieve, you know, um, you know, all of these Ambitions and build all of the products which is I think it's first and foremost, start with a very high ownership High accountability kind of culture where if you think about what we do um, it's more of a utility service versus an entertainment system, right? So if we mess up and we don't bring you your products um, that is extremely disappointing in the eyes of the consumer that's a lost sale which is um, you know, for a business that might be uh, very thin on margins and it's a lost work opportunity um, you know, for a driver.</p>
</details>

在我看来，它确实反映了**本地经济**（Local economy: 指特定地理区域内的经济活动和系统）。如果你思考**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一个国家或地区经济活动总量的指标）是如何产生的，大部分GDP仍然是由每个城市中**实体地**（Physically: 指以物质形式存在或在物理世界中）存在的中小型和大型企业创造的。这些企业也描绘了我们选择生活在**洛杉矶**（Los Angeles: 位于美国加利福尼亚州南部的一个大城市）、**奥斯陆**（Oslo: 挪威的首都）或**旧金山**（San Francisco: 位于美国加利福尼亚州的一个大城市）等伟大城市的**特色**（Personalities: 指独特的特征或个性）。我认为，为了让这种活力和真实性得以保持，在一个所有这些企业都能**成功**（Successful: 指达到预期目标或取得良好结果）的世界里，而不是在一个只有一两个**商家**（Merchants: 指销售商品或服务的企业或个人）成功的世界里，我们必须对这份**责任**（Responsibility: 指需要承担的义务或职责）抱有极大的**主人翁精神**（Ownership: 指对某事有控制权或责任感）和**严肃性**（Seriousness: 指对待某事的认真态度）。我认为这始于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it really is a reflection of the local economy the way I see it is if you think about GDP and where it gets created most GDP is still produced by the small medium and large businesses physically inside every city and they also these businesses describe the personalities of why we choose to live in Los Angeles or Oslo or San Francisco or other great cities and I think in order for that to stay vibrant and true where we live in a world where all of these businesses will be successful instead of a world where there might just be success at the hands of one or two you know Merchants, then we have to um, take great ownership and seriousness of of that responsibility. I think it starts there.</p>
</details>

那么你如何判断？现在，你面试我一份工作，你如何判断我是否具备这些特质？我认为没有神奇的**面试问题**（Magical interview questions: 指能够神奇地揭示候选人所有特质的问题）。我认为这些事情大多是通过**倾听**（Listening: 指仔细聆听和理解他人所说的话）而不是**问完美的面试问题**（Asking the perfect interview question: 指提出能够完美评估候选人的问题）来发生的。我知道我们正在播客中谈论这个，这有点**讽刺的**（Ironic: 指与预期相反或具有讽刺意味的）。但例如，我会举一些例子。当我们谈论**高度责任感**（High accountability: 指对自己的行为和结果负有高度责任）时，如果我看到一位**高级主管**（Senior executive: 指在公司中担任高级管理职位的人）来面试，他告诉我的第一件事是“有五个原因你不应该雇佣我”，这与那些只告诉我他们取得了所有辉煌成就的人，其**沟通机制**（Communication mechanism: 指信息传递和交流的方式）或**选择**（Choice: 指在多个选项中进行选择）是截然不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do you find so so now so you talk about accountability and and and ownership so here you interview me now for a job how do you figure out whether I have it? I don't think there are any magical interview questions. I think most of these things, you know, know happen through listening um, than than necessarily asking the perfect interview question. I recognize it's a bit ironic as we're talking about this in a podcast, but but but you know, for instance, I I'll give some examples, right? So when we talk about, you know, High accountability, if I see a senior executive come and you know, the first thing they tell me um, in the in the you know, interview is here are the five reasons why you should not hire me, that's a very different communication mechanism or Choice than someone who just tells me all the wonderful things that they've accomplished, right?</p>
</details>

我们还寻找这种**强烈的行动偏好**（Strong bias for action: 指倾向于快速采取行动而非过度分析或辩论的工作态度）。我们DoorDash的一位**早期建设者**（Early Builders: 指在公司早期阶段做出重要贡献的员工），现在仍然以**较小的职责**（Smaller capacity: 指承担较少的工作量或责任）与我们合作的**克里斯托弗·佩恩**（Christopher Payne: DoorDash的前首席运营官兼总裁），他曾是我们的第一任**首席运营官**（Chief Operating Officer: 首席运营官，负责公司的日常运营）兼**总裁**（President: 总裁，通常负责公司某个部门或区域的运营）。我记得2016年一个**星期五**（Friday: 星期五）和他聊了大约4**小时**（Hours: 小时），那天晚上，在几个小时内，他和当时13岁的儿子**安德鲁**（Andrew: 克里斯托弗·佩恩的儿子）就真的出去做了三四个小时的配送。这就是一种强烈的行动偏好。我没有要求他这样做，我没有说：“嘿，你能告诉我我们的**物流系统**（Logistics system: 指管理商品、服务和信息从起点到消费点流动的系统）有什么问题吗？”不，他只是出去做了配送，然后弄明白了。

One of our, you know, um, early Builders at door Das and he's still someone who works with us, but but in in a in a smaller capacity, um, was Christopher Payne, um, you know, who who was our chief was our first Chief Operating Officer and president, you know, he uh, I remember spoke with on a Friday for about 4 hours, um, in 2016 and later that evening like, you know, within a matter of a couple hours basically he and his 13-year-old son Andrew at the time, um, 13 at the time, you know, they literally went out and just did deliveries for three or four hours. That's a high bias for Action. I didn't ask him to do that. I didn't say, hey, can you tell me what's wrong with our Logistics system? No, he just went out and did deliveries and figured it out, right?</p>

我们关心那些能在**最低细节层面运作**（Operate at the lowest level of detail: 指能够深入到最细微的层面去理解和处理问题）的人，因为**物理世界**（Physical world: 指物质存在的现实世界）是**混乱的**（Messy: 指杂乱无章或复杂难处理的），一切都是**边缘情况**（Edge case: 指在正常操作范围之外，但仍可能发生并需要处理的特殊情况）。所以，我们前**首席财务官**（Former CFO: 指公司前任首席财务官）兼现任**总裁**（Current president: 指公司现任总裁）**普拉比尔·阿达卡尔**（Prabir Adarkar: DoorDash的总裁兼首席运营官）在我的第一次**面试**（Interview: 指为了评估候选人而进行的对话）或**对话**（Conversation: 指两个人或多个人之间的口头交流）中，他带来了一个10兆字节的文件，那是一个关于我们未来五年**财务预测**（Financial projections: 指对公司未来财务表现的估计和预测）的模型。我没有要求他这样做。这本来应该是一次**咖啡聊天**（Coffee chat: 指非正式的、轻松的对话），结果却变成了对**单位经济效益**（Unit Economics: 指衡量企业每增加一个单位产品或服务所产生的收入和成本，用于评估业务盈利能力）以及我们**市场**（Markets: 指商品或服务进行交易的场所或系统）和**业绩**（Performance: 指某人或某事物的表现或完成任务的效率）进展的4小时**审查**（Examination: 指详细检查或测试）。

</details>

我们寻找那些能同时持有**对立的真相**（Opposing truths: 指两个看似矛盾但可能都包含真实性的观点或事实）的人，也就是说，那些在思维上不**教条的**（Dogmatic: 指固执己见，不接受不同意见的）。我们寻找那些擅长**建设团队**（Building teams: 指组建和发展一个高效协作的团队）的人，所以我们会看他们的**过往记录**（Track record: 指某人或某事物的历史表现）。这不一定来自面试。我们寻找那些具有强大**追随力**（Followership: 指追随者对领导者的支持和忠诚）的人，因为要**维持**（Sustain: 指保持或维持某事物的存在或状态）并最终**赢**（Win: 指在竞争中取得胜利），需要一个团队。所以我们看人们在**跳槽**（Move jobs: 指更换工作）时，有多少人真的**追随他们**（Literally follow them: 指真的跟随他们跳槽到新公司）。这些是我们称之为**卓越特质**（Attributes of Excellence: 指构成卓越表现的关键特征或品质）的一些东西，我们通过它们来建立一种文化，我认为这种文化能够满足我们在DoorDash所努力实现的需求。

<p class="english-text">We look for people who can hold two opposing truths at the same time, right? So people who are not dogmatic in how they think we look at people who are great at building teams, so we look at the track record that doesn't have to come from an interview. We look at people who have strong followership, um, because it takes a team to to sustain in order to win, and so we look at, you know, when people move jobs for example, you know, so even before the interview, we look at when they move jobs, how many people literally follow them MH and you know, so these are some of the things we call them the attributes of Excellence that we look for in building a culture that I think you know, can meet the demands of what we're trying to do at door Dash.</p>

这种让人追随或成为**人才磁石**（Talent magnet: 比喻能够吸引和留住优秀人才的组织或个人）的能力是关键。你认为人们为什么愿意追随你？作为领导者，你有什么特质让他们愿意为你工作？我认为你应该问他们，尼古拉。但我认为我一直相信的一点，也是我在我们今天谈话开始时告诉你的，就是我相信每个人都有一个**超能力**（Superpower: 比喻某人拥有的独特而强大的能力或优势），而我的**工作**（Job: 指一个人为了获得报酬而从事的活动）就是将它激发出来，并给予他们最大程度的**曝光**（Exposure: 指让某人或某事接触到新的环境、机会或观众），以发挥那个超能力。我希望这种曝光总是在DoorDash。我希望这是真的，但即使不是真的，它必须在其他地方，我认为**最大化一个人的优势**（Maximizing someone's strength: 指充分发挥一个人的长处和优势）真的非常重要。

I hope that to be true, but even if it's not true and it has to be somewhere else, I think you know, maximizing someone's strength is is is is really really important.</p>

我认为人们喜欢DoorDash的一点是，它是一个为**成就**（Achievement: 指通过努力或技能完成某事）和**卓越**（Excellence: 指极其优秀或出色的品质）设定**高标准**（High bar: 指高要求或高标准）的地方。我认为那些非常有**动力**（Motivated: 指有强烈的愿望或热情去做某事）的人倾向于以类似的方式被激励。这是一个非常**严谨的**（Rigorous: 指严格、精确和彻底的）地方，对**结果**（Outcomes: 指某事的结果或最终产物）非常**狂热的**（Maniacal: 指极度狂热或痴迷的），但我们在实现目标的方式上非常**灵活的**（Flexible: 指能够轻松适应变化或调整）。这是一个**押注于人**（Bets on people: 指相信并投资于人的潜力）的地方，也许在他们的**简历**（Resume: 指个人教育、工作经验和技能的总结）还没有达到足以**值得**（Warrant: 指有充分的理由或依据）这份**工作机会**（Job opportunity: 指可以获得工作的机会）的**信誉**（Credibility: 指值得信任或可信赖的品质）之前。这是一个愿意承担**风险**（Risks: 指可能导致损失或负面结果的不确定性）的地方，有时是**时间风险**（Time risk: 指因时间投入而可能产生的损失或不确定性），有时是**财务风险**（Financial Risk: 指因投资或财务决策而可能产生的损失），有时是**运营风险**（Operating risk: 指企业在日常运营中可能面临的风险）。我认为所有这些加起来，这是一个我们努力让你成为**最好的自己**（Best version of yourself: 指个人在能力、品格和幸福感方面的最佳状态）的地方。我一直对DoorDash抱有的**抱负**（Aspirations: 指强烈的愿望或追求，通常指成功或成就）之一是，不仅仅是让你在DoorDash取得成功——那很棒——但如果作为DoorDash的**领导者**（Leaders: 指引导或管理团队、组织或国家的人），我们是成功的，那么当你**离开DoorDash**（Left DoorDash: 指不再在DoorDash公司工作）并决定去做任何接下来适合你的事情时，你对能够实现那种规模的抱负充满**自信**（Confident: 指对自己或某事有信心），那么我们就**完成了我们的工作**（Done our job: 指完成了自己应该做的工作或职责）。

你的超能力是什么？有时我仍在努力**弄清楚**（Figure that out: 指理解或解决某个问题）这一点。但我认为我发现很多**乐趣**（Joy: 指极大的快乐或幸福）并投入大量时间的一件事是与那些**才能**（Talent: 指天生的能力或天赋）多于**经验**（Experience: 指通过实践或观察获得的知识或技能）的人相处，并**及早发现这些人**（Identifying those people early: 指在他们职业生涯早期就发现有潜力的人），同时以正确的方式给予他们**曝光**（Exposure: 指让某人或某事接触到新的环境、机会或观众）。这意味着你不能只是让他们获得最大程度的曝光，然后让他们**自生自灭**（Sink or swim: 比喻在困难环境中，要么成功要么失败，没有帮助）。而是要给予他们适量的**支持**（Support: 指提供帮助或鼓励），同时**把他们推向极限**（Pushing them to the edge: 比喻将某人推到其能力的极限），这样他们仍然有**信心**（Confidence: 指对自己能力或判断的信任），从而比他们原本能更快地达到**下一个层次**（Next level: 指更高或更先进的阶段）。

你是**Meta**（Meta: Facebook的母公司，旗下拥有Facebook、Instagram、WhatsApp等社交媒体平台）董事会成员。你从中学到了什么，并将其运用到你的**业务**（Business: 指从事生产、销售商品或提供服务以获取利润的经济活动）中？

我认为有时，当你变得越来越**成功**（Successful: 指达到预期目标或取得良好结果）时，最**困难的事情**（Hardest things: 指最难以完成或解决的事情）之一就是保持这种状态。当你谈论Meta时，你谈论的是一个**应用家族**（Family of apps: 指由同一公司拥有和运营的一系列相关应用程序），它们的使用频率比世界上任何其他**产品**（Products: 指提供给市场以满足需求或欲望的物品或服务）都高。你谈论的是在**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，人工智能）和**现实实验室**（Reality Labs: Meta公司专注于虚拟现实和增强现实研究的部门）中**大胆的押注**（Audacious bets: 指大胆的、风险较高的投资或尝试），以及构建**下一个生态系统**（Next ecosystem: 指未来将形成的新型生态系统）。

看到尽管它已经取得了所有成功，却仍然保持着这种**持续的动力**（Constant Drive: 指持续不断地追求目标或进步的动力），这令人**震惊的**（Astounding: 指令人非常惊讶或震惊的），因为它意味着这家公司拥有**巨大的失败意愿**（Enormous willingness to fail: 指企业或个人愿意承担巨大风险并接受失败的可能性）。如果你想想，他们仍在努力**发明新事物**（Invent new things: 指创造出以前不存在的新产品、新方法或新概念），无论是在人工智能还是**元宇宙**（Metaverse: 指一个虚拟的、持久的、共享的3D空间，用户可以在其中进行交互），其中一些**生态系统**（Ecosystems: 指相互关联的系统或环境）尚未到来，有些可能还需要**多年以后**（Years away: 指在未来很多年之后）。我认为，拥有这种**意愿**（Willingness: 指乐意做某事或接受某事的状态），也许是**逆潮流而动**（Go against the wisdom of the crowd: 指不随大流，采取与大多数人不同的观点或行动），拥有**信念的勇气**（Courage of their conviction: 指坚持自己的信念并敢于行动的勇气），无论是在新的领域还是在**现有**（Existing: 指已经存在或正在使用的）领域，例如拥有**Facebook**（Facebook: Meta旗下的社交媒体平台）、**Instagram**（Instagram: Meta旗下的图片和视频分享平台）、**WhatsApp**（WhatsApp: Meta旗下的即时通讯应用）以及许多其他**出色的产品**（Fantastic products: 指非常优秀或令人惊叹的产品）的**应用家族**（Family of apps: 指由同一公司拥有和运营的一系列相关应用程序），我认为这都**非常鼓舞人心**（Super inspiring: 指非常激励人心或令人振奋的），我认为这对我以及其他人来说，就像是一个**展望**（Look forward: 指展望未来或对未来抱有期待），你可以看到运营**规模化业务**（Running scaled businesses: 指管理和发展已经达到一定规模的企业）和**创造新事物**（Inventing the new: 指创造出以前不存在的新产品、新方法或新概念）这两种**管理风格**（Management styles: 指领导者管理团队或组织的特定方式）并存。

<p class="english-text">I think to see that constant Drive despite all of the success it already has achieved is astounding because it means that the company has an enormous willingness to fail. If you think about it, they're still trying to invent new things whether it's in AI or in the metaverse and some of these ecosystems, you know, certainly are not here yet, some of which might be many years away to have the willingness I think to perhaps go against the wisdom of the crowd um, to do that to have the courage of their conviction um, to to do that both in the new as well as the existing, you know, that the family of apps with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and many other fantastic products, I think that's super inspiring and I think it's, you know, it's a great um, almost like look forward for for for for me and and and and I think others where you can see both management styles of running scaled businesses and inventing the new, you know, the other thing I've learned is just um, how great um, the leadership team at meta is at building the Next Generation, you know, meta is a company that largely not not entirely but largely has been built from within um, in terms of um, uh, mentoring and and giving the opportunities, you know, across the board um, across various products and I think, you know, that that also is something that resonates quite a lot with how we think about talent development at doores.</p>

我学到的另一件事是，Meta的**领导团队**（Leadership team: 指负责领导和管理组织或团队的高级管理人员）在**培养下一代**（Building the Next Generation: 指培养和发展未来的领导者或人才）方面做得非常出色。Meta是一家主要（并非完全）通过**内部培养**（Built from within: 指通过内部人才的培养和晋升来发展公司）来建设的公司，在**指导**（Mentoring: 指经验丰富的人对经验较少的人提供指导和支持）和提供**机会**（Opportunities: 指有利的条件或时机）方面，**全面地**（Across the board: 指全面地、普遍地）涵盖了**各种产品**（Various products: 指多种不同类型的产品）。我认为这与我们在DoorDash思考**人才发展**（Talent development: 指培养和提升员工技能和能力的过程）的方式非常**产生共鸣**（Resonates: 指与某人的想法或感受产生共鸣）。

### 领导力与个人成长

我尝试过，它叫做“**挪威4x4训练法**”（Norwegian 4x4: 一种高强度间歇训练法，包括4次4分钟的高强度运动，中间穿插休息），这是科学证明最能提高**最大摄氧量**（VO2 Max: 衡量人体在剧烈运动时，每分钟每公斤体重所能消耗的最大氧气量，反映心肺功能水平）的锻炼之一。尽管我会说这是一种困难的锻炼，如果你以前从未**跑过步**（Ran before: 指以前有过跑步的经验），我不会推荐它作为你的第一次锻炼。但对我来说，我真的相信**日常习惯**（Routines: 指有规律地重复的活动或行为）是寻找平衡和常态，或者说整合我的生活和工作的一种方式。对现在的我来说，日常习惯可以改变，你的**生活环境**（Life circumstances: 指个人所处的社会、经济和家庭状况）也会改变。我刚开始DoorDash时是**单身**（Single person: 指未婚或没有伴侣的人），当时在**约会**（Dating: 指与某人约会或谈恋爱），但现在我**已婚，有两个孩子**（Married with two kids: 指已婚并育有两个孩子），我的生活与十年前、十一年前大不相同。所以现在我的日常习惯是继续锻炼，我仍然每天锻炼。对我来说，这以前意味着跑步，很多是长跑。今天，这已经**转变和演变**（Shifted and morphed: 指某事物发生变化并演变成另一种形式）为其他类型的**运动**（Sports: 指为了娱乐或竞争而进行的体育活动），无论是**力量训练**（Weight training: 指通过举重来增强肌肉力量和耐力的训练）还是**柔术**（Jiu-Jitsu: 一种日本武术，注重关节技和地面格斗），尝试跑步之外的新型运动。
