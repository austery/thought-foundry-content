<p class="english-text">All right, everybody. Welcome back to the All-In podcast. We are super pleased to have with us today Senator Joe Manchin is joining us today here on the All-In Interview. And Chamath and I will be interviewing him on his new book, Dead Center in Defense of Common Sense. A great book. Welcome to the program, Joe Manchin. I know you like to be called Joe. So, Joe, welcome to the program.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 杰森，谢谢你。很高兴能和你们以及查马斯在一起。我一直关注你们，你们推出的内容以及邀请的嘉宾都令人难以置信。节目非常有趣，引人入胜，也很有深度。所以我很期待这次访谈。

<p class="english-text">Jason, thank you. And it's great to be with you and Chamath and I've followed you all and you've been unbelievable what you've put out and some of the people you've had on. It's been very entertaining, very interesting and very thoughtful. So anxious to be here.</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 谢谢。我们这里有个传统，不知道你多久看一次我们的访谈节目，但我们总是会为每位嘉宾准备一份个性化的礼物。你在书里谈到了你的第一辆车……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks. And we have a tradition here. I don't know how often you watch the interview show, but we always try to get a personalized gift for each of our guests. And so I in the book you talked about your first car, your 19...</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 哦，如果你们能帮我找到那辆车就好了。那是一辆子弹头造型的车，我自己怎么也找不到了。哇，就是它，白色内饰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, if I could if you could find that if you could find that thing for me, it was a bullet back. I can't find the car. Well, there it is with the white interior.</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 哦我的天。我们能买下它吗？不，我们已经搞定了。它现在就在你的车道上。等你离开办公室，它就会在你的游艇旁等着你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my god. Where can we buy it? No. No. We got it. It's in your driveway right now. When you get out of your office there, it'll be waiting for you by your yacht.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 让我告诉你……哦，在我的游艇旁。是啊，我有一艘大……哦我的天。那是一艘价值20万美元的拖网渔船。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me tell you that. Oh, by my yacht. Yeah, I got a big... Oh my god. Has a $200,000 trawler.</p>
</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya:** 没错，那是一艘拖网渔船。乔，听着。乔，杰森刚才证明了他根本没读这本书，他只是看了看中间的插图。他只做了这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a fishing trawler. Correct. And it's a trawler. Joe, listen. Joe, what what Jason has just proved is he has not read the book, but he looked at the pictures in the middle. That's all he's done.</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 不，我确实……他这是从中间的图片里抄来的。不，我没有实体书。我听的是有声书。但是乔，你做得很对，你自己朗读了这本书。很多作者，你知道，他们会找借口不做这件事，但这让书变得亲切多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I did the... He's ripping off the pictures in the middle. No, I don't have the physical book. I did the audio book. But Joe, you did the right thing. You read it yourself, which a lot of authors, you know, they get try to get talk out of doing it, but it makes it so much more personal.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 嘿，杰森，我当时不知道我应该这么做。突然有一天，我女儿希瑟说：“爸爸，你得去录音室开始读你的书了。”我说：“怎么……我为什么要这么做？”她说：“合同里写着呢。”我说：“我没看到啊。”她说：“我没给你看。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey, Jason, I didn't know I was supposed to do that. And I And all of a sudden, my daughter Heather says, "Dad, you got to show up at the studio and start reading your book." I says, "How how?" I said, "Why do I have to do that?" She says, "It's in the contract." I said, "I didn't see that." She says, "I didn't show it to you."</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 那是合同的一部分。大概要读六七个小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's part of the contract. It's like six or seven hours of reading.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 花了20个小时。整整20个小时。花了四天。让我告诉你，这是我做过的最棒的事情。它让我重新回味了我们写进书里的每一件事。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It took 20 hours. 20 hours. Four days. And let me tell you, it's the best thing I've ever done. The make me reminisce everything we put in the book.</p>

### 关键时刻：与拜登政府就“重建美好未来”法案的冲突

**Jason Calacanis:** 这本书太棒了。大家可以暂停播客去买一本，因为它非常重要。我们在节目前聊到“爱尔兰天主教童子军”，而你的书开头就讲了一个爱尔兰天主教童子军和一个意大利裔爱尔兰童子军打了一架。你是鹰级童子军吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, the the book's fantastic. Everybody go pause the uh podcast here and I just absolutely go buy it because it's so important and you know I mentioned um when we were just on the pre-show Irish Catholic Boy Scout and you start the book out with an Irish Catholic boy scout getting in a brewhaha Donnie Brookke with an Italian Irish boy scout. You an Eagle Scout?</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 不，我升到了“生活级”（Life Scout）。就差一点了。让我告诉你发生了什么。1959年，我永远不会忘记。西弗吉尼亚的煤矿实现了自动化。我住在一个只有400人的小煤矿社区。那里有三座你见过最大的煤矿，所有人都靠煤矿为生。突然有一天，我回到家，看到一群人坐在路边。我父亲有个小家具店，我祖父有个杂货店。那些人因为自动化被解雇了，失去了工作。帕特·基尼尔是我的童子军团长，是最好最好的人。如果你有一个好的童子军团长，你就能成功。如果不行，你就失败了。结果他不得不去俄亥俄州的洛兹敦，在汽车厂找了份工作。我们就这样失去了他。我也就此止步了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. No. I got up to I got up to life. And what happened? I was right next to it. Let me tell you what happened. 1959. Never forget it. The coal mines the coal mines got automated in West Virginia. I lived within I lived in little coal mining community, 400 people. And there was three of the largest coal mines you've ever seen. And everybody worked in the coal mines. Okay. And all of a sudden, I come home one day and my dad had a little furniture store. My grandfather had a grocery store. And there was all these guys sitting on the on the curb. They got laid off because it got automated. They lost their job. Pat Keenir was my scout leader. The best of the best of the best. If you have a good scout master, scout leader, you're going to make it. If you don't, you don't make it. And what happened? He had to go to Lordstown, Ohio to get a job in the auto factory. And we lost it. And I was done.</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 你因为“重建美好未来”（Build Back Better）法案和乔·拜登大吵了一架。我相信民主党或者他们的特工派人到你的拖网渔船，也就是你住的船屋那里，他们还派人骚扰你的家人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you got in a heater with Joe Biden over the the bill back better bill. Yeah. to the extent that like I believe the Democrats or operatives were sending people to your trawler, your your house boat that you're living on, they're sending people, you know, a little bit out your family maybe everywhere. I was and I had the death threats were unreal, Jason.</p>
</details>

**Jason Calacanis:** 来自你自己的党派。所以，也许你可以给我们讲讲那个故事，因为在我看来，这似乎是你政治生涯中的一个决定性时刻。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Your own party. So maybe you could take us to maybe tell that story because it feels to me and correct me if I'm wrong that this is a seminal moment in your political career or perhaps the...</p>

### 50/50分裂的参议院与“阻挠议事”规则

**Joe Manchin:** 我不建议任何人在一个50/50分裂的美国参议院里任职，因为参议院本应是世界上最审慎的机构。它之所以审慎，是因为你需要达到60票的门槛才能结束辩论，进入法案审议。我们的开国元勋们就是这样设计的，众议院是简单多数制，435票中拿到218票就行，你甚至不用和另一方对话，直接强行通过。乔治·华盛顿说，这就像一杯热茶，送到参议院就应该冷却下来，我们才能喝。这就是整个前提。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't recommend anybody getting caught in a 50/50 Senate in the United States because the United States Senate is supposed to be the the the uh most deliberate body in the world. And the reason it's deliberate because you have to have a 60 vote threshold for closure to get on to get on a bill. And with that, that was intended from our founding fathers is that the house is going to be simple majority. 218 out of 435. Don't even talk to the other side. You don't have to just shove it through. And George Washington said, you know, it's just going to be like a hot cup of tea and it goes over to the Senate. Should cool itself off so we can drink it. Well, that's the whole premise.</p>
</details>

人们总说要废除**阻挠议事**（Filibuster: 美国参议院的一种议事程序，允许少数派议员通过发表冗长演说等方式，无限期拖延对某项法案的表决，除非有60名参议员投票结束辩论），但这是我们所知的民主制度的圣杯。没有它，我们就不会是今天的美国。它迫使我们在其中一个机构里坐下来，让事情冷静下来，和众议院的朋友们说：“伙计们，事情得这么办，我们必须对此进行一些温和化处理。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And people keep saying, get rid of the filibuster. That's the holy grail to democracy as we know it. Because without it, we wouldn't be the a country we are now. It forced us to sit down in one of the bodies to calm things down and talk to our friends over in the House and say, "Guys, this is how it's got to be. We've got to moderate this some."</p>
</details>

这就是我从罗伯特·C·伯德参议员那里学到的，他曾是我们在西弗吉尼亚州任职超过50年的参议员。当我成为州长时，他一直告诉我他做某些事情的原因，以及规则为何如此。所以我对参议院的宗旨和我的职责有很深的理解。然后就出现了**预算和解程序**（Reconciliation: 美国参议院的一种特殊议会程序，允许以简单多数票通过与预算相关的法案，从而绕开需要60票才能结束辩论的“阻挠议事”规则）的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's what that's what it was that's what I'd always known from Bob Bird, Senator Robert C. Bird, our senator forever, 50 years plus in West Virginia. when I became governor, he kept I think he kind of knew in his mind that I would probably run for the Senate and he was getting to the end of his career or, you know, his age was creeping up on him pretty pretty hard. Anyway, he kept telling me all the different things of why he did certain things, why the rules were the way they were. So, I had a real understanding of the purpose of the Senate and my responsibilities. So, here we go. And then the the whole the whole thing on reconciliation, there's a reconciliation. It's it's a movement. It's a that we operate under. And it's basically stopping it stops anybody from preventing us to make sure we can take care of our financial responsibilities.</p>
</details>

预算和解程序只需要简单多数票。在参议院，这是唯一一个可以用51票通过法案的机制，而不需要60票来结束辩论。乔·拜登当选后，舒默在选举当晚每小时都给我打电话。我想，他为什么这么激动？因为在参议院，老实说，无论你是否是多数党领袖，只要你是参议员，你就有同样的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so reconciliation only takes a simple majority. Well, in the Senate, that's the only vehicle that you can have a 51 vote threshold without a closure vote of 60 votes getting to the bill. So then Joe Biden gets elected and I think the story in the book it starts out Schumer kept calling me that all every hour on the hour the night of the election and I'm thinking why is he so worked up? Because in the Senate in all honesty whether you're in the m if you're one of if you're not the majority leader but you're one of the senators in the caucus or the Dem Republicans you have the same power you have the same you know you can participate every senator can participate. They're all important 100 of them.</p>
</details>

他不停地说：“乔，佐治亚州的情况真的可能发生。”我心想，我们不可能赢得佐治亚州。但唐纳德·特朗普把它搅乱了。他去那里和所有人吵了一架。结果，我们的两位参议员候选人，拉斐尔·沃诺克和乔恩·奥索夫都赢了。舒默说：“你知道这意味着什么，对吧？”我说：“查克，我想这意味着你是多数党领袖了。”他说：“不，这意味着你几乎可以得到任何你想要的东西。”我说：“我只希望我的国家好。如果国家好，我的州也会好。我只关心这个。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So he keeps saying, Joe, he says, you know, understand this Georgia thing could really, you know, it could happen. I'm thinking, well, I don't think we're going to win Georgia. We hadn't and then wasn't predicted, but Donald Trump put him in play to be honest with you. Him going down there and getting into a tiff with everybody. He did. And so all of a sudden, you know, we got uh uh two senators that are running from there. And boom, the first one calls Raphael Warnock. He wins. Ossoff's later on that night. Boom. They call that and Schumer says, "You know what this means, don't you?" And I said, "Well, Chuck, I think it means you're the majority leader." He says, "No, it means that you can probably have anything you want." And I said, "I just want my country to do well. If my country does well, my state will do well. That's all I care about."</p>
</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya:** 你认为他说那话是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think he meant when he said that?</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 我很清楚他的意思。查克·舒默的意思就是，你可以为家乡争取任何东西。当然，罗伯特·伯德也曾因为带回太多所谓的“政治分肥”（pork）而备受批评。他认为我现在处在有利位置，可以超越伯德。但我从未那么想过。我从没想过要如此不公平地倾斜天平。他想的是，好吧，你想要什么？我只想让我的国家好起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know exactly what he meant, Chamath. I know exactly. Chuck Schumer basically coming from where he comes from. It just whatever you can take back home. And of course, Bob Bird was always criticized for taking so much what they call pork back home. And that was the the situation he thought, well, I'm in a cat bird seat now. I could outdo Bob Bird. I just never thought that. I just never thought of tipping the scale so unfavorably to where we all should be doing well if we can move our country forward. But that's what he thought. Okay, what do you want? I just want my country to do well.</p>
</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya:** 当时有很多人讨论，某个政党可能会试图取消阻挠议事规则，这样当他们拥有简单多数时，就可以通过任何他们想要的法律。在那个时刻，你承受了很大的压力，要求你支持取消阻挠议事规则。你能否给我们讲讲当时的情况，你是如何做出决定的，以及党内忠诚派的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When that happened, there was a lot of thought that the filibuster and and maybe just to take a step back for the audience, the whole point is that as you explained, basically laws can get passed in one of two ways. The real way, which is that you have to find some sort of compromise with folks on the other side, get to 60 votes, or the other way, which is a more of a budgetary process called reconciliation, which is a simple majority. And there's been a lot of talk that one party at some point will try to eliminate the filibuster so that when they have a simple majority, they can pass any law they want. And there was a moment, I think, in that point where you came under a lot of pressure to get on board with trying to eliminate the filibuster. Can you just give us a window into that and what happened and how you made the decision and what the what the reaction was from party loyalists?</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 让我们回到2013年，当时哈里·里德因为巴拉克·奥巴马无法完成内阁和一些法官的任命而想废除阻挠议事规则。我当时就说：“哈里，我绝不会那么做。”你不能因为无法与人合作就这么干。我说：“你和米奇（麦康奈尔）甚至都不坐下来谈谈。”我求哈里去和米奇达成协议，一致同意对所有总统任命的人员采用51票门槛，但不能用于终身任命的法官。但他不肯。他们说：“哦不，我们必须搞定法官。”我说：“你们要为终身任命的法官把确认程序改成51票？你们疯了吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's go back to 2013 when Harry Reid because of Barack Obama couldn't get his appointments done for his for his cabinet and things of that sort and and some judges. So, the majority party can change the rules. If they want to blow it apart, they can blow it apart. Well, Harry Reid decided that he wanted to get rid of the filibuster. And uh I just said, Harry, I'd never do that. I mean, my goodness, you can't just because you can't work with someone. I said, "You and Mitch don't even sit down and talk. You don't have a cup of coffee, let alone discuss what should be important for both sides." And at that time, I even told Harry, I said, "Harry, the only thing that the president's wanting that he got he won re-election 2012, gets reappointed 2013, reinaugurated, and here we go." He wants to put his team together. That's will and pleasure. And I always believe that will and pleasure that will and pleasure means you're you get elected. You're the executive Chamath and you said, "Joe, I want you to be part of this. I'm going to come and go. It's your will and pleasure. I'm not staying over. Once you're gone, I'm gone. Why not let you have your team unless I then they can do a FBI background check, find out if I'm of sound character and moral values and no criminal records and boom, let me go." So I I begged Harry just go over and cut a deal with Mitch and say, "Mitch, let's together do this unanimously. That 51 vote threshold for all of the president's appointment, people that'll be will and pleasure, no holdovers whatsoever. But you can't do it to judges that get lifetime appointments. You can't do it for other other uh different agencies that have a six-year or a nine-year term. Just will and pleasure." And I I thought that would be very simple. And he wouldn't do it. They said, "Oh, no. We got to get the judges. I says, "You're going to basically change the confirmation process to 51 votes for a lifetime? Are you crazy?"</p>
</details>

但他们还是这么做了，只针对地区和巡回法院的法官。猜猜共和党一上台发生了什么？米奇·麦康奈尔说：“好，那我们就对最高法院也这么干。”现在我们就有了一个6比3的最高法院。这招没起什么好作用。查克·舒默也直接表示想废除阻挠议事规则。拜登一直都是阻挠议事规则的捍卫者，你怎么能因为自己掌权了就想强加于人，就背弃自己的价值观呢？我说我不会那么做。所以，我和柯尔丝滕·西内马投票反对废除阻挠议事规则，阻止了这一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they did it. And then guess what happened? They did it for the They did it for district and circuit judges. Okay? Didn't do it for Supreme Court. Guess what happened as soon as Republicans took over? They were in control. Mitch McConnell says, "Fine, we'll do it for Supreme Court. Now we have a 63 court." didn't work too well before he did it. You know, whether it be Harry or that. And during this, Chuck Schumer's just come out directly and has said he wanted to get rid of the filibuster. That's how they were going to run it with Joe Biden. Well, Joe Biden had always been a defender of the filibuster. How can you flip on your values when all of a sudden now because you're in charge and you want to just shove things down people's throat? I said, I'm not going to do that. So, myself and Kyrsten Sinema voted against the filibuster, which stopped all that. I was all for the voting. I mean, all the concern the voting act, voting rights act, all that. But I said, we have to find a pathway that we have some Republicans, 10 Republicans that will work with us.</p>

### 巨额开支法案引发的激烈对抗

**Joe Manchin:** 他们做的第一件事是《美国救援计划》（American Rescue Plan, ARP）。拜登一上任，二月份就推出了这个庞大的改革计划。要知道，我们刚刚在2020年向市场注入了3.2万亿美元。他现在又想再投入至少1.9万亿，总额达到5.1万亿。我们国家每年的现金流也就5万多亿美元。他们这是要把总量翻倍。市场根本消化不了。但我说：“你们疯了吗？我们还不知道那3.2万亿会带来什么后果呢。”但他们想推行社会改革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh the first thing they did was a ARP. The American Rescue Plan was his first bill. Soon as Joe Biden gets elected, boom, he gets sworn in and in February, he comes out with the ARP, American Rescue Plan, which is this big overhaul. Okay, we had just done, you all know the finances better than probably anybody observing. We had put $3.2 2 trillion dollars into the market as co in 20 in 2020 March of from March 2020 up until the end of the year and then Joe Biden takes over. So we already put 3.2 trillion. He comes out with the American Rescue Plan. They want to put another 1.9 minimum 1.9. Now we're at 5.1. Well, our cash flow is about a little over $5 trillion a year that we run the country on. They're doubling the amount. You can't digest that. that the market can't take it. But they were doing it. And I says, "Are you people crazy right now? We don't even know what what the 3.2 is going to do, let alone but they wanted it was they were be chasing a social reform."</p>
</details>

他们听到我在走廊里抱怨，一位参议员立刻给白宫打电话说：“曼钦又在惹麻烦了。”因为是50/50的局面，他们必须有我。他们马上把我叫到白宫。我坐在那儿说：“总统先生，我求你了，请不要在这个法案上使用预算和解程序。我知道这不是你的法案，这是伯尼·桑德斯和伊丽莎白·沃伦的。”我说：“请不要这么做，先生。你是竞选总统的舞台上唯一一个说自己知道这个地方怎么运作，可以和两党合作，可以达成协议的人。我一直认为你是那样的人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I told him, I said, "Mr. President, they heard me grumbling uh in the hallway and one of the senators called the White House immediately and says, "Manchin making trouble already." Well, it was 50/50. They had to have me. say, "Call me right over to the White House." And I'm sitting there. I said, "Mr. President, I'm begging you, please don't do the don't do reconciliation on this bill. If this is your bill, which I know it's not, this is a Bernie Sanders and this is Elizabeth Warren cuz I'd heard them respectfully. I, you know, I can agree in some and I disagree, but it was just too big a bite coming right out of co and we had a vaccine that was working." So I said, "Please don't, sir." And I said, "You're the only one on the stage running for president with all that big lineup that says, you know how the place work. You can work on both sides. You can make a deal." And I always known you to be that person.</p>
</details>

舒默让你热血沸腾，以为可以这样运作。我知道他们想用四项大型预算和解法案来运作第117届国会。我说：“除非我死了，否则这不会发生。”他们把我叫到白宫，让所有人都离开房间。总统伸过手抓住我的胳膊说：“乔，你的国家需要你。”我心想：“我该说什么？”我抓住他的胳膊说：“总统先生，国家也需要你，需要我们所有人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I said, "Schumer's got you all fired up thinking that's how you're going to run it." And I knew in my mind they wanted to run that what we call the 117th Congress. The Congress is a two-year stint. Every two years you have an election. So, Congress, we were in 117th, just starting it. My my uh thought process was is that Schumer had convinced the president that we could run this Congress for two years with four reconciliation big bills, two in two in 2021 and two in 2022. And I says, over my dead body, that's not going to happen. That's not what we're here for. And that's not how this place is supposed to work. So they called me over in the White House and they grabbed you always Jason. You're sitting there and you see it on television. They made everybody leave the room and we're sitting there and then president reaches over and grabs your arm and he says, "Joe, your country needs you." I'm thinking, "What the hell do I say now?" And I grabbed his arm. "Country needs you, too. It needs us all."</p>
</details>

我说：“先生，我求你不要这么做。为什么不把这个法案交给有管辖权的委员会，让我们来处理呢？给我们一个时间限制，比如60天。”但他不肯。后来，他变得非常粗鲁，直接告诉我，如果我毁了他的法案，他再也不会跟我说话了。我说：“如果我能毁掉这个该死的法案，你确实不该再跟我说话了，因为如果可以，我会的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

Do what you got to do then. Oh, no. Got to do it now, Joe. Got to go. Got to go. Okay. So, we go. And then we shut it down there for about 12 or 14 hours one day cuz I thought they lost their mind. They wanted to expand the unemployment benefits. I said, "Do you understand what you're dealing with now? you got inflation coming at you so hard because people have been cooped up. We've sent everybody a check. And I told him this, he kind of giggled. I said, I said, "Mr. President, we've sent everybody a check. And if we've missed anybody, it was by mistake cuz you intended to send everybody a damn check." And I said, "They want to go spend money and there's nobody working. The supply chains are shut down. There's nothing. They're going to pay exorbitant amounts to get what they want. You're just fueling it, sir." Oh god. We went through all of that and he that's when he got pretty vulgar and just told me I'm going to you're going to you know if you you kill my effing bill I'll never talk to you again.

果然，一个月后，他们带着“重建美好未来”（BBB）法案回来了。现在他们谈论的是6万亿美元，如果算上所有改革，那个法案至少要10万亿。我做不到。我告诉他：“总统先生，对不起，我真的做不到。”他们花了八个月的时间来打压我。我不得不请安保人员。

### 来自党内的巨大压力与威胁

**Chamath Palihapitiya:** 那是什么样的？压力运动是什么样的？因为不仅仅是总统，就像你在书里写的，有人出现在你家门口，有人划着皮划艇在你船边举着抗议标语。那非常激烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is that? What is that like? Like, what does the pressure campaign look like? It's because it's not just the president exactly as you write in the book. It's people showing up at the house. It's people with little kayaks with protest signs around your boat. It's pretty intense.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 非常激烈。我可以告诉你，国会警察每天都打电话给你，说你的死亡威胁现在已经足够严重，所以我们必须派人接你上班，送你回家。情况很严重。他们知道我孩子在哪上学，孙子孙女在哪，孩子们住在哪。我心想：“天啊，这太疯狂了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's pretty intense. But I can tell you one thing. When every day uh the Capitol police call you and says your death threats are serious enough right now, so we have to have, you know, we'll meet you down at where you live and we'll bring you to work and we'll take you back home. You know, things are pretty serious. I never wanted to know the extent, but I knew they were serious. And then one time they said, "This is really getting serious now because now we got things. They know where your children go to school. They know where your grandchildren are, where your kids live." And I'm thinking, "Oh my god, this is crazy."</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 我认为是组织的。他们是拿钱办事的，查马斯。因为我很多住在河边的朋友假装问他们怎么才能找到一份抗议的工作。他们说，哦，只要注册就能拿到每小时15美元。我简直不敢相信。

<details>

They were paid Chamath because a lot of my friends who live on the down at the river on the Potomac River with me on the boat they they played like how can I get a job with you? How can I do this if I want to protest? They say oh just sign up and get $15 an hour. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. They were telling me that.</p>

**Joe Manchin:** 哦不，罗恩·克莱恩，我要说实话。他是个聪明人，好人，但他已经变得非常左倾，并且把乔也推向了左边。我第一次去白宫时就说：“总统先生，你的幕僚是我见过最自由派的。”他说：“嗯，乔，他们告诉我我的幕僚是最多元化的。”我说：“我们不是在谈论多元化，先生。我们是在谈论疯狂。这些人非常左。”罗恩组建了那个团队。我一直说，你的幕僚把你推得太左了，总统先生。你从来没那么左过。

First time I went over. And he said, "Well, Joe, they tell me I have the most diversified staff." I said, "We're not talking about diversity, sir. We're talking about bat crazy. We're talking about people I've known, I've worked with in the hallway forever, and I know where they came and where they worked before. These are people real far left. And Ron put that team together. And I I know that because I kept saying that your staff is pushing you too far left, Mr. President. You've never been that far left.</p>

### 对比奥巴马与特朗普的执政风格

**Chamath Palihapitiya:** 你在书中写道，特朗普是你合作过的最投入的总统之一，还有比尔·克林顿。你还说，在特朗普任期的头两年，你和他交谈的次数比在奥巴马八年任期内还多。请为我们对比一下奥巴马和特朗普，帮助我们理解你所看到的他们各自的优缺点。

**Joe Manchin:** 我认为巴拉克·奥巴马总统是个非常好的人。但他的政治立场……他当选民主党提名人后，把一切都转向了可再生能源。我心想，那我们这些煤矿工人怎么办？我们为国家做的一切怎么办？没有任何计划来替代我们的工作机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think President Barack Obama is a very good man, you know, and and but his politics, I knew him when he was a US senator representing Illinois and he knew about the coal industry and I you of course I come from the coal industry being governor of West Virginia and growing up in in the coal fields and we talked about fossil and why we needed this that and everything. He wanted me to help him and vote for something that would help his called uh uh future gen, which is the new uh coal fired plant that was going to be uh CO2 capture and all this and that. They called it back. That was a billion. It was a billion dollar project. The government was sponsoring and I told him I couldn't participate. I was one of the four states I pulled out and put my support behind and they got it. Never built the plant, but they got the the award. So, I knew he knew it. And then all of a sudden he becomes a number he becomes the the nominee from the Democratic party and switched everything to to renewables. And I'm thinking, well, what are we going to do with all the things that the coal miners have done and all we've done for our country? Does that mean you're going to bring new jobs or this or that? There was no plan to replace any opportunities to live the quality of life and to live where they wanted to live with it their culture and and and who we are and family oriented in the Appalachia.</p>

大约一年后，我们在罗斯福厅开会。轮到我发言时，我说：“总统先生，你在妖魔化煤炭方面做得真是太好了。”他跳了起来，对我大发雷霆。我说：“因为这是事实。你设定的基准我们根本无法达到，因为没有技术能让我们的行业满足这些要求，这给了你关闭它的权利。”他曾说过，你们尽管去建燃煤电厂，我们会让你们破产。他知道技术还没到位。我心想，天啊，发生了什么？你把我们抛弃了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And boy, I'll tell you, we had a meeting about one year afterwards and I was uh in the National Governance Association leadership and we had Democrats and Republicans. I finally got a meeting with him in the Roosevelt room and I'll never forget that. and uh and we were going around the table and different governors were speaking. He came to me and I says, "Mr. President, you've done one hell of a good job at villainizing Cole." And he jumped up and it went nuts on me. I'm thinking, "Woo boy, here we go." And he said, "Why would you say something like that?" And I said, "Because it's true." I says, "You have basically put benchmarks that we can't make because there's no technology that we can get our industry to meet those that gives you the right to shut it And he made a statement, if you recall, go ahead and build a coal fired plant and we'll break you. He knew that we technology wasn't there. So I'm thinking, Christ, what happened? You're leaving us behind.</p>

Then we always had a couple good jokes to tell each other and kind of broke eye, you know, we had a lot of fun. And with with and with President Donald Trump, you know, you go meet him, he's charming as can be. Sits down, talks with you. He says, "Hey, Joe, what about this? What about that?"

### 核心哲学：问责制、工作要求与 entitlement culture

**Jason Calacanis:** 你在书中谈到的，你在开支和福利问题上展现的勇气，源于你成长过程中形成的坚韧的个人主义、个人责任感和问责制。

**Joe Manchin:** 我最后一次和拜登总统会面时，他把我叫到白宫，带我上楼到生活区。我们谈话时，我说：“总统先生，我做不到。我真的做不到。”我说：“你知道，我和你都是同一个年代的人。我清楚地记得，13岁时看电视，1961年约翰·肯尼迪的就职典礼：‘不要问你的国家能为你做什么，而要问你能为你的国家做什么。’”

I really can't get there sir. And I said you know you and I are both at the same vintage. You're a little bit older but not that much. I said we're we're in the same vintage.

如果我们通过这项立法，你要求我投票支持的BBB法案，你就在改变这个国家的精神面貌，变成“我的国家还能为我多做些什么？”我不是这样出生，不是这样被抚养长大，我不相信那一套，我做不到。就算你用枪指着我的头，我也不能投票支持它。

我祖母收留了所有人。她有三条规矩：不能喝酒，不能骂人，必须工作。所以我最早接触到的就是规矩，而且都是好规矩。我祖父从不记账，他把所有的钱都放在口袋里。他是意大利移民。有人来找他借钱，他会说：“当然，宝贝。这里有扫帚和铲子，去把停车场打扫干净，我就给你五块钱。”我明白了，你必须为那五块钱做点什么。

### 对美国政治体系的改革建议

**Joe Manchin:** 我得出的结论是，我们需要任期限制。我是在一次市政厅会议上被一位女士说服的。她说：“乔，想想看。如果我们有任期限制，也许我们能从你这里得到一个好的任期。”我无言以对。从那时起，我就一直支持任期限制。参议院两个六年任期就够了，12年足矣。

I I knew her and Susie, I said, "Tell me why." She says, "Well, I just think this would be it'd be better for us to have turnover." And I says, and I wasn't for it. And I I gave her all the reasons. I said, "You're going to lose your most experienced people with the talent and know how." Boom, boom, boom. I went through everything. She said, "Joe, think of it this way. If we had term limits, maybe we get one good term out of you." I had no comeback. She convinced me right there. And from that point on, I've been for term limits. And I'm more for it today than I've ever been for it. And I'm I'm And the reason I'm telling you, yeah, maybe we'd get one good term where you'd have the courage to do the conviction with the oath you took to defend and protect the Constitution, do the job, put country before party, quit playing this game, quit worrying about getting reelected. And it's gotten to the point now public service truly when he said John Kennley says the most noblest of all profession public service that's gone. It's fame and fortune now.

**Joe Manchin:** 我可以列出两党各六七个人。我总是偏爱前州长们。州长不能只当一边的州长。比如缅因州的安格斯·金，弗吉尼亚的马克·华纳，蒂姆·凯恩，还有迈克·朗兹，约翰·霍文。共和党方面，丽莎·穆考斯基和苏珊·柯林斯一直是我合作的对象，还有米特·罗姆尼。他们总是寻求做正确的事，不关心政治。还有比尔·卡西迪，他是最优秀的人之一，聪明、敏锐，总是想做正确的事。

But I was responsible for making sure the repairs on the roads didn't do that. Okay. So you like Senator King, Angus King from Maine, former governor. You have Mark Warner, Virginia, former governor. Tim Kaine, former governor. You have Jean Shaheen, former governor. Maggie Hassan, former governor. You have Mike Rounds, former governor. John Hovind, former governor. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins were always my go-to people on the Republican side. And Mitt Romney, two of three of the best of the best. You could always work with them because they were always looking to do the right thing. They didn't care about politics. And then I always had you got Senator Cortez Masto, you have uh you know there's so many Jackie Rosen on the Tom Tillis on the on the Senate side on the Republican side. Bill Cassidy is one of the best of the best. Bill Cassidy is bright, sharp, always wanting to do the right thing, always very very articulate and he will get down to the nitty-gritty and go into the depths of it to find out an answer.

### 第三方政治的可能性与选举改革

By the primaries you can say well it's by redistricting and all this. It's really the primary process. The primary process is this. I cannot being a no party affiliate right now an independent that's that's my registration. If I want to vote for a friend of mine who's a Republican in West Virginia, the Republican party in West Virginia will not let me vote in their primary unless I register Republican.

**Joe Manchin:** 对奥巴马的期望是，他会带来一个全新的、包容的局面。我们期望很高，我认为他很有同情心，但他只是没有和立法机构很好地沟通。然后是特朗普，我们不知道会发生什么，但我们想，这是一个商人。我从第一天就和他会面，我发现我与他正在做的事情更加同步，因为他明白我们需要一个全方位的能源政策。

<p class="english-text">Expectation on Obama was was that he was bringing a complete different scenario to it. an all-inclusive scenario as you will every now it was possibility for all of us to participate no matter what your gender what your race were boom boom boom so with that we were expecting an awful lot and I think he had a lot of compassion but he just it just didn't communicate well with the legislature I didn't know that because I didn't serve with him until I got there at the end of 2010 2011 and I could see you've got to participate you've got to get involved you got to call them over to the White House and work him. I thought he could have done a lot more with that to get better participation. And basically, we got rid. They got rid of the filibuster. We lost the filibuster for the uh judges judicial system and I wasn't upset by losing him for basically appointments that were will and pleasure, but it went further than that. So, that I think that help that hap helped erode a lot of the checks and balances we had. Then it went further after that, too. So, with that being said, then you go right in from there. And then we have uh Trump. We didn't know what to expect, but we were thinking, here's a businessman always told us how successful and things of this we were expecting some things. And I I met with him from day one and when 2016 uh and talked to him and then I met with him 2017 2018. a lot of the things he did, I was more in sync with what he was doing because he understood we had to have an all-in energy policy.</p>

然后是乔·拜登，我曾与他共事很长时间，对他寄予厚望。但天啊，那真是个巨大的失望。他变得非常左倾，我认为那并非出自他本心。我认为特朗普总统有机会做出不朽的成就，因为他有非常强大的基础支持。我希望看到他的同情心，看到那个当你走进去和他交谈时能迷住你的人。他是中东问题的完美总统：强人，硬汉。但在西方世界，我们需要外交，需要一点妥协。

<p class="english-text">And then we have Joe Biden who I had an awful lot of, oh man, here's a guy I've worked with for a long time. And in Joe Biden, when there was a shutdown with Ted Cruz in 2013, I'll never forget this. It was Biden uh Obama sends Joe Biden to make a deal. Open this government up, get a deal done. Joe Biden goes directly to Mitch McConnell, sits down, old buddies and old friends. They cut a deal. We open the Cong We open the government back up. And I went into caucus the next the next week. go in the caucus with the Democrats. And uh Harry Reid says, "I told President Obama, don't ever send that damn Joe Biden back to make a deal. We don't want him here at all making a deal for Democrats." Now he's the president. Okay. Going to be the president. I think, boy, we got it now. And boy, was that a let down. Went far to the left. And I don't think that was in his heart. But he came out of Iowa bad. Came out of New Hampshire even worse. went to South Carolina, got resurrected, and within three weeks, everybody dropped south. Hadn't make a deal, I think, with the wrong side of that, and try to calm it down. And just for the sake of being president, I think he had to sign up, and his people took him to the promised land of the far left, which has no return. Now, with with I think President Trump has a chance to be monumental in what he can do because he has that support from a real strong base. I want to see the compassion. I want to see the man that could just charm you when you walk in and talk to him. I want to see that being shown now. He is the perfect president for the Middle East. Strong man, strong arm. He I say what I mean. I mean what I say and boom, boom, boom. Using my military might work in the western part of the world where we have diplomacy. We work we give and take a little bit. He's a good enough of a negotiator to understand that, but they're still playing his people are pushing him to stay hard hard. And it's just not it's not what we need right now in America. We need a leader with that compassion, but the ability to bring us together and make us work together in the United States.</p>

**Joe Manchin:** 首先，我非常希望能参加民主党的短期初选。我曾恳求他们这么做，在乔·拜登……我恳求他们。我说：“你们必须消除一些他们被贴上的标签。”那本是消除很多东西的好时机。

<p class="english-text">I think about first of all, I would have loved to have been and I begged the Democratic party to have a mini primary, 30-day primary when Joe Biden... I begged him. I said, "You had to you had to dispel some of the things that they were labeled with." And not every Democrat believed in that. That would have been a time to dispel a lot of that stuff.</p>

**Jason Calacanis:** 你会参加那样的快速竞选吗？

<p class="english-text">I'd have been right in there. I'd have I'd done everything I could to be talking about things that we're talking about now. Do we need energy? Absolutely. Don't turn your back on energy. This is make sure we do it better than anybody in the world. Uh do you need do you need a strong border? Well, let me ask you something. You all have property lines. When you buy a piece of property and a house, you either build a fence or you lived in a gated area, you want to protect your property. Why can't we protect our borders, but also have an legal immigration policy that works. I got to brought all of that stuff out. And I think a lot of Democrats believe like I do, but they've gone so far to the left they can't retreat.</p>

**Jason Calacanis:** 那么2028年呢？

<p class="english-text">And so 2028 to Jason's question.</p>
</details>

**Joe Manchin:** 2028年，伙计们，我们拭目以待。我会尽我所能帮助我的国家。但你要知道，到2028年，我已经81岁了，和拜登差不多大，也接近特朗普的年龄。米特·罗姆尼和我在谈论竞选。他说：“乔，我们得组建一个新党。”我说：“叫什么名字？”他说：“我们就叫它‘不蠢党’（the not stupid party）。”我说：“那我们掺和进来干嘛？”他说：“乔，听着，他们不想要两个老白人来竞选。”我说：“我们可是现在场上最年轻的了。”

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, 2028, guys. I mean, if we'll have to see. I'll do anything I can to help my country. But, you know, I want to make sure 2028 I will be what? I'm 78 years old right now. I'm going to be 81. Same as Biden, close to Trump. Yeah. And you're sharp as attack. And I'm I'm a year younger. I'll be the I'll give you something. Mitt Romney and I were talking about running. I said, " Mitt," he said, "Joe, let's we have to start a new party." I said, "What would it be, man?" He said, "We'll call it the not stupid party." I said, "Hell, my question is why we're involved then." Yeah. And And then... what are we doing here? Yeah. And then I said, "Well, man, what do you think?" He said, "Joe, listen." He said, "They don't want two old white guys running." And I said, "We're the youngest ones out there right now."</p>
</details>

我们拭目以待吧。我会尽我所能参与其中。如果上帝给我健康和力量，我将以任何可能的方式参与。但我保证，我会努力寻找那些把国家置于政党之上的人，支持他们，让这个国家重回正轨。

<p class="english-text">We were both of your younger. We have a lot of fun with that. We talked a lot. Anyway, look, we'll just see what happens. I'm going to I'm going to be involved every way I can. And the good Lord gives me the health and strength to participate. Any way I possibly can, I will. But I guarantee I'll be trying to find the right people that put country before party and all the behind him and let's get this country back on track.</p>
