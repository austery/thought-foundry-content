### 特朗普在明尼阿波利斯改变策略

**Michael Bavaro**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是Michael Bavaro。这是“每日播报”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: From The New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is the daily.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 今天，我们讲述**亚历克斯·普雷伊（Alex Prey）**之死事件的后续影响，如何迫使**特朗普（Donald Trump）**总统在明尼阿波利斯改变策略，以及关于这些改变是真实还是仅仅象征性的辩论。我与白宫记者**佐兰·卡诺·扬斯（Zolan Kano Youngs）**和**泰勒·佩吉（Tyler Pager）**进行了对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Today, the story of how the fallout from Alex Prey's death forced President Trump to change course in Minneapolis and the debate over whether those changes are real or merely symbolic. I spoke with White House reporters Zolan Kano Youngs and Tyler Pager.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 现在是1月28日，星期三。佐兰和泰勒，我们今天下午与你们进行这次对话，正值特朗普总统显然决定尝试传达他希望改变策略，或者至少改变其政府在明尼阿波利斯移民镇压行动的基调。此前，亚历克斯·普雷伊被杀，引发了广泛的愤慨。我们将讨论这种改变的意义有多大，或者有多肤浅。但泰勒，让我们先来梳理一下在普雷伊死亡后的几天里，幕后实际发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: It's Wednesday, January 28th. Zolan and Tyler, we are having this conversation with you on Tuesday afternoon at this moment when President Trump has clearly decided to try to telegraph that he wants to change course or at least change the tone around his administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis following the killing of Alex Prey and all of the outrage it inspired. And we're going to talk about how meaningful or superficial that change really is. But Tyler, let's first talk through what's actually happened behind the scenes in the days since Freddy's death.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 迈克尔，关于这个周末，有趣的一点是，这是特朗普总统在冬天里为数不多的留在华盛顿而不是在佛罗里达州棕榈滩他的俱乐部和住所海湖庄园度过的周末之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: So Michael, one of the interesting things just about this weekend is that it's one of the rare weekends in the winter where Donald Trump is in Washington and not in Palm Beach, Florida at his club and residence, Mar-a-Lago.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 特朗普留在华盛顿的原因是，他在白宫为一部关于他妻子梅拉尼娅（Melania）的新纪录片举办了一场特别的首映式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: And the reason that Trump stayed in Washington was because he was hosting a special premiere at the White House for the new documentary about his wife Melania.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 因此，总统花了很多时间在椭圆形办公室和椭圆形办公室旁边的餐厅观看媒体对明尼阿波利斯事件和亚历克斯·普雷伊枪击案的报道。他花了很多时间看福克斯新闻（Fox News），但也会切换频道。另一位美国公民在明尼阿波利斯被联邦探员枪杀。特朗普政府本周一直在为探员的行为辩护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: And so the president is spending a lot of the weekend in the Oval Office and in the dining room off the Oval Office watching media coverage of what's going on in Minneapolis and the shooting of Alex Prey. He spent a lot of the time watching Fox News but flips around channels. Another American citizen has been shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis. The Trump administration is defending the agent's actions this week.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 我看到了各种批评这种回应和对这位明尼阿波利斯男子被杀事件的声音。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: And just saw this cacophony of voices criticizing the response and the killing of this man in Minneapolis.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 特朗普政府如此轻易地撒谎，这应该让美国公众感到震惊。当你们能亲眼看到证据时，他们会当着你们的面撒谎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily. will lie to your face when you can see the evidence for yourself.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 特朗普政府官员称他为“国内恐怖分子”，而他手中只有一部手机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: He was called by the Trump administration officials a domestic terrorist when all he had in his hand was a cell phone.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 美国人不喜欢他们现在看到的一切。没有人喜欢联邦探员进入他们的州。那么，现在的目标是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Americans don't like what they're seeing right now. Nobody likes feds coming into their state. And so what's the goal right now?

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 这种批评是值得注意且罕见的，因为它不仅仅是民主党人，也不是共和党中那些最响亮的批评者在反对他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: And this criticism is notable and rare because it's not just Democrats and it's not the usual loudest critics in the Republican party that are pushing back on him.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: **参议员比尔·卡西迪（Bill Cassidy）**称这种情况“令人不安”，并写道：“**ICE**和**DHS**的信誉岌岌可危。”参议员，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Senator Bill Cassidy calling the situation disturbing, writing, "The credibility of ICE in DHS are at stake." Senator,

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 你有参议员比尔·卡西迪在社交媒体上表示，这起枪击事件“极其令人不安”。**汤姆·蒂利斯（Tom Tillis）**也呼吁进行调查。这是对这个白宫的显著反对，特别是对一个要求其党派忠诚的白宫。而且，除了共和党议员之外，甚至一些同情政府的媒体人士，如福克斯新闻（Fox News）的主播**特雷·戈迪（Trey Gowdy）**和**玛丽亚·巴蒂罗莫（Maria Bartiromo）**，也在批评高级政府官员的言论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: you've got Senator Bill Cassidy who said on social media that the shooting was incredibly disturbing. Tom Tillis called for an investigation as well. That's notable push back against this White House, particularly a White House that demands loyalty from its party. And beyond the Republican lawmakers, even some sympathetic media figures like Fox News hosts Trey Gowdy and Maria Bartiromo were also criticizing the rhetoric from senior administration officials.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 那么，你收集了证据，对吗？你手里有那把手枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Well, you you've collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 那是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: That's right.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 他是如何使用那把手枪威胁边境巡逻队的？威胁是什么？他拿着他的相机，对吧？他在拍摄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: And and how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 而迈克尔，这还不算特朗普总统如果收看MSNBC或CNN会看到的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: And Michael, that's to say nothing of what Trump would have seen if he tuned into MS Now or CNN.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 你看到那些视频时看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: What do you see when you watch those videos?

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 一场处决。一场绝对的处决。从任何角度看都显示如此。他们在他倒在地上，身体已经没有生命迹象时，还在继续向他开枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: An execution. An absolute execution. He There's no Every angle shows it. and they continued to fire bullets at him while his body was lifeless on the ground

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 官员们说，政府基本上枪杀了一个人，并且“搞砸了回应”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: where officials were saying that the government basically gunned down this man and bungled the response evidence.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 谎言的危害不止于误导。它们为不合理之事辩护。在**国土安全部（Department of Homeland Security）**、**ICE**、**海关和边境保护局（Customs and Border Protection）**缺乏问责的情况下，我们必须坚持真相。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: The lies do more than mislead. They justify the unjustifiable and in the absence of accountability from the Department of Homeland Security, from ICE, from Customs and Border Protection, it is up to us to hold on to the truth.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。我看到了一些报道，基本上是说政府谋杀了这个人，然后系统性地撒谎，尽管有视频非常清楚地证明了事实相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. I caught some of that coverage and it was basically the government has murdered this man and then systematically lied about what happened in the face of video that very clearly contradicted it.

</details>

### 特朗普的担忧与策略调整

**Tyler Pager**: 绝对是，迈克尔。总统关心的并非一定是事件本身。你知道，他为一个人被杀而感到不安。但迈克尔，他真正担心的是，这种混乱、这种叙事正在掩盖他在移民执法和与墨西哥边境问题上取得的所有他认为的进展。这些问题是他政治身份的核心。总统整个周末都在与助手和盟友交谈，抱怨这种叙事被这种武力和一名男子被杀所压倒，这分散了他想要传达的信息——即他已经封锁了边境，并且正在清除国内最暴力的无证移民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Absolutely, Michael. And what the president was concerned about was not necessarily the incident itself. You know, he was disturbed that a man had been killed. But Michael, what he was really worried about was that this chaos, this narrative was overshadowing all of the progress he felt he has made on the issue of immigration enforcement and the border with Mexico. These are issues that are core to his political identity. And the president was talking to aids and allies throughout the weekend and venting about how the narrative was being overtaken by this use of force and by the killing of a man and it was distracting from the message that he wanted to be driving home which was that he had sealed the border and he was getting rid of in his parliament the most violent undocumented immigrants in the country.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 我们什么时候开始看到他做出相应反应的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: And when did we start to see him reacting accordingly?

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 周日晚上，《华尔街日报》发表了对特朗普总统的采访，其中他发表了对他而言“相当克制”的评论。他实际上表示愿意对这起枪击事件进行调查，并说他的政府正在审查这起枪击事件，并最终会得出结论。这些评论与他24小时前谈论这起枪击事件的方式截然不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Late Sunday night, an interview with the Wall Street Journal published with President Trump in which he made somewhat measured comments for him. He actually expressed a willingness in an investigation into this shooting and said that his administration was reviewing the shooting and that eventually they would come out determination. These comments are starkly different from the way the president was talking about this shooting even just 24 hours before.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。对。在最初的余波中，特朗普总统再次将责任归咎于受害者。他抨击了明尼阿波利斯的当地领导人。现在他站出来，实际上说他们想“看看这件事”。这与我们在特朗普总统身上看到的，尤其是在涉及ICE或他的移民议程的任何事情上，通常的反应性辩护非常不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. Right. In the initial aftermath, President Trump once again laid blame on the victim. He attacked local leaders in Minnesota. Now he's coming out and actually saying that they want to take a look at this. That is really different than the usual reactionary defense we see from President Trump when it comes to anything really involving ICE or his immigration agenda.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 对。事实证明，这仅仅是一个相当公开的策略转变的开始，我想知道你是否能继续描述一下。是的，这始于周一早上很早的时候，总统在“真理社交”（True Social）上宣布，他将派白宫边境事务负责人**汤姆·霍曼（Tom Homan）**前往明尼阿波利斯领导此次行动。几个小时后，我们得知，曾负责全国各地这些行动的边境巡逻队高级官员**格雷格·巴维诺（Greg Bavino）**将离开明尼阿波利斯。这清楚地表明，至少在人员方面，正在发生变化，以应对这次可怕的杀戮事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Right. And it turns out that ends up Tyler being kind of just the beginning of a pretty public pivot that I wonder if you can keep describing here. Yeah, it starts very early Monday morning when the president announces on True Social that he's sending in Tom Homan, the White House borders are from Washington to Minneapolis to lead the operation. And a few hours later, we learned that Greg Bavino, a top border patrol official who had been leading these operations all over the country, would be leaving Minneapolis. And it's a clear sign that changes are underway at least in terms of personnel in response to this horrible killing.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 巴维诺的离职，让我们稍作停留，这似乎尤其值得注意，因为他曾毫不掩饰地在明尼阿波利斯现场为**ICE**和**边境巡逻队**最激进的策略辩护。而且，他曾告诉公众一些关于亚历克斯·普雷伊及其意图和行为的完全错误的信息，这些信息与随后出现的视频截然相反。所以，突然间，感觉他的行为会带来后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: And the Bavino departure, just to linger on that for a minute, feels especially notable because he had literally been on the ground in Minneapolis very unapologetically defending the most aggressive tactics that ICE and Border Patrol were using. And because he had told the public something that turned out to be completely wrong about Alex Prey and about his intent and his actions that was very much contradicted by the videos that emerged. And so suddenly it felt like there were consequences for that conduct.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 绝对是，迈克尔。我认为，不仅仅是巴维诺传播了这些虚假信息。**国土安全部部长克里斯蒂娜·尼科莫（Christine Nkomo）**、白宫高级顾问、特朗普许多移民议程的建筑师**史蒂文·米勒（Steven Miller）**也呼应了这些信息。总统正在与这些确切的信息保持距离。他没有像史蒂文·米勒那样说普雷伊是“国内恐怖分子”，也没有像克里斯蒂娜·尼科莫和巴维诺那样说普雷伊是一名试图对边境巡逻队特工造成大规模伤害的刺客。因此，那些传播对受害者最不准确信息的人，可以说是被推到了一边。此外，除了决定撤离格雷格·巴维诺，我们还听说特朗普总统与明尼阿波利斯州长**蒂姆·沃尔兹（Tim Waltz）**以及市长**雅各布·弗雷（Jacob Frey）**进行了电话交谈。这也很了不起。就在几天前，特朗普总统还在抨击这些同样的官员，指责他们对明尼阿波利斯发生的骚乱负责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Absolutely, Michael. And I think you know it wasn't just Bavino who was spreading these false messages about Prey. They were echoed by Christine Nkomo, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Steven Miller, a senior adviser in the White House, who is the architect of much of Trump's immigration agenda. And the president was distancing himself from those exact messages. He was not saying that Prey was a domestic terrorist, as Steven Miller said. And he also was not saying that Prey was an assassin who was trying to inflict mass harm on Border Patrol agents as Christine Nkomo suggested and Bouvino did as well. And so those individuals who were really spreading the most inaccurate messages about the victim were sort of being pushed aside. And on top of that deciding to to pull back Greg Pavino, we also hear that President Trump is having these phone calls with Governor Tim Waltz and uh the mayor of Minneapolis as well, Jacob Frey. This is also pretty remarkable. Just a couple days earlier, President Trump was attacking these same officials, blaming them for the unrest that we are seeing in Minneapolis.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。事实上，他的司法部正在积极调查他们两人，指控他们阻碍他的移民镇压行动。但突然间，他却进行了据称相当外交的电话交谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. In fact, his Department of Justice is actively investigating both of them criminally for blocking his immigration crackdown. But suddenly, he's having what by all accounts, I think, are somewhat diplomatic phone calls with

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 他不仅和他们谈话，还积极地描述了谈话内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: He doesn't just talk to them, he also describes it kind of positively as well.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 嗯哼。根据通话记录，迈克尔，似乎他们确实深入讨论了一些实质性问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Mhm. And based on the readouts from the calls, Michael, it seems that they really did get into some substantive issues.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 但我进行了两次非常好的谈话。我和雅各布·弗雷谈了，和沃尔兹州长也谈了。我是说，他们都很棒，通话很棒。所以

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: But I had two very good talks. I had Jacob Frey and I had Governor Waltz. And I mean they were they were great calls. So

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 正如你所知，总统明确表示，他希望加强州、地方官员与现场联邦官员之间的合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: as you know the president made clear that he wanted to enhance cooperation between state and local officials with federal officials on the ground and the

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 民主党领导人也进行了反击。首先，我要求对雷内·古德（Renee Good）和亚历克斯（Alex）的谋杀案进行“公平和独立的调查”。他说：“我们会看看的。我们会看看的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Democratic leaders also pushed back. First of all, I I asked that we have a fair and independent um investigation into the murder of both Renee Good and Alex. um and uh that we have to be able to do that and and he said I we'll we'll look at that. We'll we'll take a look at that.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 他们说他们想要对明尼阿波利斯居民的枪击事件进行“真正”的调查。沃尔兹州长办公室的声明还说，总统同意“考虑减少明尼阿波利斯联邦探员的数量”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: They said they wanted a real investigation into the shootings of Minneapolis residents and also an readout from Tim Waltz's office said that the president agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 他承诺：“看，我要派汤姆·霍曼（Tom Homan）来。我们会做得不一样。”而且，迈克尔，看起来双方都有机会提出自己的不满，并且可能取得了一些突破。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: He pledged that look, I'm going to send Tom Holman in. We'll do things differently. And really what it seems, Michael, is that both sides had an opportunity to raise their own grievances and maybe had some breakthroughs,

</details>

### 改变是真实的还是象征性的？

**Michael Bavaro**: 对？所以，到了周二下午，我们发现自己处于特朗普总统任期内我们已经变得有些熟悉的局面：政府做得太过分了。人们非常愤怒。我们的同事这样形容，我引用他们的话说，这是特朗普就职以来，在他第二个任期内面临的最严重的政治威胁之一。而总统，根据你所描述的一切，似乎理解这一点，并想以他自己的方式说：“我明白了，我准备好尝试缓和局势了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: right? And so it felt by Tuesday afternoon that we ended up in a situation that we've become kind of familiar with in the Trump presidency, which is the administration has gone too far. People are furious. I mean, our our colleagues described this as, and I'm going to quote from them, one of the gravest political threats to Trump since his inauguration in this second term. And the president, based on everything you're describing here, seems to understand that and wants to say in his own way, I get it and I'm ready to try to diffuse this.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 迈克尔，没错。而且，正如我们现在和你说话一样，总统刚刚告诉福克斯新闻，他的政府将“稍微缓和一下”明尼阿波利斯的局势。但“缓和”这个词，你很少听到这个总统说。但你看，这大概是我们现在前进道路上的大问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Michael, that's right. And I mean, just to that point, as we're speaking to you right now, the president just told Fox News that his administration was going to work on deescalating a little bit the situation in Minneapolis. But not a Trump word, not a word you often hear from this president. Uh, but look, I guess that's the big question we have now moving forward.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 这些仅仅是言语吗？你知道，在强烈的政治反对声中，这仅仅是口头上的吗？还是我们正处于一个真正的时刻，我们可以看到地面上出现具体的变化，尤其是在联邦政府对美国城市进行镇压方面？我们将稍后回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Are these just words? You know, is this just lip service at this point in the response to intense political backlash or are we uh in the midst here of a real moment where we could see concrete change on the ground when it comes to these kind of federal crackdowns on American cities. We'll be right back.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 那么，泰勒和佐兰，让我们进一步探讨一下在广告前提出的问题：在总统发出所有这些改变策略和语气的信号和象征中，明尼阿波利斯地面上是否真的发生了什么变化？**ICE**和**边境巡逻队**是否仍然在那里，而政府对该市作用的看法是否有所改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: So Tyler Enzo, let's further pursue the question posed right before the break, which is amid all these signals and symbols of some sort of a change in course and tone from the president, has anything actually changed on the ground in Minneapolis where ICE and the Border Patrol are still very much there and has the administration's thinking about its role in the city changed at all?

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 是的。所以，即使我们看到了言辞上的转变，我们实际上并没有多少证据表明地面上发生了实质性变化。明尼阿波利斯的行动似乎仍在进行。我们还听说，仅在今天，明尼阿波利斯就记录了大约100次逮捕。所以，目前，地面上的现实尚未与总统在这方面的言辞转变相匹配。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Yeah. So, even if we've seen a a rhetorical shift here, we really don't have all that much evidence that we're seeing a substantial change on the ground. This operation in Minneapolis still appears active. We're hearing as well that roughly a 100 arrests were recorded in Minneapolis just today. So at this point, we have not seen that reality on the ground match the shift in rhetoric from the president on this topic.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 泰勒，地面上实际发生变化会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Tyler, what would it look like for things to actually change on the ground?

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 一个明显的步骤是，他们撤回在明尼阿波利斯以及其他领导人表示不希望这些部队进入的城市巡逻的边境巡逻探员和其他联邦官员。他们会开始减少人数。他们会真正召回这些探员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: One obvious step, Michael, would be that they pulled back the border patrol agents and the other federal officials who are patrolling all across Minneapolis and other cities where leaders have said they don't want those forces. They'd start to reduce the numbers. They would literally recall these agents,

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 对？另一个步骤可能是解雇特朗普总统的助手。许多总统的批评者，甚至一些他的盟友私下里都说，像克里斯蒂娜·尼科莫（Christine Nkomo）这样的人可能不适合领导国土安全部，但总统今天和**史蒂文·米勒（Steven Miller）**一起走出白宫，告诉记者克里斯蒂娜做得很好，她肯定不会辞职。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: right? And another step could possibly be that there's firings of President Trump's aids. There are many critics of the president and even some of his allies privately saying someone like Christine Nkomo maybe isn't right for running the Homeland Security Department, but the president walked out of the White House today with Steven Miller and told reporters that Christine was doing a great job and she certainly was not resigning.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。我想，另一个与言辞相符的地面变化迹象是，政府采取措施跟进对亚历克斯·普雷伊（Alex Prey）被杀事件的调查。例如，他们可以公布枪杀他的边境巡逻队探员的姓名。他们可以对该探员展开调查。他们可以逮捕该探员，理论上来说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. I mean, I suppose the other sign of an on the ground change that matched the rhetoric, to use your word, Zolan, would be that the administration took steps to follow through with an investigation into Alex Prey's killing. They could, for example, name the Border Patrol agent who shot him. They could open an investigation into that agent. They could arrest that agent in theory,

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 对？就目前而言，对这起枪击事件的调查并不包括对涉事探员的刑事不当行为的调查。我们看到，本届政府不仅将这些枪击事件的受害者归咎于受害者，而且在涉及联邦探员的不当行为时，也一直避免进行实际调查。所以，这将是一个积极的步骤。而且，你知道，是的，ICE通常会在所有这些城市都有存在，但值得提醒大家的是，我们在这里看到的是一种不同的行动，那就是你有一大堆联邦探员在明尼阿波利斯。这不是一次正常的ICE部署。你还有边境巡逻队，他们也参与了这次枪击事件，以及其他联邦探员。所以，这是他们可以采取的另一个步骤，将这变成一次更典型的ICE部署，而不是一次联邦探员穿着迷彩服在明尼阿波利斯街头巡逻的混合部署。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: right? As of right now, the investigation into this shooting does not involve looking into criminal wrongdoing of the agents that were involved in this shooting. Right. We've seen that this administration not only has blamed the victims of these shootings, but has also refrained from actually investigating real wrongdoing when it comes to the federal agents involved here. So, that would be an active step. And you know, yes, ICE does typically have a presence in all these cities, but it's worth reminding folks that we have something different with this kind of operation, which is that you have this alphabet soup of federal agents that are in Minneapolis right now. It's not a normal ICE deployment. You also have Border Patrol, which was involved in this shooting, as well as other federal agents. So, that's another step they could take in just sort of turning this into a more typical ICE deployment. rather than one where you have this hodgepodge of federal agents dawned in camouflage that are now currently marching through the streets of Minneapolis.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。而且似乎有一种“一触即发”的态度，对待像亚历克斯·普雷伊（Alex Prey）那样仅仅是举着手机的行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. And seemingly with a hair trigger approach to something as simple as somebody holding a phone out in front of them in the case of Alex Prey.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 那是。你不仅会说总统，我们正在缓和局势，而且会采取具体措施来缩减这次行动，这也可以导致缓和。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: That's right. you would not only be saying as the president, we're going to deescalate this situation, but actually taking concrete steps to scale back this operation, which could then lead to deescalation as well.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。我是说，我有点重复你说的，佐兰，但当你退一步，真正审视除了言辞之外真正不同的是什么时，答案似乎是“没多少”。目前还没多少，对吧？这很重要，因为通常在特朗普总统任期内，当你经历这些新闻周期时，当他面临政治反对时，这次事件肯定很相关，他会采取一种“两手策略”，对吧？

<details>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. I mean, I'm repeating what you said to a degree, Zolan, but when you step back and really examine what's truly different here beyond the rhetoric, it seems like the answer is not much. Not much yet, right? And and that's important because often with President Trump when you're going through these news cycles, when he's facing political blowback, and this one it's definitely relevant, he kind of all has this two-handed approach, right?

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 他既对联邦探员、联邦镇压行动、他的议程进行反应性辩护，同时，当它引起政治反对、给他带来麻烦时，他又会试图与同样的议程保持距离。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: He both has this reactionary defense for federal agents, for the federal crackdown, for his agenda. And then at the very same time, he will try to distance himself from that same agenda when it gets political backlash, when it causes trouble for him.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对。佐兰，你和泰勒一周半前离开椭圆形办公室，在采访完特朗普后，你曾将总统描述为他自己总统任期及其政策和行动的“旁观者”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: Right. Zolan, when you walked out of the Oval Office with Tyler a week and a half ago after your interview with Trump, you described this as the president conducting himself like a bystander to his own presidency and its policies and its actions.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 是的。我认为这是又一个例子，总统试图成为自己政策的旁观者。这是那个谈论大规模驱逐，不仅是驱逐，还包括向美国城市部署联邦探员的总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Yes. And I think this is another example of that, of the president trying to be a bystander to his own policies. This is the president that talked about mass deportations, not only mass deportations, but deploying federal agents to American cities,

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对？这就是随之而来的。这也是那个总统，他有时会说执法部门可以通过“举行一次真正暴力的一天”来威慑犯罪。这是他在自己竞选期间说过的话。对。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: right? And this is what's come with that. This is also the president that at times has talked about how law enforcement could deter crime by holding quote one really violent day. That's something he said during his own campaign. Right. Right.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 我们已经看到了许多暴力的一天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: And we have seen many violent days.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 那是。但至少在目前这个时刻，我们看到特朗普总统是他自己政策的旁观者，而不是特朗普总统在任何情况下都积极地为他的政策辩护。泰勒，如果人们觉得这种语调的转变仅仅是语调的转变，真的只是一种表象，那显然无法满足那些要求改变、要求举行听证会的共和党人的愤怒，包括参议院。而这尤其无法满足民主党人，他们目前正威胁要阻止维持联邦政府在本周末开放所需的拨款法案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: That's right. But it seems at least in this current moment, we're seeing President Trump as a bystander to his own policy and not President Trump aggressively defending his policy no matter the circumstances. Tyler, if people sense that this tone shift is just a tone shift, really kind of a veneer, it's clearly not going to satisfy the fury of motans, of those Republicans in Congress who are demanding change, who are demanding hearings, including in the Senate. And it's especially not going to satisfy Democrats who are currently threatening to block funding bills required to keep the federal government open through the end of this week.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 是的，迈克尔，我们还没有看到这个故事的结局。就在我们说话的时候，总统正在接受提问，当被问及“你是否计划撤出在明尼阿波利斯的探员？”时，他说：“我们会做任何合适的事情。”这是一个总统可以做出的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Yeah, Michael, we have not seen the end of this story. And just as we're talking now, the president is taking questions and when he's asked, "Do you plan to pull agents out of Minnesota?" he says, "We'll do what'sever appropriate." That's a decision that the president gets to make,

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 对？他没有定义他将如何改变策略的参数。我认为这非常值得注意。我认为这些将是议员们在推进这些关键的政府拨款法案时会向政府提出的问题。我是说，我们刚刚看到缅因州共和党人**苏珊·柯林斯（Susan Collins）**告诉克里斯蒂娜·尼科莫，她希望暂停在缅因州和明尼阿波利斯的ICE执法。霍曼，非常快速地，是否存在一种真正的风险，即总统及其身边的人在明尼阿波利斯制造的与ICE、与边境巡逻队有关的局面，可能导致未来几天出现某种形式的政府关门？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: right? and he's not defining the parameters by which he would change course. And I think that's really notable. And I think those are going to be the questions that lawmakers are asking of the administration as they move forward with these critical government funding bills. I mean, we just saw choosing Collins, a Republican of Maine, who told Christy Gnome that she wants a pause of ICE enforcement in Maine and Minnesota. Holan, very quickly, is there a real risk that the situation that the president and those around him have created in a place like Minneapolis with ICE, with Border Patrol, could actually lead to some form of a government shutdown in the next few days.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 很难做出预测，尤其是在国会方面。但当不仅民主党人，还有共和党人对此次行动的核心机构表示担忧，而且正如泰勒所说，你还有一位在拨款委员会中极具影响力的人物苏珊·柯林斯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: It's always tough to make a prediction, particularly when it comes to Congress. But when you have not only Democrats but also Republicans who are expressing concern about the agency at the center of this operation and as Tyler said, you also have someone who's incredibly influential in the appropriations committee, Susan Collins,

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 也表达了这种担忧。这对那些担心政府关门的白宫人士来说，就像是“红色警报”时刻，对吧？所以，我们必须关注这里将要发生什么，但国会议员们确实有迹象表明，他们正在关注明尼阿波利斯以及其他城市在这种行动中的情况，而他们是阻止政府关门所必需的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: also expressing that concern. That is like a red alert moment for those in the White House who are anxious about a government shutdown, right? So, we have to watch what's going to happen here, but there are definitely signs that members of Congress that would be needed in order to prevent a government shutdown that they are watching what's going on in Minneapolis um as well as other cities when it comes to this operation.

</details>

**Michael Bavaro**: 你只是，为了结束这次谈话，在我看来，佐兰，你在一开始就谈到了这一点，那就是总统在过去一年里，客观地说，已经迅速实现了他的许多移民目标。他封锁了边境。他将入境人数减少到了历史低点，几乎是涓涓细流。然后，随着ICE和边境巡逻队在明尼阿波利斯等城市部署，这似乎不再像是一场辩论。他把许多人视为一种成就，变成了他总统任期内一个极其黑暗的篇章。而这本不必如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: you just to end this conversation, it strikes me and Zolan, you talked about this in the in the very beginning of this conversation that the president has just objectively speaking over the past year quickly achieved many of his immigration goals. He sealed the border. He reduced crossings to a historic low, a trickle. And then with these deployments of ICE and Border Patrol in cities like Minneapolis, it no longer feels like much of a debate here. He turned what many see as a kind of achievement into this exceptionally dark chapter of his presidency. And it just didn't need to be that way.

</details>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: 是的。你知道，这项政策比其他任何政策都更能让总统受到鼓舞。他身边的人会把他的冲动变成实际的政策，影响地面上的人。他觉得他得到了他自己政党，以及在很大程度上是国家，在移民议程上的政治支持，从竞选到现在。是的，他有时会面临反对，但他从未真正，甚至在言辞上，承认需要缩减规模。现在看来，我们已经到了总统意识到他可能在这个议程项目上“走得太远”的地步，实际上他在这个议程上走得太远，以至于现在的“形象”实际上对他不利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolan Kano Youngs**: Yes. And you know this policy more than any other policy, the president has just been incredibly emboldened. He's been surrounded by people that will turn his impulses into actually policy that will impact people on the ground. He has felt that he has had the political support of his own party and for the most part the country when it comes to this immigration agenda from the campaign until now. And yeah, he's he's faced push back at times, but he has never really even rhetorically acknowledged the need to scale back. And now it seems we are at the point where the president has realized that he might have overshot on this agenda item where actually he went so far on this agenda that now the optics are actually not working in his favor.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 对。而且这个周期还很早，我们不知道接下来会发生什么。但我们确实已经有了一个可以肯定的结论：特朗普总统在得知雷内·古德（Renee Good）被枪杀身亡，或者得知普雷伊先生被枪杀身亡后，并没有因此而缩减行动规模。事实上，他最初将责任归咎于他们两人。当他听到这对他政治上不利时，他才因此改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: Right. And it is still early in this cycle and we don't know what's going to happen next. But we actually do have one takeaway that we can say already from this and that's that President Trump wasn't moved to scale back this operation upon learning that Renee Good was shot and killed or upon learning that Mr. Prey was shot and killed. In fact, he initially laid the blame on both of them. He was moved on this when he heard that it was hurting him politically.

</details>

**Tyler Pager**: 这似乎是此刻他移民政策的“护栏”。我认为这一点值得注意，我们应该关注这一点，因为我们正在努力报道这种政策将在多大程度上进一步扩大，或者是否真的会以一种明确的方式缩减。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Pager**: That's the guard rail it seems at this moment for his immigration policy. And I think that's notable and it's something we should watch as we try to report out just how much further this is going to expand or if this is really going to be scaled back in a definitive way.

**Michael Bavaro**: 周二晚上，白宫副幕僚长**史蒂文·米勒（Steven Miller）**似乎从他最初关于亚历克斯·普雷伊（Alex Prey）死亡的不准确说法中退缩了。在给CNN的一份声明中，米勒表示，白宫现在正在评估负责普雷伊死亡的边境巡逻队探员为何可能未能遵守政府规程。

**Michael Bavaro**: 而新的人口普查数据显示，过去一年，美国人口增长率是该国历史上最慢的之一。人口放缓的一个主要原因是移民的减少，由于特朗普总统的第二任期政策以及长期以来美国出生率的下降，移民人数下降了50%以上。总体而言，国家人口增长了约180万人，增长率约为零点五个百分点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bavaro**: And new census data shows that over the last year, America's population grew at one of the slowest rates in the country's history. A major reason for the slowdown was the decline in immigration, which plunged by more than 50% because of President Trump's second-term policies, combined with a long-term decline in the American birth rate. Overall, the country's population grew by about 1.8 million people, a growth rate of about half a percentage point.
