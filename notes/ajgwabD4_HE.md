title: '**Alex Honnold**：无保护攀登**台北101**，挑战极限与人生哲学'
summary: 本期访谈深入探讨了著名徒手攀岩家**Alex Honnold**独特的风险观和恐惧管理方式，这些都源于他的成长经历和攀岩生涯。他分享了十年房车生活、为攀登**酋长岩**和**台北101**所做的精心准备，以及他认为恐惧可通过持续暴露和练习来克服，而非神经学异常。Honnold强调有意识地生活，追求热爱，并将宏大目标分解为可管理的小步骤，这一哲学贯穿于他的攀岩和**Honnold基金会**的慈善工作。

### 风险与生活选择

**Alex Honnold**: 没人像我这样思考风险，这让我抓狂。人们看我的生活，觉得“你疯了，你真是个冒险家。” 但至少我选择承担我所承担的风险。想想那些每个周末出去派对，喝得醉醺醺然后开车回家的人。甚至那些久坐不动的人，他们说：“我从不冒险，我待在家里玩电子游戏。” 不，你患心脏病的风险要高得多。他们承担着各种他们并未选择的风险，而且无论如何你都会死。所以，你不如承担明智、经过计算的风险，做所有你想做的事情，至少死的时候是开心的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: It drives me crazy that nobody else thinks about risk in this way. People look at my life and they're like, "Well, you're crazy. You're such a risk taker." Well, at least I'm taking the risks that I'm choosing because think of all the people that go out partying every weekend and they get buzzed and they drive home. And even sedentary people who are like, "Well, I don't take risk. I stay home and I play video games." No, you're at a much higher risk of heart disease. They're taking all kinds of risk that they're not actually choosing to take and you're still going to die either way. So, you might as well take smart, calculated risks and do all the things that you want to do and at least die happy when you go.

**主持人**: 他做到了。**Alex Honnold** 再次创造历史，攀登了世界上最高的摩天大楼之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He's done it. **Alex Honnold** has made history again, scaling one of the world's tallest skyscrapers.

</details>

**主持人**: 很多人得出的结论是你不会体验到恐惧，因为当他们看这两份脑部扫描时，当你看到可怕的图像时，你的杏仁核活跃度较低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But the conclusion that a lot of people have arrived at is that you don't experience fear because when they look at these two brain scans, your amygdala is lighting up less when you're shown scary images.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我其实很讨厌所有关于大脑的说法，因为人们总是把我归类。他们说：“你与众不同。” 我说：“其实不然。我只是一个中产阶级郊区长大的孩子。我家没人是运动员。我只是在每周攀岩五天，并且真的非常害怕了二十年后，我的反应才与普通人不同。” 整个过程中充满了情感上的挣扎。有些时候你只是觉得我努力了那么久，却还是达不到我想要的水平。我那时住在车里，十年里每月只有几百美元。这确实很有挑战性。但你无法一夜之间精通一门手艺。我想这就是人们看不到的地方。那么，你如何创造条件来超越他人呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I actually hate all the brain stuff because people always put me in this box. They're like, "Well, you're different." And I'm like, "Well, not really. I'm a middle-class suburban kid. Nobody in my family is athletic. I just after 20 years of climbing 5 days a week and being really scared, I respond differently than an average person." And there was tons of emotional turmoil throughout it. Periods where you're just like I'm trying so hard and I'm just not as good as I want to be. I was living in a car. I had a couple hundred bucks a month for 10 years. That's challenging. But you just can't master a craft overnight. I guess that's what people don't see. And so how do you create the conditions to out-persist other people?

</details>

**主持人**: 在你所有的职业生涯中，什么时候你最害怕？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then in all your career, when is the moment where you were most scared?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 在一次**南极洲**探险中。我一直希望情况会好转，但它却持续恶化。我当时觉得我可能会死。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: On an expedition to **Antarctica**. I kept hoping that it's going to get better and it just kept getting worse. I could die.

</details>

**主持人**: 在你做这种事情之前，你会和你的伴侣谈谈吗？因为她写了一封信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you have a conversation with your partner before you go and do something like this? Because she wrote a letter.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Oh gosh.

</details>

**主持人**: 她说：“显然，这是你最糟糕的噩梦，**Alex**，但我们有时都必须做可怕的事情。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Obviously, this is your worst nightmare, she said. But we all have to do scary things sometimes, Alex.

</details>

**主持人**: Guys, I've got a quick favor to ask you. We're approaching a significant subscriber milestone on this show, and roughly 69% of you that listen and love this show haven't yet subscribed for whatever reason.

### 童年经历与家庭影响

**主持人**: **Alex**，要了解你，我想从我所了解的关于你的一切，从我所做的研究，从与你妻子、你的经纪人以及我能交谈的每个人那里，我认为要理解你的背景，我们首先需要了解你成长的环境和你的童年。因为这似乎——对我们所有人来说，我们身上都留下了定义我们异常之处的印记，包括你自己。那么，我需要知道什么？观众需要知道关于你早期背景的什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Alex to understand you. I think from everything I've learned about you, from the research I've done, from speaking to your wife, your agent, everybody I could speak to, I think to understand your context, we first need to understand the circumstances in which you were raised and the childhood you had because it seems to be I mean for all of us there's like fingerprints left on us that define the anomaly that many of us become including yourself. So what do I need to know? What does the viewer need to know about the early context?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，你想深入到什么程度？我需要一张沙发，我需要回应。好吧。但是，是的，我的父母、我的成长经历确实留下了印记。他们的关系非常紧张。他们最终离婚了，但为了孩子他们一直在一起，那是一种非常紧张的家庭生活，因为他们彼此都不喜欢。然后我妈妈非常上进，非常优秀。我爸爸呢，很难说。我想我认识他的时候，他基本上一直都非常抑郁，因为他处于那种关系中。很难说。他没有过上最好的生活。然后可悲的是，他们离婚后，他快乐了很多，但后来他去世了。所以，我从未真正看到他绽放光彩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I mean, how deep do you want to go? I need get a sofa. I need to reply. All right. But yeah, certainly there's an imprint from my parents, my upbringing. I mean, they had a very fraught relationship. They eventually got divorced, but they stayed together for the kids and it was a whole tense home life because neither of them really liked each other. And then my mom is very driven, very, high performing. And then my dad was hard to say. I mean, I think my dad was deeply depressed basically the whole time I knew him because he was in this relation. It's hard to tell. He wasn't living his best life. And then sadly after they got divorced, he was he was much happier, but then he died. And so then never really got to see never really got to see him blossom that much.

</details>

**主持人**: 你妈妈表现出色。她有没有以某种方式含蓄地要求你也如此？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And your mother's high performing. And did did she sort of implicitly demand that of you in any way?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，我妈妈会说七八种语言。她会演奏所有乐器，这有点疯狂。她在这方面很有艺术天赋，比如古典艺术。但是，是的，她希望我们也做所有这些事情。在这方面，我让她非常失望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah, I mean my mother speaks like seven or eight languages. She plays every instrument. It's kind of crazy. She's very artistically minded in that way, like the arts and classical sense. But yeah, she I mean she wanted us to do all those things too. I'm a deep disappointment in that regard.

</details>

**主持人**: 我在看那部纪录片时看到一个短语，你妈妈会一直说，我觉得它翻译过来大概是“不够好”，就像“几乎不算”一样。这很有趣，因为我觉得我现在的成年生活中，我最常说的一句话就是“不要让完美成为优秀的敌人”。我真的很喜欢“足够好”这个概念。就是说，尝试总比不做好。做点什么总比不做好。快速失败并从中学习，然后继续前进，总比什么都不尝试要好。我基本上不想被完美主义束缚。我妈妈就是个完美主义者，她会说“如果你做不好，就别做”。我则觉得尝试、学习和改进更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There was a phrase that I saw when I was watching the documentary that your your mother would continually say which I think translates to something like not good enough like pressing a ka like almost like almost doesn't count. It's funny because I feel like a lot of my adult life now one of my sort of go-to sayings is you know don't let perfect be the enemy of good. I'm really into like good enough. Like it's better to like try. It's better to do something, you know, it's better to fail quickly and learn and keep moving forward than to not try something. Like basically, I don't want to be crippled by perfectionism. Sort of like my mom is very much a perfectionist, you know, like if you can't do it right, don't do it. I'm sort of like I think it's better to try and learn and improve,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 但她用这种方法确实取得了许多成就。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: But she's accomplished a lot of things with that approach.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，她确实做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, she Yeah, she has for sure.

</details>

### 家庭情感与攀岩起源

**主持人**: 情感方面呢？我听你谈过很多，在你父母关系不和睦的环境中。我想我听你说过，在你父亲去世之前，你从未真正见过他快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What about emotions? This is something you I've had heard you sort of talked about a lot is in that environment where your mother and father aren't getting along well. I think I I heard you say that your you hadn't seen your father really happy before he'd passed away.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是一个充满感情的家庭吗？就亲情而言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Was it an emotional household in terms of affection?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 不，那是一个非常不讲感情的家庭。话虽如此，那是一个安全、相对幸福的家庭。它很好，你知道。我与许多大家庭成员关系密切。我与祖父母以及一些叔叔阿姨关系很好。所以，我本来会把它描述为一个完全幸福的家庭生活，直到我长大后开始更多地看到别人的家庭，然后就觉得：“哦，这看起来更幸福。” 你明白我的意思吗？就像，在你看到它还能是什么样子之前，它基本上都很好，然后你就会觉得这看起来更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: No, it was a very unemotional household. That said though, it was a safe, relatively happy household. It was it was fine, you know, and and I was close to a lot of my extended family. And so I had a really good relation with my grandparents and some my aunts and uncles. And so I mean I basically would have characterized it as a totally happy family life until I became older and started seeing other people's families more and was kind of like, "Oh, this seems even happier." You know what I mean? It's like basically really good until you see what what else it can be and then you're like this seems even better.

</details>

**主持人**: 你妈妈从来都不亲热吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And your mom wasn't ever affectionate.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你知道，总感觉有点有条件的，就像，她关心你，如果你表现好，如果你做得好，如果你是个好孩子之类的，你明白我的意思吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: You know, it always feels slightly conditional, you know, where it's like you know, she cares if you be you know, if you perform well, like if you do well, like if you're a good kid or whatever, you know what I mean?

</details>

**主持人**: 攀岩是何时进入你生活的？因为我找到了一些你攀岩的照片，你看起来是和你的妹妹在一起，我相信。就是这张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Where where did climbing come into your life? Cause I've got some I have found some photos of you climbing and you look your like with your sister, I believe. Here we go. This one here.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。经典。你那时多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Classic. How old have you been?

</details>

**主持人**: 我不知道。我是说，我不知道，大概六岁或八岁。我很难判断中等身材孩子的年龄。为什么？为什么要攀岩？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I don't know. I mean, I don't know, like six or something or eight. It's hard for me to tell like medium-sized kids ages. Why? Why climbing?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 哦，为什么不呢？它太酷了。你攀岩过吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Oh, why not? It's so freaking cool. Have you Have you rock climbed?

</details>

**主持人**: 我攀过，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I've Yeah, I have.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你去过健身房吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: You gone to a gym?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我去过。但是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, I've I have. But

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那不是最酷的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And wasn't it the freaking coolest thing?

</details>

**主持人**: 很有趣，是的，当然。我是说，在你面前说我攀岩过，我觉得…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It was fun. Yeah, for sure. I mean, saying I've climbed when I'm sat with you is I feel like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。但你确实尝试过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. But you have tried it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我攀过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, I have. Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 作为一个成年人，如果你能想象作为一个孩子那是多么有趣。然后如果你不停地做这件事，然后你发现你对此有天赋，你喜欢它。就像，你可以想象走上那条路。它太酷了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: As an adult, if you can imagine as a kid how fun that is. And then if you just keep doing that non-stop and then you find that you're, you know, have some aptitude for it, you enjoy it. It's like, you know, you can imagine going down that path. It's so cool.

</details>

**主持人**: 但攀岩的挑战性有没有让你觉得它就像你大脑的拼图碎片一样？比如解决问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But is there something about the challenge of climbing that you think just kind of like was a jigsaw piece for your for you your brain? Like problem solving?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我想攀岩有一些基本的东西，就像跑步或游泳一样。它是一种基本的运动方式，我觉得非常享受。而且我想我也天生喜欢高处，你知道，喜欢站在顶端。基本上，我喜欢广阔的视野。我喜欢开阔的感觉，我喜欢空气，所以我喜欢在高处。所以，我不知道。我想它只是击中了几个这样的甜蜜点，让我觉得：“哦，攀岩太酷了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, I think there's something elemental about climbing in the same way as like running or swimming. It's like a basic movement thing that I think is quite enjoyable. And I think that I also I I think I have an innate love of like being on top of things like, you know, being at the top. Basically, I love big views. I like the expansive, you know, I like air and so I like being up on stuff. So, I don't know. I think it just hit a few sweet spots like that where I was like, "Oh, climbing is just so cool." And

</details>

**主持人**: 我猜你从未想过这会成为一种职业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you I'm assuming you never thought this could be a career.

</details>

### 职业生涯与房车生活

**Alex Honnold**: 不，不。实际上，即使当我开始全职攀岩时，我仍然不认为这会成为一种职业，因为那时根本没有职业攀岩。它规模小得多。这个行业规模小得多。攀岩更小众，不那么流行。但你不是被金钱之类的东西驱动的，因为没人会为了致富而追求攀岩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: No. No. And actually, even when I started rock climbing sort of full-time, I still didn't think it could be a career because there just wasn't really professional climbing at that time. It was like much smaller. The industry is way smaller. Climbing was way more fringe and less of a thing. But you weren't motivated by like money or anything cuz one does not pursue rock climbing to become No. Rich.

</details>

**主持人**: 不是为了致富，不。嗯，我之前说过，我父亲在那之前的一个季度去世了。因为我父母刚离婚，他基本上把退休金留给了我和我妹妹。她用它来完成大学学业。我只是把它投入债券，然后每月靠大约300美元生活，这还算凑合。我当时住在车里。我偷了我妈妈的面包车。我每月有几百美元，这足够一个19岁的孩子露营了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not to become rich. No. Well, so I said though, so my father died like the season before that. And because my parents had just gotten divorced, he basically left his retirement to my sister and me and she used it to finish college. I just put it into bonds and was living off like 300 bucks a month or whatever, which kind of like worked. I was like living in a car. I stole my mom's minivan at the time. I had like a couple hundred bucks a month and it was kind of enough to just like go to be a 19-year-old just like camping, you know.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是这辆面包车吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Was it this minivan?

</details>

**主持人**: 不，那是我的第二辆。那是**福特全顺**。那是我买的第一辆真正的面包车。我住在那辆面包车里十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No, that's my second one. That's the **Ford Econoline**. That's the first actual van that I bought. I lived in that van for 10 years.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 住了十年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: For 10 years?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。我买了这辆面包车。我是说，这很经典。我花了1万美元买了这辆面包车。然后最初，这是最后一次改装，也是最经典的改装。最初的那辆是我叔叔和我免费用他木工房的废木头做的。基本上就是这样。然后我住在里面十年。当你住在里面的时候，你就会觉得，我甚至不能在这辆面包车里站直，我当时想：“哦，我的背。” 但是，你知道，当你住在车里十年，你确实省了很多钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. So, I bought this van. I mean, this is this is classic. But so, I bought this van for 10 grand. And and then originally, this is the last buildout, which is the classiest buildout. The original one my uncle and I did for free with like scrap wood from his, you know, in his wood shop. basically. And so then I lived in that for 10 years and you're kind of like, yeah, when you live in it, I couldn't even stand in this van, you know, I was like, "Oh, my back." But you know, when you're living in your car for 10 years, you save quite a lot of money.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你住在车里十年，大概是多大到多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Between what ages did you live in your car for 10 years?

</details>

**主持人**: 我大概20岁的时候买了这辆面包车。所以基本上是20到30岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I probably bought this van when I was 20. So 20 to 30 basically.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，实际上我想是对的。因为我想我30岁的时候遇到了我妻子，同年我从这辆面包车换成了更大的面包车。如果你看过电影**《徒手攀岩》**，那就是我买了**ProMaster**，这辆**道奇**。我终于可以在我的面包车里站起来了，我当时想，我的人生正在进步。我能站起来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah, actually I think that's right because because I think I met my wife when I was 30 and that same year I switched from this van to the bigger van. And if you've seen the film **Free Solo**, that's I bought the the **ProMaster**, this like **Dodge**. It was like I could stand up in my van finally and I was like, I'm moving up in the world. I can stand

</details>

**主持人**: 在里面站得很好。哦，这辆车里有个小炉子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: in there really well. Oh, there's there is a little stove in this one, but

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。所以，这辆车是十年里我做了三次不同的改装，因为最初的那辆非常简陋。第二次改装好了一点，然后这辆是相当不错的改装，我用了大概五六年。当你住在你的面包车里十年，而且你的母亲非常注重表现，我这里有她的照片。我相信你和她一起来的。经典。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. So, this though is the I did three different buildouts of this van over the 10 years cuz like the original one was super scrappy. The second build was like a little nicer and then this was like a pretty nice build that I had for I don't know, five or six years or something. When you live in your van for 10 years and you have a mother who is very performance focused, I've got her here. I believe you coming with her. Classic.

</details>

**主持人**: 你难道没有面临很多外部压力，比如去“找份正经工作”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you not face a lot of external pressure to like go get a real job?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 说实话，比你想象的要少。值得称赞的是，我妈妈一直都非常支持我走这条路。我想，我当时很幸运，在足够年轻的时候做了很多这些事情，这都属于“间隔年”的一部分，你知道，就像你年轻时在寻找自我。然后我想，有足够的外部认可，我的家人至少可以看着说：“嗯，你在这件随机的事情上似乎很擅长，尽管我们不明白你在做什么，但至少其他人觉得你很棒。所以，继续做你的事情吧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Honestly, less so than you would think. To her credit, my mom was always pretty supportive of the whole path. I think, I was kind of lucky that that I did a lot of this when I was like young enough that it's all part of like you're gappier like, you know, it's like you're young and you're finding yourself and then and then I think there was enough sort of external validation that that my family could at least look at and be like, well, you seem to be good at this random thing even though we don't get it and don't really know what you're doing, but at least other people think you're good at it. So, keep doing your thing.

</details>

**主持人**: 在那个时候，是攀岩吗？是徒手攀岩吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And at this point, was it was it rock climbing? Was it free soloing? And

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，什么都有一点，但基本上就是成为一个，你知道，一个所谓的“职业攀岩者”。有些是徒手攀岩，有些是速攀，有些只是难度攀岩，有些是去探险，开辟新路线，什么都有一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah, it's all a little bit of everything, but basically just being a I mean, you know, like being a professional climber, quote unquote. Some of it's free soloing, some it's like speed climbing, some of it's just hard climbing, some of it's going on expeditions, doing new roots, like it's a little bit of everything.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于不了解徒手攀岩的普通人来说，它的定义是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And for the average person that doesn't know what free soloing is, what's the like definition of it?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那就是不带绳索攀登。也就是没有保护地攀登，这无疑是我现在最出名的。但在职业攀岩的背景下，我做过很多其他类型的攀岩。大多数时候你都带着绳索，大多数时候你都在做其他类型的事情。但徒手攀岩之所以出名，是因为它更容易进入主流视野。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: That's climbing without a robe. So climbing without protection, which is definitely what I'm most well known for now, but in the context of professional climbing, I've done tons of other things in climbing. Like most of the time you have a rope on, most of the time you're doing other sorts of things. But it's like the free souling is what you might have been well known for because that like breaks into the mainstream a lot more.

</details>

### 职业发展曲线与早期挣扎

**主持人**: 我对像你这样的人非常感兴趣，他们选择了一条不寻常的职业道路，然后在职业生涯的后期才获得关注。我这里有一张纸和一支笔，如果你能从80岁开始画一张图，你现在40岁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm really intrigued generally by people like you who like take I mean take the path less traveled in their career and then maybe nearer the the end of the graph pick up traction. And I have this piece of paper in this pen because I'd love if you could from the age of let's say 80 you're now 40 years old.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，我今年40岁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah I turned 40 this year old.

</details>

**主持人**: 你能画一张图，展示你的职业生涯在成功方面的样子吗？你可以用金钱或关注度或其他任何东西来衡量。我们来看看。所以，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Could you draw a graph showing how your career looks in terms of success? You can measure that by money or attention or whatever. Let's see. So,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 它有点像…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: it was kind of like

</details>

**主持人**: 没什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: nothing.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 慢一点，然后像这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Slow a little bit and then like thisish.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 然后有点像，然后基本上就像这样，你基本上有点平坦但一直在增长，然后有了**《徒手攀岩》**，它一下子跳了一大截。这有点疯狂。然后它继续以比以前稍快的速度增长，然后因为攀登大楼的事情又一下子跳了一大截。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And then kind of like and then basically just like in like this where you basically like kind of flat but growing and then you have **free solo** where it jumps a ton. It's like kind of crazy. And then and then it keeps kind of growing at a slightly faster rate than before and then it basically jumps a ton because of the building thing again.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得这很吸引人，因为大多数人一生中都不愿意忍受18到29岁这个阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I I find this fascinating because most people in their lives wouldn't be willing to endure this phase 18 to 29 where

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这不是忍受。这太棒了。我愿意再来一次。我太喜欢它了。我是说，我经常想，我很乐意从零开始，因为我现在去攀岩的地方，我已经攀岩了20年，我几乎做完了所有能做的事情。你知道，我已经把**美国西部**的很多地方都探索完了，我当时想，天哪，我真想按下重置按钮，重新开始，因为你会有那么多事情可做，那太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: It's not enduring. It's so great. I would do that again. I loved it so much. I mean I often think I'd be so happy to just start over from zero because like all the places that I go climbing now I've been climbing there for 20 years and I've like done most of the things I can do and you know I've sort of like tapped out a lot of stuff in the western US and I'm like man I would love to just hit the rezero button and start over because you'd have so much stuff to do and it's so amazing.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想这就是我问题中的“忍受”这个词的错误之处，但你把它看作是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I guess that's the that's the different the fault of my question is that I said the word endure but you see it as

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。你可以攀登你看到的一切。这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. You get to climb every single thing you see. It's amazing.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。我是说，关键是，从18岁到30岁，我基本上尝试攀登我能看到的一切，因为我当时只是觉得，我在学习，我在成长。这太棒了。我攀登一切。而现在我实际上更有策略性，因为做大量的简单攀岩对我现在来说并没有太大帮助。我不会在技术上取得大的进步。它基本上只会让我感到疲惫，而没有获得正确的进步。这就像一个精英跑步者每天跑很多很多英里。你就会觉得，那不会让你进步，如果你已经是精英跑步者，那不会提高你的马拉松成绩。那可能很有趣，但它不会对你产生影响。在你人生的这个阶段，18到30岁，你只是为了玩得开心，做你喜欢的事情而优化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and that's the thing is like from age 18 to to 30, I basically did try to climb every single thing I could see because I was just like, I'm learning. I'm growing. This is amazing. I climb everything. And like now I'm actually much more strategic about it because doing tons of easy climbing like doesn't really help me at this point. I'm not going to make like big technique gains. It basically just makes me tired without without the right kind of gains. It'd be like somebody it'd be like an elite runner just jogging for miles and miles every day. And you're kind of like that's not going to make you it's not going to improve your marathon time if you're already like an elite runner. It's it might be fun, but it's just not going to like move the needle for you. Through this period of your life, 18 to 30, you're optimizing for just having fun, doing things you enjoy.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，不，我一直在挑战自己。基本上，我一直在优化，寻找下一个能稍微推动我前进的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, I mean, no, I was always I was always challenging myself. Like basically, I was optimizing for like what's the next thing I can do that pushes me a little bit.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你并没有为了致富而优化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But you weren't optimizing for how to get rich or

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那我就会去找工作了。如果我为了致富而优化，我早就完成大学学业并找到工作了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, then I would have gotten a job. If I was optimizing for getting rich, I would have finished my college degree and gotten a job.

</details>

**主持人**: 我之所以这么说，部分原因是我采访过很多人，他们从事的职业通常不被认为是“正经工作”，比如喜剧演员或魔术师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I say this in part because I interview so many people who pursued careers that are often considered not real jobs, like comedians or magicians.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我倾向于发现18到30岁之间的人也是如此，他们优化的目标不一定是致富或成名。然后到某个时候，图表就会变成这样。嗯，那是因为，我是说，我相信你知道这一点，但世界真的就像一个赢家通吃的经济模式。基本上，如果你是那个做成了某件事的人，你的收入就会突然变得非常高。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And I tend to find the same thing between the age of 18 and 30, they optimize for something that isn't necessarily being rich or famous. And then at some point the graph looks like this. Well, it's because I mean I think I'm sure you know this, but I mean the the world really it's like a winner take all economy type deal. It's like basically if you're the dude that does the thing, all of a sudden your earnings go insane.

</details>

**主持人**: 但在你成为那个做成了某件事的人之前，你知道，如果你是最好的魔术师，或者最好的喜剧演员，或者最好的其他什么人，那么你就会突然赚到一大笔钱。但当你只是众多挣扎的喜剧演员之一时，你就会很挣扎。所以我想对我这个攀岩者来说，你有点像，哦，我只是一个住在面包车里攀岩的人。但到某个时候，我就会变成那个，你知道，我就会变成：“哦，你就是那个不带绳索攀岩的人。” 然后你就会说：“哦，是的，酷。” 然后你的收入就会突然变得很高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But until you become the dude that does the thing, you know, if you're like the best magician or the best comedian or the best whatever, then all of a sudden you make an insane amount of money. But when you're just like one of many struggling comedians, you're, you know, you're struggling. And so I think for me as a climber, you're sort of like, oh, I'm just a dude living in my van climbing. But then a certain point, I'm like the dude that, you know, I'm like, oh, you're that guy that climbs without the rope. And you're like, oh yeah, cool. And then all of a sudden your earnings are like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这段时期，你18到30岁，是你人生中艰难的时期吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Was this um was this a difficult period of your life this 18 to 30?

</details>

**主持人**: 不，那是最好的时期。嗯，显然，我当时在努力处理人际关系，我想找个女朋友。你是一个20多岁的年轻人，独自住在车里，想在某方面做得更好，却不太清楚方向，不知道自己的人生该怎么走。所以，是的，整个过程中当然充满了情感上的挣扎，但回顾起来，那真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No, it was like the best. Well, obviously it was like f, you know, I was like trying to juggle rel like I wanted to get a girlfriend. You're a young 20s man living alone in a car like wanting to be better at something than you are and not not quite knowing the way, not knowing what you're doing with your life. So no, so obviously there was tons of emotional turmoil throughout it, but no, I mean retrospectively it's like amazing.

### 父亲的去世与死亡意识

**主持人**: 你的父亲去世了，这在某种程度上是你做出超出他期望的决定的催化剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And your your dad passes away which is in part I guess some of the catalyst for

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。说实话，我父亲的去世应该是我那张图的起点。它应该基本上从19岁开始，因为我18岁上了大学，然后19岁的时候，我想我上路了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Honestly my dad passing away should be the beginning of that graph. It should be this should basically start at 19 cuz uh 18 I went to university and so then uh starting at 19 I guess I uh went on the road.

</details>

**主持人**: 你父亲的去世对你有什么影响，除了在某种程度上解放了你，让你做出超出他期望的决定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Your dad passing what impact did that have on you outside of it somewhat liberating you to to make decisions that outside of his expectations?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我是说，显然那是悲伤的，很难。尤其是现在，我有点觉得，哦，我没能和我爸爸建立关系真是太糟糕了，他也没有，你知道，我的孩子也没有祖父，所有这些。你知道，这很难。我想它最直接的影响可能只是提醒了我自己的**死亡率**。你知道，我是说，他55岁时意外去世，在机场突然倒下就死了。嗯，像是心脏病发作。所以，你知道，我是说，我想这种对我自己**死亡率**的提醒对我的职业、我的生活、我的攀岩世界，无论什么，都产生了很大的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well I mean obviously it was you know it's sad. It's hard like and especially now I'm sort of like oh it's too bad that that I don't have a relationship with my dad and he doesn't you know that my kids don't have a grandfather and all that kind of you know it's like yeah it's it's tough. I think that the most immediate impact that had maybe was just reminding me of my own mortality, you know, I mean, he he died unexpectedly at 55, just fell over in the airport and just fell over dead. Um, like heart attack. And so, you know, I mean, I think that that reminder of my own mortality has had a big impact on my career, my life, you know, my climbing world, whatever.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们可能不会期望你因为这个原因去“做危险的事情”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: one might not expect you to go quote unquote do risky things because of

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，不，因为我认为人们不做危险事情的原因之一是他们有一个错误的观念，认为他们可以永远活下去。基本上，因为人们不想思考自己的**死亡率**，所以他们会说：“哦，我不想冒任何风险，我可能会死。” 但你知道，无论如何你都会死，而且无论如何，当你死的时候，你都会因为没有活得更久而感到沮丧，因为你知道，就像预期寿命78岁，你就会想，假设你活到了那个年纪，你仍然会想：“天哪，我希望我能再多活22年，看看我的孙子孙女大学毕业之类的。” 你知道，它仍然会感觉太少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well no because the thing is I think one of the reasons that people don't do risky things is because they have this uh you know mistaken idea that they can live forever basically and basically because people don't want to think about their own mortality and so they're like oh I don't want to take any risks I could die and you're like you know that you're going to die either way and either way when you die you're going to be bummed that you didn't live longer because you know it's like like the life expect 78 and you're like Say you make it to for men, whatever. Like, say you make it that far, you're still going to be like, man, I wish I had 22 more years to like watch my grandkids graduate college or whatever, you know, it's like it's still going to feel like too little.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以，我有点觉得，你宁愿在55岁时死于意外，但做了许多让你自豪的事情，过着让你自豪的生活，也不愿在78岁时死去，仍然希望活得更久，却什么想做的事情都没做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And so, I'm kind of like, you're better off dying at 55 in an accident, but having done many things that you're proud of and, you know, like led a life that you're that you're proud of than dying at 78 and still wishing you had more, but having done none of the things you wanted to do.

</details>

**主持人**: 这很有趣。人们似乎活得好像我们认为自己会永远活下去一样。是的，这完全是疯了。我是说，每个人都说：“哦，我从不冒险。” 你就会说：“是的，好吧，你可以在生活中不冒任何风险，但你仍然会死。” 所以，你不如承担明智、经过计算的风险，做所有你想做的事情，至少死的时候是开心的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It is interesting. It does appear that people live as if we think we're going to live forever. Yeah, it's totally insane. I mean, everyone's like, "Oh, I don't take any risk." And you're like, "Yeah, well, you can take no risk in your life and you're still going to die." So, you might as well take smart, calculated risks and do all the things that you want to do and at least die happy when you go.

</details>

**主持人**: 对你来说，有意识地生活意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What does this mean to you to like live intentionally?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，就是这样。选择你愿意承担的风险，做出选择，按照你想要的方式利用你的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, that's exactly it. Like choosing the the risk that you're willing to take, making choices, like using your time the way you want to use it.

</details>

### 个人特质与恐惧管理

**主持人**: 我看了看，我想是你做过的一个性格测试。你说你…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I was looking at I think it was your your personality a personality test you did. You said you

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我做过性格测试吗？嗯，你到底有多少资料？我真是天哪。你到底有多少东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: like did I do a personality test? Um like how much material do you have? I'm like Jesus Christ. Like how many like things do you have?

</details>

**主持人**: 我有无限的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I have unlimited things.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我知道。我印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I know. I'm so impressed

</details>

**主持人**: 在这个性格测试中，它说你在寻求刺激和寻求感觉方面得分较高，但在“紧迫感”方面也显著高于普通男性，这与你刚才所说的做出决定的想法有点重叠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: on this uh personality test. It says you're you know higher on thrillseeking and sensation seeking but then also significantly higher than the average male on urgency which I think kind of overlays with what you were just saying there of like making the decision to do something.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。基本上是因为你的时间很短，你终将死去，所以赶紧行动吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Basically because your time is short and you're going to die so get on with it.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里说你在尽责性方面得分较高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It says here you're higher on conscientiousness.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 非常有礼貌。你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Very polite. You know,

</details>

**主持人**: 寻求刺激，寻求感觉，你在无聊感方面得分较低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: thrill seeking, sensation seeking, you're low on boredom.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我想无聊感低意味着你不会感到无聊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I think low on boredom means that, you know, you don't get bored.

</details>

**主持人**: 坚韧不拔。你在坚韧不拔方面得分很高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Perseverance. You're very high on perseverance.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，我想这和无聊感低是一回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah, I think that's the same as low on boredom.

</details>

**主持人**: 神经质程度低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And low on neuroticism.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那是肯定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: That's for sure.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，神经质这个词的定义是什么？它是不是像…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And so, what's your what is what's the definition of the word neuroticism? Is it like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我想它就像，嗯，我相信有一个临床定义，但我把它看作是一种普遍的焦虑症，你知道，人们为无关紧要的事情而烦恼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, I think it's like the Well, I'm sure there's a clinical definition, but I think of it as sort of general anxiety type stuff, like, you know, people spinning in their heads about things that don't matter.

</details>

**主持人**: 回顾你的人生，以及你小时候和青少年时期得到的反馈，情况一直如此吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And has that always been the case when you look back through your life and the feedback you've had as a kid and a teenager?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 有点吧。是的，我想是这样。我想我从来没有太担心过，我不会钻牛角尖。我是说，显然，偶尔我也会为事情感到压力，但就是不像很多人那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Kind of. Yeah. I think so. I think I've never been too concerned about I I don't spin. I mean, obviously, you know, occasionally I stress about things, but but just not the way I think a lot of people do.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想弄清楚这是一种习得的行为，还是有点习得，有点来自你的成长环境、基因或其他什么。因为一个人能学会吗？一个人能学会减少神经质吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm trying to figure out if that's a learned behavior or maybe a little bit learned and a little bit um from your upbringing, genetics, whatever it might be. Because can can one learn that? Can one learn to be less neurotic and

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，大概吧。我是说，像冥想之类的。我想人们可以找到一种方法来放下某些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Well, presumably I mean like meditation, things like that. I think people can sort of find a way to let go of certain things.

</details>

**主持人**: 当人们不可避免地问你关于恐惧的问题，以及你如何应对那些对像我这样的普通人来说是可怕的挑战时，这不是很奇怪吗？所有这些都包含了一个元素，那就是你确实有天性和后天培养，这对于像我这样的人来说是无法复制的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Isn't this quite quite interesting when people ask you questions inevitably about fear and how you take on such you know to muggles like me terrifying challenges. There's an element of all of this which is you do have a nature and and a nurture which somewhat is impossible for someone like me to replicate

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 因为你的大脑和我的大脑完全不同。你的父母，你大脑在发育和髓鞘化时的早期接触，都与我完全不同。所以，你知道，我总是觉得这就是给人建议的麻烦之处。我们处理的是不同的天性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Because your brain and my brain are completely different. Your parents your early contacts when your brain was being wired and malated are completely different to mine. So, you know, I always find this is the like the trouble of giving people advice is um we're dealing with different different natures,

</details>

**主持人**: 不同的天性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: different natures.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 但我确实觉得，就我而言，天性上最大的不同在于我一直热爱攀岩。你知道，因为我基本上认为，后天培养是其中大部分的原因。如果你花30年时间训练一件事，你就会在这件事上变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: But I I do feel like in my case, the biggest difference in nature is the fact that I've just always loved climbing, you know, because I basically I think that nurture is is the majority of this. Like if you spend 30 years training a thing, you're going to get better at the thing.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以我认为我与不攀岩的人之间最大的区别在于，我他妈的爱死攀岩了。如果可以的话，我每周可以攀岩10天，你明白我的意思吗？但遗憾的是，我太累了，我的身体会垮掉。所以，你知道，我基本上有无限的能力去做这件事。我只是喜欢做这件事。我想这可能是天性上最大的区别，你知道，因为其他一切你都可以克服。你知道，就像如果你像我一样热爱攀岩，无论你的基因倾向于神经质之类的东西如何，你都会努力克服所有这些，你会找到自己的道路，基本上就是擅长攀岩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And so I think that the biggest difference between me and and somebody who's not into rock climb is I freaking love rock climbing. I could go I could do it 10 days a week if if I could, you know what I mean? But sadly, I get too tired and my body breaks down. And so, you know, I could I basically have like a limitless capacity to to do the thing. I just love doing the thing. And I think that that is probably the biggest difference in nature, you know, because everything else you can kind of overcome, you know, like if you loved rock climbing as much as I love rock climbing, no matter what your your genetic disposition towards like neuroticism and all that stuff, you would just kind of work through all that stuff and you'd find your own path to to getting good at climbing basically.

</details>

### 对孩子的建议与攀岩的挑战

**主持人**: 如果你的孩子来找你，你有两个女儿，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: If your kids came to you, you have two girls, right?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果她们来找你，说：“爸爸，给我一些关于人生目标的建议。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: If they came to you and said, "Dad, like give me advice on what I should aim at in life."

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你会告诉她们吗？我不会。我不会给她们建议。我会说：“你去做你喜欢做的事情，努力去做。基本上，学习一些技能，擅长某件事。你喜欢做什么？” 我是说，对我来说，尤其是攀岩，就像如果有人告诉我：“你余生都要训练攀岩。” 我会觉得：“哦，那听起来有点像苦差事。” 你知道，因为我是说，这确实是辛苦的工作。你就像背着沉重的背包爬上山，又冷又刮风。这基本上是身体上的不适。我是说，成为一名职业攀岩者意味着你总是身体不适，但经常如此，你知道，这很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Would you tell I wouldn't I wouldn't give them advice. I'd be like, "You do you find the thing you love to do, go hard, you know, basically like learn some skills, get good at something, like what do you like to do?" I mean, that's kind of the thing for me, especially with climbing is like if someone had told me like, "You're going to train climbing for the rest of your life." I'd be like, "Oh, that sounds like kind of a grind, you know, cuz I mean, it is it is hard work. You're like hiking uphill with a heavy backpack and it's cold and it's windy. It's like it's basically physically uncomfortable." I mean, being a professional rock climber means that you're physically uncomfortable all the time, but like like often, you know, like it's you know, it's hard.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。但如果你是因为你真的喜欢做这件事而做，那感觉就不会那么难。所以，我是说，我认为对孩子来说，关键是找到那些不觉得是辛苦工作的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. But if you're doing it because you freaking love doing it, it doesn't feel very hard. And so, I mean, I think the key for a kid is find the thing that doesn't feel like hard work.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 当你刚开始的时候，你害怕那些高大的岩壁之类的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And when you started, were you scared of of big tall rock faces and stuff like that?

</details>

**主持人**: 我是说，是的，我对它有一种健康的敬畏感。我是说，在我第一个赛季，第一次作为一个攀岩者看到**酋长岩**时，我19岁，它看起来不可能。它看起来完全是疯了。我当时想，那太大了。但后来，你知道，在几个赛季之内，我攀登了一些更大的岩壁，学会了攀岩，然后我和一个朋友有了一个赛季目标，我们打算整个赛季都攀岩，最终目标是在一天内攀登**酋长岩**。所以，基本上，在**酋长岩**上有一个漫长的进步过程，就像你从只是尝试爬上去，到尝试更快地爬上去，再到只用手脚爬上去，仍然使用保护。但基本上，你可以采取所有这些步骤。所以，经过几个赛季，我攀登了**酋长岩**大约60次，不同的路线，所有这些不同的事情。然后最终你就会觉得：“哦，也许我可以开始考虑徒手攀登它了。” 这就是电影**《徒手攀岩》**的由来。然后最终你做到了这件事。但人们会问：“你难道不害怕吗？” 你就会觉得：“哇，我花了十年时间来积累这件事。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean, yeah, I had like a healthy intimidation of I mean, like my first season, the first time seeing **Elcap** as a climber, uh, I was 19 and it looks impossible. It looks completely insane. I was like, that's so big. But then, you know, within a couple seasons, uh, you know, I climbed some bigger walls, learned how to climb, and then a friend and I had the sort of season goal, like we were going to climb all season with the aspiration at the end to climb **Elcap** in a day. So, basically, there was this long progression on **LCAP** specifically where it's like you go from just trying to get up it to trying to get up it faster to trying to get up it with just your hands and feet, still using protection. But basically, there's like all these steps you can take. And so, over a bunch of seasons, you know, I climbed a cap like 60 times, different routes, all these different things. And then eventually you're sort of like, "Oh, maybe I can start thinking about freoling it." Which is where the film **Free Solo** comes in. And then eventually you do this thing. But then people like, "Well, aren't you scared?" And you're kind of like, "Wow, I've spent 10 years like building up on this thing."

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我想这就是人们看不到的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I guess that's what people don't see.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。所以他们只是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. So they just

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，纪录片**《徒手攀岩》**我认为很好地展示了直接的准备工作，比如完成那次特定攀登所需的训练，但它没有展示那之前的八年。我想是因为这部纪录片拍摄了两年，而我从2006年就开始了。所以那之前有九年时间我一直在攀登，每年大概有三个月在攀登岩壁。

**Alex Honnold**: I mean like the documentary **Free Soul** I think does a pretty good job of showing the the direct preparation like the training involved in doing that specific climb, but it just doesn't show the uh like eight years before that I guess cuz the documentary was filmed over two years and I guess I've been going since 2006. So it's nine years before that that I've been going to use and I've been spending maybe three months a year climbing walls.

**主持人**: 我想这就是所有做大事的人，然后成为运动员、短跑运动员之类的，比如**C罗**或**梅西**，你都看不到他们…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I guess that's the illusion of like all people that do great things and then become like athletes or sprinters or whatever **Ronaldo** or **Messi** is you you don't get to see the

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，他们为做这件事付出了全部人生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. the whole life that they put into doing the thing.

**主持人**: 是的。

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

**主持人**: 所以当我们看到结果时，它看起来就像一个魔术。就像我们在**Netflix**上看你攀登**台北**，哇！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So it looks it looks like a magic trick when we see the outcome. Like we show show up on **Netflix** to watch you climb **Taipei** like whoa

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 悬挂着，用他的腿。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: hanging with it from his leg.

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，人们看那些节目，他们会说他只是走上去就做到了。你就会说，嗯，是的，经过30年的练习，我只是走上去就做到了。但它不像只是走上去就做到了。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I mean people watch some of those programs and they're like he just walked up and did it. And you're like well yeah after 30 years of practice like I just walked up and did it. But no it's not like just walking up and doing it. Hm.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，是的，我真的每周攀岩5天，持续了30年。那真是太多的攀岩了。我他妈的爱死攀岩了，我攀岩很多。

**Alex Honnold**: I mean, like, yeah, I've literally been climbing 5 days a week for 30 years. Like, that's so much climbing. I freaking love climbing and I climb a lot.

### 恐惧与脑部扫描的误解

**主持人**: 关于“暴露疗法”这个概念，它与恐惧、焦虑以及面对那些让你恐惧的事物有关。在早期，你是不是在某个时候感到害怕？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: On this on this idea of like exposure therapy as it relates to like fear and anxiety and confronting one's uh things that terrify them. Was there in the early days were you I'm trying to understand. Were you like scared at some point?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 哦，一直都害怕。这实际上是我认为，你知道，我显然做过很多关于恐惧以及如何管理恐惧的采访，多年来我以很多不同的方式谈论过恐惧，我想随着年龄增长，我逐渐意识到，作为一个攀岩者，你其实一直都感到害怕，是一种低水平的恐惧，但攀岩本质上是可怕的，它总是有点可怕，因为总是有后果。即使你带着绳索攀岩，你仍然总是会想象如果绳索断了会发生什么？如果，你知道，这安全吗？装备好吗？它真的安全吗？所以你总是有点害怕。经过多年持续的害怕，你就会非常擅长管理这类事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Oh, all the time. That's actually something that I think uh you know I've obviously done so many interviews around fear and like managing fear and all that and I've talked about fear a lot of different ways over over the years and I think as I've gotten older I've sort of come to realize that that actually you're just scared all the time as a climber like low-level fear low like but you're but climbing is fundamentally scary like it's always kind of scary because there always consequences like even if you're climbing with a rope you're still always visualizing like what happens if the rope breaks like what if you know like is this safe like you know is the gear good like is is actually safe. And so you're always a little bit scared. And so after years and years of always being scared, you get pretty good at managing that kind of stuff

</details>

**主持人**: 因为围绕着你的脑部扫描有很多误解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because there's a lot of sort of misconceptions swirling around this brain scan you.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，我知道。我讨厌所有那些东西。那都来自电影**《徒手攀岩》**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. I know. I hate all that stuff. That's just all from the film **Free Solo**.

</details>

**主持人**: 电影里那个场景太短了。他们需要再多一点。他们需要让它有呼吸感，你知道，我认为需要解释得更好一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It was like too short of a scene in the film. They needed a little more. They need to let it breathe, you know, explain things a little better, I think.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以他们扫描了一个对照组对象。另一个人扫描了你，观察了你大脑中的**杏仁核**，很多人得出的结论是你不会体验到恐惧，因为当他们看这两份脑部扫描时，当你看到可怕的图像时，你的**杏仁核**活跃度较低，基本上是这样，对吧？但就像只展示这张图像，那到底意味着什么？就像我的大脑是紫色的，他的大脑是橙色的。你就会觉得，那意味着什么？我不知道。但是，我是说，关键是，这也是我希望电影能解释得更好的地方，那就是我们是在fMRI（功能性磁共振成像）中被展示黑白照片。所以，你身处一个密封的金属管中。你完全安全。你身体上是安全舒适的。然后你被展示黑白照片。所以，对我来说，显然，那不会点燃我大脑中的恐惧反应，因为你只是在看图片。你就会觉得，谁在乎呢？我完全安全。但在对照组对象中，你知道，显然你的大脑会对图像做出某种反应。但我有点觉得，我攀岩20年了，所以我已经害怕过很多次了。你就会觉得，嗯，如果你20年来一直感到害怕，黑白照片就会开始失去它们的刺激性。所以，显然那不会触发太多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: So they scanned a control subject. another person scanned you, looked at the **amygdala** in your brain, and that the conclusion that a lot of people have arrived at is that you don't experience fear because when they look at these two brain scans, your **amygdala** is lighting up less when you're shown scary images basically, right? But like shown just this image, like what does that even mean? Like my brain's purple and his brain is orange. You're like, like what does that mean? Like I don't know. But no, I mean the the thing is though, and this is what I wish was explained in the film better, is that this is we're being shown black and white photos inside an fMRI. So, you're inside a sealed metal tube. You're totally safe. You're physically safe and comfortable. And you're being shown black and white photos. And so, to me, obviously, that's not going to light up the fear response in my brain because you're looking at pictures. You're like, who cares? I'm totally safe. But in a control subject, uh, you know, apparently your brain sort of responds to images one way or another. But I'm kind of like, I've been climbing for 20 years, so I've been like scared quite a lot. And you're kind of like, well, black and white photos start to lose lose their edge if you've been scared all the time for 20 years. So, it's like obviously that's not going to trigger much.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。我想每个人在生活中都能想到一个场景，他们拥有某种精通，那会让人害怕，就像一个脱口秀喜剧演员站在舞台上，可能不会像我一样害怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. And I imagine everybody in their life can think of a scenario where they have mastery that would sc like a stand-up comedian looking out at a stage probably wouldn't be as scared as me.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 因为那会让我感到恐惧。所以，这不一定是什么神经学上的…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Because that would that would terrify me. Um so again, this is not necessarily some sort of neurological

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 不，我是说，我认为真正的启示是我有一个**杏仁核**，而且它在工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: No, I mean I think the real takeaway is that I have an **amygdala** and it works.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你明白我的意思吗？因为我想如果结果显示我缺少**杏仁核**，那我就会遇到各种问题，我小时候就会死了，因为我基本上无法像人类一样运作。但是，你知道，如果它显示出结构性差异或某种真正的变化，但这基本上只是表明，经过20年的条件反射，我的反应与普通人不同。你就会说，是的，一点也不奇怪，如果你把一个僧侣放进fMRI里，他们的大脑反应也与普通人完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: You know what I mean? like cuz I think if if the results had shown that I was missing my **amygdala** then I would have all kinds of I would have died already at youth cuz I wouldn't be able to function as a as a human basically but you know had it shown something like that where there are like structural differences or like some real change but this is basically just showing that after 20 years of conditioning I respond differently than an average person and you're like yeah no kidding like if you put a monk into an fMRI their brain responds totally differently than average person as well

</details>

**主持人**: 我实际上认为这是一个非常鼓舞人心的结论，因为它意味着我们都可以…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: which I actually think is a really inspiring conclusion because it means that we can all

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 更好地掌握我们的恐惧。而且，你知道，人们可能不知道我的这一点，但十年前，我曾和我的朋友**Ash**在他的公寓里坐下来，录制一个两分钟的视频。当我坐在那里时，我太害怕了，说不出话来。所以，你实际上在这个两分钟的视频中，你会看到背景从白天变成黑夜，只是因为我们为了让我能在镜头前说两分钟的话，在七个小时里剪辑了那么多。显然，在镜头前十年之后，我现在可以不结巴地说话了。我想我的大脑状态看起来会大不相同，因为我们的**暴露疗法**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: grasp our fears better. And even, you know, people won't know this about me, but 10 years ago, I sat down on camera with my friend **Ash** in his apartment to record a two-minute video. And as I sat there, I couldn't I was so scared I couldn't get the words out. So, you actually in this 2-minute video that comes out, you see it go from night and day in the background just because we did that many cuts over 7 hours to try and get me to say 2 minutes on camera. And obviously, after 10 years of being on camera, I can now speak without [ __ ] myself. And I imagine my brain state looks significantly different because of our **exposure therapy**.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全正确。是的。嘿，你应该做fMRI。你应该，是的。你应该十年前就做了，因为那样你就会有对照组，然后你现在再做，结果会完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Totally. Yeah. Hey, you should do the fMRI. You should Yeah. You should have done 10 years ago cuz then you'd have your control and then you do it now and it'd be totally different.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 而且，我坐过的所有心理学家都证实了这一点。他们谈论**暴露疗法**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: But also, the psychologists I've sat with all confirm this. They talk about **exposure therapy**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我也经历了同样的事情，关于公开演讲。我一直非常害怕公开演讲。我也非常害羞，就是不喜欢，那太可怕了。而现在，因为**《徒手攀岩》**电影巡演，以及那之后我做的所有公开活动，我基本上没问题了。你知道，你仍然会有点紧张，但现在基本上很容易了。你就会觉得，这完全变了。显然，人类有巨大的学习能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And and I went through exactly the same thing with public speaking. Like I was always so afraid of public speaking. I was also very shy and like just not like it was terrifying. And now because of the **free solo** film tour and you know all the public things I've done since then, I'm like basically fine. And you know, it's like you still got a little nervous, but it's like basically easy now. You're kind of like, well, that's a total change. It's like obviously there's a tremendous capacity for humans to learn.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 人们总是和你谈论恐惧，因为我是说，你的工作，因为攀岩真的非常可怕。这很合理。完全可以理解。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: People talk to you about fear all the time because I mean your work cuz climate is really freaking scary. It makes sense. It's totally understandable. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。而且我想，他们在某种深层面上也意识到，阻碍他们成为他们想成为或渴望成为的人的，是恐惧。通常是别人的评判。是冒险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And they also realize, I think, at some deep level that the thing holding them back from who they think they want to be or who they aspire to be is fear. Often it's judgment of someone else. It's taking a risk.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 完全正确。所以，你对很多人来说，就像是：“告诉我，告诉我如何克服。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Totally. So, you've become for many people the like, tell me, tell me how to overcome.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。嗯，我想每个人都说：“你克服恐惧的秘诀是什么？” 你就会说：“没有秘诀。你只是长时间地一次又一次地感到非常害怕，最终它就不再那么可怕了。” 但我要说，那是一种非常持久的克服恐惧的方式，如果你愿意经历那个过程，那么你实际上是无所畏惧的，你知道，因为你可以使用一些小技巧。我是说，你可以播放响亮的摇滚乐，然后直接冲上去，你知道吗？就像，在所谓的“重力辅助运动”中有很多这样的例子。比如说，如果你要滑雪跳崖，你可以到边缘，觉得：“这真的很可怕。” 然后说“3、2、1，跳！” 然后就跳下去。在攀岩中，你不能那样做，因为它太慢了。当你攀岩时，你移动一步，然后再移动一步，然后你就会想：“我还想待在这里吗？” 恐惧会更多地悄悄潜入。但在重力辅助运动中，你会有更多那种瞬间克服恐惧的时刻，然后它就发生了，你知道，就像在皮划艇或滑雪中进行大跳，一旦你下定决心，它就会以某种方式发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Well, I think that everyone's like, "What's your hack to overcome fear?" And you're like, "There's no hack. You just get really scared over and over for so long and eventually it's not that scary anymore." But I will say that that's like a very enduring way to overcome your fear is like if you're willing to go through that process, then you are actually unafraid, you know, because like you can do like hacks. I mean, you can you can like crank up loud rock music and just go for it, you know? Like, and there are plenty of examples of that in in what I'd call gravity assisted sports. Like, say if you're going to jump a cliff on skis, like you can get to the edge, be like, "This is really scary." And then be like 3 2 1 do it and just like go. In climbing, you can't really do that as much because it's so slow. Like when you climb, you make one move and then you make another move and then you're like, "Do I still want to be here?" Like it basically fear creeps in a lot more. But sort of in gravity assisted sports, you can have more of that moment where you just like overcome your fear and then it happens, you know, like making a big drop in a kayak or like skis or things like that where it's like once you commit, it's happening one way or another.

### 半圆顶攀登的惊险经历

**主持人**: 无论如何，有很多事情要谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Anyway, there's a lot to get into with like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 不，我是说，我想谈谈。我看过你攀登**半圆顶**的视频，我想是，看起来你爬到一半就害怕了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: No, but I mean I want to get into it. I watched a video of you climbing **Half Dome**, I think it was, and it looks like you got scared halfway up or

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。嗯，那个视频实际上是后来拍的。所以视频中的旁白是我在完全独自徒手攀登时的经历。我确实在**半圆顶**上非常害怕，在岩壁顶部附近经历了一次相当创伤性的攀登经历。但后来我们回去拍摄时，我们在拍摄过程中又经历了一次不同的创伤性经历。创伤性较小，但有一瞬间非常可怕，他们把它拍了下来。所以他们基本上在电影中把两者剪辑在一起，因为它展示了我非常害怕的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. Well, so that video is actually filmed later. So the voice over in that video is me talking about the experience of me freestyling when I was totally alone. And I did get really scared on **halfdome** and I had this whole somewhat traumatic climate experience near the top of the wall. But then when we went back to film it, I had a different traumatic experience while we were filming. Less traumatic but uh but like very scary for a moment and they got that on camera. So they basically in the film they just cut the two together as like a because it shows me like being really scared.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 首先，**半圆顶**是什么？然后，那次创伤性经历是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: What's **Half Dome** to start with and then what was the traumatic experience?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。所以**半圆顶**，对于没见过的人来说，是**优胜美地**一堵非常棒的岩壁。它是一面2000英尺高的花岗岩壁。实际上，它是**北面**的标志。它太棒了。那就是**半圆顶**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. So **Halfdme** for anyone who hasn't seen is uh is this just totally amazing wall in **Euseite**. It's a 2,000 foot granite face. Actually it's the **North Face** logo. It's a It's freaking It's That's That's **half dome**.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。所以它就像**优胜美地**的一个标志性岩壁。它看起来像一个半圆顶，但实际上它更像一个被推入的冰球。根据你如何看它，它实际上是一个完整的圆顶。但西北面垂直2000英尺，令人难以置信。所以我徒手攀登了它。那是我在2008年第一次进行的主要徒手攀登之一。在某种程度上，那也是让我成为职业攀岩者的事情之一。但当我攀登时，我只做了最少的准备。我基本上不知道。那是我徒手攀登过的最大的一堵岩壁。我不太知道该如何准备。无论如何，我攀登了它，基本上没有练习足够。我真的非常害怕。我偏离了路线，迷失了方向，跳过了一些东西，然后在最顶部，我经历了一段极度恐慌的时刻，你知道吗？基本上，我爬到了一些地方，然后精神上完全崩溃了，几乎无法完成上面的大石板。攀登最难的部分就在顶部附近。我当时试图走过这个壁架。基本上，我曾面朝里和面朝外走过那个壁架。通常人们会用手横穿它，或者爬过去。有很多不同的方式可以穿过壁架，我每种方式都试过。然后我们在那里拍摄，我当时想，我要面朝外走过去，但事实证明，当你面朝外走过去时，它真的非常可怕。所以我走到一半，就想：“哦，天哪！” 然后就放弃了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. So, it's like an iconic wall in **Euseity**. Um it looks like half of a dome, but actually it's more like a hockey puck just shoved in. It's actually a full dome depending how you look at it. But the Northwest Faces vertical for 2,000 ft is incredible. And so I freelled. That was one of the first like major free soulas I did in 2008. Um and one of the things that sort of made me a professional climber in a way. But when I did the climb, I did the bare minimum preparation. I basically like didn't know. It was it was the biggest thing I'd ever freed. I didn't quite know how to like go about getting ready for it. Anyway, I I climbed it and basically hadn't practiced enough. Was really freaking scared. Got off route, got confused, skipped some stuff, and then at the very top had this whole moment of extreme panic, you know? Basically, I got up into some stuff and all sort of like crumbled mentally and like sort of barely managed to finish this upper slab. Like the hardest part of the climb was like right near the top. I was trying to walk across this ledge. Basically, I've walked across that ledge face in and face out. you normally people hand traverse it or they crawl across it. There are like different ways to go across the ledge and I've done it every which way and then we were up there filming and I was like I'm going to walk it face out but it turns out when you walk it face out it's really freaking scary. And so I made it kind of halfway and was like oh my gosh and then bailed.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 当你说你脑子里出现危机时，那是什么？那是不是就是“天哪，我到底在干什么”？当你…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And when you say you having like a like a crisis in your your mind, what does what is that? Is that just oh my god what am I like how does that sound when you

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我是说，在这种情况下，走过这个壁架，它一开始可能只有一英尺宽。所以你的脚完全踩在壁架上，你小心翼翼地移动。但到某个时候，是的，我是说，那就是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, I mean so in this case so walking across this ledge it's like it starts maybe as a foot wide. So your foot is fully on the ledge and you're shuffling across it. But then at a certain point, yeah, I mean that's that's

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我会把视频放在屏幕上，供观看者参考。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: the video I'll put on the screen for anyone watching.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，那就是那个壁架。但基本上在最窄的部分，你的脚会伸出壁架边缘，岩壁会稍微凸起。所以它会迫使你的背部稍微向外，所以你基本上就像用脚后跟摇晃着，下面有大概1700英尺或1800英尺的垂直落差。所以，你知道，这相当紧张。无论如何，我以为我会那样走过去，但我走到凸起的部分时，突然觉得：“哦，天哪，这不适合我。” 然后设法退了回来，改变了策略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, that's that's the ledge. But basically at the narrowest part, your feet are sticking out over the lip of it and the wall bulges ever so slightly. So it for forces your back out a little and so you're basically like rocking on your heels with I don't know like a 1700T drop or something, 18800t drop like straight down below you and so you know it's like pretty it's pretty intense. Anyway, and so I thought I was going to walk across it like that and I made it to the bulging part and was suddenly like, "Oh my god, this isn't like this isn't for me." And then managed to like shuffle back and and change my strategy.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那是脑子里的恐慌吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Is it like panic in your head?

</details>

**主持人**: 不是恐慌，但你会想：“哦，哦，我做出了错误的选择。这很糟糕。这很糟糕。” 你知道吗？我是说，它不像完全的五级警报那样的恐慌，但你会想：“哦，我完蛋了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's not panic, but you're like, "Oh, oh, I made the wrong choice. Like, this is bad. This is bad." You know? I mean, it's not like full like five alarm bell like panic panic, but yeah, you're like, "Oh, I'm so screwed."

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你以前也曾从很高的地方摔下来过。我听说你小时候有一次从山上摔下来，设法给你妈妈打了电话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And you have fallen a long long way before. I I was hearing about a time when you were younger you fell off a a mountain and called your mother, managed to call your mother in

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，那就像是滑下冰冷的冰川之类的。这和从悬崖上自由落体有点不同。那是滑下山。但是，是的，我完全受伤了。是的，是的。我小时候摔下来好几次，手臂都骨折了。然后作为攀岩者，带着绳索，你经常会大摔，你知道，当你受到保护时。那基本上是这项运动的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, though that was like sliding down an icy cooler type thing. It's a little different than like free falling off of a cliff. That's like sliding down a mountain. But yeah, I got totally messed up and and uh Yeah. Yeah. And I've like broken my arm several times as a kid falling off things and and then with a rope as a climber, you take big falls like routinely, you know, when you have protection. That's like part of the sport basically.

</details>

**主持人**: 我是说，当你站在一个小壁架上，身体凸出，往下看时，很容易就能想象到坠落700英尺。你知道，你会很容易地想：“哦，天哪。” 你知道，就像你只要稍微向前弯曲一点，你就会像天鹅一样坠落700英尺到地面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: M I mean it's certainly easy to visualize falling 700. You know when you're like standing on a little ledge and you're just bulging and you're looking down you're, you know, it's easy to be like, "Oh my god." You know, it's like if you just bend forward a little bit, you're just going to take a swan dive like 700 feet to the ground.

### 攀岩的风险与安全性

**Alex Honnold**: 这项运动的死亡率数据与其他运动相比如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: The stats in this sport are I mean of of fatalities. How do they compare to other sports?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，比你想象的要安全。关键是每个人都觉得它很疯狂，但它没那么疯狂。我不知道确切的统计数据，但我怀疑它实际上与滑雪之类的运动相当。你知道，因为休闲滑雪者经常会死，比如掉进树洞里，或者不小心从悬崖上掉下来之类的。攀岩实际上出奇地安全，这也是我喜欢攀岩的原因之一。我是说，攀岩非常，它非常“二元”，就像你要么完全安全，要么就会死。而你死亡的几率非常非常小。但正因为它们存在，它们总是让你保持警惕。你明白我的意思吗？它基本上让你保持警惕，但你永远不会真正受伤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Uh safer than you would think. That's the thing is everyone thinks it seems crazy, but uh it's not that crazy. I don't know actual statistics, but I suspect that it's actually pretty comparable to to skiing or something, you know, because like recreational skiers die all the time, like falling into tree wells or like going off cliffs by accident or things like that. Climbing is actually surprisingly safe, which is one of the things I love about climbing. I mean, climbing is very it's very uh sort of binary where it's like either you're totally safe or you're going to die. And the odds of you dying are very very very small. But because they're they're there, they always keep you on. You know what I mean? Like it basically keeps you alert, but you're never really gonna get hurt.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这包括徒手攀岩吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Is that including free soloing?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我是说，大部分情况下是这样。我是说，有几个人徒手攀岩死了。我是说，确实偶尔有人徒手攀岩死亡，但实际上大多数顶尖的徒手攀岩者并不是在徒手攀岩时死的。他们是在其他事情中死的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. I mean, for the most part, I mean, a couple people have died free soling. I mean, people occasionally die free soloing for sure, but actually most of the the sort of cutting edge free soloists have not died soling. They've like died in other things.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我想是在**Netflix**上的纪录片**《徒手攀岩》**中，你的一个同事…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I think it was in in the um the documentary on **Netflix** um **Free Solo** where one of your colleagues

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。**Tommy**，**Tommy**说大多数徒手攀岩者现在都死了。嗯，这有点是真的，但有点误导。我是说，你知道，他只是随口说说，并不完全是事实。有几个最好的徒手攀岩者确实在徒手攀岩时死了，尽管他们死在非常简单的地形上。但大多数其他伟大的徒手攀岩者都是在与攀岩相关的事故中死亡的，比如翼装飞行、定点跳伞，还有一个人在海边攀岩时被巨浪卷入海中，他当时站在岸边，却被卷入海中。你知道，诸如此类的事情，你就会觉得，他们显然在生活中冒险，最终死亡，但这并不是人们想象的那样。你知道，你看到那样的照片，你就会说：“徒手攀岩，你肯定会死。” 你就会觉得：“嗯，人们实际上并不是那样死的。” 我是说，他们确实有。我是说，并不是说它不会发生，但比人们想象的频率要低得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. **Tommy** **Tommy** is like most free solos are dead now. Um which is kind of true but it's slightly mis misstated. I mean you know he's just like speaking off the cuff and it's not like strictly true. Like a couple of the best free solos have died free soling though they died on very easy terrain. But then the majority of other great free solas have died in sort of climbing adjacent accidents like wings suit base jumping and uh like one got swept to sea by a rogue wave like while he was out climbing a sea cliff but he was like standing on shore and got swept out to sea. You know things like that where you're just kind of like you know obviously they're taking risks in their lives and they wind up dead but it's not the way that people think. You know, you see a photo like that and you're like, "**Free soul**, you're going to die for sure." And you're kind of like, "Well, people don't actually really die that way." I mean, they have. I mean, not to say that it doesn't happen, but way less frequently than people would suspect.

### 最糟糕的生活与自由的追求

**Alex Honnold**: 如果我要专业地折磨你，我不是在说极端情况，但你会让我过什么样的生活？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: If I was to try and like, you know, professionally torture you, and again, I'm not talking in extremes here, but what life would I prescribe you to live?

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，像一个金融男之类的。一辈子都要做电子表格。你是这个意思吗？就像我最糟糕的…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, being like a finance bro or something. Having to like just work spreadsheets my whole life. Is that what you mean? Like what what is my like worst

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我不知道，像那样吧。或者说实话，像一个舞蹈编导之类的，我就是做不到。或者像一个歌剧演员，我简直会自杀。我就是做不到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I don't know, something like that. or honestly being like a choreographer for dance or something like I just I couldn't do like or or being like an opera singer like I would just kill myself. I just couldn't do that.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？为什么做一个金融男对**Alex**来说是最糟糕的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Why Why would being a finance bro be like the worst thing for Alex?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 只是坐在电脑前，在一个小隔间里打字。我是说，我有点反传统。我不喜欢规则。我不想跳过障碍。我不想做任意的事情。我不想让某个经理来告诉我：“哦，你又得重新提交那份报告了。你漏了一行。” 我会说：“你去死吧。” 我就会直接走出大楼。我就是不知道我能不能忍受那样。但这就是大多数人的生活方式。我们都生活在…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Just the idea of sitting at a computer in a cubicle just like typing. I mean I'm kind of contrarian. I don't like rules. I don't want to like jump through hoops. I don't want to do arbitrary things. Like I don't want some manager to come and tell me like, "Oh, you got to file that report again. You like missed a line." I'd be like, "You go f," you I just like walk out of the building like it's just I just like don't know if I could take that be like no. But that's like how most of the world live. We kind of we all live in like you know

</details>

**主持人**: 我就是不知道这是否适合我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I just don't know if it's for me.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我不知道。我是说，那不就是…我是说，我曾有这样的时刻，我在**纽约**待了几天，我坐地铁去见一些朋友，我从隧道里出来，那里挤满了人，我只是看着地面，我只是，你知道，跟着别人的脚步走上这条破旧的楼梯，我当时想，我不能这样生活。不是日复一日地这样生活。这就像你只是在做和周围所有人完全一样的事情。我当时想，哦，这看起来太无聊了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I don't know. I mean doesn't that just seem I mean I had this moment I've been in New York a couple days and I I took the subway down to see some see some friends and I was like coming out of the tunnel and it's like packed with people and I was just like looking at the ground and I was like just you know following someone else's footsteps up this like beat down path of stairs and I was like I couldn't live like this. like not day in and day out every day like this is just like feeling like you're just doing the exact same thing as everyone else around you. I'm like oh it seems so so boring.

</details>

**主持人**: 这很有趣，因为我们很多人看你的生活，都觉得哇，那很不正常，但实际上，在基础层面上，你过着比我更正常的生活。我是说，你在大自然中，你在运动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's funny cuz so so many of us look at your life and go wow that's not very normal but actually maybe at a foundational level you're living a much more normal life than I mean you're out in nature you're moving your body.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，是的。在这方面，我当然是在进行很酷的冒险，出去玩。我不知道。我想这也是为什么你的生活如此吸引人的部分原因，尤其是当你观看**《徒手攀岩》**时，你确实看起来像一个自由的人，而我们大多数人并没有那么自由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Yeah. In that in that way for sure I'm like going on cool adventures and going out and I don't know. I think that's also part of why the the sort of attraction and allur with your life especially when you watch **free solo** is you do seem to be a free man in a way where most of us aren't free as such.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我是说，我想我们都在某种程度上渴望那样。我是说，大多数人认为那就像他们一年一度的假期一样。他们计划在某个时候退休，然后他们就会拥有自由。你就会想，我不知道。我是说，也许你必须尽可能地那样生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. I mean well I think we're all sort of aspiring to that to some extent. I mean most people see that though as like they get their vacation for the year. They they're planning to retire at some point and then they're going to have their freedom and you're kind of like I don't know. I mean maybe you got to try to live that way as much as possible.

</details>

### 意义非凡的生活与早期收入

**Alex Honnold**: 如果你的小女儿**June**和**Alice**来找你，说：“爸爸，什么是有意义的生活？过上充实有意义的生活的原则是什么？” 你会给她们建议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: If if your if your young girls came up to you **June** and **Alice** and said, "Dad, what's what is a meaningful life? like what are the principles of living a fulfilling meaningful life? Would you give them advice there?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。我是说，那会是一次漫长而漫无边际的多日对话。但我是说，追求自己的目标，我想，无疑是拥有有意义生活的核心之一，比如拥有你认为有价值的事情。我是说，真正地按照你的价值观生活，找到对你重要的事情，并尽你所能去追求它们。当你回顾你早期的20多岁到30多岁时，你有点像在过着佛教徒的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it'd be a long rambling multi-day conversation with them about But I mean, following your own goals is is I think, you know, certainly one of the the cores of having a meaningful life, like having things that you find valuable. I mean, really like living in line with your values, finding things that are important to you and pursuing them with as much as you can give them. you when you look at your early so 20s to 30s it kind of looks like you're living like a Buddhist a little bit.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，是的，我曾经有一次旅行，他们叫我“僧侣”，只是因为我过着一种非常坐禅式的生活方式。我当时在读书，我从来不喝酒，也不喜欢派对，我只是出于个人偏好。所以我只是住在我的小面包车里，读书，不停地攀岩，这些都是我喜欢做的事情。你知道。就像，是的，只是做你想做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I mean yeah I went on a a trip once where they called me the monk just because I was living such a sort of a seated lifestyle. I was like reading I've never I don't drink and I don't like party and I didn't just for personal preference whatever. So I'm just like living in my little van and reading books and climbing all the time like those are the things that I'm into doing you know. It's like it's yeah it's just doing what you want to do.

</details>

**主持人**: 你曾经抑郁过吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you ever been depressed or?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，可能不是那种严重的临床抑郁症，但时不时会有一些时期，你就会想：“我到底在做什么？为什么？我的目标是什么？” 你知道，是什么？我想对我来说，最令人沮丧的事情是，你知道，我把我的整个生命都投入到攀岩中，一直努力做到最好。有时你付出了巨大的努力，却看不到结果。比如，无论出于什么原因，你就是很糟糕。你就会想，我努力了那么久，却还是达不到我想要的水平。那很有挑战性，你知道吗？但那是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah, probably not like deep clinical depression, but there's certainly periods from time to time where you're just like, what am I doing or why or what are my goals? Like, you know, what's And I think to me the most depressing thing is that, you know, I've put like my whole life into climbing, like trying to be the best you can be all the time. And sometimes you put tons of effort in and you just don't see results. Like for whatever reason, you just suck. You're like, I'm trying so hard and I'm just like not as good as I want to be. And like that's challenging, you know? But that's

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，每个人在某种程度上都会面临这种情况，你就会觉得我正在努力做一件事，但我就是没有达到我想要的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I mean everybody faces that to some extent where you're like I'm working hard at a thing but I'm just not achieving the results that I want.

</details>

**主持人**: 在那段时期，也就是你20到30岁之间，你的事业还没有起飞，纪录片还没有上映，你还没有攀登**台北**，你从攀岩中赚了多少钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And between the between that the sort of that period of no man's 20 and 30 where your career hasn't taken off yet the documentary is not out. You've not climbed **Taipei**. How much money are you earning from climbing?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，我最初几年，我通过**北面**获得的赞助，我想我第一年大概是每年1万美元。我当时觉得这太棒了。因为我住在车里，你知道，当你独自住在面包车里时，赚1万美元比你需要的要多。嗯，它显然在某个时候增加了，但那几年它一直在1万到10万美元之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: I mean the first my first couple years my sponsorship through the **Northace** was like uh I think my first year was like 10k a year. I was like this is amazing. cuz I was living in my car and uh you know making 10 grand when you live by yourself in a van is like more than you need basically. Um it obviously went up but beyond that at some point but it was you know like in the 10 to 100 range for the first for the whole yeah for years.

</details>

**主持人**: 然后在某个时候它增加了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Then at some point it increases.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。然后它增加了。我是说，然后**《徒手攀岩》**显然是一件大事，它开启了所有这些机会。嗯，因为我开始做企业演讲之类的。我是说，我相信你知道，那完全是另一个世界。所以你从只从赞助商那里赚一些钱，到从其他公司那里赚钱。然后你就会觉得，好吧，现在你赚了一些钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. And then it increases. I mean then **free solo** is obviously like a big thing and that sort of opened up all these opportunities. Uh because then I started doing corporate speaking and stuff like that. And I mean, as I'm sure you know, that's just like a whole different world. And so then you go from just like making some money from sponsors to like making money from from other corporations stuff. And then you're like, okay, now you're making some money.

</details>

### 目标分解与台北101攀登

**主持人**: 我在听你讲一些你令人难以置信的攀岩故事时，我试图理解可视化或你的准备工作扮演了什么角色，以及它如何能转移到我和我的生活中。我们谈了一点你为**酋长岩**之类的攀登做了多少准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: One of the things when I was I was hearing you talk about some of your incredible climbing stories is um I was trying to understand what role visualization or or your preparation plays and how that's like transferable to to me and my life. We talked a little bit about just how much preparation you did for something like **LCAP**,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 但你听起来确实把挑战分解成更小的部分，然后真正地走过那些单独的步骤，而很多人只会看着**酋长岩**，然后说：“哦，天哪，他们会吓坏的。”

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: but you you it sounds like you really break down the challenge into smaller bits and then really go through those individual steps, whereas a lot of people would just look at **LCAP** and go, "Oh my god, they'll be terrified."

</details>

**主持人**: 然后说不可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then say impossible.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。这很公平。我是说，我花了几年时间看着**酋长岩**，然后说：“那太大了。那是不可能的。” 然后，你知道，几年之后，我一直希望我能看着它，它会以某种方式看起来很容易，我就会说：“酷，现在我要去做了。” 但它从来没有看起来很容易。所以最终我决定：“好吧，我得投入一些真正的努力。” 然后我开始慢慢地分解它，然后一旦你把它分解成碎片，并开始处理这些碎片，你就会觉得：“好吧，它开始感觉更合理了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Which is fair. I mean, I spent years looking at **LCAP** and being like, "That's too big. That's impossible." And then, you know, after years of that, I kept hoping that I would look at it and it would like look easy somehow and I'd be like, "Cool, now I'm going to do it." And it just never looked easy. And so then finally I was like, "Okay, I'm gonna have to like put some real work into it." And then I started slowly breaking it down and and and then once you like break it into pieces and start working on the pieces, then you're kind of like, "Okay, it starts to feel more reasonable."

</details>

**主持人**: 分解成碎片，然后开始处理这些碎片。就攀岩而言，那意味着什么？所以如果我们，我是说，我这里有这个模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Break it into pieces and start working on the pieces. What does that mean in terms of climbing? So if we I mean I've got this this uh model here of

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 类型。所以，你知道，这也是我生活中任何挑战的隐喻。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: type. So you know, and this is also a metaphor for any challenge I have in my life.

</details>

**主持人**: 但这实际上很完美，因为它就在这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But this is actually perfect because it's right here.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我今年九月侦察了这里。我一月进行了攀登。无论如何。九月我们去了，嗯，我们必须先确保它可行，然后才能承诺做一个完整的电视节目。我们当时想，我们先确保我们能做到。然后他们还得收集所有这些营销材料。你得拍下与建筑物的合影，所有那些成为预告片之类的东西。所以我们九月去做了准备工作。所以我基本上检查了所有不同的部分。所以任何你看到它看起来有点不同的地方，你知道，就像整个底部都是一个低角度的石板。它被这两个小红宝石点缀着，这些小硬币状的东西或者云朵之类的。然后角落里有龙。这些都是悬空的。就像这八个区块中的每一个都是一个巨大的悬空物。感觉有点不同。然后你爬到这里，有一些阳台。这些实际上是悬空的。基本上，它的每个小部分都非常不同。你知道，显然在这个模型上看起来都一样，但是，嗯，不同部分之间的每个过渡都是一回事。所以我用绳索检查了所有这些。是的，你就是一步一步地爬上去，直到整个建筑物的顶部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So I scouted this in September of this year. I did the climb in January. or whatever. In September, we went and um well, we had to like one make sure it was possible before you sort of like commit to it doing a whole TV program. We were kind of like, let's make sure we can do this. And then they also had to get all this sort of marketing material. You like get the photos with the building, like all the stuff that becomes the trailer and whatever. And so we went in September to sort of like do the prep. And so we I basically checked out all the different pieces. And so anywhere where you see it looking a little bit different, you know, it's like this whole bottom part is like a low angle slab. It's like punctuated with these two little rubies, these little like coin things or whatever the clouds or whatever they are. And then there the dragons on the corners. These are all overhanging. Like each of these eight blocks is like a big overhanging thing. It feels a little bit different. Then you get up here, there's like these balconies. These are actually overhanging. Like basically each little segment of this is quite different. And you know, obviously on this model like looks looks the same, but um each transition between the different pieces is like a thing. So I checked out all of them with ropes and and yeah, you just go piece by piece all the way up the whole thing.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 而在我们看到**Netflix**直播之前，你从未攀登过它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: And you hadn't ever climbed it before we saw it on **Netflix** live.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我没有徒手攀登过。不，但我攀登过。我用绳索攀登过所有这些部分，这是肯定的。我检查过不同的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, I hadn't freed it. No, but I had climbed it. I climbed all the pieces with a rope for sure. I'd like checked out the different things.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 好的。所以，你把这些看作是每一步的独立挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Okay. So, so you you look at these as individual challenges every step.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。就像你，嗯，甚至只是离开地面，第一步就与所有其他步骤略有不同。你必须跳上去，然后用力压。嗯，然后爬过这些小云朵是另一回事。每条龙都是另一回事。是的，是的，我是说，它就是，你知道，它有惊人的复杂性。所以我们第一次侦察时，你知道，我手机上有一个备忘录，我只是写下所有不同的东西，基本上我试图像学习任何东西一样学习它，我只是做笔记，然后就像从54层到72层，感觉是这样。我攀登了东南角，左边的，你知道，就是这样，然后，是的，只是把它都写下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. It's like you go Well, even like just getting off the ground, the first move is a slightly different move than any of the other moves. You have to like jump up to a thing and like press it out. Um then climbing over these little clouds is a different thing. Each dragon is a different thing. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's just, you know, there's a surprising amount of complexity to it. And so our first on the scout, you know, I had a note on my phone and I'm just like writing down all the different basically I'm trying to learn it the way you study anything where I'm just like making notes and sort of like from floor 54 to 72 it feels like this. I climb the southeast corner the left ar you know just and then yeah just writing it all down

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，有你用腿悬挂着的著名照片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: and I mean there's this famous photo of you hanging with your leg.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，那就是这里的这些环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, that's this these are the rings up here.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以你用腿悬挂在这里。是的。现在，这是一个关于耐力的问题。你如何计划拥有足够的能量？你如何知道当你在这里计划时，你是否会有足够的能量？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So you're hanging you're hanging here from here with your leg. Yeah. Now, I this is really a question of endurance. Like, how do you plan to have the energy? Like, how do you know if you're going to have enough energy when you're up here when you're just planning it?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我是说，这就是它令人兴奋的地方，因为你无法确定。但是，你知道，我一生中攀岩了很多次，也做过很多24小时的攀登。我是说，我曾在**巴塔哥尼亚**有过一次经历。那是一次54小时的冲刺。最后20小时我们没有食物徒步，因为我们被暴风雨困住了。那是一个疯狂的故事。但基本上，你知道，我一生中有很多次经历，我进行了超过24小时的艰苦运动。所以这次，你知道，我预计会花一个半到两个小时。我有点觉得，是的，我是说，运动两个小时后我会感到疲惫，但我不会精疲力尽。你明白我的意思吗？就像，我知道我有一个更深的储备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, I mean, what this this is what makes it exciting because you can't be sure. But, you know, I've done a lot of climbing in my life, and I've done a lot of climbs that were like 24 hours. I mean, I had this experience in **Patagonia** once. It was a 54-hour push. Like, the last 20 hours we hiked without food um cuz we got caught in a storm. It's a whole crazy story. But basically, you know, I've had a lot of experiences in my life where I've done hard exercise for more than 24 hours. And so this, you know, I expect it to take me somewhere in the hour and a half, two hour range. And I'm kind of like, yeah, I mean, I'll be tired after 2 hours of exercise, but I'm not going to be exhausted. You know what I mean? Like, I know that I have a much deeper reserve than that.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 关于你完成这件事之后，很多讨论都围绕着这是否比攀登**酋长岩**更难。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So much of the conversation around um after you' done this, or some of the conversation was around whether this was a harder challenge than **Al Capitan**.

</details>

**主持人**: 不，不，它显然容易得多。我是说，我是在电视直播上做的，你知道，它显然更容易，但它之所以酷，是因为它与众不同。它很有趣。它很有挑战性。对我来说，它真的就像在我的“甜蜜点”上，它足够有挑战性，它并不容易。你明白我的意思吗？就像说它比**酋长岩**容易，它不是，你知道，**酋长岩**就像一个我花了十年时间秘密进行的生命项目。我按照自己的条件，在正确的日子，经过多年的努力才完成。我曾失败过。你知道，**酋长岩**就像一个耗费我多年心血的生命项目，显然你不能在电视直播上做那样的事情。你就是不能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No, no, it's obviously much easier. I mean, I'm doing on live television, you know, it's like obviously it's easier, but what makes it cool is that it's different. It's fun. It's challenging. Like for me, it's really like in my sweet spot where it is challenging enough like it's it's not easy. You know what I mean? Like saying easier than **LCAP**, it doesn't, you know, **LCAP** was like a 10-year life project that I did in absolute secrecy. I did it on my terms on the correct day after years of effort. I had failed attempts. I you know what I like **LCAP** was like an all-consuming life project for years kind of like obviously you can't do that for live TV. It's like you just can't put anyway

</details>

**主持人**: 但这非常符合我的“甜蜜点”，你就会觉得，哦，它足够难，它很难，它很酷，你知道，它很有趣，很有意思，攀岩很有吸引力，它给了我几个月的训练目标，它超级有趣，但它不是，你知道，不是我能做的绝对极限，因为你就是不能在电视直播上做那样的事情。我是说，如果不是别的，我当时攀登的是东南面，因为它能得到很好的晨光，看起来很美，非常适合拍摄。但如果我试图做我能做的绝对最尖端的攀登，我就会攀登西北山脊，因为它会完全阴凉，因为条件会更好，你知道，会更冷。你就是不想在阳光下。它会让你的皮肤，你知道，让你很热之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but this was very much in my sweet spot where you're like oh it's hard enough that it's that it's hard like it's cool you know like it's fun it's interesting the climbing is engaging it's you know gave me something to train for for months it's like it's super fun but it's not you know it's not like the absolute limit of what I can do because you just can't do that on live TV. I mean, if nothing else, so I was climbing the southeast because it gets good morning light and it looks beautiful and it's like great for filming. But if I was trying to do the absolute most cutting edge climb I could do, I'd be climbing the northwest arette because it'd be full shade because it'd be good better conditions, you know, be colder. Like you just don't want to be in the sun. It makes your skin, you know, makes you hot and stuff.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alex Honnold**: Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，你知道，就是这类事情。你就会觉得，嗯，如果你是为了电视而做，并且试图直播它，那么你希望它看起来很好。但如果你是为了高难度攀岩和良好条件而做，你就会在完全阴凉处进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And so, you know, just things like that. You're like, well, if you're doing it for TV and you're trying to broadcast it, then you want it to look good. But like, if you're trying to do it for hard climbing and good conditions, you do in full shade.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: **Netflix**有10秒的延迟，以防你摔下来。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And **Netflix** had a 10-second delay just in case you fell.

</details>

**主持人**: 我是说，我确定部分原因是为了以防你摔下来，但部分原因也是，如果有人拔掉其中一个插头怎么办？或者，你明白我的意思吗？它太复杂了。有太多事情正在发生，这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean, I'm sure part of it is in case you fall, but part of it's like, what if somebody unplugs one of the things or, you know what I mean? Like, it's so complicated. There's so much stuff going on, it's insane.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这次攀登有最难的部分吗？有没有让你感到紧张的部分？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Was there a hardest part of this a part where you were at all nervous?

</details>

**主持人**: 我开始时最紧张的是那些竹子盒子，也就是做这八个悬空部分，因为它们总是重复相同的动作，而且体力消耗很大，你肯定会感到疲惫。我是说，实际体力上最难的动作，嗯，就像实际上随机的，这里的一个角落会是一个相当难的动作，但墙上却固定着一个该死的监控摄像头。所以，你把监控摄像头当作把手。那真是太酷了。它用巨大的螺栓固定着，所以看起来非常安全，你知道，它非常坚固和牢靠，但那本来会是一个极端的跳跃，我当时没有，你知道，那可能可行，但会是一个大挑战，但取而代之的是你直接抓着监控摄像头。我当时想，那太酷了。嗯，所以有一些这样的事情，比如单个动作需要肌肉力量，但总的来说，最难的是耐力，也就是一遍又一遍地做数百英尺的挑战。

<details>

**主持人**: The thing I was most nervous about when I started was were the bamboo boxes, like doing these eight overhanging segments cuz they're just so relentlessly the same move and it's just it's pretty physical like you get tired for sure. I mean, the actual physical hardest moves, um, like actually randomly one of these corners up here would have been quite a hard move, but there was this freaking security camera bolted onto the wall. And so, you use the security camera as this handle. It was really freaking cool. And it was like bolted on with these giant bolts, so it like looked super safe and, you know, it was like very robust and secure, but it would have been kind of like this extreme jump, which I wasn't, you know, it's probably possible, but would have been like a major thing, but instead you just reef off the security camera. And I was like, that's so cool. It was uh so there are a few things like that like individual moves that are kind of muscly but overall it's the the stamina like the challenge of doing this over and over for hundreds of feet that was the hardest thing.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 在你去做这样的事情之前，你会和你的女儿们和妻子谈谈，以防你回不来吗？我知道…

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Do you have a conversation with your with your girls and wife before you go and do something like this about just in case you don't come back? I know the

</details>

**主持人**: 不会和孩子们谈，因为她们太小了，反正她们也不懂。嗯，也不会和她谈，因为她和我一起去了**台北**，或者说她在那里的整个行程结束时都在。我早一点去了，这样我能更好地适应时区，感觉更好。但是，嗯，但基本上她和我在一起，所以，你知道，我们那天晚上一起睡觉，那天早上一起醒来，一起吃了早餐。所以感觉不像一次大的告别。你知道，实际上她和我一起在基地，我们一起开始，然后我真的就像“好吧，再见”，然后走过去做了这件事，然后在顶部又见到了她。所以我们只分开了大约一个半小时，你知道，而且我透过窗户见过她几次，所以感觉她就在那里，和我一起经历了整个过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: not with the kids cuz they're too young and like they wouldn't they don't understand it anyway. Um and not with her because she came with me to **Taipei** or she was there for like the whole end of I went a little bit earlier so I could adapt to the time zone more and like feel better. But um but basically she was with me so you know like we went to bed together that night and like woke up that morning and had breakfast together. So it didn't feel like a big goodbye. You know it was kind of actually she was with me at the base like we did the start together and then I literally was like okay bye and walked over and did the thing and saw her again going to the top. So we were only apart for like an hour and a half of the whole you know like and I saw her through the window a couple times and so it felt like she was just there having the whole experience with me.

### 其他建筑攀登与报酬争议

**Alex Honnold**: 你看过世界上其他建筑吗？比如**哈利法塔**？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Did you look at other buildings in the world like like the Burge? So, yeah,

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我多年来侦察过**哈利法塔**两次。嗯，早在2013年左右，这个项目差点就发生了，所以我当时侦察了一些建筑。**哈利法塔**只是有点太极端了。它太难了。但也许有一天，谁知道呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I've scouted the **Burge** twice over the years. Um, back when this project, this project almost happened in 2013 or something and so I'd scouted some buildings then. The **Burge** was just a little too extreme. It's just too hard. But someday maybe, who knows?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 因为它怎么了？是不是不够？太滑了？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Cuz it's what? Like there's not enough. It's too slippery.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，是的，超级滑。而且，它的握点方式也很特别。我是说，**台北101**的妙处在于，它的握点很好，可以抓握的东西很近，你就会觉得你可以抓住它们，感觉很安全。**哈利法塔**。我几乎无法从一端伸到另一端去够那些握点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um, yeah, super slippery. Also, it's just the way the holds are. Like I mean, the beauty of **Typo 101** is that the holds like they're good things to hold that are close together and you're just like and you can hold them and you feel secure. the **Burge**. I can barely span tip to tip to like reach between the holds.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以你的脸会紧贴着玻璃。你就像这样抓着。这非常难。而且你必须连续做112次同样的事情。做一次就已经很难了，然后你还得做100次。你就会觉得这有点难。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And so then your face is like right against the glass. You're like holding on like this. And it's pretty hard. And you have to do the same thing 112 times in a row. It's like pretty hard to do it once then you have to do 100 times. You're like it's kind of hard.

</details>

**主持人**: 另一件事是，在你攀登之后的一两天，我在网上看到，每个人都开始谈论你为此得到了多少报酬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The other thing that I saw um online after you'd climbed it about one or two days after everyone talk started talking about how much you were paid to do it.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我想是因为你接受了一次采访。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I think cuz you did an interview.

</details>

**主持人**: 这很有趣。有些引语有点断章取义，因为是的，一位《**纽约时报**》记者问我得到了多少报酬，我当时有点不想谈论，因为它有点令人尴尬，因为对我圈子里的所有朋友来说，这是一个令人尴尬的高额数字。在攀岩界，如果你能靠攀岩赚钱，你就会觉得太成功了，你竟然能靠攀岩赚钱。这太疯狂了，你知道吗？所以我认为那是一个令人尴尬的巨额数字。我当时想这有点奇怪。但后来他四处打探，开始将其与拳击比赛之类的进行比较，那些比赛中人们为了打一场拳击比赛能拿到2000万美元。我当时想：“嗯，不，与那相比，这是一个令人尴尬的小数目。” 你知道，就像如果你把它与大联盟棒球合同之类的进行比较，你就会觉得：“是的，这是一个令人尴尬的小数目，但我从没有抱怨过。我觉得这很棒。” 我是说，我甚至愿意免费去做。我是说，我曾花钱去观景台。观景台就在顶部，视野好得惊人，城市也令人难以置信。你知道，就像花20美元之类的，乘坐世界上最快的电梯到大楼顶部。你知道，我在**哈利法塔**也做过同样的事情，你花钱去大楼的最顶部，视野好得惊人。就像我旅行到任何地方都会那样做，比如**西尔斯大厦**，芝加哥的**威利斯大厦**。我曾花钱去观景台看风景，那太酷了。我有点觉得，如果有人愿意付钱让我爬到观景台，那真是太酷了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's funny. There were some quotes that were kind of taken out of context because yeah, a **New York Times** reporter asked me how much I was getting paid and I was kind of like I don't want to talk about it cuz it's kind of embarrassing cuz all my friends it's like an embarrassingly high amount for my community. Like in the climbing world if you're getting paid to rock climb you're like great success, you're getting paid to climb. That's insane, you know? And so I thought it was like sort of an embarrassingly large amount. I'm like this is kind of weird. But then he sort of poked around and he started comparing it to like boxing matches and stuff where people get paid like $20 million to like fight someone boxing. And I was like, "Well, no, compared to that, it's an embarrassingly small amount." You know, it's like or if you compare it to like major league baseball contracts and things and it's like, "Yeah, it's an embarrassingly small amount, but I was never complaining. Like, I thought it was great." I mean, I would do it for free. I mean, I've paid money to go up to the observation deck. The observation deck is way up here at the top and the view is insane and the city's incredible." And, you know, it's like 20 bucks or whatever to take the world's fastest elevator to the top of the building. And you know, I've done that in the **Burge** as well where you like pay the money and you go to the very top of the building and the view is insane. It's like I do that like anywhere I travel like the Se the **Willis Tower**, whatever the **Sears Tower** in Chicago. Like I've paid the money to go to the observation deck and see the view and it's so cool. And I'm kind of like if someone's willing to pay me to climb up to the observation deck, that's freaking cool.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。我想那是因为人们再次认为，他们相信你是在冒着生命危险。是的，所以他们不认为拳击手是在冒着生命危险。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. I think it's because people again they're they're saying that they believe that this is you're risking your entire life. Yeah. And and so yeah, they don't think of boxes as risking their entire life in the same way.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们有点是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They kind of are.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 除非他们是。是的。但他们不认为那是。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Unless they are. Yeah. But they don't see it as that.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道。他们当然不认为那是。这完全可以理解。我明白。但我认为，就像任何进入拳击台的人一样，特别是如果他们实力悬殊，你知道，你就会认为有严重的受伤或死亡的真实可能性，你知道吗？这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I know. Of course they don't see it as that. And that's totally understandable. I get that. But I see it as like anybody going into the boxing ring, particularly if they're very mismatched, you know, like you would think that there is some real chance of grievous injury or like death, you know? It's like it's insane.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我认为人们，我认为那些对攀岩一无所知的人看着我攀登一座建筑物。他们会觉得他生死的几率是五五开。完全不知道。你就会说不。如果你把它放在我一生中所有做过的事情的背景下，我非常自信我不会从建筑物上摔下来。你知道，我是说，显然它永远不是100%，因为生活就是这样，但你知道，它感觉就像100%。你就会觉得，哦，我不可能从这栋楼上摔下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And so I think that people over the thing is I think people that don't know anything about anything like don't know anything about climbing look at me climbing a building. They're like it's 50/50 if he lives or dies. Like no idea. And you're like no. If you put this in the context of all the things that I've gone in my life, I felt very confident that I wouldn't fall off the building. You know, I was like, you know, obviously it's never 100% because like whatever it's life, but you know, it feels like 100%. You're like, oh, there's no chance I'm falling off this building.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 谣言说你从**Netflix**那里得到了50万美元来攀登它。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: The rumors were that you got 500k to climb it from **Netflix**.

</details>

### 价值创造与人生哲学

**主持人**: 在我整个所谓的攀岩生涯中，我基本上从未担心过钱，我总是只管做这件事，让一切顺其自然。所以多年来我做了很多免费的工作。哦，就像我们之前谈到的那部**半圆顶**电影，我当时在小心翼翼地移动。那部电影我是免费做的。我做了很多像那样的免费电影。嗯，只是因为你就会觉得：“哦，这是作为一名职业攀岩者的一部分，我可以去攀岩，我可以和我的朋友们一起拍摄。” 你就会觉得：“你在免费工作。没关系。” 但通过做所有这些免费的事情，我从来没有，我从来没有在意过日薪。从来没有，你知道，我当时想，我不需要为了和朋友们在岩壁上玩得开心而得到报酬。没关系。但作为那部电影的结果，你知道，一两年后，他们最终在那里为《**国家地理**》封面拍摄了一组照片。所以你最终会参与到其他事情中，然后那被看到了，我最终被《**60分钟**》报道了，那实际上是我的第一个职业转折点之一。那是2011年左右的《**60分钟**》报道。但基本上，我一生中做了很多免费的工作，这都是游戏的一部分，我只是喜欢玩这个游戏。所以你就是让它顺其自然。这很有趣，因为对于这座建筑，很多人认为我得到的报酬过低，但之后，你知道，有些人来找我谈论一些奖金和其他工作，基本上很多事情已经发生了，而距离攀登这座建筑才过去几周。我有点觉得，你知道，你不需要为这件事本身得到报酬，因为它总是会奏效的。我有点觉得，我不知道。我有点觉得，不要纠结于你得到多少报酬。只管去做。确保它非常棒，然后一切都会迎刃而解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Throughout my whole like, you know, quote unquote career as a climber, I basically have never worried about money and I've always just tried to do the thing and let it all play out at the end. And so I've done a ton of work for free over the years. Oh, like actually we were talking about that **Halfdme** film earlier where it's like I'm shuffling along. It's like I did that film for free. I did tons of films like that for free. Uh just because you're kind of like, "Oh, it's part of being a professional climber and I get to go climbing and I'm up with my friends filming on a thing." You're just like, "You're working for free. It's fine." But by doing all that stuff for free, like I never I never stress the day rate. Never, you know, I was like, I don't need to get paid to go have fun with my friends on a wall. Like it's fine. But as a result of that film, you know, a year or two later, they wind up doing a photo shoot out there for the cover of **National Geographic**. And so you just wind up in other things and then and then that got seen and I wound up being profiled by **60 Minutes**, which actually was one of the first sort of career inflection points. It was like the **60 Minutes** profile in 2011 or something. But basically, I've done a ton of work for free over my life as all part of like it's all part of the game and I just love playing the game. And so you just like let it play out. And it's funny because with this building, a lot of people thought that I was sort of underpaid by it, but afterward, you know, some people have approached me about some bonuses and some other work stuff and like basically a lot has already sort of happened and it's only been a couple weeks since the building. And I'm kind of like, you know, you don't need to get paid for the thing itself cuz it always works basically. I'm kind of like I don't know. I'm like, don't get hung up on how much you get paid. Just do the thing. Make sure it's freaking rad and it all sorts itself out.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，是的。我是说，那对我来说也完全是事实。即使是这个播客，当我们开始在我的厨房里做播客时，我是说，这是我厨房的复制品，**Jack**当时在这里。我们开始时没有任何报酬。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Yeah. That I mean that's also been like um the that's completely true for my life as well. Even this podcast like when we started the podcast in my kitchen I mean this is a replica of my kitchen and **Jack** was here. There was no pay there was no payment when we started it.

</details>

**主持人**: 你只是在做一件事。你把它做得尽可能好，最终一切都会奏效，你就会觉得很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're just doing a thing. You make it as good as you can and eventually it all sort of works and you're like cool.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我之所以，因为你刚才描述的模式在我生命中已经上演了15年。我现在，我的首席财务官和我的商务总监可能不喜欢我这么说，但他们知道我的这一点，我们最近甚至在一个特定项目上谈论过，那就是不要让短期内看不到钱从哪里来，阻止你追求你认为会创造价值的事情，因为历史表明，实际上，价值，就像向世界输出价值，先于经济效益。所以如果它在我生命中发生了15年，我记得当我开始社交媒体业务时，有人，一个家伙在**伦敦**的**谷歌**里把我叫过去，向我解释为什么我永远无法从那个业务中赚钱。他给我算了账，而且账算得很扎实。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I've I because that that pattern you've just described has played out for 15 years of my life. I now and again my my CFO and my commercial director might not love me saying this but they know this about me is and we even talked about it recently with a particular project is like don't let the inability to see where the money is going to come from in the near term stop you pursuing something that you think is going to create value because history shows that actually value like giving value out into the world precedes the the e the economics totally. And so if it happened 15 years of my life where I remember when I started the social media business and people some a guy sat me down in **Google** in **London** and explained to me why I would never make money from that business. He like he did the math for me and the math was solid.

</details>

**主持人**: 他说：“如果你每天做一次，你就赚不到钱。” 我当时想…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He was like if you do once a day you won't make any money. And I was like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你就会说：“是的，但我不认为那是真的。” 你知道，你就会说…

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: you're like yeah but I don't think that's true. You know you're like

</details>

**主持人**: 而且你没有证据，但是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and you have no evidence but

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，但你就是知道它会奏效。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: yeah but you just know it's going to work.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。**Uber**的首席执行官**Dario**昨天和我坐在这里，他告诉我，他说：“问题是有一种叫做**杰文斯悖论**的东西，当，是的，当效率更高时，人们会以线性进展的方式思考事物，但实际上是指数级进展。所以当我们推出**Uber**时，更多人开始打车。所以所有关于这个市场有多大的模型都错了。” 我在那个方面也发现了同样的情况，大约五年前我也发现了同样的情况，是的，就像你把我叫过去，然后说：“嗯，**Steve**，CPM（千次展示费用），你得达到一百万下载量才能谋生。” 但…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. The **Uber** CEO **Dario**, was was sat here with me yesterday in that scene and he was telling me he was like the thing is there's this thing called **Jevans paradox** where when yeah when become more efficient whatever people think of things in linear progression but actually there's exponential progression. So when we launched **Uber** more people started taking taxis. So all of the models about how big this market were were all wrong. And I find the same in that and I found the same in about 5 years ago was yeah like you set me down and go well **Steve** CPMs you're going to have to be getting a million downloads to make like to earn a living like but

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 就像等着瞧吧。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: like wait and see.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，做这件事，让它发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah thing and let it let it happen.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，你就是一个很好的例子。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I mean you're a prime example of that.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。把精力集中在把事情做到最好，而不是想着如何从中赚钱，总是更好的选择。我是说，我整个攀岩生涯中，我总是努力专注于如何“送出”，在攀岩术语中，这意味着做最难的事情。你总是专注于“送出”，然后其他一切都会随之而来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. It's always better to focus your energy on being the best at the thing that you're trying to do than figuring out how to monetize it or you know make money off of it. It's like I don't know. I mean, my whole like life as a climber, I've always tried to focus on like how do you send, which in climbing terms means like do the hard thing. Like you always focus on sending and then everything else follows.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 哇。你脸上那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Whoa. What's that on your face?

</details>

**主持人**: This is my **Bon Charge** face mask. I've been wearing this for some time now. They're a sponsor of the podcast. I put this on for 15 20 minutes a day. I can sit here in the chair and wear it. Boosts my collagen production. helps with fine lines, blemishes, my complexion gets better, and then people more people listen to podcasts cuz I I look better. Professionalgrade equipment in such a small box. It's noninvasive.

And if you're in B2B marketing, that is much of the game. And this is where **LinkedIn** ads solves that problem for you. Their targeting is ridiculously specific. You can target by job title, seniority, company size, industry, and even someone's skill set. And their network includes over a billion professionals. About 130 million of them are decision makers.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's funny you you talking about mortality earlier on and um I think in the last couple of years my mortality like realizing that I'm going to die someday has been such a a wonderful thing to to really remind myself of and like a frequent basis.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: What uh how come?

</details>

**主持人**: 只是因为，好吧，有很多原因。其中之一是，嗯，**沉没成本偏误**的整个概念，你在一件事上成功了，然后你现在有东西可以失去。所以人们会进入一种**损失厌恶**的状态，他们开始保护自己所拥有的。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Just because Okay, so there's many things. One of them is um the whole idea of like sunk cost bias where you become successful at a thing and you and now you have something to lose. So people go into a state of loss aversion where they start to protect what they have. Totally.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这会以一种方式限制你的生活，你停止接受挑战，停止冒险，停止做新事物。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And this narrows your life in a way where you stop taking challenges, stop taking risks, stop doing new things.

</details>

**主持人**: 另一件事是，通常来说，知道自己会死去并真正提醒自己这一点，它能让你从纠结于那些在宏大的宇宙现实中完全无关紧要的事情中解脱出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And the other thing generally about knowing you're going to die and really like reminding yourself of that is it liberates you from getting caught up and worrying about things that in the grand scheme of like cosmic reality are like totally inconsequential.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>

**主持人**: 不太清楚。你知道他们过着什么样的生活，他们担心什么，他们如何感到尴尬和羞耻吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not really. And do you know the life they lived and what they were worried about and how they were embarrassed and their shame.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。没错。不，你什么都不知道。

### 亲密关系与情感表达

**Alex Honnold**: 你之前说过，当你住在面包车里十年时，你想要一个女朋友。

<details>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 现在，我不是在开玩笑，但像你这样的人，以及在某种程度上像我这样的人，由于各种原因，在亲密关系中会遇到困难。我想我在看纪录片**《徒手攀岩》**时确实看到了这一点。我看到你当时有一个伴侣。在悬崖边发生了一起事故，你摔了下来，而她本应保护你。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Now, I'm not being funny, but people that fit your profile and uh to some degree, people that fit my profile struggle in intimate relationships for a variety of reasons. And I think I actually saw this in the documentary when I watched **Free Solo**. I saw you had a partner at the time. There was an accident on the cliff side where you fell and she was supposed to be protecting you.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。总的来说，我只是看到一个人，他可能更不善于表达情感，更倾向于逃避承诺。这准确吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm. And generally I just saw someone who probably is more on the um less affectionate, more commitment avoidant side of life. Is that accurate?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我不知道是不是逃避承诺，因为我确实有过长期的女朋友之类的，但是，是的，我肯定更不善于表达。我的情商不如我妻子。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I don't know about commitment avoidant because actually I have had long-term girlfriends and things but but yeah, definitely I'm like less expressive. I'm less emotionally intelligent than my wife.

</details>

**主持人**: 她有没有给你反馈说，她希望你更情绪化一点？我是说，我明白。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Has she ever given you feedback that she wishes you were more emotionally uh available? I mean, I get that.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，是的，是的。也许用不同的词语，但基本上是这样。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I mean, yeah. Yeah. in in different words perhaps, but yeah, basically

</details>

**主持人**: **Sanni**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Sonnie.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，**Sanni**。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah, **Sonnie**

</details>

**主持人**: 是她的名字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: is her name.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 她写了一封信。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: She wrote a letter.

</details>

**主持人**: 天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh gosh,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这很有趣，因为开头两个词是：“天哪，一封亲密的信要大声读出来。”

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: that's funny because the first two words are, "Oh gosh, an intimate letter out loud."

</details>

**主持人**: 天哪，她确实了解我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh gosh, she she does know me.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 她说：“显然，这是你最糟糕的噩梦。”

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Obviously, this is your worst nightmare, she said.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是…她太了解我了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's She knows me so well.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 但我们有时都必须做可怕的事情，**Alex**。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: But we all have to do scary things sometimes, Alex.

</details>

**主持人**: 啊，我的教练。她说：“我记得你曾经读过一本书，里面有一个女人说她比大多数人更少受情感影响。在她的一生中，人们试图说服她她错了，她在压抑自己的感情，但最终，她只是没有。当你读到这里时，你转向我，说了类似的话，大概是：‘每个人都想相信我把所有这些东西，这些感情深埋在心里，但我只是没有。’ 我笑了，我开玩笑说：‘别担心。我知道你内心已死。’ 如果我没记错的话，你给了我一个拥抱。但我经常思考这段对话，因为作为你的妻子，我花了很多时间试图理解你。虽然显然有一些情感驱动着你，但我大部分时间都在开玩笑说你内心已死。我确实认为你比我们很多人更少受焦虑、恐惧、羞耻、内疚或自我怀疑等一些情感的影响。但我认识你越久，我就越看到表面之下隐藏着一片不同的海洋。填补这些情感通常会占据的空间的是真正看清事物的能力。你像一只鹰一样穿梭于世界，而我们其他人则迷失在思绪中。作为一名攀岩者，你能看到岩壁的攀登路线，建筑物的可攀爬性，或山脉的层层历史。作为一名父亲，你注意到女儿们安静的内在渴望，或家里需要做的家务。作为一名朋友，你看到你遇到的每个人身上蕴藏的巨大潜力。有时这是你最难理解的地方。没有什么能逃过你的眼睛。无论是优点还是缺点，无论是奉献的时刻还是懒惰的时刻。你对你的选择和我们的生活评估得实际而直率。但这也是因为你看到了我们。而关注就是爱。你清晰地看待世界的能力也让你能更清晰地欣赏它。那是一种特殊的爱。也许那里毕竟蕴藏着情感的源泉。但就这封信而言，**Alex**，我想把你的礼物还给你，告诉你我看到了什么，尤其是在我们有了孩子之后的四年里，因为我认为你和我们一起穿梭于世界的方式是一个独特的爱情故事。我看到你从攀岩区冲下小径，以便及时赶回家和我和女儿们一起吃晚饭。我看到你坐红眼航班，以便早一天回家。我看到你即使有一个巨大的目标在地平线上，仍然挤出时间进行健身训练，这样我也有时间锻炼。我看到你白天将身体推向极限，但仍然设法保持清醒足够长时间，以便晚上和我聊天。我看到你多花一天时间旅行，只是为了说服有钱人向你的基金会捐款，帮助拯救地球。我看到你为了工作机会调整了你的整个训练计划，以便为我和女儿们提供美好的生活。我看到你每天都在进行疯狂的平衡表演，不仅要成为一名伟大的运动员，还要成为一名伟大的父亲和丈夫。我知道这不容易，但我看到了，我也很感激。我们爱你本来的样子，**Alex**。不感情用事，但存在，投入，并且总是能看到别人错过的地方。你的，**Sanni**。”

<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She said, "I remember when you read a book once about a woman who said she was less affected by emotions than most people. For her entire life, people tried to convince her that she was wrong, that she was suppressing her feelings, but at the end of the day, she just wasn't." As you were reading, you turned to me and said something similar, something like, "Everyone wants to believe that I'm burying all these things, these feelings deep inside, but I'm just not." And I laughed and I joked, "Don't worry. I know you're dead inside. If I remember correctly, you gave me a hug. But I've thought about this conversation a lot because as the person married to you, I spend a lot of time trying to understand you. And while there obviously are emotions that drive you, I was mostly joking about the dead inside part. I do think you are far less affected by some feelings like anxiety, fear, shame, guilt, or self-doubt than many of us. But the longer I know you, the more I see an ocean of something else hiding beneath the surface. Filling the space that would normally be taken up by all these feelings is the ability to truly see things. You move through the world like a hawk while the rest of us are lost in thought. As a climber, you can see the way up a rock face, the climbability of a building, or the layered history of a mountain range. As a father, you notice the quiet intrinsic desires of your daughters or the chores that need doing around the house. And as a friend, you see the raw potential in every person that you meet. Sometimes this is the hardest thing about you. Nothing goes unnoticed. Neither the strengths nor the weaknesses, the moments of dedication or the moments of laziness. You are practical and blunt in your assessment of your choices and our lives. But that's also because you see us. And paying attention is love. Your ability to see the world so clearly allows you to also appreciate it more clearly. And that is a special form of your love. Perhaps there's a well of emotion in there after all. But but for the purposes of this letter, Alex, I want to give you your gift back to you and tell you what what I see particularly in the last four years since we had kids because I think the way you move through the world with us is a unique love story. I see you rushing down the trail from the climbing area so you can get back in time for dinner with me and the girls. I see you flying the red eye so you can be home a day sooner. I see you cramming in your gym session even when you have a huge goal on the horizon so that I have time for my workout too. I see you pushing your body to the absolute limit during the day but still managing to stay awake long enough to chat to me at night. I see you taking on an extra day of travel just to convince someone with money to donate to your foundation and help save the planet. I see you adjusting your whole training schedule for work opportunities in order to provide a wonderful life for me and the girls. I see the insane juggling act you do every day to not only be a great athlete, but a great dad and husband. I know it's not easy, but I see it and I appreciate it. We love you as you are, Alex. Not overly emotional, but present, committed, and always seeing what others miss. Yours, **Sani**."

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 她非常敏锐。我当时想，这就是我娶她的原因。你知道。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: she is very astute. I was like that's I was like that's why I married her you know

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 她非常敏锐。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: she is very astute.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我从读这封信中学到了很多关于你的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. I learned a lot about you from reading this.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: H what do you think?

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道，我们都以不同的方式表达爱，有时我认为世界衡量爱的传统方式是通过言语表达和浪漫姿态之类的。但还有另一种人，他们常常在生活中对爱的期望方面挣扎，他们通过服务行为来表达爱。那真的是我们前几天晚上在床上关于某件事的最后一次大争吵，不是完全的爆发，但基本上她有点像，我只是需要更多，你知道，言语上的表达。我当时有点像，我真的在做所有的事情。我总是说，你知道，行动胜于言语。我有点像，如果你在做所有的事情，你就在做正确的事情。你不需要谈论它们，因为你正在做这些事情，你知道，那基本上是一来一往。我是说，你知道，我接受了她的观点，那就是偶尔你也要说正确的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know we all show our love in different ways and sometimes I think the conventional way that the world tries to measure love is through the like verbal expression of it and romantic gestures and those kinds of things. But there's another type of person who often struggles, I think, in in what life's expectations of what love looks like, who show it through acts of service. That was that was literally one of our last big arguments about something like in bed the other night, not like a total blowout, but basically she was sort of like, I just need more, you know, of the verbal kind. And I was kind of like, I'm literally doing all the things. And I always sort of say, you know, actions speak louder than words. I'm kind of like, if you're doing all the things, you're doing the correct things. you don't need to talk about them because you're doing the things, you know, and that was basically a a back and forth. I mean, you know, I took her point that like occasionally you have to say the right thing, too.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我和我的未婚妻也在重复同样的争论。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Well, I have the same the same argument on repeat with my fiance.

</details>

**主持人**: 她也需要言语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: H she needs the words, too.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。她就像有不同的语言。她在说西班牙语，我在说法语。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. She has like a different language. She's speaking Spanish. I'm speaking French.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 而且，顺便说一句，我必须说，在某种深层面上，再次因为我早期的背景，就像你一样，我希望我的父母分手。我希望他们离婚，因为我看到的爱不是幸福的。我想在某种深层面上，我有一个承诺问题或亲密关系问题。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And also, by the way, I have to say at some deep level, again, because of my early context where like you, I wished my parents would break up. I wish they would just get a divorce because the model of love I saw was not a happy one. I think at some deep level I have a commitment problem or an intimacy problem where

</details>

**主持人**: 即使在成长过程中，说某人是我的“最好的朋友”也让我有点不舒服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: even growing up say calling someone my best friend somewhat made me cringe.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 就像对某人说亲昵的话，在某种深层面上让我感到非常不舒服。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Like saying saying affectionate words to someone at some deep level made me feel deeply uncomfortable

</details>

**主持人**: 所以你可以想象我当时的样子，然后我想，我们常常会选择与自己相反的人结婚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and so you can imagine me being ding and then I think like often times we go for the opposite in the person we end up mar like marrying or

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。对我来说当然是这样。是的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Certainly for me. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。嗯，当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Well certainly.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。我妻子比我整个大家庭中的任何人都更具情商。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. My wife is like way more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my entire extended family.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我也是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, same.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这就是你如何建立丰富的生活，你基本上就像，我是说，就像招聘一样。你找到团队成员，他们拥有你所需的所有优势，就像你做不到的事情。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: This is how you build a rich life is that you basically like I mean it's like hiring. You find members of the team who have all the strengths that you need and it's like the things that you can't do and

</details>

**主持人**: 这就像填补你的盲点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it's like filling your blind spots basically.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你有没有更擅长说那些话？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Have you got better at saying the words?

</details>

**主持人**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 有进展吗？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Any progress?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，是的，可能有进展。但非常缓慢。但从某种意义上说，这很棒，你知道，因为我们将要结婚，共度余生，所以那可能是另外50、60年的时光。所以你需要看到渐进的进步，你知道，因为生活中真的没有什么比取得进步更好的了。我从一个很低的起点开始，进步得如此缓慢，以至于我基本上有一个很好的项目可以做一辈子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Uh yeah, progress probably. But very slow. But in a way that's great, you know, because we're going to be married the rest of our lives and so that could be another 50 60 years together. And so you need to see incremental progress, you know, because really there's nothing better in life than making progress. And I've started at such a low point and I'm making progress so slowly that I basically have a good project for the rest of my life.

</details>

### 毅力与复利效应

**主持人**: 哦，嗯，我们之前也提到过，但目前我一直关注的一件事，嗯，实际上是我在你的性格测试中看到的一点，那就是你在**毅力**方面得分很高。嗯，我们之前谈到过精通，以及坚持不懈地擅长某件事的重要性。但我想这对我来说，长期以来一直是我关注的焦点，因为即使作为一个播客主持人，我意识到很多游戏，我现在已经做了五年了，嗯，当我看到像**Joe Rogan**这样的人时，他已经做了大概15、17年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, um, we kind of touched on it before, but one of the things that's been in front of mind for me at the moment is, um, actually something I saw in your personality test, which was you were high in perseverance. And, uh, we talked earlier on about like mastery and how it's important to, um, persist to get good at something. But this has just been front of mind for me I think for a long time because even like as a podcaster I realize that a lot of the game I'm like five years in now and um when I look at someone like **Joe Rogan** he's been going for like I don't know 15 17 years

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 或者更久。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: or more

</details>

**主持人**: 我就会觉得，在某件事上变得出色，努力奋斗，很大程度上就是付出异乎寻常的努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and I go like so much of the game in becoming great at something grinding it's just going unusual amount of

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这就像**复利**。我就会想，看看**沃伦·巴菲特**。你见过**沃伦·巴菲特**的资料吗？就像，你知道，他花了40年才赚到他最初的几百万美元，然后又花了10到15年才赚到他最初的十亿美元，然后，你知道，在过去的八年里，他赚了大概一千亿美元，你知道，因为他的全部财富就像是，哇。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: it's like compounding interest. I'm like look at **Warren Buffett**. Have you ever seen stuff with **Warren Buffett** where it's like, you know, it took him whatever 40 years to make his first couple million or whatever, took him another like 10 or 15 years to make his first billion and then it took him like whatever in the last eight years he's made like hundred billion dollars, you know, cuz his whole wealth is like woo.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你就会觉得，基本上，如果你在一件事上投入足够的时间，并让它**复利**，它就会慢慢变得越来越大。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: You're kind of like basically if you put enough time into something and you let it compound, it like slowly gets bigger and bigger.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全就是这样。所以我一直在思考…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's exactly that. And so I've been thinking about like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以所有这些数字都是不正确的，但图表的形状是正确的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So all those numbers are incorrect, but the the shape of the graph is correct.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们会把它放在屏幕上，让大家都能看到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We'll put it on the screen so everyone can see.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，是的，是的。有人纠正我的数字。原则是正确的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody correct my numbers. The principle is correct.

</details>

**主持人**: 这和你画的职业生涯图是一样的。嗯，这和播客的增长是一样的，三年没有人听，然后我们有了这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's the same. It's the same as this graph here that you drew of your career. Um it's the same as the podcast growth where three years no one was listening and then we have this

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我认为作为一个原则…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um and I I think as a principle

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这就是为什么你要专注于做有价值的事情，因为对于播客来说，如果你觉得你在做一些有用的事情，你觉得很酷，你觉得有东西在那里，你就会一直做下去，最终人们就会加入进来。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: that's why you focus on doing something of value because with the podcast like if you feel like you're doing something useful and that you think is cool and you think there's something there you just keep doing it and eventually people get on board.

</details>

### 如何持续超越他人

**主持人**: 好的。所以，沿着这个思路，我一直在思考如何创造条件，让我能在自己热爱的领域中持续超越他人。其中一件事，比如对于播客来说，就是永远不要进行我不期待的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. So on that train of thought, I've thought a lot about how do I create the conditions to out-persist other people in the areas that I love. And one such thing, for example, with a podcast is like never have a conversation that I'm not looking forward to

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 因为那从长远来看是不可持续的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: because that's unsustainable over the long term.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全正确。因为那样就会感觉像是在做苦工，而不是像这样，这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Totally. Cuz then it feels like hard work as opposed to something like this is amazing.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。所以当我看到我的，他们会说，哦，这个人想来，他们有160亿粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. So when I look at my they'll say, oh this person wants to come and they've got 160 gazillion followers.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你就会说，我不在乎那个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But you're like I don't care about that person.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。因为如果我把那作为未来十年的决策框架，我就会放弃。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Because if I if I use that as a decision framework for the next 10 years, I'll quit.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你有没有想过，在你自己的领域中，如何创造条件来持续超越他人？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Do you think about that like the conditions to out persist in your domain?

</details>

**主持人**: 我是说，有点吧。是的。我是说，我没怎么想过，因为我他妈的爱死攀岩了，它的一切形式我都喜欢。所以，基本上，攀岩对我来说很容易，但就我做的工作而言，嗯，我忘了，我想我是在我们开始录音之前和你谈过，但是，嗯，我主持一个叫做**《地球梦想家》**的播客。嗯，它就像**劳力士**的“永恒星球”系列。我采访科学家和环保主义者之类的。无论出于什么原因，每次我做那些播客时，我都会感到充满活力，就像我应该多训练，我应该学习，我应该学点什么。基本上，因为我采访的人都非常擅长他们所做的事情，而且他们都在以不同的方式努力拯救世界。你知道，就像海洋生物学家探索深海海底之类的。昨天，我采访了两位女士，她们谈到我们只探索了深海的0.001%，而深海占地球的三分之二。所以，基本上，地球的三分之二我们几乎一无所知。而且海底有一个丰富的水下世界，里面有很多很酷的东西正在发生，我们从未见过，也一无所知，这太疯狂了。我当时想，那太酷了。我对此非常兴奋。所以当我从工作，你知道，所谓的“工作”中出来时，我感到充满活力，兴奋地学习和成长，你知道，推动自己。我有点觉得，这就是我想尽可能多做的工作。然后还有其他一些事情，你知道，我会做企业演讲之类的，你出现在一个会议上，然后你就会感到精疲力尽，你知道，当你离开回到酒店时，你所能做的就是躺在床上一个小时，想着：“我在用我的生命做什么？” 你就会觉得有点崩溃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean, kind of. Yeah. I mean, I haven't had to think about it too much because I freaking love climbing in all its forms. And so, basically, climbing comes easily, but like in terms of the work stuff I do, um I forget I think I was talking to you before we started recording, but um but I host this podcast called **Planet Visionaries**. Uh it's like a **Rolex Perpetual Planet**. Like I interview scientists and conservationists and whatever. And for whatever reason, every time I do those podcasts, I come out of it feeling all energized and like, I should train more. I should study. I should learn something. Basically, because the people that I'm interviewing are all so uniquely good at what they do, and they're all trying to save the world in different ways. It's like, you know, marine biologists like exploring the deep sea floor and things like that. Yesterday, I interviewed these two uh women about the fact that we've only explored .001% of the deep sea, which represents two-thirds of the planet. So, basically, two-thirds of the planet we know like literally nothing about. And there's like this rich underwater world of like cool stuff going on in the ocean floor that we've never seen and know nothing about and it's insane. I was like that's so cool. And I got all fired up about it. And so I come out of work thing, you know, quote unquote work things like that and I'm like energized and excited to learn and grow, you know, push myself and I'm kind of like that's the type of work that I want to do as much as possible. And then there are other kinds of things where you know I'll do like corporate speaking or something where you show up at a conference and you just like get ground down you know when you leave and you go back to your hotel and all you can do is just like lie there on the bed for an hour being like h what am I doing with my life you know you feel like kind of wrecked.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以，如果你能专注于那些让你感到启发和兴奋，想要努力工作的工作，而不是那些让你只想漫无目的地刷几个小时手机的工作，那该多好。你明白我的意思吗？因为有时你就是觉得，哦，我受够了。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So it's like if you can focus on the work where you come out of it feeling inspired and like excited to try hard versus the work that makes you want to like mindlessly scroll on something for hours. You know what I mean? Cuz sometimes you're just like oh I'm just so over it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。有人在我的职业生涯中对我说过，他说，每当你发现那些让你感到开阔的领域时…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Someone said that to me in my career. I said like whenever you find domains that make you feel expansive like

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: totally

</details>

**主持人**: 你就应该加倍投入那些领域，因为那是通往精通的道路。你将能够继续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you should double down on those domains cuz you're that's the path to mastery. You're going to be able to continue.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。因为你可以在那方面继续非常努力地推进。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Because you can just keep pushing super hard in that

</details>

**主持人**: 幸好对于攀岩来说，一直都是这样，我就是他妈的爱死攀岩了。它太棒了。你应该多攀岩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: thankfully for climbing that's always just been that like I just freaking love climbing. It's so great. You should do it more.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我知道，**Alex**，你让我们所有人都想多攀岩。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I know you you make us all want to climb more, Alex.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想这是观看你做像**台北**这样的事情的一个巨大影响。我是说，**台北**街头有很多孩子，我想，他们都在尝试攀爬建筑物。有很多有趣的视频。然后，显然，他们只爬了一米左右就摔下来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's one of the I think the great um consequences of watching you do something like **Taipei**. I mean, there was loads of kids in the streets of **Taipei**, I think, that were all trying to climb buildings. There was loads of like funny videos. Then, obviously, they were only getting like a meter up before they fell.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我当时想，希望他们不要，是的，希望不要有太多模仿者，但是，是的，我们从**Netflix**那里得到了一些惊人的数据，我想在**台湾**，一半以上拥有**Netflix**订阅的人观看了那次攀登。在**台湾**，那真是太疯狂了。就像，几乎每个人都看了。它是一座如此独特、引人注目的**台北**建筑。它就像一个国家标志，你知道吗？它太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I was like, hopefully they don't Yeah, hopefully it's not too much copycatting, but yeah, we got some crazy numbers from **Netflix** that I think half of people or more than half of people who have a **Netflix** subscription in in **Taiwan** watched the building climb on uh it's like in in **Taiwan**, it was like insane. Like, literally everybody watch. It's it's such a it's such a singular striking building in in **Taipei**. It's like a total national icon, you know? It's like a it's it's insane.

</details>

### 设定目标与神经可塑性

**主持人**: 你已经开始考虑下一步要做什么了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you already started thinking about what you're going to do next?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 人们总是问：“你的下一个大目标是什么？” 我就会说，你知道，如果你只是专注于一直做很多小事情，偶尔大事情就会发生，你无法完全提前知道。你明白我的意思吗？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: People are always like, you know, what's your next big thing? And I'm kind of like, you know, if you just focus on doing lots of little things all the time, occasionally the big things just happen and you can't totally know ahead of time. You know what I mean?

</details>

**主持人**: 那就是我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's me.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，至少，我是说，我有20年前就开始的攀岩目标。我手机上有很多笔记。我总是有待办事项清单。尤其是我住在面包车里旅行的时候，你就像季节性地不停地在攀岩目的地之间移动。所以我列出了所有这些不同类型的目标。比如我想做这些类型的事情。某些目标会导向其他目标，因为它们属于同一种体能类型，比如说。所以，做非常大的事情有助于你以后做更大的事情，但做非常困难和紧张的事情有助于你以后做其他困难和紧张的事情，你知道吗？所以在某些方面，你堆叠目标的方式，你可以逐渐积累到大事情，或者积累到非常困难的事情之类的。所以我总是有不断更新的待办事项清单，比如我今年要尝试完成所有这些攀登。而实际上，我通常只完成一半，或者有些我甚至从未尝试过，因为天气不好。我最终去了另一个地方，或者我根本没去那个攀岩目的地。所以我甚至从未尝试过那个项目。但我总是有很多这样的目标。回顾多年来的这类清单，我只是发现很难预测你何时会实现那些尖端或开创性的事情。你只需要不停地做这些事情，偶尔其中一些就会脱颖而出。我是说，这又回到了创造价值的那些事情上，你不知道哪些事情会很棒。你只是做所有的事情，其中一些最终会很棒。

**Alex Honnold**: Well, so at least, so I mean, I have climbing goals going back 20 years. I have all these notes on my phone. I always have like to-do lists. of especially when I lived in the van and I was traveling, you're like seasonally moving between climbing destinations non-stop. So I'd lay I'd layer out all these different types of goals. Like I want to do these types of things. Certain goals lead to other goals because they're same type of fitness, let's say. So like doing really big things help you do even bigger things later, but doing like really hard and intense things help you do other hard and intense things later, you know? So in some ways in the way you stack your goals, you can kind of build up to big things or like build up to really hard things or whatever. And so I've always had running to-do lists of like I'm going to try to do all these climbs this year. And realistically, I normally do like half of them or or some of them I never even get to because it's like the weather's not good. I wind up going to a different area or I like don't go to that that climbing destination at all. And so I never even try the project. But I've always had tons of goals like that. And looking back at years and years of that type of those types of lists, I just see that it's slightly hard to predict when you're going to achieve the things that are like cutting edge or groundbreaking or whatever. You just have to keep doing the things non-stop and every once in a while some of them rise to the top. I mean, this kind of goes back to the same like value creating things like you don't know which things are going to be rad. You just do all the things and some of them wind up being rad.

**主持人**: 那么决策框架就是只做你喜欢并能挑战你的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And the decision framework there is to just do things you love and that challenge you.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。那些以正确的方式推动你，对你来说是新的，对你来说是困难的，有挑战性的事情，你知道，但你就是不能，你不能总是提前知道哪些事情会脱颖而出，哪些不会，但你仍然会去做，因为你正在从中学习，你对它们感到兴奋，它们很难，然后，你知道，有些很酷，有些不酷。有些你甚至从未尝试过，那也没关系。你就是继续做事情。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. things that push you in a like things that are new for you that are hard for you that are challenging in the right ways, you know, but you just can't you don't always know ahead of time which of those things are going to stand out or not, but you just do them anyway because you're learning from them, you're excited about them, they're hard and then, you know, some are cool, some aren't. Some you never even try and like that's fine. You just keep doing things.

**主持人**: 因为这会限制他们遇到偶然的机会和可能性，如果他们心胸开阔。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because it narrows them to the serendipity and opportunity and things that might happen if they're broad and openminded.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，或者，嗯，我和我妻子有时开玩笑说，我们都有非常坚定的观点，但又很灵活，就像：“哦，我完全确定一件事，直到我得到一些数据表明那是错的。” 然后你就会想：“哦，算了。扔掉它。” 我的很多待办事项清单或目标一直都是这样，我就会想：“哦，我有所有这些目标。” 但如果我这一年稍微偏离一点，就像，出于某种原因，其他一些事情出现了，做所有这些其他事情是合理的，我就会立即转向，然后改变。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Well, or um uh my wife and I sometimes joke it's that we both have very strong opinions loosely held where it's like, "Oh, I'm totally sure of a thing right up until I get some data that shows that that's wrong." And then you're like, "Oh, never mind. throw that away. And that's kind of how a lot of my to-do lists have always been or like my goals where I'm like, "Oh, I have all these goals." But if I take a slight fork in my year where it's like turns out, uh, you know, for whatever reason, like something else lines up and it makes sense to do all these other things and I'm just like right turn and just change.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你知道。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: You know,

</details>

**主持人**: 这与你之前所说的，不要太担心今天能赚多少钱，或者什么是大目标，有点重叠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and it overlaps with what you said earlier about like not worrying so much about like how much it's going to pay me today or what the big thing is or

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 有点像，只管做酷的事情。一切都会好起来的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: it's kind of like just just keep doing cool things. It'll it'll all work out.

**主持人**: 我很想，你知道，扫描你的大脑，看看所有部分。尤其是在我了解了大脑中一个叫做**前扣带回皮层**的特定区域之后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I would love if we could, you know, scan your brain and look at all the parts. It's especially in the context I learned of about this particular region of the brain called the **anterior mid-sulate cortex**.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听**Andrew Huberman**谈论过。这是他们最近发现的大脑的一部分，当你做你不想做的事情时，它会亮起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Which I heard **Andrew Hman** been talking about. And it's a part of the brain they discovered quite recently that lights up when you do things that you don't want to do.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以不是你喜欢做但有点困难的事情，比如跑马拉松，而是你积极避免和抵制但仍然会做的事情。痛苦、恐惧、努力、纪律。这是决定你放弃还是坚持下去的回路。你做你不想做的事情越多，它就越会增长。所以他们现在认为它是大脑中的**意志力肌肉**。当他们看运动员时，他们有更大的**意志力肌肉**。当他们看那些挣扎的人，或者更久坐不动的人，或者体重有问题的人时，他们通常有更小的**意志力肌肉**。任何避免不适的人都有更小的**意志力肌肉**。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So not things that you enjoy doing that are somewhat like difficult like running a marathon, but things that you actively avoid and resist but do anyway. Pain, fear, effort, discipline. This is the circuit that decides whether you quit or you push through. And it grows the more you do things you don't want to do. So it's like they now consider it to be the muscle of willpower in the brain. When they look at athletes, they have bigger ones. When they look at people who are struggling or less are more sedentary or struggling with their weight, they often have smaller ones. Anyone that avoids discomfort has a smaller one.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，嗯，在你的生活中，你一直在做困难的事情。我是说，你可能喜欢攀岩，但你不一定喜欢…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So um in your in the context of the way you've lived your life, you've continued to do things that are hard. I mean, you can love climbing, but you don't necessarily love

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。但每次多做一组，那总是一个挑战。你总是会觉得我全身都疼，但我会再多做一点，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. But just doing like one more set every time is like that's that's always a challenge. You're always like my whole body hurts but I'll just do a little more, you know?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我想这里的重点是关于**神经可塑性**，现在有很多听众，他们离他们的A型人格，离他们的**台北101**太远了。他们从事着不喜欢的工作。他们可能就是你刚才说的那种金融男，他们的生活缺乏冒险。他们可能看着你，然后说，嗯，你知道，他只是拥有我没有的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And I think the thing I guess here is like about neuroplasticity which there's going to be a ton of people listening right now that are so far away from their type A from their type A 101. They're so far away from that. They're in a job they just don't like. They're maybe the finance bra that you know you talked about a second ago and their life is absent of ad adventure and they probably look at you and go well you know he just has something I don't have.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我知道，但我就是没有，你知道，我是说，我只是以不同的方式构建了我的生活，我做出了许多不同的选择，所有这些，但关键是，我真的不认为我有什么不同。我是说，我实际上讨厌所有那些关于大脑的东西，因为人们总是用它来把我归类，说：“嗯，你与众不同。” 我就会说：“嗯，不完全是。我是一个中产阶级郊区长大的孩子。我的父母，我家没有人是运动员。没有人擅长运动。你知道，就像，如果你要看，你知道，就像如果我是一个电子游戏角色，你要看我所有的小条，你就会说：‘那家伙不会成为运动员。他在这方面不擅长。’ 你知道，就像我的父母是教授，我们他妈的读书。我没有，真的没有任何天赋。”

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I know, but I just don't, you know, I mean, I've structured my life in a different way and I've made many different choices and and all that, but that's the thing is I don't really think I have anything different. I mean, I I actually hate all the like brain stuff because people always like use that to to put me in this box of like, well, you're different. And I'm like, well, not really. Like, I'm a middle-class suburban kid. Both my parents like nobody in my family is athletic. Like, nobody is good at sports at all. You know, it's like like basically if you were to like look at the, you know, like if I was a video game character and you were to look at all my little bars, you'd be like, "That guy's not going to be an athlete. Like he's not good at this." You know, it's like my parents professors and we freaking read books. Like I'm not there's no aptitude for anything really.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我小时候运动很差。我不擅长球类运动。你知道，没有理由。但我是说，我只是非常热爱攀岩，所以我愿意投入大量的时间和精力，最终变得擅长。我有点觉得听到人们说：“哦，你的大脑不同。” 你就会想：“嗯，每个人的大脑在某些方面都有一点不同。” 这并不意味着你不能全身心地投入到你关心的事情中。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And I was like bad at sports as a kid. I'm not good with balls. Like, you know, there's no reason. But I mean, really, I just have loved climbing enough that I've been willing to put in a tremendous amount of time and effort and eventually get good at it. And I'm kind of like to hear people say like, "Oh, your brain's different." You're kind of like, "Well, everybody's brain is a little bit different in some ways." It doesn't mean that you can't devote yourself to something that you care about.

</details>

**主持人**: 但考虑到这一点，以及我采访过的所有神经科学家，你的大脑之所以不同，部分原因在于你做了不同的事情。而**神经可塑性**表明，你可以在你的一生中改变你的大脑。我的一个朋友，嗯，**Tom Bilyeu**就是一个很好的例子。他是一个著名的播客主持人。你可能认识**Tom Bilyeu**。嗯，但是他，你知道，他当时，我不记得大概的年龄了，但我会说他30岁。用他的话说，他懒惰到整天躺在床上。当他女朋友回家时，他说他会跳下床，只是为了让她不相信他整天都在床上。他不想感到尴尬。当他问他当时的女朋友，如果他能，嗯，问她爸爸他是否可以娶她时，她爸爸说不。他当时就是懒惰、沮丧。在接下来的十年里，他决定接受更困难的挑战，建立了一家价值十亿美元的公司，然后卖掉了它。如果你今天见到这个人，你会觉得他像个运动员、天才、超级聪明、有动力。你会恳求他给你关于纪律和动力的建议。他就是那种人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But with this in mind, and with all the neuroscientists that I've interviewed, your brain is different in part because you've taken you've done different things. And **neuroplasticity** says you can change your brain right the way up throughout your your entire life. One of my friends, um, **Tom Bilu** is a good example of that. He's a big podcaster. You might know **Tom Bilu**. Um, but he, you know, he was, I can't remember the rough age, but I'm going to say he was 30 years old. He was so, in his words, lazy that he would lay in bed all day. When his girlfriend came home, he said he would jump up out of bed just so she didn't believe that he was in bed all day. And he didn't want to be embarrassed. And when he asked his at the time girlfriend if if he could um asked her dad if he could marry her, dad said no. He was he just he was like lazy down and out. Over the next 10 years, he makes decisions to take on more difficult challenges, builds a billion dollar company, sells it. If you meet this guy today, you'd think like athlete, genius, super smart, motivated. You'd beg him for advice on discipline and motivation. Like he's that kind of guy.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 什么？是的。那么他做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: What? Yeah. So, what did he do?

</details>

**主持人**: 他读了一本关于**神经可塑性**的书，他意识到他没有被困住。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He read a book about **neuroplasticity** and he realized that he wasn't stuck.

</details>

**主持人**: 他了解了**神经可塑性**，这意味着在你人生的任何年龄，你做出的决定都会改变你的大脑。这就是为什么我喜欢**前扣带回皮层**的这个发现，因为它意味着，也许我没有接受我的**台北101**挑战，部分原因是因为我还没有接受我的**台北101**挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He he learned about **neuroplasticity**, which means that at any age in your life, the decisions you make change your brain. And that's why I love this discovery of this **anterior mid-syncular cortex** because it means that like maybe in part the reason why I'm not taking on my type A 101 is because I haven't taken on my type A 101.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。你确实，你还没有接受你的A1型。你知道你的A型，你的A12型之类的。你知道，就像底部的小碎片。因为关键是，这就是为什么当你问我任何大目标时，我都会说，我有时觉得大目标有点限制性，因为如果你是那个躺在床上的朋友，**台北101**就不是一个合适的目标。你明白我的意思吗？就像你需要，你需要A4型。你只需要出去做一点小事。你需要取得一些成功。你需要看到你能做一些事情，你需要接受适当规模的挑战，因为我认为拥有一个伟大的白鲸，你知道，有时很棒，但那不总是你需要的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. You have well you haven't taken on uh your type A1. You know your type A your type A 12 or whatever. you know, like just the little pieces at the bottom. Cuz that's the thing is like and and actually this is why when you ask about like any big goals, I'm like I I sometimes I think the big goals are slightly limiting because like if you're your friend who's laying in bed, **typo 101** is not the appropriate goal. You know what I mean? Like you need you need to type a four. Like you need to just get out and like do a little thing. You need to achieve some success. you need to see that you can do something and you need to take on appropriately sized challenges because I think having a great white whale, you know, is is great sometimes, but that's not always what you need, you know,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 而且部分原因，就像对我来说，现在，你知道，我们正在抚养两个小孩子，我们正处于其中，你知道，就像现在是睡觉时间。这很辛苦。我当时想，我现在不需要像**酋长岩**那么大的目标，因为，你知道，我们只是想度过人生的某个阶段。并不是说我永远不会有其他大目标，但你就会觉得，你希望你的目标与你拥有的时间和空间相适应。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: and and partially like for me right now, you know, we're raising two little kids and we're just like in the midst of it, you know, it's like bedtime right now is hanging. It's just like it's a lot. And I'm like, I don't need like an **LC** capsized goal right now because, you know, we're just trying to make it through a certain phase of life really. Not to say that I'll never have other big goals, but you're kind of like you you want your goals to be appropriate to the the time and and and space that you have available.

</details>

**主持人**: 我曾听一位心理学家谈到，设定一个A1型的小目标。人们不这么做的原因是因为他们觉得它太小了，以至于他们认为它无关紧要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I had a psychologist say to me about this idea of just setting yourself a type A1, like a small goal. The reason why people don't do it is because they see it as almost so embarrassingly small that they don't think it matters.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。但我是说，那正是你专注于它的原因，它对你来说不重要。它是不是你没有做过的事情？它对你的成长有益吗？它对你来说有挑战性吗？它足够好了。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. But I mean, but that's why you focus on it doesn't matter to you. Like is it something that you haven't done? Like is it good for your growth? Is it challenging for you? like it's good enough.

</details>

**主持人**: 但那位心理学家告诉我，当他们治疗一位非常缺乏动力的病人时，他们无法走出卧室，卧室里堆满了盘子和餐具，第一天就是把吸尘器搬进房间。那是第一天。第二天是插上电源。那是第二天。到第30天，他们出门了。这是一个害怕出门的人。他们出门散步。房间很干净。但他对我说，人们不迈出第一步，因为它太小了，小到几乎令人羞耻，以至于不好意思说，今天我们只是把吸尘器搬进来。是的，但关键是，迈出一步总比不迈出一步好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But that same psychologist told me that when they were dealing with a patient who was so demotivated um that they couldn't get out of their bedroom which was stacked to the ceiling with plates and cutlery that day one was bringing the Hoover into the room. That was day one. Day two was plugging it in. That was day two. And by day 30 they're outside. This is someone who was scared of going outside. They're outside walking around. The room is clean. But he he said to me that people don't take that first step because it's so embarrassingly small that it's almost shameful to say like today we're just going to bring the Hoover in. Yeah, but that's the thing is it's always better to take a step than to not take a step,

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你知道吗？是的。我是说，我一直都觉得这些事情是这样。你就会想，嗯，你不如出去做这件事。做点什么。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: you know? That's Yeah. I mean, that's how I've always felt with with all these things. You're like, well, you might as well go out and do the thing. Like, do something.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你记得一开始我说过，不要让完美成为优秀的敌人。做优秀的事情，你知道，因为它就像，不要让**完美主义**束缚你，你知道吗？就像，这就是为什么我认为，你知道，**台北101**，如果那是你的完美目标。就像不要让它阻止你出去攀登**台北A4**或A型，或者，你知道，周围的一些小建筑，因为它就像你练习你能做到的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: You remember at the beginning I was like, you don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Like, you do the good thing, you know, cuz it like it's like don't let perfectionism [ __ ] you, you know? It's like that's why I think you know **Taipe** A 101 if that's kind of like your perfect goal. It's like don't let that hold you back from going out and climbing **Taipe** A 4 or Type A or you know like some of the surrounding little buildings because it's like you practice on what you can.

</details>

**主持人**: 这又回到了**毅力**这一点。我多年前读到一句话，说“伟大不存在。伟大只是好的重复。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Goes back to this point of perseverance. I read a quote many years ago that said um greatness doesn't exist. Greatness is just good repeated.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我是说，这就是我所说的拥有很多小目标。我实际上会说，如果你重复足够好的事情，偶尔其中一些实际上会很棒，但你就是不知道。你知道，我注意到很多，就像在我的攀岩生涯中，在攀岩的漫长历程中，我做过很多事情，就像在一个赛季中，我在**优胜美地**有五六个目标，我完成了所有这些事情，其中一个，无论出于什么原因，最终会变得很棒，它会，你知道，登上攀岩新闻之类的。而其他的，你知道，可能没那么出名，但你无法完全提前知道哪些是酷的，哪些不是，哪些会经受住时间的考验。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I mean this is what I'm saying about having lots of little goals is that I would actually say that if you repeat good enough every once in a while some of those are great actually but you just don't totally know. You know, I noticed that a lot like in my climbing life, like in the long arc of climbing, there are tons of things I did in use where like in a season I'd have like five or six goals in use and I'd do all the things and one of them for whatever reason would wind up being like that's rad and it would, you know, like makes climbing news and things like that. And the other ones, you know, maybe less so, but you don't totally know ahead of time which ones are cool or not and which ones are going to stand the test of time.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 在不久的过去，我曾保持着**优胜美地**所有主要地貌的速攀记录。现在其中一些已经被打破了，但那些就是你永远不知道这些记录会持续多久的事情，因为有时你做了，然后你的朋友在下一个赛季就打破了，你就会觉得很酷，然后你来来回回，这都是一个有趣游戏的一部分，然后有些你创造的速攀记录会持续15年，你就会有点觉得，哦，我没想到这会成为一个里程碑。你知道。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: At one point in the not too distant past, I held a speed record on every major formation in use. Now a few of them have been broken over time and but those are the kinds of things where you never really know like how long those types of records will last cuz sometimes you do them and then your friend comes and breaks it the next season and you're like cool and you go back and forth and it's all part of a fun game and then some of them you set a speed record and it lasts for like 15 years and you're sort of like oh I didn't realize that this was going to be like such a milestone. You know,

</details>

**主持人**: 这让我想起了**史蒂夫·乔布斯**的那句话，关于你只能回顾过去才能真正连接点滴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it reminds me of um the **Steve Jobs** quote about how you can only really connect the dots looking backwards in a

**Alex Honnold**: 完全正确。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Totally. Totally.

</details>

**主持人**: **史蒂夫·乔布斯**在他的毕业典礼演讲中说：“你无法向前看连接点滴。你只能回顾过去连接它们。” 所以你必须相信这些点滴最终会以某种方式连接到你的未来。清晰不是行动的先决条件。它是你行动之后获得的奖励。这就是关键，我想，因为我做了很多采访，就像，你知道，你什么时候决定成为一名职业攀岩者？我就会说，没有那一刻。我只是年复一年地做这件事。而现在回顾过去，它看起来像一个惊人的弧线，你知道，但在当时，你总是，你知道，我花了几年时间思考，我应该回大学吗？我需要学位吗？然后我花了几年时间思考，我是否应该回去攻读行政MBA之类的，因为我当时想，我不想回本科。我已经在我的面包车里住了十年了。但你仍然会觉得，我需要那种认可。我需要，你知道，我想跳过那些障碍。然后真的，直到现在我才有点觉得，我不需要那个。部分原因，我想，我们很多人之所以被迫拖延，当我们试图向前看连接点滴时，是因为我们面临着社会提出的这些问题，比如你的计划是什么？你的职业是什么？你的目标是什么？而我们没有答案。所以我们填补空白。我们必须对爸爸妈妈说些什么。你必须说，未来的计划是什么？你不能什么都不说。没有计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **Steve Jobs** quote from his commencement speech was, "You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards." So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. Clarity isn't a prerequisite for action. It's the reward you get after you move. And that's that's the thing I think cuz I do so many interviews like, you know, when was the moment you decided to be a professional climber? And I'm like, there's no moment. Like, I just did the thing for years and years. And now looking backward, it looks like this amazing arc, you know, but at the moment you're always, you know, I spent years being like, should I go back to college? Like, do I need a degree? Like, and then I spent a few years wondering if I should go back and get like an executive MBA or something or something because I was like, I don't want to go back to undergrad. I've been living in my van for 10 years. And but you're kind of like still, I need that validation. I need, you know, I want to jump through the hoops. And then really, it's only now that I'm kind of like, I don't think I need that. In part, I think the reason why we um we so many of us get forced into procrastination when we're trying to connect the dots looking forward is because we face these questions from society which is like what's your plan? What's your career? What are you aiming at? And we don't have answers. So, we fill in the gaps. We have to say something to mom and dad. You have to say like what's the plan for the future? You can't say nothing. No plan.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，或者你只是说：“我正在生活。我只是让它顺其自然。我们拭目以待。这将是一场宏大的冒险。” 我不知道。我是说，我有点希望我的孩子们对此感到自信，你知道，就像：“嗯，我正在尽力而为。我正在练习我关心的事情，我们会看看结果如何。”

### 终极攀登挑战

**Alex Honnold**: 如果你知道你只剩下最后一周的生命，而且就是这一周，你只能做最后一次攀登，你会回去打破记录，再次攀登**酋长岩**，我不知道，另一座建筑物，你只有一周时间，假设你已经为任何攀登做好了充分准备。你会做什么？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: If you knew that you only had one week left to live and this was the week and you could only do one last climb, you go back and recapture the record, go do our cap again, I don't know, a different building, you have one week and assume you're sufficiently prepared for whatever the climb would be. What would what would

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我被允许做一些尖端、未来主义的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So I'm allowed to do like cutting edge futuristic things.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，好吧，那我就不知道了。我是说，**哈利法塔**会很疯狂。但是，嗯，不，嗯，**优胜美地**的**自由三联**，就是**优胜美地**的三大岩壁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, well then I'm like I don't know. I mean the **Burrish** like it'd be insane. But um but no uh like the the **free triple** in **Euseite** is like the three biggest walls in **Euseite**. Uh

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 自由三联。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: free triple

</details>

**主持人**: 所以是**酋长岩**、**半圆顶**和**沃特金斯山**。**沃特金斯山**是一座**半圆顶**大小的岩壁，位于山谷更深处。所以那是**优胜美地**的三大岩壁。所以**Tommy Caldwell**和我徒手攀登了**三联**。我们俩一起用绳索完成了它，但我们攀登了整个岩壁。然后我独自攀登了**三联**。所以我独自用绳索完成了所有三座岩壁。那大概是18或19个小时的攀登。嗯，但它从未被徒手攀登过。嗯，我曾单独徒手攀登过**半圆顶**，也单独徒手攀登过**酋长岩**。没有人徒手攀登过**沃特金斯山**。但如果能在一天内完成所有三座岩壁的徒手攀登，那将是，我想，完全是下一代成就。有一些这样的事情，我就会想，如果我重新开始，如果我是一个18岁的年轻人，现在想成为一名职业攀岩者，并且拥有比我现在更高的技能水平，而且，你知道，基本上是想再次做这件事。有一些这样的事情会是，就像明显的下一代挑战。徒手攀登，一天内完成所有三座岩壁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: the so it's **LCAP**, **Halfdme**, and **Mount Watkins**. **Mount Watkins** is kind of like a halfdome sized wall that's further up valley. So it was the three biggest walls in **Euseite**. So **Tommy Caldwell** and I have free climbed the triple. The two of us did it together with ropes, but we like climbed the whole thing. And then I've soloed the triple. So I've done all three with ropes by myself. It was like 18 or 19 hours or something of climbing. Um, but it's never been free sololed. Uh, I've freestolled **Haft** individually and I've free sololed **Alcap** individually. No one's ever free soloed **Watkins**. But the idea of doing all three in a day would be like I think totally like next generation achievement. There are certain things like that where I'm sort of like if I was starting over, if I was like an 18-year-old who was like trying to make it as a professional climber nowadays and had a higher level of skill than I do now and, you know, basically was like trying to do this again. There things like that that would be sort of like the obvious next generation challenge. free solo, all three in the same day.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。是的，我大概会花，嗯，可能不到24小时。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Yeah, I'd probably take uh well, it take a bit under 24 hours probably.

</details>

**主持人**: 你现在每天的训练计划是什么？是经常去攀岩吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What is your training regimen to these days? Is it go rock climbing a lot today?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我今天早上在酒店健身房做了点小锻炼。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: I did a little workout in the hotel gym this morning.

</details>

**主持人**: 你的手很特别。它们很大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Your hands are quite different. I was They're quite big hands.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我是说，你知道，我想就像一个石匠一辈子都在打磨一样。我看到你。我不知道人们在镜头前能不能看到，但你看起来确实有非常宽的手指。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Well, that's I mean, you know, I think like a stonemason just like grinding away their whole life. I see you. You have I don't know if people can see that on camera, but you it does look like you have very um wide fingers.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我的手指在过去承受了很多虐待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, my fingers uh have taken a lot of abuse in their time

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 因为我看到你把它们夹在岩壁之间。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: cuz I see you like putting them in in between walls.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，裂缝攀岩。你基本上把手指伸进裂缝里，然后扭动它们。所以侧向拉扯会使你的结缔组织变大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, crack climbing. It's like you basically put your fingers into a crack and then you torque them. And so like the side to side pulling uh does sort of make your connective tissue bigger.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 那会疼吗？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And does that hurt?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，会疼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, it hurts.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 我当时想，当你爬上去时，当你技术好时，它不会那么痛苦。嗯，这取决于岩石的类型，但有些岩石很锋利，有点痛苦。嗯，但是，是的，这又回到了强化你的，你大脑中那个部分叫什么？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: It I was wondering when you're going uphel when you're doing it well with good technique, it it's not that painful. Well, it depends on the type of rock, but some rock is kind of sharp and kind of painful. Um, but yeah, this is this goes back to strengthening your what's the part called in your brain?

</details>

**主持人**: **前扣带回皮层**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Anterior midsular cortex.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，没错。就是那个。我是说，关键是，即使做得好，攀岩也会伤到你的手指和脚趾，你知道，裂缝攀岩时，你把脚趾塞进裂缝里，然后侧向扭动它们，你把手指楔进去。我是说，当你做得好时，它会有一种愉快的安全感，因为你可以真正地锁进裂缝里，感觉很舒服，你感觉像在游泳，你就会觉得：“这太美了。” 但当你真正感受到时，你仍然在把你的骨头压进裂缝里，就像《**星球大战**》一样。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah, exactly. That guy. I mean, that's the thing is that even when done well, climbing like it hurts your fingers and toes, you know, crack climbing when you're like jamming your toes into a crack and you're torquing them side to side and you're like wedging your fingers in. I mean, when you're doing it well, it has a pleasant feel of safety to it cuz you can really like lock into cracks and it feels comfortable and you feel like you're swimming and you're like, "This is beautiful." But when you really come down to the sensations, you're still crushing your bones into a crack like a **Star Wars**.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我看到这种照片时…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When I look at this kind of photo

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你看起来就像用一只半手悬挂着。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: where you're It looks like you're hanging by one and a half hands.

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

**Alex Honnold**: 如果你的握力不够，你就会摔死。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: And you're going to fall to your death if you if your grip isn't

</details>

**主持人**: 足够。这让我觉得你一定拥有世界上最强的握力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: sufficient. It makes me think you must have the world's greatest grip strength.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 嗯，我肯定没有。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Uh I definitely don't.

</details>

**主持人**: 我是说，嗯，你握着你的握力器。你可以发现…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean, well, you have your your grip then. You can find out

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 在这张照片中，你下面是什么？嗯，实际上，我下面有一个倾斜的悬崖。嗯，所以我实际上只离地面30英尺，但如果你摔下来，你就会弹开，然后你会，你知道，基本上掉到看起来像山谷底部的地方。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: what's below you there in this photo. Well, actually, so there is like a sloping cliff thing below me. Uh, so I'm actually only like 30 ft off the ground, but if or 40 ft, but if you fell, you'd bounce off and you'd go, you know, basically to where it looks like down in the valley floor down there.

</details>

**主持人**: 吓人的照片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Terrifying photo.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 这很有趣，实际上。你见过**《徒手攀岩》**吗？

<summary>Alex Honnold**: It's funny, actually. Have you you you've seen **Free Solo**?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 你记得那个摄影师吗？他不敢看。嗯，那个在地面上拍长镜头的人，**Mikey**。他是我很好的朋友。我跟他一起做过很多事情。他也拍摄了**台北**的攀登。嗯，**Mikey**是这张照片的摄影助理。他拿着照片，他完成了整个拍摄，只是看着墙壁。他就是从不看任何发生的事情。**Jimmy Chin**在拍照，**Mikey**负责所有的索具和灯光之类的，**Mikey**完成了整个拍摄，只是看着自己的腋下，看着另一边。他当时想，我不是其中的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Do you remember the the camera guy that like can't look? Uh, the guy that's like shooting the long shot on the ground, **Mikey**. He's a really good friend of mine. I've done tons of things with him. He was he shot the **Taipei** clown as well. Um, **Mikey** was the photo assistant for this photo. He was like holding the photos and he did the whole shoot just like looking into the wall. Like he just never looked at any of the things happening. Like **Jimmy Chin** was taking the photo and **Mikey** was like did all the the rigging and the lights and everything and **Mikey** did the whole shoot just like looking into his armpit like looking the other way. He was like I am not part of this.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想看看他的脑部扫描。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I would like to see his brain scan.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 他很紧张，但我是说，他自己也是一个精英攀岩者，他很棒，但基本上看徒手攀岩是很有压力的，如果不是必须，没人想做。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: He was stressed but he I mean he's an elite climber himself and he's he's amazing but like basically watching free souling is stressful and nobody wants to do it if they don't have to.

</details>

### 最害怕的时刻与风险管理

**Alex Honnold**: 在你所有的职业生涯中，什么时候你最害怕？你什么时候觉得你可能做得太过火了？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: When is in all your career, when is the moment where you were most scared? Where you thought maybe you had pushed it too far?

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，实际上，我经历过几次这样的时刻，但大多数时候都是带着绳索的。关键是，当你徒手攀岩时，你通常会保持在一个健康的范围内，或者你会提前练习，你知道，基本上是因为你会死。你确保你能做到。但当你带着绳索时，你更愿意冒险进入未知领域，因为你就会想，我最终会得到一些保护的。我会继续寻找。我会继续寻找。所以，我曾有一次，我实际上在2017年参加了一次**南极洲**探险，进行了一些非常极端的攀登，但都是带着绳索的，但是，你知道，那是**南极洲**，天气非常冷，条件很有挑战性，岩石正在崩塌，一切都很可怕，你只是不断希望情况会好转，但它却不断恶化，最终你就会觉得，因为关键是，带着绳索没有任何意义，除非你得到良好的保护，这意味着你必须能够把装备放入岩石中，如果你找不到地方把装备放入岩石中，那么你就可以，你知道，绳索有200英尺。如果你在200英尺内没有得到良好的装备，那么你就会面临400英尺的坠落，然后绳索才会抓住你。嗯，那几乎肯定是致命的，你知道。我是说，如果你摔那么远，即使绳索会抓住你的尸体，你知道，但你仍然会在400英尺后撞到墙壁，你就会完蛋了。所以，无论如何，我最可怕的经历大部分都是那样的情况。这就是为什么我说攀岩，你会经常感到害怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, it's actually uh I've had several moments, but it's actually mostly with ropes on. That's the thing is that because when you're freestyling, you generally keep it within a healthy margin or you practice ahead of time, you know, basically because you're going to die. You make sure that you can do it. But when you have a rope on, you're way more willing to push into the unknown because you're kind of like, surely I'll get some protection eventually. I'll just keep looking. I'll keep looking. And so like I've had I was on an expedition to **Antarctica** actually um in 2017 and did a bunch of climbing that was very extreme but like with a rope but it was you know it's **Antarctica** it's really freaking cold conditions are challenging the rock is crumbling everything is scary and you just keep hoping that it's going to get better and it just keeps getting worse instead and eventually you're sort of like because the thing is having a rope on doesn't mean anything unless you get good protection which means you have to be able to put gear into the rock and if you can't find places to put gear into the rock then you can go you know the rope is 200 feet If you go 200 feet without getting good gear, then you're looking at taking a 400t fall before the rope catches you. Uh, which is almost certainly fatal, you know. I mean, if you fall that far, even though the rope will catch your corpse, you know, but you're still just going to hit the wall after 400 ft, like you're screwed. So, anyway, my scariest experiences have all been situations like that for the most part. This is why I'm saying climbing, you get scared a lot.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们的那次探险，我们基本上是隔天攀登。每天我们都会去攀登一个疯狂的尖塔，然后我们会有这些经历，我当时会非常害怕，然后第二天我们就会坐在帐篷里，因为那是**南极洲**。非常冷。你在炊事帐篷里，我基本上整天都在吃**Nutella**，完全震惊，完全受到创伤，然后第二天你就会休息够了，然后出去再做一次，我们就是这样隔天进行，充满了创伤和恐惧，持续了整个旅程，然后我们攀登了山脉中的所有东西。那太棒了。那是一次令人难以置信的旅行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And our like that expedition we were climbing basically day on, day off. Each day we would go climb one of these crazy spires and we'd have these experiences where I'd be like so scared and then the next day we would just sit in the tent because it's **Antarctica**. It's like really cold. You're in the cook tent and I would basically just spoon **Nutella** all day totally shell shocked like totally like just completely traumatized and then the and then you'd be like rested enough and you go out the next day and do it again and we just did like day on day off of like full trauma fear for the whole trip and then we climbed everything in the range. It was amazing. It was an incredible trip.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 所以你确实会害怕？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: So you do get scared?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我一直都非常害怕。有没有什么被证明对你处理这种恐惧有效的方法？比如人们谈论的呼吸法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, I was so scared the whole time. Are there any techniques that are proven to be effective for you to deal with that fear? Like people talk about breath work and

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的，深呼吸，努力让自己镇定下来。我是说，我努力保持理性，你知道，就像，我处于危险之中吗？因为有时，就像在**南极洲**的这个例子中，我确实处于危险之中。如果我摔下来，我可能会死。嗯，但很多时候你感到恐惧，但你实际上并没有处于危险之中。只是你的思绪在奔跑。所以有时你可以理性地调整一下，你就会说：“不，我是安全的。保护会抓住我。绳索，你知道，我的装备很好。” 然后你只是深呼吸，然后继续前进。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah, take some deep breaths, try to compose yourself. I mean, I try to stay rational, you know, like, am I in danger? Cuz sometimes, like in this case in **Antarctica**, I am actually in danger. Like, if I fall, I could die. Um, but often times you feel you get those feelings of fear and you're not actually in danger. You just it's your mind running away from you. And so sometimes you can sort of rationally re in a little bit where you're like, "No, I am safe. The protection will hold me. The rope is, you know, my gear is good." And then you just take a deep breath and you just carry on.

</details>

**主持人**: 你会想象自己摔倒吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And do you visualize falling ever?

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 哦，是的。我是说，当然。是的。我是说，你必须了解后果会是什么，因为我是说，那种可视化也是你如何知道自己是否安全的方式，因为如果你打开装备，你试图想象，如果我摔下来，我会撞到地面吗？还是装备会在我撞到地面之前抓住我？我是说，经常会有这样的情况，你就会想，如果我摔下来，我会撞到那个壁架，摔断双腿吗？还是我会越过壁架，掉入自由空间，那样就完全安全了。所以，能够清晰地可视化是有帮助的，你知道，因为大多数人会想象最坏的情况，比如如果我摔下来，我就会死。你就会说，嗯，很多时候，如果你，我指的是带着绳索，如果你摔下来，你会没事的。但了解其中的区别很重要。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Oh yeah. I mean of course. Yeah. I mean you have to understand what the consequences will be because I mean that type of visualization is also how you can know when you're safe because like if you ever open gear and you're trying to visualize like if I fall am I going to hit the ground or is the gear going to catch me before I hit the ground? I mean there often situations like that where you're like if I fall am I going to hit that ledge and break both my legs or am I going to clear the ledge and fall into free space in which case it's totally safe. And so it helps to be able to have a cleareyed visualization of, you know, because most people visualize the worst case, like if I fall, I'm going to die. And you're like, well, often times if you I'm talking about with the rope, if you fall, you're going to be fine. But it's important to know the difference.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以你不会回避与负面结果的对抗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So you don't avoid the confrontation with the negative outcomes.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 不，因为你试图避免负面结果，你必须考虑它，因为否则你如何减轻这类事情？

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: No, because you're trying to avoid the negative out like you have to think about it because how else do you mitigate that kind of stuff,

</details>

**主持人**: 但你不能让那阻止你在风险可控的情况下采取行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but you can't let that stop you taking actions when the risk profile is okay.

</details>

**Alex Honnold**: 是的。没错。我是说，这就像一个关于冒险和一切的完整长篇大论，但我是说，关键是你想承担你想要承担的风险。没人像我这样思考风险，这让我抓狂，因为想想所有那些每个周末出去派对，喝得有点醉醺醺然后开车回家的人。他们承担着各种他们并未真正选择承担的风险。你明白我的意思吗？就像他们只是选择出去派对，玩得开心，但他们却有点醉醺醺地开车，他们说：“不，没关系。” 但你就会说：“不，你显然在冒险。” 或者你把自己置于危险境地，因为你因为醉酒之类的而失去行动能力。所以，你知道，你把自己置于更高的犯罪风险之下，诸如此类。所以你正在冒险，你只是没有选择承担这些风险。我有点觉得，攀岩的关键在于我选择承担风险。而且我对所承担的风险非常清楚。我是说，我不会说它是完美的，但大部分情况下，我认为我对哪些方面是危险的，当后果严重时会发生什么，如果我真的摔下来会发生什么，都有一个很好的了解。你知道，你努力尽可能多地思考清楚。我有点觉得，在正常生活中，有多少人真正思考过他们正在承担的所有风险？即使是那些完全久坐不动的人，他们说：“嗯，我从不冒险。我待在家里玩电子游戏。” 你就会说：“不，你患心脏病的风险要高得多。你会被其他事情害死。” 你知道，它就像，而且你无论如何都会死。好吧，我抱怨完了。对不起。

<details>
<summary>Alex Honnold**: Yeah. Exactly. I mean, this is like a whole rant about risk-taking and everything, but like I mean, that's the thing is you want to be taking the risks that you want to take. And it drives me crazy that nobody else thinks about risk in this way because think of all the people that like go out partying every weekend and they get like kind of buzzed and they drive home and whatever. And it's like they're taking all kinds of risk that they're not actually choosing to take. You know what I mean? Like they're just choosing to go out and party and have a good time, but then they're like driving a little buzzed and they're like, "No, it's fine." But you're like, "No, obviously you're taking a risk." or like you're putting yourself into situations where you're like in a vulnerable situation
