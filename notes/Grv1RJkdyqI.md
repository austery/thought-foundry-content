### 对疫情预警的反思

Derek: 那么，做出这个预测，但世界基本上没有听取并做好准备，你感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: So how did it feel to make this prediction and then have the world essentially not listen and not prepare?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，对于这样的事情，说“我早就告诉过你了”并没有什么好感觉。如果在未来几十年内有任何东西导致超过一千万人死亡，那最有可能是一种高传染性病毒，而不是战争。你知道，我只是回想，我是否可以更有说服力？我们实际上在阻止流行病的系统上投资甚少。我们还没有为下一次流行病做好准备。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Bill Gates: Well there's no good feeling that comes on something like this saying i told you so If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. You know I just think back and could I have been more persuasive? We've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic.</p>
</details>

Derek: 你是如何做出如此有先见之明的预测的？你是怎么知道这会发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: How did you make such a prescient prediction? How did you know this was going to happen?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，有许多呼吸道病毒，时不时地会出现一种传染性很强并导致一定程度死亡的病毒。呼吸道疾病非常可怕，因为当你具有传染性时，你仍然会在飞机上、公交车上走动，这与**埃博拉**（Ebola: 一种高度致命的病毒性疾病）等其他疾病不同，在那些疾病中，当病毒载量感染他人时，你大多已经躺在病床上了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well there's a number of respiratory viruses and from time to time one will come along that's very transmissive and causes some level of fatalities. Respiratory diseases are very scary because you're still walking around on a plane, a bus when you're infectious unlike some other diseases like ebola where you're mostly in a hospital bed by the time the viral load infects other people.</p>
</details>

Derek: 嘿，最近我有机会采访了比尔·盖茨，当时他的基金会发布了年度信函。我会在描述中附上链接，我们谈论了很多事情，包括阴谋论和错误信息，但关于疫情，我想知道既然这么多人预见到它的到来，而且预防成本相对较小，那为什么没有做更多的事情呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: Hey, so recently i got the chance to interview Bill Gates when his foundation's annual letter came out I'll link to it in the description and we talked about lots of things including conspiracy theories and misinformation but about the pandemic i wanted to know if so many people could see this coming and the costs of prevention were relatively small then why wasn't more done about it?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，有些风险，比如地震，我们总是看到小地震。或者你知道战争、火灾或飓风的历史，所以你不会忘记。这些流行病出现的频率如此不规律，以至于我们被一种安全感所麻痹，觉得未来几年可能不会有问题，为什么要为此投入资金呢？你基本上没有购买保险。这次疫情将帮助我们认识到，这需要成为一个优先事项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well there's some risks like earthquakes where we see small earthquakes all the time. Or you know the history of war or fire or hurricanes so you don't forget. These pandemics only come along so irregularly that being lulled into a sense of security where it probably won't be a problem in the next few years, why should we put money into that? You don't buy the insurance policy, basically. This one will help us understand it needs to be a priority.</p>
</details>

### 下一个潜在的全球危机

Derek: 不过，我感觉人类可能有一个问题，就是总是在打上一场仗。所以，如果我们现在专注于流行病，但一百年内都没有发生，那下一个灾难是什么？我们没有准备好应对的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: I feel like humans have an issue though with fighting the last battle potentially, so if we focus on pandemics now and there isn't one say for another hundred years What is the next disaster? What is the one that we're not prepared for?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，我会指出两个：一个是气候变化。每年，气候变化造成的死亡人数甚至会超过我们这次疫情所经历的。此外，与流行病相关但人们不太喜欢谈论的是生物恐怖主义，即有人想要造成破坏，他们可以设计一种病毒，这意味着遇到这种情况的成本不仅仅是像当前疫情这样的自然流行病所带来的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well I'd point out two: One is climate change. Every year that would be a death toll even greater than we've had in this pandemic. Also, related to pandemics is something people don't like to talk about much which is bioterrorism, that somebody who wants to cause damage could engineer a virus and so that means the cost the chance of running into this is more than just the naturally cost epidemics like the current one.</p>
</details>

Derek: 我觉得流行病、气候变化或小行星撞击之间有一些相似之处，那就是它们不那么具体可感，但你可以做一点事情。我不知道，人类似乎不太擅长处理这类问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: It feels to me like there's something similar about pandemics and you know climate change or like asteroid impact, which is that you know they're not very tangible but you could do a little bit. I don't know it seems like humans are not very good at those sorts of problems.</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，我最喜欢的作家**瓦茨拉夫·斯米尔**（Vaclav Smil: 一位加拿大环境科学家和政策分析师）曾写过所有潜在的灾难，比如小行星的风险，或者像黄石公园那样的火山爆发的风险。事实上，他表明，除了人为的核战争之外，流行病是我们最需要做好准备的重大事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well my favorite writer, Vaclav Smil, you know wrote about all the potential kinds of disasters like you know the risk of an asteroid, the risk of a you know yellowstone-like eruption and in fact he showed that pandemics were significantly the biggest thing other than a human-caused nuclear war that we needed to be more prepared for</p>
</details>

### 提升未来疫情应对能力

Derek: 那么，我们应该采取哪些措施来更好地应对下一次疫情？**COVID-19**（2019冠状病毒病）有可能是最后一次全球大流行吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: So what changes do we put in place to be readier for the next one and is it possible that covid-19 could be the last global pandemic?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，肯定会有更多的流行病。人类与其他物种互动的方式，这些病毒正在跨越物种屏障，无论是来自蝙蝠还是猴子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well certainly there will be more pandemics. The ways that humans interact with other species, these viruses are coming across a species barrier whether it's from bats or monkeys or</p>
</details>

Derek: 但你认为我们不能将准备水平提高到，以至于它永远不会成为这种全球性问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: but you don't think we could increase our preparedness to such a level that it never sort of becomes this global issue?</p>
</details>

BG: 我们可以提高我们的准备水平，这样我们就永远不会有接近今天这样高的死亡人数。你知道，流行病在死亡人数方面可能会更糟。**天花**（Smallpox: 一种由天花病毒引起的传染病，曾导致数亿人死亡）的死亡率超过30%。所以，我们有点幸运，这次疫情的死亡率不是特别高，但我们可以将其扼杀在萌芽状态。它仍然会传播到很多国家，但如果有正确的系统，死亡人数应该只有我们现在看到的十分之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: We could increase our preparedness so we never have a death toll uh anywhere near what we have today. You know pandemics can be worse in terms of the fatalities. Smallpox was a over 30 per cent fatality. You know so a little bit we were lucky that the fatality here is not not super high but we can nip it in the bud it'll still get to a lot of countries but the number of deaths you know uh with the right system should be a tenth of what we we've seen here.</p>
</details>

Derek: 你想建立的系统，以便能够将其扼杀在萌芽状态，或者说，我们现在没有但未来应该具备的关键要素是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: And the systems that you want to put in place so this sort of so you can nip it in the bud or so what are the key elements that we didn't have that we should have going forward?</p>
</details>

BG: 我会将其分为两个部分：实地活动和研发活动。在研发方面，我们需要使**mRNA**（信使核糖核酸: 一种基因信息载体，在疫苗开发中用于指导细胞产生抗原）技术更加成熟，以便我们可以更快地生产，并在世界各地建立工厂，使其便宜且热稳定。在治疗方面，包括抗体在内，还有很多可以投入的地方。在诊断方面，要有每天进行一千万次**PCR检测**（聚合酶链式反应检测: 一种用于检测病毒基因片段的分子诊断方法）的能力。然后在实地方面，我们需要世界各地大量的诊断机器。我们需要一支流行病学家团队。所以，研发和实地团队之间的投资大致相等，并且信息应该持续流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: I would divide it into two sections: There's the field based activity and the R&D activity. In R&D we need to mature mRNA so we can make it even faster and have factories all over the world, have it be cheap and thermal stable. There's a lot that can go into therapeutics including antibodies. On diagnostics having the ability to give 10 million PCR tests a day. Then in terms of the field we need a lot of diagnostic machines all over the world. We need a team of epidemiologists. So the investments are about equal between R&D and the the field-based group and information that should beconstantly flowing.</p>
</details>

### 信息时代下的真相与误解

Derek: 我觉得有一个元问题凌驾于所有这些问题之上，那就是人们如何与现实联系，如何分辨什么是真的，什么不是，以及应该相信什么信息。我不得不说，在我成长和进入这个信息时代时，互联网和所有这些工具似乎会让正确的信息更容易获取，并把我们带入一个更基于事实的世界。然而，现在看来它并没有把我们带到那里。我想知道你是否也曾对互联网能为我们所有人做什么抱有类似的愿景，你对它的现状有什么看法？我们如何应对这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: You know I feel like there's a meta-issue that is kind of above all of these issues which is you know the way that people connect with reality and figure out what's true and what's not and you know what information to believe. I've got to say that you know as i was growing up and coming into this information age it seemed like the Internet and all these tools were going to make the correct information so much more easy to access and bring us into a more fact-based world. Instead it doesn't look as though it's bringing us there. I wonder if you shared a similar vision for you know what the Internet might do for all of us and i don't know if you have any thoughts about the current state of it you know how do we deal with this?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，互联网做了一些很棒的事情，那就是如果你想学习，你知道，那些看你视频的人有机会了解科学和正在发生的事情，这在以前是没有的。所以对于很多人来说，他们现在了解得更多。我的朋友们会问我关于这些变种的问题，他们对最新信息的了解程度让我感到震惊。所以对于那些想学习事实的人来说，这是一个黄金时代。你知道，我们关注的是一些阴谋论和反事实的负面部分，因为社交媒体是如此新颖，所以要弄清楚如何遏制这些，比如给那些耸人听闻但虚假的东西贴上标签，限制其传播速度。我们缺少一些好主意来避免这种可怕的现象，在反疫苗方面，这可能会减缓我们让很多人接种疫苗的速度，从而延长疫情，并使我们付出数万生命的代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well the internet has done something fantastic which is if you want to learn you know the people who watch you are you know getting an opportunity to understand science and what's going on and that just wasn't there uh and so for a lot of people they're so much more informed. I mean I have friends who ask me about these variants where I'm just stunned at how up to date they are with the latest information so for people who want to learn facts this is a golden age. You know we focus on the negative part with some of these conspiracy theories and anti-factual things and so because social media is so new figuring out how you curb that, you know labeling it restrict the speed of spread of things that are titillating but false. We are missing some good ideas to you know not have this kind of scary phenomena that in the case of anti-vaccine things may slow down how quickly we get lots of people uh to take the vaccine and therefore extend the epidemic and and cost us in in tens of thousands of lives.</p>
</details>

### 言论自由与信息过滤的平衡

Derek: 感觉你正在与美国言论自由的伟大原则对抗，对吗？我认为你提出的观点非常棒，即过去的问题是信息稀缺，难以获取这类信息，而现在的问题是信息过载，需要分辨哪些是好的，哪些不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: It feels like you're running up against you know kind of that great American principle of free speech, right? I think it's a great point that you bring up that you know in the past the problem was kind of scarcity getting access to this sort of information and now it's sort of a problem of too much and figuring out which is the good stuff and which is not.</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，当然有一些明确的事情，比如对疫苗说完全虚假的话，但中间存在一个灰色地带，弄清楚规则是什么，以及谁应该负责审查和解释这些规则。哇，我们今天缺少这一点。你知道，你能否召集一群专家来权衡这些事情，你真的不希望有利润动机的参与。但你需要专业知识和能力，所以，几年后我希望我们能更成熟地确定这条界限应该如何划定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well there are certainly clear things like you know saying completely false things about you know vaccines but there is kind of a gray area in the middle that figuring out what the rules are and who should be the one looking and interpreting those rules Wow, we are missing that today. You know can you get a group of experts that are weighing in on these things you don't really want the profit motive involved But you want you know expertise and capacity and so you know a few years from now i hope we're more sophisticated on what or how that line should be drawn</p>
</details>

Derek: 你知道，不久前我在我的第二个频道上制作了一个名为《**被憎恨**》（Be Hated: 视频标题）的视频，内容是关于我如何反击错误信息，认为我们应该看到世界上任何错误的事情，并尽力去对抗它，所以你不应该被所有人喜欢，因为有些人持有错误的观念，你应该反击他们。这基本上是我的想法，但从那时起，我感觉我的观点有所软化，现在我把我们反击错误信息的方式看作有点像免疫系统。显然，如果你的免疫系统很弱，对任何事情都没有反应，那是个问题，但如果你的免疫系统太强，那也是个问题。你知道，在1918年流感大流行期间，死亡分布非常有趣，年轻人和老年人显然更容易死亡，因为他们的免疫系统较弱，但25到35岁左右的人也更容易死亡，因为他们的免疫系统过于强大，过度活跃，最终导致了死亡。所以我觉得在反击错误信息的程度上有一个最佳点。你知道，你永远不会看到我制作关于“地平说者”的视频，因为我看不出有什么意义。制作那样的视频只会巩固他们的世界观，而且真的没有什么思想可以改变，所以这就是我最近如何概念化错误信息的方式，有点像我们必须是一个有针对性的免疫系统。所以我想在这个想法上进一步追问比尔，我提到了我在推特上看到的一条推文，大意是说**牛津大学**（Oxford University: 英国著名学府）的疫苗开发团队本来打算开源他们的疫苗，直到比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会介入并表示不，你们必须与大型制药公司**阿斯利康**（AstraZeneca: 一家英瑞合资的跨国制药和生物制药公司）独家合作。显然，这在推特上的人看来，似乎有什么阴险的事情正在发生，但我想知道比尔，真实的故事是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: you know a while back on my second channel I made a video called Be Hated, which was kind of about my thoughts about pushing back against misinformation, that we should see anything that is wrong in the world and we should do our best to fight it so you should not be liked by everyone because there are some people out there with bad ideas and you should be pushing back against them. That was essentially my thought but since then I feel like my views have softened a little and now I think of our pushing back against misinformation a little bit like an immune system. Obviously it's a problem if your immune system is weak if it doesn't respond to anything but it's also a problem if your immune system is too strong. You know during the 1918 flu pandemic there's a really interesting distribution of deaths where the young and old were more likely to die obviously because they have weak immune systems but also people in the sort of 25 to 35 year-old range because their immune systems were just so strong they were overactive and that ended up resulting in mortality so I feel like there's a sweet spot in terms of how much we push back against misinformation. You know you'll never see me make a video about flat earthers because i just don't see the point. You know making that video only kind of reconfirms their world view and there's not really any minds to move there so that's kind of how I'm conceptualizing misinformation these days, a bit like we have to be a targeted immune system. So i wanted to push Bill a bit further on this idea and I brought up a tweet that I had seen doing the rounds on twitter that basically said that the Oxford vaccine development, they were going to open source that vaccine until the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation got involved and said no you must partner exclusively with a big pharma company AstraZeneca and so obviously it seems to the people on twitter that something nefarious was going on there, but I wanted to know from Bill what was the real story</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，制造一种安全的疫苗比制造一架喷气式发动机更复杂，人们对疫苗非常挑剔，事实上，如果你在工厂生产疫苗时，每个阶段的质量控制都不精细，你可能会毁掉疫苗的声誉。你知道，任何错误都可能导致工厂停工数月，而那时它的产量正需要拯救数百万人的生命。所以疫苗工厂不是你可以像开源代码那样随意拿来捣鼓的东西。因此，疫苗生产数量的限制是基于世界上有多少优秀且有能力的疫苗制造商，我们已经确保**阿斯利康**的疫苗在这些大型印度工厂生产，而且没有版税，完全免费。现在，我们盖茨基金会不得不为此提供资金。这些公司我们已经与它们合作了十多年，以确保它们的工厂质量，这样就有备用产能来生产廉价疫苗。所以牛津大学很棒，但他们没有能力进行三期临床试验，他们也没有工厂。我们确实告诉牛津大学，他们需要寻找有专业知识的人，然后阿斯利康介入了，我们没有控制那份协议，但他们介入并表示他们想以非营利方式进行。我对他们投入最优秀的人才并提供帮助印象深刻。你知道，那些没有参与的制药公司，没有人批评他们。所以，你为那些真正奇迹般地帮助生产这些疫苗的公司感到遗憾。这些是我怀疑存在的非常好的理由，但我觉得社交媒体无法理解这种细微之处，看到世界变成这样让我很痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well the making a safe vaccine is more complicated than say making a jet engine and people are very picky about vaccines in fact you could ruin the reputation of vaccines if you're making them in factories where the quality control at every stage is not exquisite. and you know any mistake you know you can have that factory shut down literally for months at a time when its output is needed to save millions of lives. So vaccine factories are not something that you just you know you know like open source code that you can take and you know mess around with and so the the limitations on how many vaccines are being made, that's based on how many great capable vaccine manufacturers there are in the world and we've made sure that the AstraZeneca's being made in these big indian factories and there's no royalty for that, no charge at all. Now we've had to fund that, the Gates Foundation. These are companies we've been working on their factory quality for over a decade so that there was spare capacity to make inexpensive vaccines so Oxford University is is wonderful, but they're not capable of doing a phase three trial and they they don't have factories We did tell Oxford that they needed to seek somebody with expertise and AstraZeneca came in and we didn't control that agreement but they came in and said hey they want to do it on a non-profit basis and I'm impressed with how they put their best people on it and helped out. You know the pharma companies who didn't get involved nobody's criticizing them. So you know you feel sorry for the ones that are really miraculously helping make these vaccines. These are the very good reasons that I suspect exist but that that's where I feel like social media just doesn't get the nuance and you know it pains me to see the world like that.</p>
</details>

Derek: 甚至看到你，比尔，成为一些阴谋论的目标，这似乎没有困扰你，但你知道，作为一个希望每个人都生活在同一种现实中的人，这有点困扰我。我看到你在那里做着伟大的事情，我认为这应该受到赞扬，而不是你所得到的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Derek: And you know even to see you, Bill, you know be the target of some of these conspiracy theories It seems to not bother you but you know it kind of bothers me as a guy who wants you know everyone to live in the same kind of reality and you know I see you out there doing great things and I think that you know that should be commended as opposed to what you get.</p>
</details>

BG: 我没有资格抱怨太多，你知道，我有很多事情让我非常幸运，我希望这些阴谋论能消失，我不知道这对未来意味着什么。

<p class="english-text">I'm not in a position to complain much you know I have a lot of things that you know make me extremely lucky and you know I hope these conspiracy theories go away and I don't know what what it'll mean for the future.</p>

### 疫苗接种进展与全球挑战

Derek: 到目前为止，你对疫苗推广感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek: How do you feel about the vaccine roll-out so far?</p>
</details>

BG: 嗯，我们知道我们需要供应，我们需要物流，我们需要需求，而这些方面都存在巨大的挑战。我希望**强生公司**（Johnson & Johnson: 一家美国跨国医疗器械、制药和消费品公司）能在下个月获得批准，因为那是一种单剂量疫苗，非常便宜且可大规模生产。**阿斯利康**、强生，以及几个月后的**诺瓦瓦克斯**（Novovax: 一家美国疫苗开发公司）。对于大多数发展中国家来说，这些疫苗将是提供给他们的疫苗，所以我们投入了数十亿美元来努力实现这一点，希望在几个月内能有所进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BG: Well we you know we need the supply, we need the logistics and we need the demand and there are huge challenges in each of those. I'm hopeful that Johnson and Johnson in the next month will get approved because that's a single dose vaccine, very cheap highly scalable so AstraZenica, Johnson and Johnson and a few months later Novovax. Most of the developing world, those are the vaccines that will be going to them and so we put billions into trying to make that happen and you know in a few months hopefully it'll come together.</p>
