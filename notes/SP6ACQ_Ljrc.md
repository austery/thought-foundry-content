### ICE 培训问题

**主持人**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，2月24日，星期二。我们正在报道以下内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, February 24th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**主持人**: 在过去的 5 个月里，我看着 ICE（美国移民与海关执法局）拆解其培训项目，从 58 个必修课中削减了 240 小时的重要课程。一位前 ICE 官员已站出来成为举报人，声称新特工的培训协议存在缺陷且不足。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: For the last 5 months, I watched ICE dismantle the training program, cutting 240 hours of vital classes from 58. A former ICE official has come forward as a whistleblower, alleging that the training protocol for new agents is broken and deficient.

</details>

**主持人**: “执法是一项极其严肃的业务。这不是可以走捷径的地方。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Law enforcement is a deadly serious business. It is not a place for shortcuts.

</details>

**主持人**: Ryan Schwank 于 2021 年被 ICE 聘用，并于去年开始在一所联邦执法培训学院教授法律课程。他昨天在华盛顿特区的一个由国会民主党人组织的论坛上分享了他的经历。他表示：“没有改革，ICE 将会培养出数千名新警官，他们不知道自己权力的界限，也没有接受过识别非法命令的培训。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Ryan Schwank was hired by ICE in 2021 and started teaching legal courses at a federal law enforcement training academy last year. He shared his account yesterday in DC at a forum organized by congressional Democrats. Without reform, ICE will graduate thousands of new officers who do not know the limits of their authority and who do not have the training to recognize an unlawful order.

</details>

**主持人**: 昨天，参议院民主党人还公布了数十页的 ICE 内部记录，这些记录表明，特朗普政府在增加人员配置的同时，缩减了基础培训。在特朗普执政期间，ICE 进行了大规模的招聘，引进了超过 12,000 名新警官和特工，数量是之前的一倍多。这种激增威胁要压垮培训大多数联邦特工的中心。作为回应，ICE 官员缩减了培训计划。例如，参议员们公布的文件包括两份不同的教学大纲，一份来自 7 月，一份来自本月，显示培训时间减少了 40%。其他文件表明，像“使用武力模拟训练”这样的课程不再是必修课，此外还有一些关于移民法和 ICE 法律权威的课程也被取消了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Yesterday, Senate Democrats also released dozens of pages of internal ICE records that suggest the Trump administration has curtailed the basic training right as it's been staffing up. Under Trump, ICE has been on a massive hiring spree, bringing in over 12,000 new officers and agents, more than double what it had before. That surge has threatened to overwhelm the centers which train most federal agents. In response, ICE officials scaled back the regimen. For example, the documents senators released include two different syllabi, one from July and one from this month, which show a 40% decrease in training hours. Other documents suggest that courses like use of force simulation training are no longer required along with some on immigration law and ICE legal authorities.

</details>

**主持人**: 综合来看，这些新披露的信息加剧了人们对国土安全部（Department of Homeland Security）特工行为和准备情况的担忧，这些特工在过去一年中至少射杀并打死了三名美国公民。在本月早些时候国会质询其是否降低了标准时，该机构的代理主管表示：“培训的核心内容从未被移除。”而国土安全部则表示，他们精简了培训，但“没有牺牲基本主题内容”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Taken together, the new disclosures underscore concerns about the conduct and preparedness of agents from the Department of Homeland Security who have shot and killed at least three US citizens in the last year. When pressed by Congress earlier this month about whether ICE had lowered its standards, the acting director of the agency said, quote, "The meat of the training was never removed." And the DHS says it's streamlined training without quote sacrificing basic subject matter content.

### 墨西哥卡特尔头目被击毙

**主持人**: 在墨西哥，当局正在分享关于如何追踪到该国头号通缉犯、被称为 Eleno 的卡特尔头目（他于周日被安全部队击毙）的新细节。墨西哥国防部长表示，当局通过追踪 Eleno 的一位情妇，找到了这位已逃亡多年的犯罪头目。上周晚些时候，她前往哈利斯科州（Halisco State）山区的一间小屋与他会面。她离开后，当局突袭了小屋。Eleno 逃入树林，墨西哥军队与他的安保团队爆发枪战。特种部队随后追踪到他。他受了重伤，在被送往医疗设施途中死亡。国防部长说，墨西哥情报官员领导了搜捕行动，但美国当局提供的信息帮助锁定了卡特尔头目的位置。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: In Mexico, authorities are sharing new details about how they tracked down the country's most wanted cartel leader known as Eleno, who was killed by security forces on Sunday. Mexico's defense minister said authorities found the criminal kingpin, who'd been on the run for years, by tracking one of his romantic partners. Late last week, she traveled to meet him at a cabin in the mountains of the Halisco State. After she left, authorities raided the cabin. Elmeno fled into the woods as a gun battle broke out between Mexican troops and his security team. Special forces then tracked him down. He was severely injured and later died while being transported to a medical facility. The defense minister said Mexican intelligence officers led the search, but that information from American authorities helped pinpoint the cartel leader's location.

</details>

**主持人**: 与此同时，Eleno 死后席卷全国的混乱局面现已基本平息。卡特尔成员曾封锁公路，纵火焚烧建筑和汽车以示武力。当局称，至少有 62 人死亡。其中大部分是涉嫌的卡特尔成员或墨西哥军方人员。这场暴力事件动摇了许多城市，包括一些对墨西哥旅游业至关重要的城市，而旅游业是该国重要的经济驱动力。昨天，几家主要的美国航空公司取消了飞往波多黎各维亚塔（Porto Viarta）和瓜达拉哈拉（Guadalajara）的航班，而计划在未来几天停靠在墨西哥太平洋沿岸的三艘邮轮的运营商也取消了行程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Meanwhile, the mayhem that broke out across the country after Eleno's death has now largely subsided. Cartel operatives had blocked highways and set fire to buildings and cars in a show of force. Authorities say at least 62 people were killed. A majority of them were suspected cartel members or members of the Mexican military. The violence rattled many cities, including some that are central to Mexico's tourism industry, which is a vital economic driver for the country. Several major US airlines canled flights to Porto Viarta and Guadalajara yesterday, and the operators of three cruise ships that were set to dock on Mexico's Pacific coast in the coming days have their visits.

### OpenAI 面临质询

**主持人**: 今天在加拿大，运营 Chat GPT 的公司 OpenAI 将面临关于 18 岁的枪击案凶手如何使用其平台的质询。该国人工智能部长表示，他对有关该公司在袭击前可能知道什么的报道“深感不安”。本月早些时候，这名枪手在家中杀害了两名家人，随后在一所附近的学校杀害了五名儿童、一名教育工作者以及她自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: In Canada today, Open AAI, the company that runs Chat GPT, will face questions about how the 18-year-old behind a recent mass shooting used its platform. The country's Minister of Artificial Intelligence has said he is quote deeply disturbed by reports about what the company may have known before the attack. Earlier this month, the shooter killed two family members at home before killing five children, one educator, and herself at a nearby school.

</details>

**主持人**: 《纽约时报》对她社交媒体账户的回顾发现，她多年来一直与心理健康问题作斗争，并日益迷恋武器和极端暴力。去年 6 月，她发送给 Chat GPT 的信息引起了 OpenAI 内部的警觉，她因此被禁止使用该平台。据该公司称，他们曾考虑就她的账户通知执法部门，但最终决定不这样做，因为他们认为她没有可信的袭击计划。《华尔街日报》报道称，这一决定当时让公司的一些员工感到不满。事发地不列颠哥伦比亚省（British Columbia）的最高政府官员表示，OpenAI 未能分享他所说的“相关情报”，这一点“非常令人不安”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: A Times review of her social media accounts found she had a yearslong struggle with mental health issues and a growing fascination with weapons and extreme violence. Last June, messages she sent to ChatGpt raised flags internally at OpenAI and she was banned from the platform. According to the company, it had considered informing law enforcement about her account, but ultimately decided not to since it determined she had no credible plan for an attack. The Wall Street Journal has reported that decision upset some of the company's employees at the time. The top government official of British Columbia, where the attack took place, said it was very troubling that OpenAI didn't share what he called quote related intelligence.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，加拿大官员将要求就 OpenAI 的安全协议及其何时与警方共享信息的阈值作出解释。OpenAI 则表示，他们在袭击后确实联系了加拿大当局，并且他们努力在公共安全与保护个人用户隐私之间取得平衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Now, Canadian officials will be asking for explanations about OpenAI's safety protocols and its threshold for when information is shared with the police. For its part, OpenAI says it did contact Canadian authorities after the attack and that it tries to balance public safety with protecting the privacy of individual users.

### 伊朗监控与抗议

**主持人**: 在伊朗，过去几天，主要是学生的反政府抗议者走上街头，这是自今年早些时候严厉镇压抗议活动以来该国首次出现大规模示威。该政权正高度戒备，防范美国可能对其核计划发动的袭击，但同时也在努力压制威胁要从内部破坏政府稳定的广泛不满情绪。据多个权利组织称，1 月份，安全部队杀害了数千名抗议者，此后，他们逮捕了约 40,000 人。我的同事们一直在报道伊朗今年早些时候用于针对示威者的“高科技监控工具”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: In Iran, over the past few days, anti-government protesters, mainly students, have taken to the streets for some of the first demonstrations in the country since a brutal crackdown on protests earlier this year. The regime is on high alert for a possible attack from the US over its nuclear program, but it's also trying to suppress the widespread discontent that's threatened to destabilize the government from within. In January, security forces killed thousands of protesters. And since then, they've arrested around 40,000 people, according to several rights groups. My colleagues have been reporting on the high techch surveillance tools that Iran used earlier this year to target demonstrators.

</details>

**主持人**: “其中最让我震惊的一件事是，许多伊朗人参加了抗议活动，之后他们收到了一条威胁性的短信，警告他们说，他们‘被注意到’参加了非法集会，并且现在他们正处于情报监控之下。”《纽约时报》科技记者 Adam Sataraniano 一直在关注伊朗如何利用人们的定位数据来创建一个“数字罗网”。我们听到了其他例子，说明人们的手机或社交媒体行为如何被用来对付他们。因此，那些在社交媒体上发布有关抗议活动或其他政治敏感话题的人，发现他们的 SIM 卡（即他们访问移动网络的能力）被关闭了，移动银行服务也被中断了。我们还听说有人被拘留和审问，并被出示面部识别或定位追踪的证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: One of the things that jumped out to me the most is many of these Iranians were out at the protests and then later they received a text message that was essentially threatening and warning them saying that their presence at illegal gatherings quote unquote had been noted and that now they were under intelligence monitoring. Adam Sataraniano, a Times tech reporter, has been looking at how Iran has essentially used people's location data to create a digital drag net. We heard other examples of this of how people's phones or social media behavior were were used against them. So people who had posted on social media about the protests or other politically sensitive topics, they found that their SIM cards, so their access to mobile networks had been turned off, access to mobile banking had been interrupted. We also heard about people who were detained and interrogated and shown evidence of facial recognition or location tracking.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以这只是伊朗政府拥有的监控技术菜单中的一个例子。这是他们多年来一直在构建的东西。伊朗拥有世界上一些最广泛的监控技术，并且他们表现出愿意以非常引人注目的方式部署它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: And so it's just an example of this menu of surveillance technology that the Iranian government has. And this is something they've been building up for years and years. Iran has some of the most expansive surveillance technology available in the world. And and they've shown a willingness to deploy it in ways that is really notable.

### Bad Bunny 推动萨尔萨舞热潮

**主持人**: 最后，本月早些时候 Bad Bunny 在超级碗（Super Bowl）上的表演让人们渴望学习如何跳萨尔萨舞。他的热门歌曲“Titi Me Preguntó”（意为“你问我”）是他表演的 medley 的一部分。他曾邀请 Lady Gaga 一同跳舞。自去年歌曲发布以来，它一直在推动人们去参加舞蹈课程。皇后区的一位萨尔萨舞老师告诉《泰晤士报》，他的课程人数翻了一番。而自超级碗中场秀以来，老师们说又涌现了一批新面孔。当然，萨尔萨舞有着悠久而丰富的全球历史。很多人会在婚礼或家庭聚会上非正式地学习。其他人则去工作室学习。但 Bad Bunny，这位全球流媒体播放量最高的艺术家，推广它无疑有帮助，尤其是在年轻人中。人们还说，他不是一个专业的舞者也有帮助。不是说他跳得不好，只是说他跳舞就像普通人一样，这在某种程度上给了每个人加入的“许可”，无论他们的协调能力如何。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: And finally, Bad Bunny's performance at the Super Bowl earlier this month has people wanting to learn how to salsa. His hit song Titi Me Preguntó or unforgettable dance was part of the medley he put on on the field. He led Lady Gaga to the dance floor for it. Ever since the song came out last year, it's been driving people to dance lessons. One salsa teacher in Queens told the times his classes doubled in size. And since the halftime show, teachers say there's been another wave of new faces. Salsa, of course, has a big rich global history. A lot of people pick it up informally at weddings or family events. Others go to studios to learn. But Bad Bunny, the most streamed artist in the world, promoting it definitely helps, especially among young people. What also helps, people say, is that he's not a professional expert dancer. Not to say he's not good, just that he dances like an everyday person, which kind of gives everyone else permission to join in, whatever their level of coordination.
