### 介绍与背景

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我是 Kyra Blackwell。我是 Rosie Garin。你正在收听的是 Wire Cutter 节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I'm Kyra Blackwell. I'm Rosie Garin. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Kyra，你还好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Kyra, are you okay?

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: No.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是不是因为你住在地下室，而且现在是二月？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah. Is it by any chance because you live in a basement and it it is February?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哦，你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Oh, what do you think?

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我觉得这可能有关。是的。是的。是的。我一直都在说这件事，但我确实住在地下室，而且我从来见不到阳光。尤其是在冬天，当它全面来临时，会特别难熬，因为我感觉自己一直身处黑暗之中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I think that might have something to do with big factor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I talk about this all the time, but I do live in a basement and I don't get any light like ever. And it's especially hard in winter when it's in full swing because it just it just feels like I'm in darkness all the time.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是啊。而且白天也更短了。嗯，你有没有考虑过买那种他们广告里说的，冬天应该用的那种大灯，让你不那么沮丧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. And the days are shorter, too. Um, have you ever considered getting one of those big lights that they advertise that you should use in winter so that you are less sad?

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的。嗯，它的技术名称其实是**光疗灯**（light therapy lamp），但因为它们通常在冬季使用，以应对**季节性情感障碍**（seasonal effective disorder）的发生，所以它们经常被称为 SAD 或 SAD 灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah. Um, the technical name is actually a light therapy lamp, but since they're pegged for use during winter when seasonal effective disorder hits, they're often referred to with their acronym SAD or SAD lamps.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 所以，它们字面意思就叫“悲伤”灯？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So, they're literally called sad.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 它们字面意思就叫 SAD 灯，是给世界上那些“sad”的人用的。但是的，我考虑过。嗯，我读了很多关于它的资料，但我不知道。我很难决定是否要投入其中，有几个原因。我不确定它们效果如何，而且它们有点贵。我是说，我认为我们最好的选择大约是 200 美元，买一个非常亮但很丑的灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: They're literally called sad lamps for the saddies of the world. But yeah, I've thought about it. Um, I've read about it a lot, but I don't know. It's been kind of hard for me to decide if I should dive right into it for a couple of reasons. I wasn't sure how well they might work and they're a little bit expensive. I mean, I think our top pick is about $200 for this really bright, ugly lamp.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 所以，你想在投入之前，对它们的工作原理、效果以及预期有所了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So, you want to have some sense of if they work, how they work, what to expect before you jump in.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。嗯，那我们得找个朋友帮忙了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. Well, we got to phone a friend then.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我们要和 Nancy Red 聊聊。我们爱 Nancy。爱她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: We're going to chat with Nancy Red. We love Nancy. Love.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我们爱 Nancy。上次我们和 Nancy 聊的是牙刷和防晒霜，她知识渊博。她在 Wire Cutter 负责健康和个人护理报道。她在这里待了很久。Nancy 是权威。我迫不及待想和她聊聊。所以，我们先休息一下，回来后，我们会聊聊这些 SAD 灯到底有什么作用，是否有效，如何工作，以及 Nancy 会推荐哪一款。马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: We love Nancy. We last talked to Nancy about toothbrushes and sunscreen and she's incredibly knowledgeable. She covers health and personal care here at Wire Cutter. She's been here a long time. Nancy is the source. I can't wait to talk to her. So, we're going to take a quick break and then when we're back, we're going to talk about what exactly these sad lamps do, if they work, how they work, and which one Nancy would recommend. Be right back.

### SAD灯的工作原理

**Kyra Blackwell**: 欢迎回来。我们的嘉宾是 Nancy Red。她是 Wire Cutter 的一名资深撰稿人。欢迎你，Nancy。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Welcome back. Our guest is Nancy Red. She's a senior staff writer here at Wire Cutter. Welcome, Nancy.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 嗨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Hi.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 嗨。今天我们聊的是光疗灯，也叫 SAD 或 SAD 灯。那么，你能解释一下什么是季节性情感障碍，以及阳光在其中扮演什么角色吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Hi. Today we're talking about light therapy lamps, also known as SAD or SAD lamps. So, can you break down what seasonal effective disorder is and how sunlight plays into it?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 好的。季节性情感障碍，也称为 SAD，是一种有季节性模式的重度抑郁发作。所以，正式诊断应由医生进行，它实际上被归类为“有季节模式的抑郁障碍”，但这个缩写不如 SAD 那么吸引人。所以，我们基本上就称之为季节性情感障碍。很多人在季节变化时，尤其是在冬天，会有情绪或精力上的变化。对一些人来说，这很轻微。你知道，我们总是听说“冬季低落”或“冬季忧郁”。但对另一些人来说，即使他们没有意识到这种模式，它实际上可能表现出足以扰乱日常生活的症状。它会让你感到身体疲惫，因为黑暗的月份根本无法提供你所需的能量和褪黑素。SAD 可能会让人感到无休无止。人类在没有阳光的情况下很难舒适地生存。而这正是光疗的作用所在。研究实际上是在几十年前开始的。20 世纪 80 年代是季节性情感障碍研究的重要时期。通过反复试验，他们发现足够明亮的人工光，那种我们现在所处的荧光灯，就是那种房间里的顶灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Okay. So, seasonal effective disorder, also known by the acronym SAD, is a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes. So, officially it should be diagnosed by a physician and it's actually classified as depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, but that acronym isn't as fabulous as SAD. So, we basically just refer to it as seasonal effective disorder. And a lot of people have mood shifts or energy shifts when the seasons change, in particular in the winter. For some people, it's mild. You know, we've always heard of the winter blas or the winter blues. But for others, even if they don't recognize the pattern, it actually can present symptoms that are serious enough to disrupt daily life. And it can make you feel physically exhausted because darker months just do not provide the energy, the melatonin um that you need. And SAD can feel relentless. It's it's just really difficult for humans to exist in comfort without sunlight. And that's actually where light therapy comes in. Research actually started into this decades ago. The 1980s was a big time for seasonal effective disorder research. And through trial and error, they figured out that sufficiently bright artificial light, the kind that, you know, we're kind of stuck in the fluorescent light, it's just this, you know, rooms of overhead lighting.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 正是如此。它实际上会抑制夜间的褪黑素分泌。而褪黑素是我们睡眠周期的一种调节激素。自从他们弄清楚这一点后，他们就一直在试图弄清楚，如果足够明亮的人工光会抑制夜间褪黑素，我们是否能找到一种不同类型的光来帮助调节我们的睡眠周期，并在冬季创造更健康的**昼夜节律**（circadian rhythm）？所以，对于那些不知道的人来说，你的昼夜节律基本上是你身体的内部时钟。它遵循一个 24 小时的周期，主要受光线或缺乏光线的影响。它影响从你的体温到你的荷尔蒙再到你的睡眠-觉醒周期的一切。所以，这些灯的设计就是为了人为地让你的昼夜节律回到你想要的状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Exactly. Um, actually suppresses nighttime melatonin. And melatonin is the hormone that regulates our sleep cycle. And ever since they figured that out, they were trying to figure out, so if sufficiently bright artificial light suppresses nighttime melatonin, can we figure out a different kind of light that can help to regulate our sleep cycle and create a healthier circadian rhythm during the winter? So, for those who don't know, your circadian rhythm is basically your body's internal clock. It works on a 24-hour cycle that's mostly affected by light or lack thereof. And it affects everything from your body temperature to your hormones to your sleepwake cycle. So, these lamps are designed to sort of artificially get your circadian rhythm back in line with where you want it to be.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 对。所以，自 20 世纪 80 年代以来的研究表明，昼夜节律可以通过早晨暴露于明亮的光线来重新调整。当白天更长时，我们自然的睡眠-觉醒周期是怎样的，对吧？嗯，所以基本上，日照减少会扰乱你的内部时钟，而明亮的光疗有助于重置它。它与普通灯泡非常不同，因为他们过去做研究时曾认为，“哦，它没用。”但他们意识到他们只是没有使用足够亮的光。所以他们设定了光疗有效工作的最低标准，那就是 **10,000 勒克斯**（lux）。勒克斯是衡量光输出的单位。那是非常明亮的。所以他们还必须弄清楚如何以一种受控且安全的方式呈现它。而这正是 SAD 灯或光箱的作用。也称为光疗灯。我总是喜欢说，即使它们可以非处方购买，但最好在**医疗监督**下使用，这一点非常重要，因为这会影响你的情绪。这会影响你的感受，你的睡眠。所以，如果你要开始光疗，你希望得到了解你和你的病史的人的支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Right. Absolutely. So, research since the 1980s has determined that circadian rhythms can actually be pushed back into alignment with morning bright light exposure. what our natural sleep wake cycle is when days are longer, right? Um, so basically, less daylight throws off your internal clock and bright light therapy helps to reset it. And it's very different from a regular light bulb because they used to do research and they thought, "Oh, well, it doesn't work." But they realized they just weren't using lights that were bright enough. So they've come up with a minimum for light therapy to work effectively and that is 10,000 lux. Lux is a way to measure light output. That's very bright. So they also have to figure out how to present it in a controlled and safe way. And that's where the SAD lamp or light box comes in. Also known as a light therapy lamp. This is where I always like to say it's very important that these be used under medical supervision even though they're available over the counter because this is affecting your mood. This is affecting how you feel, how you sleep. So you want to have some support from someone who knows you and your medical history if you are embarking upon light therapy

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 在冬天，我们确实不是真的缺少光，而是晚上缺少光，但早上仍然有阳光。基本上，我的意思是，仅仅暴露在阳光下也能起作用吗？还是说你必须很早起床才能捕捉到阳光，而不是像这样买个灯，就在自己家里坐着？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: in the winter time. We get not really less light but we have a lack of light in the evenings but we do still have sunlight in the mornings. Basically, what I'm asking is, can just regular sunlight exposure do this, too? Or does that just mean you have to get up really early to catch that sunlight as opposed to getting a lamp like this and just sitting in your own house?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 嗯，第一步，目标始终是实际的阳光，对吧？就像任何事情一样。嗯，我们利用我们所拥有的。而寒冷是一个阻碍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Well, step one, the goal always is actual sunlight, right? Just like with anything. Um, we work with what we have. And cold is a prohibitor.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 对我来说绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: It definitely is for me.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 然后还有云，还有雨，还有恶劣天气。所以，在世界许多地方，实际上光线更少，而且光线存在的时间也更短。所以，如果你能，我真心建议，如果你听了这个播客，你意识到自己可能有点“冬季低落”，或者“哦，我注意到这种模式了”，你可能需要和你的医生谈谈你是否有季节性情感障碍。尝试出去散散步，沐浴阳光，穿上你的派克大衣之类的。那总是一个很棒的选择。但如果你没有这种能力，无论是由于不同的身体状况、你的工作时间表等等，那么光疗可以帮助提供一种人为的方式来“欺骗”你的身体，让它“修复”你的昼夜节律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: And then there's clouds, there's rain, there's inclement weather. So there is actually less light and the light is there for less time in many parts of the world. So if you can I truly suggest if you if you recognize by listening to this podcast I might have a touch of the winter blues or huh I have noticed this pattern I might need to talk to my doctor about whether or not I have seasonal effective disorder. Trying to just get out for a walk in the sun put on your parka and all that. That's always a a great option. But if you don't have that capacity, whether because of different abilities, your work schedule, etc., then light therapy can help provide an artificial way to kind of trick your body into quote unquote fixing your circadian rhythms.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 那么，回到这个灯的力量。Nancy，你提到了 10,000 勒克斯是它必须达到的强度。你能给我们一个参照点吗？比如你晚上放在边桌上的台灯之类的？你知道，那种灯大概有多少勒克斯？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: So, back to the power of this light. Nancy, you mentioned 10,000 lux is the strength that it has to be. Can you just give us a point of reference like a lamp on your side table at night or something? You know, something like that is going to be how many looks?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我无法给出参照，因为每盏灯和每个光源都不同。这取决于你选择的灯泡。这取决于很多方面。但我可以说，一旦你体验过 10,000 勒克斯，你就回不去了。我可以告诉你，光疗灯发出的光是一种非常不同且有目的的光，而且它非常受控且安全，而且它们是无紫外线的。它们有一个特殊的罩子，让眼睛看起来舒适而不刺眼。而且它们通常有低于 10,000 勒克斯的选项，因为那可能非常强烈。有时可能会让人感到不知所措，但这正是光疗灯需要医疗监督的原因之一。因为如果你在生活中感觉像是时差反应，昏昏沉沉的，然后突然，砰，一道明亮的光束进入你的生活，可能会让你觉得有点太多了。但你家里的普通灯泡的亮度远达不到这个水平。或者即使达到了，也是一种不同的光，比如那种让你感觉像在审讯室里的荧光灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: I cannot because every lamp and light is different. It depends on the light bulb you choose. It depends on so many facets. But I can say once you've experienced 10,000 lux, you can't go back. I can say that the light therapy lamps emit a very different purposeful kind of light and it's very controlled and safe and and they're UV free. They have a specific type of cover to make it pleasing to the eye and not jarring. And often times they have options to have less than 10,000 looks because that can be very strong. It can be an experience that is a bit overpowering sometimes, but that's part of why light therapy lamps are meant to be used under medical supervision. Because if you're walking around life feeling like you're jetlagged and bumped out, then out of nowhere, boom, this bright shining beam enters your life, it can feel like a lot. But the average light bulb in your house is not going to come anywhere near that. Or if it does, it's a different kind of light. like the fluorescent lights from overhead that can make you feel like you're in an interrogation room.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 嗯，我正想问，因为 10,000 勒克斯听起来像是千阳之光。我是说，你坐在这些东西前面时需要戴防晒霜和眼镜吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Well, I was going to ask because 10,000 looks sounds like it's the light of a thousand suns. Like, do you have to wear sunscreen and glasses when you sit in front of these things or

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 这个问题不傻。这说得通，对吧？因为如果你想在家里模仿太阳，而你有一个距离脸部 12 英寸的光源，并且你应该每天用它照射角膜 30 分钟，你可能会想，这安全吗？从心理学角度来说，这就是为什么与医疗专业人士合作很重要。但从生理学角度来说，你不需要防晒霜，因为我们推荐的灯会发出**无紫外线**（UV-free）的光。这样，你就不用担心紫外线了，紫外线是阳光中与皮肤损伤相关的部分。就像我说的，我们特别避免任何不过滤紫外线的灯。通常它们会使用特殊的塑料过滤器，确保它是 99.9% 无紫外线的光，或者有些地方非常有信心，他们会说 100% 无紫外线。所以我们推荐的灯在不产生紫外线暴露的情况下提供明亮光线。所以你不需要戴防晒霜。但作为防晒霜指南的作者，我必须说，无论如何你都应该每天涂抹防晒霜，因为如果你外出活动，这对你的健康非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: That's not a dumb question. It does make sense, right? Because if you're trying to mimic the sun in your house and you've got a light that's 12 in away from your face and you're supposed to have it going into your cornea for 30 minutes a day, you might think, is this safe? And from the psychological standpoint, that's why it's important to work with a medical professional. But from the physiological standpoint, you don't need sunscreen because the lamps that we recommend emit UVE light. That way, you don't have to worry about ultraviolet light, which is the part of sunlight that is associated with skin damage. Like I said, we specifically avoid any lamp that doesn't filter out UV light. Usually they use specific plastic filter to make sure that it is either 99.9% UV-free light or some places you know are very confident and they say 100% UVE. So the lamps that we recommend are designed to deliver bright light without UV exposure. So you don't have to wear sunscreen. But this is where as the sunscreen guide writer, I will say you should be wearing sunscreen every day regardless because it is very important for your health if you're going out and about.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我本来想说，我信任你，Nancy，因为我信任你，但我也信任你说的所有这些，因为你是我们的防晒专家。所以这是与之相辅相成的信息。感觉很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I was going to say I trust you because I trust you, Nancy, but I also trust you on all of this because you are our sunscreen expert. And so this is this is information that is a companion in some ways to that. It feels like

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 真的很有趣。我是说，如果你回想一下为什么太阳被崇拜了数千年，然后想想它的感觉，告诉我，有谁在阳光下待了一会儿之后，不会感觉自己稍微明亮一些呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: it's really fun. I mean, if you think back to why the sun has been worshiped, you know, for millennia, and you think about how it feels, tell me the person, you know, who doesn't it feel just a little bit brighter once they've just had a moment in the sun?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 你理解了我们作为一个人类机制是什么，以及阳光是其中一个重要方面。这很美妙。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: You understand what we are as a human mechanism and how the sun is an important aspect of that. It's a beautiful thing.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 那么，我们能回到并谈谈这些灯的工作机制吗？灯发出的光对你的身体有什么作用？所以，这 10,000 勒克斯，目标是找到一个灯，而且说实话，这并不像听起来那么容易，因为市面上有成百上千个所谓的“光疗灯”。所以，当我们筛选时，找到专家推荐的并不像看起来那么简单。专家说，要有效，灯需要提供 10,000 勒克斯，并且你需要每天不间断地接触这 10,000 勒克斯大约 30 分钟，最好是在早上。原因在于，早晨明亮的光线照射有助于提前调整你的昼夜节律，并使其与你自然的睡眠-觉醒周期重新对齐。很多专家将冬季低落或季节性情感障碍比作感觉像时差反应。你知道长途飞行后你会怎么样吗？你会觉得，“啊，我是谁？我在哪？这是什么？”然后需要几天时间才能让一切恢复正常，并在新旧环境中正常入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So, can we just go back and talk about the mechanics of how these lights work? What is the light that the lamp is emitting doing to your body? So, these 10,000 looks, the goal is to find a lamp, and it's not as easy as it sounds, by the way, cuz there's like hundreds of quote unquote light therapy lamps out there. So, when we're sifting through, finding what the experts recommend isn't as easy as it seems. So experts say that to be effective, the lamp needs to offer 10,000 lux and you need to have access to that 10,000 lux for about 30 uninterrupted minutes per day, ideally in the morning. And the reason for that is the morning bright light exposure helps to push your circadian rhythm earlier and brings it back into alignment with your natural sleepwake cycle. A lot of experts refer to winter blues or seasonal effective disorder as feeling like you're jet-lagged. You know how you get off of a long flight and you're just like, "Ah, who am I? What am I? What is this?" And it takes you days to kind of put everything back in order and sleep normally in your new or old environment. So,

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 每天早上用明亮的灯光照射 30 分钟，可以抵消冬季可能引起的时差反应，并重新调整你的自然睡眠-觉醒周期。你会建议人们只在冬天使用吗？因为我个人在夏令时开始时确实会遇到麻烦，早上很黑，但白天晚些时候才有阳光。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: setting yourself right with morning bright light for 30 minutes a day, it kind of undoes that jet lag effect that winter can cause. and realigns your natural sleepwake cycle. Would you recommend that people only use this in the winter time? Because I personally actually have trouble when daylight savings starts in the summer and it's really dark in the mornings, but you get sunlight later in the day.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 嗯，这是一个很棒且敏锐的观察。很高兴你意识到阳光如何影响你的身体，因为每个人的身体都不同。这就是为什么光疗灯不是万能的。它不是情绪灯。它是一种医疗设备。而且也要记住，世界各地的情况非常不同。例如，在阿拉斯加的一月份和弗吉尼亚南部的一月份，这是一个完全不同的对话。对吧？所以季节性情感障碍与季节模式有关。所以，让我们把“冬天”这个词的语境化为你所在的任何黑暗的月份，对吧？光疗被认为是一种有效的治疗 SAD 和其他类型抑郁症的选择。现在，由此推断，对吧？就像你说的，嗯，我在这个时期感觉有点奇怪，或者其他人可能一直感觉奇怪。专业人士是帮助确定它是否适合你以及如何指导你使用它的绝佳人选。所以，我不会称它为严格的冬季专用工具。我认为这是一种可以根据个体情况量身定制的治疗方法，你知道，最好是在临床医生的指导下进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Well, that's a great and astute observation. I'm glad that you are aware of how the sun affects your body because every body is different. Which is why again a light therapy lamp is not a miracle lamp. It's not a mood lamp. It is a medical device. And also remember parts of the world are very different. Like this is a different conversation in January in Alaska than it is in southern Virginia. Right? So seasonal effective disorder is tied to seasonal pattern. So let's just contextualize whatever your darker months are. That's what we mean by winter, right? Bright light therapy is considered to be an effective treatment option for sad and other types of depression. Now, extrapolating that, right? Like you said, well, I'm feeling weird in this period of time or other people might feel weird all the time. A professional is a great person to help determine whether it's appropriate for you and also to guide on how often or how long you should use it. So, I wouldn't call it a strictly winter only tool. I think it's a treatment that can be tailored to the individual, you know, ideally with a clinician's guidance.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 那么，我们对 SAD 灯可能适合谁有了一些想法，但我很好奇，你知道是否有任何特定人群可能对这些灯敏感，以至于不适合使用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So, we have an idea of who sad lamps might be for, but I'm curious if you know if there are any particular groups that may be sensitive to these lamps that it may not be a good idea.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 实际上，有比你想象的更多的人应该非常非常小心地进行光疗，因为你认为它只是一盏灯。会发生什么？嗯，有些人对光非常敏感。所以，首先也是最重要的，任何有**双相情感障碍**（bipolar disorder）病史的人都应该知道，光疗有可能在易感个体中引发躁狂发作。还有一些重要的生理禁忌症，因为我们并不完全了解光疗对视网膜的长期影响。好的？所以，患有**黄斑变性**（macular degeneration）或**糖尿病视网膜病变**（diabetic retinopathy）等视网膜疾病的人应该先咨询他们的眼科医生。然后，还有对光敏感的药物，对吧？比如有些化疗药物，有些抗精神病药物。服用某些药物的人应该告知他们的医疗专业人士。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: There are actually more people who should really, really be careful about undergoing light therapy than you would think cuz you think it's just a lamp. What could happen? Well, people are very sensitive to light. So first and foremost, anyone with a history of bipolar disorder should know that light therapy has the potential to trigger a manic episode in susceptible individuals. There are also some important physical contraindications because we don't fully know the long-term effects of light therapy on the retina. Okay. So, people with retinal diseases like macular degeneration or diabetic uh retinopathy should speak to their opthalmologist first. And then finally, medications that are photosensitive, right? Like there are some chemotherapy drugs, there are certain antiscychotics. People who are taking certain medicines should mention it to their medical professionals.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 所以 Nancy，简单总结一下，我听到的是，最重要的事情是你绝对想在购买这些东西之前与你的医生沟通。如果他们批准了，那么在你使用光疗灯期间，仍然要全程保持沟通。我想强调一下，当我提到医生时，不一定非得是你的全科医生。可以是你的治疗师、精神科医生、心理医生，任何了解你病史的人。这是我的理想情况，适用于所有人。然后，你将希望将其融入你的早晨例行程序中。也许在你喝咖啡的时候，你就能享受到 10,000 勒克斯的光照在你脸上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: So Nancy, just to recap, I'm hearing that the most important thing is you definitely want to be in communication with your doctor before you buy one of these things. And if they give you the go-ahad, then during the time that you're using light therapy lamp, still communicate throughout the entire process. And I want to just make sure I say when I say doctor, it doesn't have to be your PCP. It can be your therapist, your psychiatrist, your psychologist, just somebody who knows you as a patient. That is my ideal for everyone. And then you're going to want to incorporate it into your morning routine. Maybe while you're sitting having your coffee, you're blessed in 10,000 lux right on your face.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 绝对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Absolutely.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 好的，我们要休息一下，回来后，我们将详细介绍 Nancy 推荐的所有四款 SAD 灯。请继续收看。

<details>

**Rosie Garin**: All right, we're going to take a quick break and when we come back, we're going to get into the details of all four sad lamps Nancy recommends. Stick around.

### SAD灯评测与推荐

**Kyra Blackwell**: 欢迎回来。现在我们知道了 SAD 灯是什么以及它们如何工作，让我们来谈谈你推荐哪些型号，Nancy。首先，请告诉我们你是如何研究和测试这些灯的。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Welcome back. Now that we know what sad lamps are and how they work, let's talk a little bit about which ones you recommend, Nancy. So, first, tell us how you even researched and tested these lamps.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 好的，Wire Cutter 自 2017 年以来一直在测试光疗灯。作为健康领域的高级撰稿人，我个人测试过 30 多款光疗灯。我评估过上百款，但很多都不符合我们对最佳光疗灯以帮助治疗季节性情感障碍的标准。我喜欢阅读同行评审的研究。我喜欢浏览人们在生物黑客论坛上讨论如何让自己全年感觉良好，尤其是在冬季通过光疗灯，这是一个人们非常感兴趣的话题，我与多位专家进行过交流。找出最好的光疗灯真的很有趣，尽管我们不评估其**医疗功效**（medical efficacy）。但我们会检查每款灯，以确定它是否真的能提供 10,000 勒克斯？你必须坐多近？因为有些灯能提供，但距离只有 6 英寸，对吧？而这需要你做出一个生活决定。我将如何度过？嗯，当然，就像我说的，它是否过滤掉了可能有害的紫外线。然后还有其他不太重要但仍然重要的因素，如热量输出、定位选项、电源线长度、定时器以及亮度设置。你可能会惊讶。很多这些灯实际上会变得相当热。是的，我在你们位于长岛市的办公室里测试过一点，我注意到你一走进那个会议室，就摆放着所有这些灯，里面明显很热。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Okay, so Wire cutters been testing light therapy lamps since 2017. As the senior staff writer for health, I have personally tested over 30 light therapy lamps. I've evaluated over a hundred, but many of them do not meet our parameters for the best light therapy lamp to help with seasonal effective disorder. I love reading peerreview studied. I love scouring message boards where people are biohacking trying to figure out how to make themselves feel great year round, but in particular in the winter months with light therapy lamps and is a it's a topic that people are really into and I've spoken with multiple experts. It's been really fun to figure out the best light therapy lamp even though we are not evaluating for medical efficacy. But we are looking at each lamp to decide is it actually delivering the 10,000 lugs? How far away do you have to sit? Because some lamps will deliver it, but it's 6 in, right? And that's that's a life decision that you have to make. Is that how I'm going to go down? Um, and of course, like I said, whether it filters out UV light that could potentially be damaging. Then there are other less important but still important factors like heat output, positioning options, cord length, timers, and also brightness settings. You'd be surprised. A lot of these lamps actually get rather hot.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的。我在你们办公室的测试中也注意到这一点，我注意到会议室里摆满了各种灯，里面明显很热。是的。嗯，我想回到前面问一下，为什么你们不测试功效？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah. I sat in a little bit on your testing at our office in Long Island City and I noticed as soon as you walk into that conference room, you had all these like lamps set up and it was noticeably hot in there. Yes. Well, I wanted to go back a little bit and ask why you're not testing for efficacy.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 是的，绝对不。我们没有测试过这些灯的功效。现在，其他人已经测试过功效。事实上，我们首选的制造商 **Carex**，曾参与过许多显示光疗灯有效性的研究。但我们 Wire Cutter 没有资格或能力评估 SAD 灯的医疗功效。所以，我们不测试它们是否能改善抑郁症。我们测试的是它们是否具有专家所说的“具有治疗效果的统计数据”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Yes, definitely no. We have not tested these lamps for efficacy. Now, other people have tested for efficacy. In fact, the maker of our pick, Carrick, has been part of many a study showing the efficacy of light therapy lamps. But we at Wire Cutter are not qualified or equipped to evaluate SAD lamps for medical efficacy. So, we're not testing whether or not they improve depression.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I see.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我们测试的是它们是否具有专家所说的能达到治疗效果的统计数据。以及用户体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: We are testing whether or not they have the stats experts say can be therapeutically effective. And user experience.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的。因为正如你将看到的，与夏季款相比，它们在技术上治疗效果是否略有下降？是的。但它是否是可以在小公寓里使用，或者符合个人预算，或者符合审美需求的东西？同样是肯定的。所以，就像任何东西一样，无论是牙刷还是光疗灯，你最需要选择的是你真正会使用的那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yes. Because as you'll see with summer picss, are they slightly less technically therapeutically effective? Yes. But is it something that can work in a tiny apartment or a person's budget or an aesthetic desire? Also yes. So like with anything, whether it's a toothbrush or light therapy lamp, the one you will use is the one that you need to pick.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。我想谈谈你具体推荐的那款。我还想提一下，我记得这个指南以前只有一款灯，而且是“下雨灯”很长一段时间，然后你又增加了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. I wanted to talk about your pick specifically. I also wanted to mention that I mean I remember this guide used to only have like one light and it was just the raining light for a long time and then you added

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 不，它一直都有两款。一直都有两款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: No, it always had two. It always had two.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的，我们一直有两款。抱歉。嗯，原因是我对这个非常热情，我不是故意打断你，但它一直都有两款。我们一直有我们出色的 **Carex**，它经历了一个升级过程，然后我们现在推荐升级后的那款，它真的很棒。嗯，它就是那么……它看起来像一个医疗设备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yes, we've had two. Sorry. Well, and the reason why and I'm so passionate about this I didn't mean to cut you off but it has always had two. We've always had our delightful Carex which has gone through an upgrade process and then we now recommend the upgraded one which is really great. Um and it's just so peruncter. It It looks like a medical device.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 像个医疗设备。它非常……它很大。它有一个很长的臂，而且它是……看起来像是钢制的。它只是有点……它让你感到压迫，它在你上方俯视你，并向你投射出明亮的光线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Like a medical device. It's very It's huge. It's got this really long arm and it's made out It looks like it's made out of steel. And it just kind of like overpowers you as it stares over you and shines this bright light at you.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 是的。是的。它在尖叫：“我在医疗监督下使用。我没有美学价值，但我可能会帮助你生存。”这对很多人来说都不是那种感觉。所以，但我们一直有一个亚军。它更贵。它的位置调整性更差。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Yes. Yes. It's screaming, "I am being used under medical supervision. I have no aesthetic value, but I might be able to help you survive in life." That's not the vibes for many for many people. And so, but we always have had a runner up. It's more expensive. It's less positionable,

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 但它看起来更可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: but it looks cuter.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 它是一款更可爱的灯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: It's a cuter lamp.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 你的指南里有四款推荐。一个人应该如何选择最适合自己的那一款呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: So, you have four picks in your guide. How should somebody go about choosing which one is right for them?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 如果你对只是……你知道，试图改善你的情绪感到满意，那就选择 Carex 吧。它很棒。价格实惠。它具备我们专家推荐的所有规格。它有很棒的**五年保修**。我们最喜欢它的一点是，它可以调整位置以模拟太阳的顶光，而这正是目标。目标是模仿阳光。所以它挂在你头顶上方。所以如果你坐在桌子旁，它就像太阳一样进入你的眼睛，但它看起来很笨重。如果我真的需要一个 SAD 灯，我会用它，因为我选择功效而非美观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: If you are okay with just the, you know, trying to improve your mood, definitely go with the Carex. It's amazing. It's affordable. It has all the specs our experts recommend. It's got a really great 5year warranty. What we like about it most is it can be positioned to mimic overhead lighting from the sun, which that's the goal. The goal is mimicking sunlight. And so it hangs over your head. So if you're sitting at a desk, it's coming in your into your eye like sun would, but it looks clunky. If I really needed a sad lamp, I would use it because I choose efficacy over aesthetics.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 好的，那么 Carex 的首选，即使它可能不是最漂亮的东西。**Northern Light** 灯最适合什么？这是另一个选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Okay, so Carrick's top pick, even if it's maybe not the nicest thing to look at. What is the Northern Light lamp best for? This is another pick.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 所以，Northern Light 多年来一直是我们的……嗯，亚军，因为它看起来就像一个……一个工业盒子。它非常漂亮，而且很薄，很流畅。它还有一种非常美丽的暖光，设计也非常低调。所以如果你把它放在那里，没有人会说，“那是什么？”你知道，而且它很大。所以我们的一些选择比较小巧低调，但灯面越大，你在更短的时间内获得一些益处的机会就越大。所以，如果你在权衡功效、美观和易用性，那肯定会是 Northern Light 盒子灯。是的，那是我在办公室测试中最喜欢的一款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: So, the Northern Light has always been like our little runner uh for years, and it's because it just looks like a like an industrial box. It's like very pretty, and it's thin, streamlined. It also has this very beautiful warm light and it has a very unobtrusive design. So if you just slid it in there, no one would be like, "What's that?" You know, and it's very large. So some of our pics are smaller and unobtrusive, but the larger the light face, the better a chance you have of getting some benefit out of this in a shorter period of time. So, if you are weighing efficacy, aesthetic, and ease of use, it's definitely going to be the Northern Light box light. Yeah, that was my favorite one I tested in the office.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我有一张你站在它前面的漂亮照片。你看起来真可爱。你看起来就像一个阳光仙子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I have a beautiful picture of you in front of it. You look so cute. You just look like a sun fairy.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 它有那种非常温暖的色调。感觉就像我在沐浴阳光。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: It's It's got that really warm toned light. It felt like I was just basking in the sun. It was great.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 它和 Carex 一样，多年来一直是我们的选择。那 **Buer** 呢？我发音对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: It has been a pick just like the Carrick for years. How about um the Buer? Am I saying that right?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我不知道。啤酒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: I don't know. beer.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: TL95。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: The TL95.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 这是一款非常、非常特别的灯。它看起来像是属于 Apple Store 的产品。它发出的光非常独特，旨在更接近模仿自然日光，但它是一种非常酷的颜色，不适合所有人，这就是为什么人们喜欢阅读评论、观看视频并决定什么适合他们的原因。是的，那一个更让我想起荧光灯。比如那种颜色，它发出的光非常白。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: It's a really, really special lamp. It looks like it belongs in an Apple store. It has a very unique light that it emits that is designed to more closely mimic natural daylight, but it's a very cool color that's not for everyone, which is why it's great for people to read reviews, watch videos, and decide what works for them. Yeah, that one more so reminded me of like a fluorescent light. Like the the color it was literally it's very white that comes off of that lamp.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: **Verilux Happy Light** 呢？那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: How about the Verilux Happy Light? What's that one about?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我喜欢这款。好的，这款很有趣，因为多年来我一直在寻找另一款经济实惠的灯，但没有一款能超越 Verilux Happy Light。它是一款很棒的小巧、紧凑、便宜的灯。而且，我们顶级型号的价格，你可以买两三盏。你可以在办公室放一盏，家里放一盏。我甚至听说有人把这款灯装在……用便携式充电器，开车去上班时带着它。而且它完全有效。人们非常喜欢这款名字恰如其分的 Verilux Happy Light。所以，如果有人真的想要更多的阳光照射在他们的环境中，为什么他们要花高达 200 美元买一盏这样的灯，而他们可以用 Verilux 的价格的一小部分就能买到呢？嗯，再次强调，灯面越大，你在更短的时间内获得有效剂量的光疗的机会就越大。这款经济实惠的型号的问题在于，它在距离仅 6 英寸处提供 10,000 勒克斯，对吧？所以，这意味着在更远的距离，它的勒克斯值会降低。所以，如果你在它前面待的时间更长，比如你整天让它开着放在桌子上，那也没关系。但更短时间内获得更多勒克斯更好。这就是为什么你会选择 Carex 或盒子灯，或者你知道的，另一个能让你保持距离的灯。而且要始终阅读说明。好的光疗灯会提供英寸到勒克斯的距离供你做决定。所以，我想这就是全部了。我是说，你……这是你必须为自己做出的决定。就像，你不会把 Carex 带到车里，但 Happy Light 恰好适合某种生活方式和氛围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: I love this one. Okay, this one it's so funny because over the years I've always been looking for another budget pick light, but nothing can topple the Verilux heavy light. It's a great little inexpensive compact cheap lamp. And for the price of one of our top picks, you can get two or three. You could have one in the office, one at home. I've actually even heard of people taking this lamp and attaching it to like a portable charger and putting it in the car with them as they're driving to work. And it's totally effective. People really like the aptly named Verilux Happy Light. So, if somebody really wants more sunlight in their environment, why would they spend up to $200 on one of these lamps when they could get something like the Verilux for a fraction of that cost? Well, again, the bigger the light phase, the better chance you have of getting an effective dose of light therapy in an amount of time that makes sense for most people. The one problem with our budget pick is it provides 10,000 lux at a distance of only 6 in, right? So, what that means though is at a longer distance, it provides less lux. So, if you're in front of it for a longer period of time, like if you just have the thing on at your desk all day, that's fine. But more lux in a shorter period of time is better. That's why you would pick the carax or the box of light or you know another one that gives you a distance and always read what they say. Good light therapy lamps offer you inches to lux for you to make your decisions. So I think that's it. I mean you it's a decision you have to make for yourself. Like again, you're not going to have the carax in your car, but the heavy light just kind of fits into a lifestyle and a vibe.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 那么，对于一个正在收听的、感到好奇但可能有点怀疑，不愿意尝试或购买 SAD 灯的人来说，最合理、压力最小的尝试光疗的方法是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: So, for someone listening who is curious, but maybe a little bit skeptical about reaching for or paying for a sad lamp, what is the most reasonable and low pressure way to try light therapy without overcommitting?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我知道这听起来很“模拟”，但首先，试试穿上派克大衣，拿一杯热饮，你知道，然后找到你周围阳光似乎照耀的地方，如果可以的话，就享受 10 分钟，或者散散步。如果可以免费做到的话。虽然我是光疗灯指南的作者，但我也是一个注重预算、亲近自然的人。所以看看这是否有帮助，因为新鲜空气、自然的声音，即使你没有得到很多阳光，所有这些东西也能提升你的情绪。最坏的情况会发生什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Fancy. I know this sounds very analog, but just try at first putting on a parka, grabbing a travel cup of a hot drink, you know, and just finding a spot in your world where the sun seems to be shining and just bask for 10 minutes if you can or take a walk. if you can do it for free. Even though I am the the author of the guide to light therapy lamps, I am also a budgetoriented nature first person. So see if that helps cuz the fresh air, the nature sounds, even if you don't get a lot of sun, all of these things can also boost your mood. And what's the worst that can happen?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 嗯，Nancy，我们到了最后一个问题。你最近买的、你非常喜欢的东西是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Well, Nancy, we've made it to our final question. What's the last thing you've bought that you've really loved?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 哦，好的。我要给你两个词，它们似乎不搭，但实际上很搭。你听说过**泳衣派克大衣**（swim parka）吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Ooh, okay. I'm going to give you two words that don't seem like they would go together, but they do. Have you ever heard of a swim parka?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: No.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 哦，Nancy。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Oh, Nancy,

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 这是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: where is this headed?

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 想象一下一件防水的长款外套，从头到脚，但内衬是蓬松吸水的毛巾。泳衣派克大衣。我女儿加入了游泳队，我们给她买了她的小……她的小毛巾，还有其他孩子从泳池出来时，他们的父母就像……像个看管人一样，给他们穿上这些外套，我当时就想：“这是什么？为什么你们在泳池边穿外套？”他们说：“这不是外套，这是泳衣派克大衣。”所以，我立刻上网买了一件，它很棒，很暖和，但又不会太热，孩子可以穿着它走到车里，而且它能防止汽车被氯水弄湿。我只想知道，我怎么能活了 44 年却不知道这种极度升级的毛巾——泳衣派克大衣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Imagine a giant waterproof head to calf coat, but the inside lining is a fluffy absorbent towel. Swim parkas. My daughter joined a swim team and we had her little sad towel and all the other children are exiting the pool with their parent acting like like a a handler and putting them in these coats and I was like, "What is this? Why are you wearing a coat at the pool?" They're like, "It's not a coat. It's a swim parker." So, I went online and immediately bought it and it's delightful and warm, but it's not too warm and the kid can waddle in it to the car and it keeps the car from being soaked in chlorine. I just wanted to know how I made it 44 years without knowing about this extreme towel upgrade that is the swim parker.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 好的，我得说实话，我以为你是在水里穿这个。这说得通多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: All right, I'm not going to lie. I thought you wore this in the water. This makes way more sense.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 完全正确。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: Totally. Totally.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的，我也是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah, same.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 但这同样令人震惊，因为为什么我们还在用毛巾，而不是泳衣派克大衣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: But it's equally as mind-blowing cuz why are we out here with a towel when we could have a swim park?

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 有道理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Fair.

</details>

**Nancy Red**: 我对此没什么意见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nancy Red**: I'm not mad at that.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 谢谢你，Nancy。谢谢你加入我们。

<details>

**Rosie Garin**: Nancy Red，我们最喜欢的嘉宾之一。

**Kyra Blackwell**: She is such a gem. What are you taking away from this conversation? I found it really interesting.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 嗯，我觉得我需要和我的医生谈谈，看看买一盏光疗灯是否适合我。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Um, I think I need to talk to my doctor and see if maybe getting a light therapy lamp is the move for me. Yeah,

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我住在地下室，你知道的，我觉得我真的会从中受益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I live in a basement, as you well know, and I think I would really benefit from one.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的，我喜欢这样。我觉得对我来说，这些选择多年来一直很稳定，正如 Nancy 所测试的那样，这表明那里有一些非常好的选择。Carex 听起来不太好看，但它效果非常好，而且是一个高效的选择，尤其是考虑到价格。我也从 Nancy 那里学到了在早上使用这些灯的想法，以真正地……你知道，尝试启动并调整你的昼夜节律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah, I love that. I think for me the picks have been pretty consistent over the years as Nancy has tested these which suggests that there are some really good options there. Carrick sounds like it's not that nice to look at but it works really well and it is an efficient choice especially for the price point. And I also took from Nancy this idea of using these in the morning to really kind of try and jump start and get right your circadian rhythm.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的，非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah, really important.
