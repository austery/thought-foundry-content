这是关于洛杉矶山火一年后三部曲系列的第二部分。如果您还没有听过第一部分，请返回我们的订阅源查找，它的标题是《洛杉矶山火灾后恢复的真实成本，第一部分》。

**发言人**: 4063。我想就是这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: 4063. And I think that's this one.

</details>

**发言人**: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: That's great.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，那里有邮箱。去年12月，我与我的共同主持人**Rosie Garin**和我们的制作人**Abigail Keel**驾车行驶在一条美丽蜿蜒的道路上。我们正前往我们的同事**Gregory Han**的家。2025年1月，Gregory和他的妻子**Emily**从家中撤离，以为他们只会离开几天。但**伊顿山火**造成的破坏使他们六个月都无法回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah, there's the mailbox. In December, I drove up a beautiful, winding road with my co-host **Rosie Garin** and our producer **Abigail Keel**. We were headed to our colleague **Gregory Han**'s home. In January 2025, Gregory and his wife **Emily** evacuated from their home, thinking they'd only be gone for a few days. But the damage and destruction from the **Eaton fire** kept them from moving back for 6 months.

</details>

**发言人**: 很有橡树林街道的感觉。那是桉树还是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Very Oak line street. Is that eucalyptus or something?

</details>

**发言人**: 呃，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Uh,

</details>

**发言人**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: what is that?

</details>

**发言人**: 你可能闻到的是鼠尾草。那里有

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: You are probably smelling. There's sage. There is

</details>

**发言人**: **Gregory**的房子坐落在一座大山顶上，他住在一个小小的死胡同里，周围还有几栋房子，都建在**Altadena**的**Meadows**社区。火灾发生一年后，他周围的房子都没有被烧毁的痕迹。大火甚至没有蔓延到山坡上，但这并不意味着它们没有受损。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Gregory's house is on the top of a big hill. He lives on a small culde-sac with a handful of other homes, all built in the **Meadows** neighborhood of **Altadena**. A year out from the fire, none of the homes around him looked burned. The fires didn't even come up the side of the hill, but it doesn't mean they weren't damaged.

</details>

### 灾后房屋污染与检测

**发言人**: 是的。所以当我到达这里时，这个区域是**悬浮颗粒物**污染最明显的地方。所有这些路边都截住了所有吹向这边的东西。所以烟雾是从那边飘过来的，显然是顺着风吹到这边来的，因为我们的邻居和朋友**Sandy**，她的屋顶被烧毁了。所以现在都重新装修了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. So when I arrived here, this area was the most obvious contaminated with **particulate matter**. All of this curb had caught everything that was blowing this way. So the the smoke had come over and apparently like blown with the wind down this way because our neighbor and our friend **Sandy**, she lost her roof. So it's all redone

</details>

**发言人**: 这边，街对面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: this across the street.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，街对面。所以显然它吹到了这里，然后就堆积在整个环形区域。我喜欢的这个环形车道，变成了一个巨大的收集器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Speaker**: Yeah, across the street. And so apparently it blew in here and it just accumulated all around the circle. This circle driveway, which I love, became a big catch.
</details>

**发言人**: 那它看起来像什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: So what did it look like?

</details>

**发言人**: 它看起来就像有人倒了一堆像盐和胡椒粉一样的东西，大块的白色、灰色和黑色碎片堆积成堆。我曾经全副武装地来过一次，把它们收集起来，装进小袋子里，然后立即送去检测样本。你送去检测的样本，结果是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It looked like somebody dumped a bunch of like salt and pepper, like big white and gray and black pieces that had accumulated into piles. I came one time fully PPEd and gathered it and put it in a baggie and and sent out a sample to test right away. Did the sample that you sent away, what did that one come back as?

</details>

**发言人**: 它显示**铅**含量很高。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It showed high **lead**. Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 我是**Christine Sierette**，这里是**Wire Cutter Show**。这是我们回顾洛杉矶山火一年后特别系列的第二部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I'm **Christine Sierette** and this is the **Wire Cutter Show**. This is part two of our special series looking back at the LA wildfires one year later.

</details>

**发言人**: **Gregory**和我们的另一位同事**Mike Cohen**都从**伊甸山火**中幸存下来，这场大火肆虐了**圣盖博山脉**的山麓。他们面临着不同的后果。Mike的家被毁了，Gregory的家受损了，但他们都在努力应对经历自然灾害的意义。因为Gregory和Mike都是Wire Cutter的撰稿人，他们倾向于务实和以服务为导向，他们对其他人可以从他们的经验中吸取什么教训思考了很多。去年夏天，他们发表了一篇文章，为任何可能面临自然灾害的人提供了最佳建议。我们正在借鉴那篇文章以及他们过去六个月学到的东西。上次我们听说了Gregory和Mike在火灾期间和火灾后立即发生的事情，以及他们最大的教训之一，即在灾难发生前投资于您的社区。今天我们将听听火灾后他们生活中发生的事情，以及他们如何应对恢复过程中一个重要环节的建议：**保险**。他们有一个简单的建议，你现在就可以做，以后你会感谢自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Gregory** and our other colleague **Mike Cohen** both survived the **Eden fire** which raged through the foothills of the **San Gabriel Mountains**. They faced different consequences. Mike's home was destroyed. Gregory's was damaged, but they both are still navigating what it means to live through a natural disaster. Because Gregory and Mike are both wire cutter writers, they tend to be practical and service-minded, and they've thought a lot about what others can take away from their experiences. Last summer, they published an article that gave their best advice for anyone who might face a natural disaster. We're drawing from that article and what they've learned in the 6 months since. Last time we heard about what happened during the fire and immediately after for Gregory and Mike and about one of their biggest lessons, investing in your community before a disaster. Today we're going to hear about what's happened in their lives since the fires and their advice for how to navigate a big piece of the puzzle of recovery. **Insurance**. They've got one simple suggestion you can do now that you'll thank yourself for later.

</details>

**发言人**: 在灾难中，你只是假设他们会相信你的话。这是一个非常不安全的假设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: In a disaster, you just assume, I think, that they will take your word for it. That's a very unsafe presumption. You know,

</details>

**发言人**: 休息后，我们将听到更多来自**Gregory**和**Mike**的分享。Gregory和Mike都告诉我们，火灾发生后的一年里，他们有时感觉自己像在过别人的生活。**Gregory**被安置了六个月，期间他的家进行了修复，这意味着需要进行专业的清洁和维修，以使其再次安全居住。**Mike**已经无家可归。火灾发生后不久，他与**Chelsea**搬到**德克萨斯州**与家人同住。四月，他们回到了洛杉矶。在住了几个不同的**爱彼迎**之后，他们租了一套公寓安顿下来。当我早上醒来选择要穿的衣服时，那些都不是我的衣服。我现在穿的所有衣服都是捐赠的，对此我非常感激。但当我照镜子时，我简直认不出自己。感觉火灾发生后，我们的一切都是暂时的。我们不知道重建过程会是怎样的。我们不知道是否能回到**Altadena**。我们不知道Altadena是否会完全安全，让我们回去。我们不知道它是否还会是我们当初买房并想在那里抚养家庭的那个Altadena。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: we'll hear more from **Gregory** and **Mike** after the break. One thing that Gregory and Mike both told us about their year since the fire is that they sometimes feel like they're living someone else's life. Gregory was displaced for 6 months while his home was remediated, which means it needed to be professionally cleaned and repaired to make it safe to live in again. Mike doesn't have a home to go back to. Soon after the fires, he and **Chelsea** moved in with family in **Texas**. In April, they came back to LA. After a few different **Airbnbs**, they settled into a rental apartment. When I wake up in the morning and I choose the clothes to wear, they're not my clothes. All of these clothes that I'm wearing right now were donation, which I'm so grateful for. But when I look at myself in the mirror, I don't I literally don't recognize myself. It feels like everything is temporary for us since the fires. We don't know what the rebuilding process will look like. We don't know if we'll get back to **Altadena**. We don't know if Altadena will be fully safe for us to go back to. We don't know if it'll be the Altadena that we bought a house and wanted to raise a family in.

</details>

**发言人**: 谈到家庭，你今年的生活确实和火灾前大不相同，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And speaking of family, you your life does look a lot different this year, right, than it did before the fires.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。火灾差不多发生在1月的第一周。一周后，我们发现我们怀上了第一个孩子。所以，那真是一段过山车般的经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. So, uh, the fires were pretty much the first week of January. A week later, we found out we were pregnant with our first child. So, it was a roller coaster.

</details>

**发言人**: **Mike**的女儿**Florence**出生在十月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Mike**'s daughter, **Florence**, was born in October.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。一切都不同了。一切都不同了。所有让你感觉像你自己的东西，当你早上醒来，你会说：“哦，这是我的咖啡机，我喜欢这样操作它。”现在一切都不同了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. Everything is different. Everything is different. Everything that makes you feel like you when you wake up in the morning and you're like, "Oh, this is my coffee machine. The way that I like to do it, everything is different.

</details>

### FEMA援助的局限性

**发言人**: 灾民在解决了即时安全问题后，面临的一个障碍是住在哪里以及如何更换他们的物品。**Mike**和**Gregory**都曾认为**FEMA**（**联邦紧急事务管理局**），这个提供灾害援助的机构，会提供一些帮助。但他们每人在火灾后收到的第一笔款项远低于预期，仅覆盖了他们开销的一小部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: One hurdle disaster victims face after their immediate safety is taken care of is where to live and how to replace their stuff. **Mike** and **Gregory** both assumed that **FEMA**, the **Federal Emergency Management Agency**, which provides disaster assistance, would offer some of this help, but the first check they each received after the fire was much less than they had expected, covering only a fraction of their expenses.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们收到了700。是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And we got 700. What is it?

</details>

**发言人**: **770美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **$770**.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。每个人都收到了**770美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. Everybody got the **770**.

</details>

**发言人**: 每个人都收到了**770美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Everybody gets the **$770**.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。那可能只够买些杂货和一些基本必需品。之后我没听说还有其他人获得任何其他**FEMA**援助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. And that was to cover maybe some groceries. Um some basic necessities and then everybody I haven't heard of anybody else getting any other **FEMA** aid.

</details>

**发言人**: 不，我们被多次拒绝，也多次上诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: No, we we've been rejected multiple times and we've appealed multiple times.

</details>

**发言人**: 我也一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Same here.

</details>

**发言人**: 其他洛杉矶山火受害者获得了更多援助。截至2025年6月，**FEMA**及其联邦合作伙伴报告已向山火幸存者发放了超过**30亿美元**的资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Other LA wildfire victims have received more. As of June 2025, **FEMA** and its federal partners reported dispensing over **$3 billion** in funds to wildfire survivors.

</details>

### 房屋保险与财产清单

**发言人**: 实际上，**Gregory**和他的妻子最初的许多费用都由他们的**房屋保险**承担了。我们漫步走进保险公司在**Altadena**设立的移动灾害帐篷。我们走进去说：“我们需要帮助。我们受到了火灾的影响，我们需要帮助。我们需要钱买杂货。我们没有工作。我们只是需要钱来维持生计。”我们真的很幸运，因为我们遇到的那个人说：“哦，我今天就批准，马上就批。”我们旁边的一些邻居直到两周后才获得批准。这种保险的随机性真的让人抓狂。我记得走出帐篷时，我说：“至少接下来的三个月，我们会没事的。”你就是这样一步步前进的，就像“下周，下个月”。是的。然而，最终，灾民需要的不仅仅是购买杂货和即时住房的钱。你需要开始更换你日常使用的物品，那些构成你日常生活的物品。你需要钱来购买这些物品。而要从保险公司获得这笔钱，你需要证明你确实拥有这些物品。这就是**财产清单**的作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: In reality, many of those initial costs for **Gregory** and his wife were covered by their **home insurance**. We ambled into our insurers's mobile disaster tent that they had set up in **Altadena**. We walked in and said, "We we need help. We're affected by the fires and we need help. We need money for groceries. We're not working. We're we just need money to get by. And we were really fortunate because the guy who we met said, "Oh, I'll approve today right right off the bat." Some of our neighbors immediately next to us did not get approved for 2 weeks. And it it's really that luck of the draw of of insurance that is really maddening. I remember walking out of the tent. I said, "At least for the next 3 months, we'll be okay." And that's how you move forward. It's like, "Next week, next month." Yeah. Eventually, though, disaster victims need more than just money for groceries and immediate housing. You need to start replacing the items you use every day. The items that make up your daily life. You need money for these items. And to get that money from an insurance company, you need to prove that you actually owned these items. That's where **the list** comes in.

</details>

**发言人**: 这就是你家里所有东西的清单，如果你把家里的东西都倒出来的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: This is the list of every single thing in your home if you were to take your home and dump it out.

</details>

**发言人**: **房屋保险**政策不仅覆盖你的房屋，还覆盖房屋内的物品，即你的**个人财产**。当像**Mike**一样，你失去了一切，需要钱来更换这些财产时，保险公司会要求你列出他们需要赔付的具体物品清单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Home insurance** policies cover not just your home, but also the things inside it, your **personal property**. And when, like **Mike**, you've lost everything and need money to replace that property, insurance asks for a list of exactly what they're paying to replace.

</details>

**发言人**: 大多数人现在都说不出自己背包里所有的东西。如果你把所有东西都倒出来，然后逐项列举，想象一下你必须对家里每一个抽屉、阁楼里每一个箱子、每一个书架上的每一本书都这样做。你会为每一件物品获得一定的赔偿，但前提是你必须能记住它。他们是为了保护自己免受**欺诈**。他们只支付他们必须支付的金额。而我们这边则说，我不知道我有多少双袜子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Most people can't tell you everything that's in their backpack right now. If you were to dump all of it out and itemize it, imagine having to do that with every single drawer in your entire home, every box in your attic, every shelf with every single book. You will get paid some amount for every single item, but only if you can remember it. They're protecting themselves against **fraud**. They're only paying out as much as they have to. and we're on the other side of it going, I I I don't know how many pairs of socks I had.

</details>

**发言人**: 有很多东西是藏起来的，你只是存放起来，然后就忘记了，这只是作为美国人的习惯。所以，当你办理保险索赔时，他们需要你拥有这些东西的证明。因此，通过记录所有物品，你已经为保险公司做了前期工作。我们曾多次不得不反驳说：“不，不，不。那不是我们拥有的东西。你给我们的是这种东西中价值较低的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: There are a lot of things that are hidden away that you just store away and forget just being an American. So, when you go through the process of making a claim with your insurance, they want proof that you own these things. So, by having everything documented, you're already doing the footwork with the insurance. There have been instances where we had to push back and say, "Oh, no, no, no. That's not what we owned. You're giving us the lesser of this thing."

</details>

### 灾前财产记录与数字化

**发言人**: **Mike**和**Gregory**的建议是，为了在灾难发生前保护自己，现在就开始制作这份清单。记录你的财产。保留收据，特别是**数字化收据**，会有帮助，但你还需要物品的**照片证据**。这是Mike和Gregory都希望他们在火灾前能更彻底做到的事情。如果你有家里所有物品的**视频记录**，在火灾后的几周里，与保险公司打交道会更容易吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Mike** and **Gregory**'s advice for what to do now to protect yourself before a disaster, is to start making this list. Document your possessions. Keeping receipts, especially **digital ones**, will help, but you'll also want **photographic evidence** of your items. It's something Mike and Gregory both wish they had done more thoroughly before the fires. If you had had **photographic documentation** of everything that you had in your home, would it have made it easier in the weeks after the fire with your insurance company?

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。如果我们有经过精心制作的**照片记录**和**视频记录**，那会容易得多。我们可以用这些文件开始与保险公司进行沟通和谈判。相反，我们不得不联系所有朋友，翻遍所有照片，尽量找到尽可能多的证据。我们翻阅了朋友的**Instagram**，深入挖掘了我们的照片。非常幸运的是，我们前一年刚养了狗。任何第一次养小狗的主人都会告诉你，你会一直在家里给它们拍视频。哦，这是**Una**正在跑离**戴森V8 Absolute吸尘器**。哦，那是**Unona**，她正在转弯，就在空气净化器旁边。我们给保险理赔员发了那么多我们狗狗的视频，以至于最后她都评论说：“你的狗真可爱，你把它训练得很好。”制作清单和与保险公司谈判赔付的过程，对每个人来说都不同，取决于你失去了什么以及你拥有什么样的保险。但**Gregory**和**Mike**都对这需要多长时间感到惊讶。我们仍在与保险公司合作，以更换或获得一定金额的赔偿，其中包含了我们因污染而损失和不得不丢弃的物品的折旧。我可以说这是一个**六位数金额**，这太疯狂了。所有这些都加起来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yes. If we had had **photographic documentation**, **video documentation** that was really intentionally done, it would have been so much easier. We could have started the conversation and the negotiations with our insurance company with that documentation. Instead, what we had to do was reach out to all of our friends and go through all of our photos and try to find as much of it as we could. We went through friends **Instagrams**. We went through deep dives of our photos. Really luckily, we had just gotten our dog the year before. And as any firsttime young puppy owner will tell you, you're taking videos of them all the time throughout your entire house. Oh, here's **Una** running away from the **Dyson vacuum V8 Absolute model**. Oh, there's Unona. She's turning the corner and she's right next to the air purifier. Like, we sent our insurance adjuster so many videos of our dog that by the end she actually remarked on it and was like, "Your dog is really cute and you've done a great job training her." the process of making the list and negotiating with insurance for payment. It looks different for everyone depending on what you lost and the insurance you have. But **Gregory** and **Mike** have both been surprised by just how long it can take. We're still in the process of working with our insurance to replace or be paid a certain amount with depreciation of what we lost, what we had to throw out due to contamination. And I will say that it's a **six figure amount**, which is crazy. It all adds up.

</details>

**发言人**: 他们建议对你的家进行**家庭视频导览**。从一个房间走到另一个房间时进行拍摄。打开每一个抽屉。打开每一个橱柜。对于重要物品，展示品牌或型号。不要忘记你的车库、阁楼或地下室。你希望这个视频成为你详尽的“倾倒所有物品”清单。人们应该多久记录一次他们的家呢？如果他们想为未来可能发生的不幸事件做准备，这是他们应该每年做的事情吗？还是每三年做一次？因为我认为人们会有意愿去做这件事，但这似乎是那种没有人想做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They recommend taking a **video walkrough** of your home. Film as you walk from room to room. Open every drawer. Open every cabinet. For important items, show the brand or model. Don't forget your garage, the attic, or the basement. You want the video to be your exhaustive, dump it all out list. How frequently should people be documenting their homes? If they're trying to prepare themselves for some unfortunate event that might happen in the future, is this something they should be doing annually? Is it something every 3 years? Because I mean I think people would have the intent to do this, but it seems like kind of something that nobody wants to do.

</details>

**发言人**: 在你搬家的时候做。你搬到一个新地方，你可能会拍一个视频，这样你的房东就知道它长什么样，你也可以向他们证明。在你搬家的时候做。在你发生重大人生事件的时候做。哦，我们结婚了。这是我们登记的所有物品。哦，一位父母去世了，现在我们必须整理他们所有的遗物。然后每隔几年做一次，你就会没事的。最后，今天就做。今天就做。只需要8分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Do it when you move. You're moving into a new place. You're probably going to take a video of it so that your landlord knows what it looks like and you can prove it to them. Do it when you move. Do it when you have a major life event. Oh, we got married. Here's everything on our registry. Oh, a parent passed away and now we're having to go through all of their possessions. And then do it once every couple years and you're going to be fine. And lastly, like do it today. Do it today. It'll take 8 minutes.

</details>

**发言人**: 不要忘记你的**重要文件**、照片、传家宝。拍摄或扫描你的身份证明和法律文件。确保如果你失去了对这些实物文件的访问权限，你仍然可以访问它们所包含的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Don't forget your **important documents**, photos, family heirlooms. Take photos or scan your identification and legal documents. make sure that if you were to lose access to these physical items, you could still access the information they hold.

</details>

**发言人**: 当你去银行说：“嘿，我需要一些现金来买杂货。”如果你没有证明你在这家银行有账户，那就很难了。要证明很多我们平时理所当然的事情变得非常非常困难，因为我们随时都可以访问它们。所以，拥有你生活的**数字化版本**，当你被问到时，你可以说所有这些关于我自己的事情都是真实的，因为在灾难中你会遇到很多意想不到的关于你是谁以及你的生活是什么的挑战。你只是假设他们会相信你的话，而那是一个非常不安全的假设。所以，拥有你生活中通常会有的东西的数字访问权限，就像给你一份小小的保险单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: When you go to the bank to say, "Hey, I need some cash just to get some groceries." If you you don't have proof that you bank with them, it's hard. It becomes very very difficult to prove a lot of things that we take for granted when we have just access to it all the time. So having a **digitized version** of your life that you can like say all these things are true about myself when you're asked of it because you run into so many challenges of who you are and what your life is in a disaster that you just didn't expect. You just assume I think that they will take your word for it and that's that's a very unsafe presumption you know. So having digital access to things that are normally part of your life like just gives you a little bit of an insurance policy.

</details>

### 房屋加固与保险激励

**发言人**: 除了记录你的物品，你现在还应该做另一件事。你可能不喜欢它。它可能要求你面对一些你最大的恐惧，但它可能会拯救你的家，甚至你的生命。我们将在休息后详细讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Beyond documenting your stuff, there's something else you should do now. You probably won't like it. It may require that you face some of your greatest fears, but it could save your home, if not your life. We'll talk more about that after the break.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。下面有一条小溪。如果你一直往上走，就会走到一个瀑布，那真的很美。现在是2025年12月，我正和**Rosie**和**Abigail**站在**Gregory**的后院。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. And down there is a creek. If you hike it all the way up, goes to a waterfall, which is really beautiful. It's December 2025, and I'm standing in **Gregory**'s backyard with **Rosie** and **Abigail**.

</details>

**发言人**: 真美。那里有餐桌区、串灯和两张躺椅，可以俯瞰山脉和下方城市令人难以置信的美景。**Gregory**说，他认为曾经遮挡住这片美景的六英尺高树篱，可能才是让他买下这栋房子的原因。没有人真正意识到树篱后面是什么。他搬进来的时候就把它们拆掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It's beautiful. There's a dining table area, string lights, and two lounge chairs overlooking an incredible view of the mountains and the city below. **Gregory** says he thinks the 6ft tall hedges that used to block this view might have been what actually got him the house. No one else realized quite what was behind them. He ripped them out when he moved in.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，你就是从那条路开上来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: So, you came up on that road right there.

</details>

**发言人**: 这是一个很好的观景点。那里那片光秃秃的地方，以前有几栋房子，我相信有**53栋房子**被烧毁了。所以火灾就停在那里了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And this is a good place to look out. That bare spot right there. There used to be several homes and those I believe **53 homes** burned. So that's where it stopped. The fire had stopped there.

</details>

**发言人**: 就在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Just right there.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。就像你现在看到的那片光秃秃的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah. Like right where that where you see like it's kind of bare now.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 那些房子在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Those homes up there.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>

**发言人**: **Gregory**转身朝向房子。房子的整个背面都是玻璃推拉门。五组，每组两扇门。你可以看到厨房和他的客厅。他的两只猫**Hani**和**Hobie**正在扒拉其中一块玻璃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Gregory** turns back towards the house. The entire back side of it is made of glass sliding doors. Five sets, two doors each. You can see into the kitchen, his living room. His two cats paw one of the panes of glass. that they There's our cats, **Hani** and **Hobie**.

**发言人**: 它们离开的时候有这么大。

**发言人**: 它们离开的时候有这么大，现在它们

**发言人**: 它们茁壮成长。

**发言人**: 是的，它们茁壮成长。是的。

**Speaker**: Yeah, they're thriving. Yeah. [laughter] Yeah.

**发言人**: 站起来。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Standing up.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 他指着房子侧墙与玻璃门相接的角落。但那个角落，就是那扇最后的窗户，是很多**悬浮颗粒物**进入的地方。但整个内部都有一条**烟灰**、**焦炭**、**灰烬**的痕迹。你一眼就能看到。它就像一条可乐线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: He points to the corner of the house where the sidewall meets the glass doors. But this is where a lot of the that corner right there uh that last window is where a lot of the **particulate matter** got into. But all across here inside was a line of **soot char ash**. You could just see it. It was like a a coke line of

</details>

**发言人**: 火灾对**Gregory**来说是一个巨大的冲击。它们颠覆了他的生活，但并非意料之外。在洛杉矶长大，我曾多次不得不撤离。我从不轻视山火。我非常像那种随时准备好**应急包**和应急物资的人。我准备好了背包。我预先考虑到了所有这些，明白这些火灾来得如此之快，比你想象的还要快。当他买房时，他考虑了该地区并评估了风险。它就在**国家森林**旁边。只有一条进出的道路。我知道如果我们要在这个社区买房，我们必须在很多方面做好准备。所以我有一种心态，最坏的情况会是什么？这种直面你所居住地区真正面临的风险的心态，是**Gregory**和**Mike**都说在火灾后的一年里让他们印象深刻的事情。虽然你当然无法真正为每一种可能的灾难做好准备，但你可以保持警惕并采取一些预防措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: the fires were a huge shock to **Gregory**. They upended his life, but they weren't a surprise. Growing up in Los Angeles, I had numerous occasions where we had to evacuate. I never took wildfire, you know, lightly. Um, I'm very much like somebody who has a **go bin**, emergency supplies ready to go. I have backpack ready to go. I have all this forethought in in understanding like these fires can come so quickly, faster than you think. When he bought his home, he considered the area and evaluated the risks. It was right by a **national forest**. There was only one road in and out. And I knew if we were going to buy into this neighborhood, we'd have to be ready in so many ways. And so I had a mind state, what's the worst thing that could happen? This mindset of confronting what you are really at risk for based on where you live is something that **Gregory** and **Mike** both said stuck out to them in the year after the fires. While you certainly can't truly prepare for the realities of every possible disaster, you can be aware and take some precautions.

</details>

**发言人**: **Gregory**搬进家后，投入了大量时间和金钱进行一项名为**房屋加固**的工程。这个术语意味着你让你的房屋及周围土地更能抵抗热量、火星和火灾。所以，你的房子着火的可能性基本上会降低。对**Gregory**来说，这意味着定期清理排水沟和院子里的灌木、树叶和松针，修剪离房子太近的树木，并用定制的**阻燃通风口**替换房屋周围的旧通风口。阻燃材料在受热时会膨胀，用于被动防火。**Gregory**的通风口有三层，包括一层在强热下会膨胀闭合的阻燃蜂窝层。我们参观他的房产时，他向我们展示了这些通风口。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: After **Gregory** moved into his home, he invested a lot of time and money into a process called **home hardening**. This term means you're making your home and the land around it more resistant to heat, embers, and fires. So, your house is basically less likely to catch fire. For Gregory, it meant regular cleanup of brush, leaves, and pine needles from his gutters and yard, trimming back trees that were too close to the house, and replacing old vents that surrounded his home with custom **intimac venting**. Inscent materials swell when exposed to heat and are used for passive fire protection. Gregory's vents have three layers, including an intent honeycomb layer that swells closed in the presence of intense heat. He showed them to us when we were walking around his property.

</details>

**发言人**: 但你可以看到**阻燃通风口**。这个通风口一直延伸过去。这就是我们花钱买的。这是三层

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But you can see the **intimac vent**. This vent that goes all across. This is what we paid for. This is the three layer

</details>

**发言人**: 三层

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: three layer

</details>

**发言人**: **阻燃通风口**。所以它是一个非常窄的过滤器。然后它会接触到一种阻燃材料，这种材料在**430摄氏度**的温度下会闭合，然后是另一层通风口。所以，这阻止了很多东西进入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **intimscent venting**. So it's a a very narrow filter. Then it goes to an intent material that will close off after **430° temperature** and then another layer of venting. So, this had prevented a lot of things from going in.

</details>

**发言人**: 无法得知**Gregory**所做的**房屋加固**是否阻止了他的房屋着火，但他确实相信他安装的通风口有助于阻止**悬浮颗粒物**和灰烬进入。没有升级通风口的邻居在他们的阁楼里看到了更多的灰烬。**Gregory**自掏腰包支付了这些升级费用。仅通风口就花费了他**7000多美元**。你为房屋所做的这些防火加固措施是否影响了你的**保险费**？它是否给你带来了某种折扣或什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: There's no way to know if the **home hardening** **Gregory** did prevented his home from catching fire, but he does believe that the vents he installed helped block **particulate matter** and ash from entering. Neighbors without upgraded vents saw more ash in their attics. Gregory paid for those upgrades out of pocket. The vents alone cost him over **$7,000**. Did any of this fire hardening you did for your home impact your **insurance premiums**? Did it give you any kind of like discount or anything?

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，我们当时以为那会有帮助，所以我们联系了我们的代理人，说：“嘿，我们安装了阻燃防火通风口。”代理人说：“是的，你会省下大约**7美元**。”我一直在思考这个问题。我不知道为什么保险公司不鼓励防火加固措施，因为从长远来看，这能为他们省钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yeah, you know, we thought that that would help and we contacted our agent and said, "Hey, we put in intscent fire resistant vents." The agent said, "Yeah, you you'll save about **$7**." [laughter] And I've been thinking about that. I don't know why the insurance aren't incentivizing fire hardening efforts because they save money in the the long term.

</details>

**发言人**: 尽管**Gregory**安装的通风口并未使其**保险费**大幅下降，但行业研究组织**保险信息协会**表示，房主可以通过其他升级获得更大的保费折扣。例如安装**抗冲击屋顶**，这种屋顶更能抵抗风力。**Gregory**说，他从这一切中得到的教训是，要现实一点，为你的房屋面临的风险做好准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Although **Gregory** didn't see a meaningful decrease in his premiums for the vents he installed, the **Insurance Information Institute**, an industry research group, says homeowners could see bigger premium discounts for other upgrades. Things like installing an **impact resistant roof**, which is more resistant to wind. **Gregory** says that his lesson in all of this is to be a realist and prepare your home for the risks it faces.

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为你必须以一种大多数人都不愿意的方式去观察。这真的很难，因为你只能准备你所知道的，而这来自于观察。我认为我与洛杉矶的很多人交谈过，即使他们知道有这些火灾发生，他们也没有做任何事情。这对我来说很疯狂，因为我不是在谈论那些经济状况不允许的人。他们只是不想去思考。而思考是第一步。**气候变化**将以某种方式影响我们所有人。但我认为，是的，仅仅是观察，知道什么时候情况不那么糟糕，可以让你为情况真正糟糕的时候做好准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I think you have to be observant in a way that most people are averse to. It's really tough because you can only prepare what you know and that comes from observation. I think a lot of people that I have spoken to in Los Angeles, even though they know that there's these all these fires that happen, they haven't done anything. And this is like crazy to me because they're and I'm not talking about people who are in an economic situation that like they can't afford to. They just don't want to think about it. And thinking about is the first step. **Climate change** is going to reach all of us in some way. But I think yeah, just observation, knowing when it's not so bad can prepare you for when it gets really bad.

</details>

### 理解房屋保险政策

**发言人**: 了解你的房屋及其面临的风险之所以重要，一个主要原因是这样你才能确保你的**房屋保险**政策在你面临这些风险时能够覆盖你。几乎所有的房屋保险政策都包含**火灾覆盖**，但根据你居住的地方，你可能需要额外的洪水、地震或其他灾害的覆盖。**Gregory**和**Mike**都说，当他们买房时，他们担心无法获得保险。这是因为过去几年主要保险公司一直在撤出**加州市场**，理由是成本飙升、无法承受的金融风险和州法规。事实上，就在火灾发生前一年，该地区数千名房主失去了保险。虽然有一些**州政府支持**的选项，但潜在的房主面临着艰难的选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: One of the major reasons why it's important to understand your home and risks it faces is so that you can make sure your **home insurance policy** covers you in the event that one of those risks actually happens. Nearly all home insurance policies include **fire coverage**, but depending on where you live, you may want additional coverage for floods, earthquakes, or other disasters. **Gregory** and **Mike** both said that when they bought their homes, they were concerned they wouldn't be able to get coverage. That's because major insurers have been pulling out of the **California market** over the past few years, citing soaring costs, untenable financial risk, and state regulations. In fact, thousands of homeowners in the area lost their coverage just the year before the fires. While there are some **state sponsored options**, potential homeowners are facing tough choices.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们的房地产经纪人总是非常坦诚地告诉我们，住在某些地区，我们很难获得保险或火灾保险，或者费用可能会更高，因为我们处于**高火灾风险区域**。甚至还有一张地图显示哪些是高火灾风险区域，哪些不是。我们看到了自己，我们处于**中等风险**，我们想：“哦，哇。也许这是其他人不愿意承担的风险，但如果这是我们能负担得起的，而且是我们愿意承担的风险，那也许意味着我们能买到房子。”我像大多数人一样思考灾难。哇，那发生在其他人身上真的很悲伤，但它永远不会发生在我身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Our realtor was always very upfront about how living in certain areas we would have trouble getting insurance or fire insurance or it might be more expensive because we were in **high fire risk areas** and there was even a map of what is high fire risk and what is not. We saw ourselves and we were **medium risk** and we thought, "Oh, wow. Well, maybe this is a risk that other people aren't willing to take, but if it's what we can afford and it's a risk we're willing to take, maybe that means we get a house." I thought about disasters like most people think about them. Wow, that's really sad that happened to those other people, but it's never going to happen to me.

</details>

**发言人**: **Mike**投保了。他有火灾保险，但他说，这基本上就是他对他的**房屋保险**政策所知道的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Mike** was insured. He had fire coverage, but that he says is basically all he knew about his **home insurance policy**.

</details>

**发言人**: 我知道我的抵押贷款机构需要一定金额的保险才能批准我们的贷款，但对我来说，它更像是汽车保险。哦，天哪，我怎么才能把我的月保费降到最低呢？我想我拿到保单的时候并没有读完整个政策。我只看了三四个数字。它们看起来足够了。我签了字，然后每月或每年支付。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: I knew my mortgage lender needed a certain amount of it in order to okay our loan, but to me, it was more like car insurance. Oh man, how can I get my monthly premium down as much as I can? I don't think I read my entire policy when I got it. I saw three or four numbers. They seemed like enough. I signed on the line and I paid every month or every year.

</details>

**发言人**: 当**Mike**与保险公司签订合同时，他收到了一份长达四十多页的文件。灾难发生后，我们做的第一件事就是把我们的整个保险政策输入到一个**人工智能聊天机器人**中，然后向它提问。**升级代码**和**重建设施**是什么意思？**景观修复**是什么意思？因为保险公司在确保万无一失方面做得很好，但其方式可能对每月支付保费的普通人来说是模糊不清的。我认为要求每个人都仔细阅读他们的保险政策要求太高了，但如果他们至少能理解它是什么以及他们同意了什么，那将是非常棒的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: When **Mike** signed his contract with the insurance company, he got a document that was 40 some odd pages long. After the catastrophe happened, one of the first things that we did was to take our entire insurance policy, drop it into an **AI chatbot**, and ask it questions. What does **upgrade code** and **rebuilding amenities** mean? What does **landscaping remediation** mean? Because again, the insurance company's doing a great job of crossing their tees and dotting their eyes, but in such a way that can be obfuscating to the average individual who's just paying a premium every month. I think it's too much to ask for everybody to read through their insurance policy, but it' be really great for them to at least understand what it is and what they're agreeing to.

</details>

**发言人**: **了解你的政策**。这是**Mike**和**Gregory**今天推荐的。阅读它，或者寻求帮助阅读它，这样如果你需要使用它，你就知道你有什么权利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Know your policy**. That's what **Mike** and **Gregory** recommend today. read it or get help reading it so that if you need to use it, you know what you're entitled to.

</details>

**发言人**: 这会让你有能力与你的保险公司会面，并要求你应得的、你所支付的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And that empowers you to meet with your insurer and demand exactly what you're owed, what you paid for.

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Mhm.

</details>

**发言人**: 灾后，**房屋保险**可以帮助你支付三项主要费用。第一项是**个人财产**，我们之前已经讨论过。这涵盖了你物品的成本。你的保单应该涵盖的第二项是**附加生活费用**（通常称为**ALE**），它通常涵盖你被安置的费用。所以，在你等待受损房屋变得可居住或被毁房屋重建期间，新公寓的租金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: There are three main things that **home insurance** can help you pay for after a disaster. One is **personal property**, which we talked about earlier. This covers the cost of your items. The second thing your policy should cover is **additional living expenses**, commonly called **AL**, which typically cover the cost of being displaced. So, rent money for a new apartment while you're waiting for your damaged home to be livable or your destroyed home to be rebuilt.

</details>

**发言人**: 你越了解你的保单中具体包含什么，就越好。但这非常难以做到。它非常难以解析，而且是故意设计成难以理解的。一旦你掌握了这些关键信息，你就可以说，我要求这个、这个、这个和那个。因为他们会玩“空壳游戏”，说，嗯，我不知道你是否真的需要那个。好吧，是的，我需要租金。我需要一个住的地方。这会让你向前迈进。每向前迈一步，都会让你离更好的境地更近一点。当你停滞不前或者感觉自己在倒退时，绝望就会开始袭来，因为你不知道该怎么做。所以，知道该怎么做以及该要求什么很重要。而这始于了解你的保单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The more you know what is exactly in your policy, and that is very difficult to do. It's very difficult to parse and it's intentionally difficult to understand. Once you have that information, key points, then you can say, I am demanding this, this, this, and that. Because they'll play the shell game of saying, well, I don't know if you really need that. Well, yeah, I need rent. I need somewhere to live. And that moves you forward. And every step forward brings you a little to a better place. When you're not moving or you you feel like you're regressing, that's where the hopelessness starts kicking in because you don't know what to do. So, knowing what to do and what to ask for is important. and and that starts from knowing your policy.

</details>

**发言人**: 你希望能够与你可能合作的保险理赔员使用相同的语言。你希望知道如何以他们无法拒绝的方式提出你的需求。你的**房屋保险**应该涵盖的第三件事是**房屋价值**本身。修复或重建受损或被毁结构的成本。这一个可能真的很难处理。我们首先谈谈修复受损房屋。这就是**Gregory**身上发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: You want to be able to speak the same language as the insurance adjusters you might be working with. You want to know how to ask for what you need in a way where they can't say no. The third thing your home insurance should cover is the **value of the home itself**. The cost to repair or rebuild a damaged or destroyed structure. This one can get really tricky. We'll talk about repairing a damaged home first. That's what happened to **Gregory**.

</details>

### 房屋修复与污染清除

**发言人**: 当**Gregory**最终在火灾后能够回到他的房产时，他的院子里覆盖着他之前描述的“盐和胡椒粉”般的灰尘。这不仅仅在他的院子里。风通过他房屋的裂缝和通风口吹入。这些灰尘聚集在他的玻璃门内，并且充满了**污染物**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: When **Gregory** was eventually able to come back to his property after the fires, his yard was covered in that salt and pepper dust he described earlier. It wasn't just in his yard. The wind pushed through the cracks and vents in his home. It's what collected inside his glass doors, and that dust was full of **pollutants**.

</details>

**发言人**: 火灾造成的污染一直是社区居民持续关注的问题。许多仍然屹立的房屋，即使经过大规模的室内清洁，仍被检测出**铅**和**石棉**呈阳性。**Gregory**觉得他的家不安全，无法搬回去，尤其因为他的妻子刚刚完成癌症治疗。他想进行**修复**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Pollution caused by the fires has been an ongoing concern for people in the neighborhood. Many still standing homes have tested positive for **lead** and **asbestos** even after extensive indoor cleanup. **Gregory** felt that his home was unsafe to move back into, especially because his wife had just finished cancer treatment. He wanted to go through **remediation**.

</details>

**发言人**: **修复**是将你的家，你的宜居空间，恢复到灾难发生前安全水平的过程，无论灾难对室内空间造成了什么影响。我总是告诉人们，如果他们看过电影**ET外星人**，其中政府特工封闭了那个家庭的房子，用塑料将其密封起来，这样没有人可以在不带入或带出污染物的情况下进出。这与我们看到的情况非常相似。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: **Remediation** is the process of bringing your home, your livable space back to safe levels prior to whatever disaster has affected the interior space. I always tell people if they've seen the movie **ET** and where they close off the family's home, the government agent comes and like seals it in plastic so nobody can get in and out without bringing contamination or bringing contamination out. That's very similar to what we saw.

</details>

**发言人**: 但为了让他的家得到修复，他必须证明它确实受到了污染且不适合居住。为此，他需要检测他房产上的土壤以及家中不同地方的**污染物**水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: But in order to have his home remediated, he had to prove that it was in fact contaminated and unsafe to live in. To do this, he needed to test the soil on his property and the pollutant levels in the different places in his home.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们专门检测了**烟灰**、**焦炭**、**灰烬**和**铅**。这些测试费用昂贵。我们自掏腰包支付了。所以我们的保险公司一开始说他们不会覆盖测试费用。这是一个很大的问题。这就是为什么很多人无法继续进行下去的原因，因为没有测试，你就无法获得修复或**铅清除修复**的保险覆盖。所以我们自掏腰包支付了**8000多美元**，请来了一位**认证工业卫生师**，他受过专业培训，能够正确地从你家各地采集样本，并检查污染水平并进行分析。然后我们反过来利用这些信息来告知修复团队和我们的保险公司，对他们进行反驳。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: We tested for **soot**, **char**, **ash**, and **lead** specifically. And those tests were expensive. We paid out of pocket. So our insurer at first said they would not cover testing. That was a big big problem. That's why a lot of people couldn't move forward was without testing you don't get remediation coverage for remediation or **lead abatement remediation**. So we paid over **$8,000** out of pocket to have a **certified industrial hygienist** come who is trained to properly take samples from across your home and look for contamination levels and break it down. And then you we use that in turn to inform the remediation team and our insurer to push back on them.

</details>

**发言人**: 你有没有报销过那笔自掏腰包的费用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Were you ever reimbursed for that out-of-pocket expense?

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，但那大约是六个月之后的事了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Yes, but it was approximately 6 months later.

</details>

**发言人**: 这就是**Gregory**希望他的**房屋保险**政策能有更明确语言来涵盖初始测试费用的那种事情。测试结果显示污染物水平不安全后，**Gregory**继续进行了**修复**。这个过程使他火灾后六个月都无法回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: That's the kind of thing that **Gregory** wishes he had clearer language about in his **home insurance policy** covering that initial testing. After the testing came back showing unsafe levels of contaminants, Gregory moved forward with **remediation**. This process is what kept him from returning home for 6 months after the fire.

</details>

**发言人**: 他们用塑料密封了房屋。所以窗户、门都密封了，然后他们进去，把他们认为被污染的、我们同意丢弃的东西放进塑料密封袋里，然后开始处理这些物品。一旦所有这些都被清除，他们就开始把你的物品堆成堆，然后可以单独清洗。所以小到你的书，都有被清洗过的记录。他们擦拭了你的家具。他们擦拭了你的地板。他们吸尘。他们运行这些工业级空气净化器来清洁室内空气。他们逐个房间地进行。然后你剩下的是一堆堆的东西。他们不会把东西放回去。嗯，而且它通过了，因为在修复之后，你必须进行**灾后修复测试**，即**清场测试**，以证明他们做得对。所以，我们非常幸运。我们的修复团队做得很好，我们能够顺利搬回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They sealed the home in plastic. So, the windows, the doors, then they go in and then they put the things that they feel like were contaminated and that we agreed to have thrown out, put in plastic sealed bags, and then they start disposing the items. Once all that is taken out, they start putting your items in piles that they can start cleaning individually. So things as small as your books had records that were were cleaned. They wiped down your furniture. They wiped down your floors. They vacuum. They run these industrial size air purifiers to clean the interior air. They're doing it room by room. And then what you're left with is just like piles of stuff. They don't put things back. Um, and it passed cuz after you have remediation, then you have to have **post remediation testing**, **clearance testing** to prove that they did the right job. So, we were very fortunate. Our remediation team did a good job and we were able to get it back in.

</details>

**发言人**: **Gregory**的一些邻居仍然没有回到自己的家中。也许他们无法承担必要的自费检测，或者无法获得保险覆盖。或者他们的检测结果需要更大范围的修复，这需要更多的钱。每个人的情况都不同。**保险**是大多数人在不需要时不会多想的事情，但现在听从**Mike**和**Gregory**的建议，可以为你省去未来许多大麻烦。**记录你的物品**，**数字化你的文件**，如果你面临某些自然灾害的风险，尝试相应地**调整你的房屋**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Some of **Gregory**'s neighbors are still not back in their homes. Maybe they couldn't afford the necessary testing out of pocket or couldn't get it covered by insurance. or maybe their results required remediation of a larger area which costs more money. Everyone's situation is different. **Insurance** is something most people don't think much about until they need it, but following **Mike** and **Gregory**'s advice now could save you major headaches in the future. **Document your stuff**, **digitize your documents**, and if you're at risk of certain natural disasters, try to **adjust your home** accordingly.

</details>

**发言人**: 也许最重要的是，**了解你的保险政策涵盖什么**。这可以帮助你确保在遇到像**Gregory**那样房屋受损但未被毁的情况时，你拥有所需的保险。它还可以帮助你了解你拥有多少保险，如果像**Mike**一样，你失去了整个家园并需要钱来重建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: And maybe most importantly, **understand what your insurance policy covers**. This can help make sure you have the coverage you need if you face a situation like **Gregory**'s where your home is damaged but not destroyed. It can also help you understand how much coverage you have if, like **Mike**, you lose your entire home and need money to replace it.

</details>

**发言人**: 你的损失得到了足够的赔偿吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Were you covered enough for your losses?

</details>

**发言人**: 没有。我不知道有谁的损失得到了完全的赔偿。不幸的是，**Mike**的保险政策不足以覆盖重建他房屋的全部成本。下次我们将更深入地探讨为什么会这样，以及为什么许多美国人可能在不知不觉中也面临同样的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: No. And I don't know anybody who's been fully covered to the extent of their losses. Unfortunately, **Mike**'s insurance policy is not enough to cover the full cost of replacing his home. We're going to talk more about why that is and why many Americans may be in the same situation without even realizing it next time.

</details>

**发言人**: 如果你今天给自己写一封信，写给两年前的自己，关于保险，你会对自己说什么主要的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: If you were to write yourself a letter today to yourself from 2 years ago about insurance, what would be the main things that you would say to yourself?

</details>
