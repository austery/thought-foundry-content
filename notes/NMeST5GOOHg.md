### 市场收盘与全球同步直播

And right now we are 2 minutes away from
the end of the trading day.
Romaine Bostick here with Katie Greifeld
taking you through to that closing bell
with a global simulcast.
We're joined right now by Norah Melindo
and Christine Aquino in today for Carol
Massar.
And Tim Stenovec taking a well-deserved
short week here as we welcome our
audiences across all of our Bloomberg
platforms, our partnership with you to
peer guys on what's going to be another
record setting day for U.S.
equities, another record day for U.S.
equities, really even seeing green
across the screen.
That's all Christine and I have been
talking about all day today as we're
sitting in for Carol and Tim, who are
out headed to the screen time conference
here.

现在距离交易日结束还有2分钟。
我是 Romaine Bostick，和 Katie Greifeld 一起带您进入收盘的全球同步直播。
现在加入我们的是 Norah Melindo 和 Christine Aquino，她们今天代替 Carol Massar。
Tim Stenovec 正在享受他当之无愧的短周，我们欢迎了来自我们所有彭博平台观众的加入，与您合作，共同关注美国股市又一个创纪录的一天，美国股市又一个创纪录的一天，屏幕上几乎一片绿色。
这正是我和 Christine 今天一直在谈论的，我们今天代替 Carol 和 Tim，他们将参加屏幕时间会议。

### 科技股引领市场反弹

But it's really tech stocks that are
continuing to propel these indexes
higher heading into this year.
You know, there was a bit of uncertainty
and there still remains uncertainty
here, but you are still seeing a sense
of bullishness dip buyers coming out
into the market and a lot of people
pouring some money into stocks.

但真的是科技股在推动这些指数在今年一路走高。
你知道，曾经存在一些不确定性，现在仍然存在不确定性，但你仍然看到一种看涨情绪，买家涌入市场，很多人将资金投入股市。

### 美联储会议纪要与通胀担忧

Yeah, absolutely, Norah.
But of course, we can't forget about the
Federal Reserve and we did hear from
them as well regarding their September
meeting.
A lot of focus on inflation risks.
You know, the actual meeting itself, the
Jerome Powell press conference, a lot of
focus then on the risks to the labor
market but seems like at this point
maybe officials pushing pushing back a
little bit on the other side of their
mandate, talking about the potential
upside to inflation and what they're
potentially going to be looking at doing
from here in terms of rates.
Yeah, absolutely.
You have to wonder how much room they
have to actually cut rates if, of
course, inflation is pressured higher
here.
But at least for today, no one's really
concerned about it.
It's all about big tech.

是的，绝对的，Norah。
但我们当然不能忘记美联储，我们也听到了他们关于九月份会议的消息。
很多关注点都在通胀风险上。
你知道，会议本身，杰罗姆·鲍威尔的新闻发布会，当时很多人关注的是劳动力市场的风险，但似乎 at this point，官员们可能在朝着他们职责的另一面稍作推迟，谈论通胀的潜在上行以及他们未来在利率方面可能采取的措施。
是的，绝对的。
你不得不怀疑，如果通胀受到更大压力，他们实际上还有多少降息的空间。
但至少今天，没有人真正关心这个问题。
一切都与大型科技股有关。

### 市场情绪与数据发布

Ramy.
Yeah, I would like to forget about the
fact that
they came out with minutes today and of
course they have some data coming next
week that probably is about that time
because of the government shutdown.
And that basically leaves the market
left to its own devices, at least until
earnings season picks up here on this
Wednesday afternoon.

Ramy。
是的，我想忽略这样一个事实：
他们今天公布了会议纪要，当然下周他们还有一些数据要发布，可能因为政府关门而推迟。
这基本上让市场自行发展，至少要等到本周三下午财报季开始。

### 主要股指表现

You are seeing green more or less across
the screen.
The S&P 500 decidedly in record
territory, 6753 unchanged as we wait for
these numbers to settle up about 39
points to 6/10 of 1%.
The Nasdaq composite adding more than
200.0% on the day, a 300 point gain for
the Nasdaq, 100% on the day, both at
record highs.
It looks like the Dow Jones Industrial
Average is going to close, basically
unchanged on the day.
And the Russell 2000 participating in
the action as well.
A gain of about 26 points here on the
day 1% and just about four points shy of
its most recent record high.

您基本上看到屏幕上是一片绿色。
标准普尔 500 指数稳稳地处于历史纪录区域，6753 点，我们正等待这些数字稳定下来，上涨约 39 点，涨幅为 6/10 of 1%。
纳斯达克综合指数当天上涨超过 200.0%，纳斯达克指数上涨 300 点，当天上涨 100%，两者均创下历史新高。
道琼斯工业平均指数看起来将基本持平收盘。
罗素 2000 指数也参与了这一行情。
当天上涨约 26 点，涨幅 1%，距离其最近的历史高点仅差约四点。

### 标普 500 成份股涨跌分布

And digging a bit deeper into where a
lot of these stocks landed here,
particularly in the S&P 500, we've got
about 263 that settled up in the green,
237 down here, only three unchanged.

深入研究一下这些股票的涨跌情况，特别是在标普 500 指数中，我们有大约 263 只股票收盘上涨，237 只下跌，只有三只持平。

### 板块表现分析

All right, it's circle time.
Let's take a look at the sectors right
now.
More of this, a possible arrow or what
is it?
Also, do go overboard.
It's a snake that eats itself.
Not well.
Maybe it is what you're seeing today, at
least when it comes to the tech sector.
But that's what's outperforming tech up
one and a half.
And what is also bingo is that's
something I think that has to do with me
and like maybe eating the marrow out of
a bone.
But industrials also had a great day,
remains the best performing sector on
the day.
What didn't do to hot financials.
That was your biggest loss leader, at
least from a points basis.
We know that big bank earnings kickoff
pretty soon.
Consumer staples, energy and real estate
also falling.

好了，现在是“圆圈时间”。
让我们来看看现在的板块。
更多的是，一个可能的箭头，或者是什么？
另外，还可能过度。
这是一条蛇在吃自己。
不太好。
也许这就是你今天看到的，至少在科技领域是这样。
但科技股上涨了一个半百分点，表现最好。
而“宾果”也令人惊讶，我认为这与我有关，就像啃骨头里的精华一样。
但工业股今天也表现出色，仍然是当天表现最好的板块。
表现不佳的是金融股。
至少从点数来看，那是你的最大亏损者。
我们知道大型银行的财报季很快就要开始了。
消费必需品、能源和房地产板块也在下跌。

### 收益季展望

And we just heard from Betsy Graseck
over at Morgan Stanley.
She's actually pretty bullish about this
earnings season for the big time.
She told us to buckle up.
She did.
I'm buckled.
What's next?

我们刚刚听取了摩根士丹利 (Morgan Stanley) 的 Betsy Graseck 的意见。
她对这个重要财报季相当看好。
她告诉我们要系好安全带。
她做到了。
我已系好。
接下来呢？

### 标普 500 涨幅榜：AST Space Mobile 获Verizon合作

Let's take a look at some of the gainers
that we saw in the S&P 500, a few of
them to look at AST Space Mobile.
This is a company that really spends a
lot of its time in space.
It actually has strong competition here
with Space X, there's StarLink there.
So we did see shares climbing earlier
for double digit gains, but closing
about 8% higher at the closing bell.
This is after the company signed an
agreement with Verizon here to provide
direct to cellular connectivity when
needed for customers starting next year.
So we had William Blair saying that this
is really a competitive deal here for
Verizon, specifically over space X's,
StarLink here.
So one to definitely follow.

让我们来看看标普 500 指数中的一些上涨个股，其中有几只是 AST Space Mobile。
这是一家公司，它的大部分时间都花在太空领域。
它在这里与 SpaceX 展开了激烈竞争，那里有 StarLink。
因此，我们看到该股早盘上涨了两位数，但在收盘时上涨了约 8%。
在此之前，该公司与 Verizon 签署了一项协议，从明年开始为客户提供按需直连蜂窝网络的服务。
因此，William Blair 表示，这对 Verizon 来说是一笔非常有竞争力的交易，特别是在 SpaceX 的 StarLink 之上。
所以这是一只值得关注的股票。

### AMD 受OpenAI巨额投资提振，股价飙升

But of course, as we've been talking so
much about, I cannot stop talking about
that story here.
Shares of AMD also in Focus, up 11%
today.
I mean, this has been a company that
we've been talking about quite some
time, as you think about it, with the
likes of Nvidia and a few of its other
peers.
But the news today, of course, in video
agreeing to invest as much as 00
billion in openai to fund a data center
buildout.
So of course, that's really the broader
scope here.
But this opening striking a deal with
NVIDIA rival AMD to deploy tens of
billions of dollars worth of chips here,
Openai is poised to become one of AMD's
largest shareholders, really seeing a
boost to the stock here.

但当然，正如我们一直在谈论的，我无法停止谈论这个故事。
AMD 的股票也备受关注，今天上涨了 11%。
我的意思是，这是一家我们谈论了很长时间的公司，当你想到英伟达 (Nvidia) 和它的一些同行时。
但今天的新闻，当然是关于英伟达同意向 OpenAI 投资高达 1000 亿美元，以资助数据中心的建设。
所以，当然，这确实是更广泛的背景。
但这次 OpenAI 与英伟达的竞争对手 AMD 达成协议，部署价值数百亿美元的芯片，OpenAI 有望成为 AMD 的最大股东之一，这确实提振了 AMD 的股价。

### Beauty 获摩根士丹利上调目标价

And lastly, let's look at the beauty
space.
I'm looking at shares of beauty right
now.
Shares ended about 3% higher at the
closing bell.
It actually got a price target lift at
Morgan Stanley.
The analyst over there is really
pointing.
Toward a very strong launch for its road
brand.
It's a foray.
I don't know if you guys are familiar.
That's Hailey Bieber.
Her makeup brand is called Road.
Apparently, they had a very strong
launch at the Sephora store is here.
So you are seeing a lift as Morgan
Stanley is pushing their price target up
to a street high.
We're actually well versed in makeup.
Okay.
Yeah.
There you.
We are.
We are.
We are.

最后，让我们来看看美妆领域。
我现在正在关注美妆公司的股票。
收盘时，该股上涨了约 3%。
它实际上获得了摩根士丹利的价格目标上调。
那里的分析师确实在指出。
在其 Road 品牌有一个非常成功的推出。
这是一个尝试。
我不知道你们是否熟悉。
那是 Hailey Bieber。
她的化妆品牌叫 Road。
显然，他们在丝芙兰 (Sephora) 的门店取得了非常成功的推出。
因此，您看到了股价上涨，因为摩根士丹利将其目标价推至了市场最高水平。
我们其实很懂化妆品。
好的。
是的。
你看。
我们是。
我们是。
我们是。

### 费埃萨克 (FICO) 受竞争对手挤压股价下跌

All right, Decliners.
What's up?
Well, it's green is green, Katie, but
there are a few stocks that fell today.
One of them is fair.
Isaac, you and I probably know that more
commonly as FICO and is falling not
because of news specific to Pfizer
itself, but because of news from its
competitor, Equifax, saying that it will
offer its Vantagescore 4.0 service to
mortgage credit scores at $4.50 through
the end of 2027.
Remember last week, FICO said that it
will sell credit scores directly to
mortgage resellers and Equifax, saying
that its move is a direct response to
what FICO is doing there.
So it's a little bit of a tussle between
credit score provider is a very
interesting space there.
But certainly FICO taking the brunt of
that pain from that news today.

好了，下跌的股票。
怎么了？
好吧，凯蒂，一切都是绿色的，但今天有几只股票下跌了。
其中之一是 FICO（费埃萨克）。
你我可能更熟悉它，叫 FICO，它下跌不是因为辉瑞 (Pfizer) 本身的消息，而是因为它的竞争对手 Equifax 的消息，Equifax 称其将以 4.50 美元的价格向抵押贷款信用评分提供其 Vantagescore 4.0 服务，直至 2027 年底。
还记得上周，FICO 说它将直接向抵押贷款经销商出售信用评分，而 Equifax 则表示其举动是对 FICO 所做事情的直接回应。
所以，这在信用评分提供商之间有点小小的争斗，这是一个非常有趣的市场。
但 FICO 今天无疑承受了这一消息的冲击。

### 华纳兄弟探索公司因潜在收购谈判股价下滑

Another decliner, too, I want to pay
attention to today is, of course, Warner
Brothers.
Those shares down after we did get news,
people familiar was saying that
Paramount Skydance has discussed its
interest in acquiring Warner Brothers
and Discovery with legendary
entertainment and Apollo Global
management.
Now, the talks seem to be related
specifically to Legendary's investment
in some key film franchises.
Ever heard of Dune or Godzilla?
So these are some of the as is are
potentially being discussed here.
And the bottom line is this looks like
is this going to be another delay to
this potential acquisition?
They were hoping to get this done before
the Warner Brothers split in early 2026,
but another roadblock.
And have you actually seen Dune,
Christine?
I saw it in theaters.
Oh, really?
You liked it?
I mean, it's interesting.
I it's not my cup of tea necessarily.
So wouldn't watch it again.
Yeah, no, I wouldn't watch it again.
I may have fallen asleep in the middle
of it.
Oh, I actually did fall asleep in
theaters during Dune two, but that's
because we went to a midnight showing.
And, you know, that's a young man's
game, but great movie.
Well, there you go.
Yeah.
How about that bond market, though?

另一只下跌的股票，我也想提请大家注意，当然是华纳兄弟探索公司。
在有消息传出后，该公司股价下跌，知情人士称派拉蒙 (Paramount) Skydance 已与传奇影业 (Legendary Entertainment) 和阿波罗全球管理公司 (Apollo Global Management) 讨论了收购华纳兄弟探索公司 (Warner Brothers Discovery) 的意向。
现在，这些谈判似乎专门与传奇影业在一些关键电影系列中的投资有关。
你听说过《沙丘》或《哥斯拉》吗？
所以这些是正在讨论中的一些事情。
底线是，这看起来像是对这次潜在收购的又一次拖延吗？
他们本来希望在 2026 年初华纳兄弟拆分之前完成这项交易，但又出现了另一个障碍。
你真的看过《沙丘》吗，Christine？
我在电影院看的。
哦，真的吗？
你喜欢吗？
我的意思是，它很有趣。
它不一定是我喜欢的类型。
所以不会再看了。
是的，不，我不会再看了。
我可能在看的时候睡着了。
哦，我实际上在电影院看《沙丘2》时睡着了，那是因为我们去看了午夜场。
你知道，那是年轻人的游戏，但电影很棒。
好吧，就这样吧。
是的。
那债券市场呢？

### 债券市场动态

Yeah, How about that bond market?
Well, not a whole lot.
I mean, I don't know if you heard Katie
Greifeld, but there was a tail on the
most recent ten year auction here.
Actually, in all seriousness, though,
you don't really seeing a whole lot of
activity, a little bit of activity on
the longer end of the curve.
But that was mostly selling, pushing
yields higher by about two basis points,
a very, very modest bid on the long end
of the curve with that 30 year yield
just down less than a basis point.

是的，那债券市场怎么样？
嗯，没什么大动静。
我的意思是，我不知道你是否听说了 Katie Greifeld，但最近的十年期国债拍卖有点“尾部”。
事实上，说真的，你并没有看到太多活跃的交易，在收益率曲线的长端有一点点活跃。
但那主要是抛售，将收益率推高了约两个基点，在收益率曲线的长端有一个非常非常温和的买盘，30 年期国债收益率仅下跌不到一个基点。

### 拉瓜迪亚机场因数据中断航班延误

All right, guys, let's get to it.
The most important news of the day right
now.
I'm going to catch a flight in a minute.
Am I going to be able to get on it?
I mean.
Well, depends on the airport.
You're going to remain because what
Christine, I've been looking at
throughout the day, this news coming in
that LaGuardia Airport flights are being
temporarily halted, this due to a data
outage.
And it's just really interesting because
what throwback to was in Newark earlier
this year that was experiencing some
issues.
Yeah, there's always some sort of issue
here.
It just flights into the airport were
held at their origin until 4 p.m.
while departures were delayed by as much
as 45 minutes, which of course, you
know, not terrible.
But I mean if you're looking for to
catch your flight in, you're in a pinch
here.
This is not great news for those who are
trying to get through the airport.
Right, Christine?
To the new LaGuardia.
Yeah, they've actually redesigned it.
So it's actually you know, if you are
delayed, it's not like the end of the
world.
Right.
I mean, I was going to say I was
actually delayed for 6 hours there.
Oh, well, you know.
Yeah.
Because, you know, I was looking at the
fountain.
You can get cheesecake in a bag.
Did you go to a lounge?
Drinks.
I could have gone to the lounge, but,
you know, we just hung out by the
fountain and there you go.
You the past 6 hours of your time, if
you have to.
Certainly worse ways to spend 6 hours.

好了，各位，让我们开始吧。
今天最重要的消息是。
我马上要赶飞机了。
我能赶上飞机吗？
我的意思是。
嗯，这取决于机场。
你会留在这里，因为 Christine，我今天一直在关注的消息是，拉瓜迪亚机场 (LaGuardia Airport) 的航班正被暂时停飞，这是由于数据中断。
这真的很有趣，因为今年早些时候纽瓦克机场 (Newark) 也发生过类似的问题。
是的，这里总会有一些问题。
直到下午 4 点，飞往机场的航班才在始发地被叫停，而离港航班延误长达 45 分钟，当然，这不算糟糕。
但我的意思是，如果你想赶飞机，你可能会遇到麻烦。
这对那些要通过机场的人来说不是个好消息。
对吧，Christine？
去了新的拉瓜迪亚。
是的，他们实际上重新设计了它。
所以实际上，你知道，如果你被延误了，也不是世界末日。
对吧。
我的意思是，我要说的是，我实际上在那里被延误了 6 个小时。
哦，好吧，你知道。
是的。
因为，你知道，我当时在看喷泉。
你可以买到袋装的芝士蛋糕。
你去休息室了吗？
喝的。
我可以去休息室，但是，你知道，我们就坐在喷泉边，就这样。
你度过了你过去的 6 个小时，如果你不得不这么做。
当然有比这更糟糕的打发 6 个小时的方式。

### Poly Market CEO 成为最年轻白手起家亿万富翁

Let's also circle back to one of the
most read stories of the day.
This about the poly market CEO.
If you didn't know his name prior to
this week, you betcha.
He didn't fly commercial.
No, his name is Shane Coplan.
And Bloomberg News crunched the numbers.
Apparently on the Bloomberg billionaires
list.
He is the youngest self-made
billionaire.
This comes after that ice investment
yesterday into poly market, $2 billion,
valuing poly market term of the Internet
Intercontinental Exchange, right?
Yeah, right, right, right.
Yeah.
People keep pointing that out to me when
I say ice.
But anyway, ICE investing $2 billion in
poly market, bringing its valuation to a
whopping $8 billion, a stunning amount.
But it's made Shane Kaplan a very
wealthy man.
Absolutely.
Here.
One of the most read stories on the day
here.

让我们也回顾一下今天阅读量最多的新闻之一。
这是关于 Poly Market 的首席执行官。
如果你在本周之前不知道他的名字，那你肯定知道了。
他没有乘坐商业航班。
不，他的名字叫 Shane Coplan。
彭博社 (Bloomberg News) 进行了数字统计。
据彭博亿万富翁指数显示。
他是最年轻的白手起家亿万富翁。
这 comes after ICE 昨天向 Poly Market 投资了 20 亿美元，Intercontinental Exchange（洲际交易所）对 Poly Market 的估值为，对吧？
是的，对，对，对。
是的。
当我提到 ICE 时，人们总会指出这一点。
但总之，ICE 向 Poly Market 投资了 20 亿美元，使其估值飙升至惊人的 80 亿美元。
但这让 Shane Kaplan 成为了一个非常富有的人。
绝对的。
这里。
今天阅读量最多的新闻之一。
