### 市场开盘与近期动态

大家早上好，欢迎回到“市场开盘”节目。今天是12月11日星期四，我们正在直播。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Thursday, December 11th.</p>
</details>

我今天在一个不同的地方直播，因为我的公寓又停电了，这是第三次了，我为房租付了太多钱，不应该发生这种事。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am in a little bit of a different setting. Um, I know it looks like I'm in some random room in someone's basement, and that's because I am back in the mom's basement. Dude, I'm trying to get back to being that kid with that uh underdog mentality. I just needed to get back there. No, the apartment once again is doing some I pay way too much in rent for this to be happening for the third time.</p>
</details>

这次停电是因为整栋楼要更换新的发电机，他们说这是最后一次，但需要停电八小时，几乎每个楼层都受影响。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's like some some they're they're moving on to a new generator for the entire building and they said this is the last time they have to do it, but it's uh it's requiring eight hours of no power for like pretty much every single floor.</p>
</details>

我昨晚看到邮件时简直不敢相信，但节目还得继续。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was just I got I saw the email last night and I was like, goodness gracious, bro. All right. Well, show's got to go on. Show has got to go on.</p>
</details>

我怀疑是新泽西的数据中心，比如Nebius在新泽西购买的土地占用了所有能源，虽然我希望数据中心股票上涨，但这确实很烦人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we came back, but we will be live from here uh for the morning and for the afternoon. I hope this is the last time. This has happened two times. And I'm just like I think my conspiracy theory is that these freaking data centers in New Jersey, you know, Nebus bought some land in New Jersey that is taking up all the energy. And I'm like, I get it because I want my stocks to go up in the data center space, but goodness, it's annoying. So hopefully this is the last time.</p>
</details>

### 甲骨文财报与市场震荡

我们有很多事情要谈，甲骨文（Oracle）昨天的财报是个大事件。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, we are live. We got a lot to talk about. Oracle earnings big deal yesterday.</p>
</details>

我们将讨论甲骨文和Adobe的财报，这两家都是AI领域的大公司，其中甲骨文在市场认知上显然是最大的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we will talk about what happened with Oracle and where it went from there along with Adobe earnings. Two big companies in the AI space. Oracle obviously being the biggest one in terms of market perception.</p>
</details>

美联储主席鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）也召开了联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee: 美联储的货币政策决策机构）会议，我们将讨论会议结果。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You also had JPAL that had the FOMC meeting. We will discuss what happened with JPAL.</p>
</details>

鲍威尔的言论总体上是**鸽派**（Dovish: 主张宽松货币政策）的，我们将探讨原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, overall, it was doubbish and we'll talk about why I thought it was doubbish.</p>
</details>

不幸的是，市场昨晚开始下跌，甲骨文股价下跌13%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unfortunately, and I don't know why exactly, the markets are red right here and why they started puking last night. Oracle, as you can see right here, down 13% uh 193 and and Oracle, I can understand why it's red, and we'll we'll discuss why.</p>
</details>

我不明白为什么甲骨文要拖累整个市场，这似乎是昨晚开始发生的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know why Oracle has to take the rest of the market down with it, which it seems like started happening late last night.</p>
</details>

这不是因为10年期债券、日本债券或任何宏观事件，我真的认为昨晚东部时间8、9点左右，甲骨文开始受到更严重的打击，然后一切都跟着下跌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was not the 10-year bond. It was not Japanese bonds. It was not some random macro event. It was not yen carry trade. I really think at around 8, 900 pm Eastern last night, Oracle started just getting hit a little harder and then you saw everything.</p>
</details>

Coreweave下跌4%，英伟达（Nvidia）下跌2%，Nebius下跌3%，所有数据中心相关的股票都和甲骨文一起受到冲击。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coreweave down 4%. Nvidia down 2%. Nebus down 3%. All the data center plays along with uh Oracle are getting hit.</p>
</details>

博通（Broadcom）今天有财报，下跌1.3%；标普500（S&P 500）下跌0.3%；Palantir下跌1.4%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Broadcom which has earnings today that's down 1.3%. S&P down.3%. Palunteer down 1.4 for not downside reversing a lot of the Rocket Lab was pushing 59 was very exciting for a lot of the market.</p>
</details>

看起来甲骨文拖累了所有这些股票，我认为这没有道理。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems like Oracle decided to take all that down which I don't think is warranted but nonetheless when the market opens today we're going to see how how they actually interpret what happened with Oracle.</p>
</details>

市场原本预期鲍威尔会发表**鹰派**（Hawkish: 主张紧缩货币政策）言论，因此市场已经消化了看跌情绪。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone was expecting a hawkish cut and so it was kind of baked in to be bearish.</p>
</details>

但我们最终得到了鸽派降息，这彻底改变了市场对美联储想法的预期，这本应非常令人兴奋，但不幸的是，甲骨文又把一切都搞砸了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We ended up getting a dovish cut and that dovish cut completely changed the trajectory of how the market was thinking about it which I thought was also very exciting and then unfortunately Oracle came back and ended up messing up everything.</p>
</details>

我不确定这是否足以破坏“圣诞老人行情”（Santa Claus rally: 指每年年底股市通常会出现上涨的现象），但我不愿意现在持有甲骨文的股票。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if that's enough to destroy or make you know make the Santa Claus rally not be a thing. I guess we'll find out, but I I I wouldn't be excited to be owning Oracle stock right now, just from a perceptive perspective.</p>
</details>

甲骨文几周前在185美元触底，现在是否会回到170美元、160美元？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, again, Oracle, I mean, I don't know. Is this this thing bottomed at 185 a couple weeks ago? Is this really going back to 170, 160?</p>
</details>

“解放日”的低点是120美元，它已经从350美元下跌了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Liberation Day lows were 120. So, it's already down from 350.</p>
</details>

也许它从未值得350美元，但我不认为它应该再受到如此大的打击，因为财报本身还算不错，只是债务方面有些问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe never deserved to be up at 350, but still I don't know if it really has to get hit that much further because the earnings were decent except there were certain elements of their debt that were not the best that we'll talk about.</p>
</details>

所有数据中心相关的股票都受到了甲骨文下跌13%的影响。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cor right there down about 5%. I ran down 2%. Neb is down 3%. All the data center names basically getting hit with Mr. Oracle as that one is down 13%.</p>
</details>

### 鲍威尔的鸽派言论

让我们从鲍威尔开始，我认为这是最重要的事情，它为所有后续事件奠定了基础。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get into it. Thank you everybody for being here. Let's start up with JPAL because I think this was the most important thing and I think this kind of frames everything that played out.</p>
</details>

鲍威尔昨天的言论让我大跌眼镜，他说了些相对**看涨**（Bullish: 预期价格上涨）的话，这是我们没有预料到的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this was the clip that when JPAL said this yesterday. There's two clips. I'm going to play this one right here. Um my jaw dropped to the floor. I think a lot of you guys saw me live. Uh because I was like, "Wait a second." He just said something relatively bullish, something that we didn't expect him to say.</p>
</details>

这影响了市场对美联储通胀前景的看法。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it kind of framed how the market was thinking about the Fed's perspective on inflation.</p>
</details>

九人投票支持降息，一人投票支持降息50个**基点**（Bips: Basis points: 衡量利率或收益率变化的单位，1个基点=0.01%），九人投票支持降息25个基点，两人投票不降息。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nine people voted for a cut. One person voted for 50 bips, nine people voted for 25 bips, and two people voted for no cuts at all.</p>
</details>

鲍威尔表示，关税引起的通胀需要几个月才能完全生效，但一旦生效，这只是一次性价格上涨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To ask you, um the inflation expectations uh has has come down in your SCP report. Um do you see the tariff price increases as passing through in the next three months? Is it a six-month process that we're looking for that to end? And then because of that, is jobs the threat to the economy? So with with tariff inflation, you know, it takes there's the announcement of a tariff and then there's, you know, they start to take effect and then it takes some months. Goods may have to be shipped from other parts of the, you know, it may take, you know, quite a while for an individual tariff to take its full effect. But once it's had that effect, then the question is, isn't that just a one-time price increase?</p>
</details>

他认为，如果没有新的关税，商品通胀应该在明年第一季度左右见顶。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we've actually we actually look at all of the announcements and and and and what you get from all that you see sort of a for each one of them there's a time period and then then it's fully in. So if there are no new tariff announcements and we don't know that but let's assume there are no major new tariff announcements inflation from goods uh should peak in the first quarter or so right roughly you know we haven't been able he's saying inflation shouldn't be an issue next year.</p>
</details>

这与市场普遍预期他会说相反的话形成对比，他实际上是说通胀明年不应该成为问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone thought the consensus view that he would say the opposite even I was like all right J Pal's going to be like hey we give you your cut but inflation is rising so don't expect one in January don't expect one in April now the chances for an April cut are actually 40%.</p>
</details>

鲍威尔的鸽派态度表明，劳动力市场正在下降，但通胀并没有像人们预期的那样急剧上升。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which means you had pal go rather dovish on the idea that yes the labor market is declining but also inflation is not necessarily picking up as aggressively as people thought to predict this with any precision.</p>
</details>

他表示，通胀峰值应该在明年第一季度左右，之后应该不会有大的问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No one is but call it the first quarter or or so of next year should be the peak and from here it should be it shouldn't be big. It should be a couple ten or or even less than that. We don't really have precision on this but and after that again if there are no new tariffs that that are being announced that will take 9 months to get fully in 9 months is also an estimate um then you should start to see that coming down in the back half of next year.</p>
</details>

鲍威尔继续表示，通胀正在下降，关税可能不会使经济过热。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So he goes on to say that inflation is coming in lower tariffs may not be running the economy hot.</p>
</details>

他还暗示，如果不是关税问题，通胀已经降到2%了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He also then went on to say that if inflation or if tariffs weren't an issue we would already have inflation down at 2%. um which is basically him implying, hey, like tariffs are the only reason we're in this situation.</p>
</details>

他认为关税影响将在第一季度见顶，并强调通胀不应是最大的问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then as you can see in the clip, he said tariffs should peak in Q1. He doesn't know that for sure. Maybe we have more tariffs, maybe we don't. Maybe we have significantly less tariffs because of the Supreme Court decision. But at its core, he's making the argument that inflation should not be the largest issue.</p>
</details>

因此，债券市场收益率下降，这表明信贷市场相信鲍威尔的判断，并支持降息计划。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the bond market, which you know, yields were spiking in the morning last yesterday at at 4.2, yields are down, at least on the tenure and on the Japanese tenure. 4.125. I mean, it's the lowest it's been in the past uh week. And the tenure yield also coming down for Japanese bonds. So, it's not like the credit market is screaming that they don't believe the easiest way for the credit mark to say we don't believe PAL and we think inflation is going to be an issue and we think they shouldn't be cutting rates because if they're cutting rates, then the yield they're getting on the uh bond would also hypothetically go down. which means, you know, like the credit market would be selling off those bonds to give a signal to the Fed that we want a higher rate or we want you to control inflation for you to get our money in the bond market. But the fact that they're buying bonds says the opposite, says they're going along with the plan.</p>
</details>

所有迹象都预示着一个不错的“圣诞老人行情”，这很大程度上取决于鲍威尔的鸽派立场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like anything you could possibly imagine for uh the the sort of setup for a really nice Santa Claus rally, which was very contingent on JPAL being doubbish.</p>
</details>

我们都预计他会是鹰派，所以我们只希望能降息。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think all of us expected him to be hawkish. So, we were all like, "All right, at least we'll get the cut and we'll figure out what happens later, but like we just need to get the cut."</p>
</details>

我们不仅得到了降息，还得到了一个支持降息的美联储主席，这完全出乎市场意料。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">We got the cut, but then we got a supportive Fed president into the cut, which I just think wasn't priced in, quite frankly.</p>
</details>

标普500指数一度距离历史新高仅差30到50美分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we saw that the S&P 500 got within 30 cents of an alltime high or like 40 50 cents of an all-time high.</p>
</details>

从这个角度看，昨天发生的一切非常令人兴奋，但随后甲骨文的财报却搅乱了局面。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, when you think of it from that perspective, it's very exciting to see what happened yesterday. But then came Oracle.</p>
</details>

我不认为甲骨文的财报足以完全逆转所有这些势头，毕竟甲骨文虽然重要，但它不是英伟达、博通、谷歌或亚马逊那样的巨头。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess that which I don't think should be enough to like completely reverse all that momentum because it's freaking Oracle. Like Oracle, like look, Oracle's important, but they're not Nvidia. They're not Broadcom important, you know? They're not Google or Amazon important. They're Oracle. It's like, okay, fine. Like cloud computing, database, like yeah, that's cool. But I guess that was more important than what the street thought. And then unfortunately that got hit.</p>
</details>

美联储正在购买短期债券以增加流动性，这不完全是大规模的**量化宽松**（Quantitative Easing: 央行通过购买资产向经济注入货币）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yes, and then and last point on the Fed and then we'll get into Oracle. As Chris says right here, they are buying short-term bonds to boost um to boost liquidity. So, this is not necessarily massive quantitative easing.</p>
</details>

虽然这更接近量化宽松而非**量化紧缩**（Quantitative Tightening: 央行通过出售资产从经济中抽走货币），但与2020年那种数百亿美元的债券购买规模不同。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had a little bit of debate yesterday on X on if this this is officially quantitative easing or not. And it's closer to QE than QT, right? So, is it the type of QE that we saw in 2020 when the Fed was just buying, you know, hundreds of billions of bonds on the balance sheet? No.</p>
</details>

他们正在购买400亿美元的短期国库券，这标志着量化紧缩的结束。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they're buying 40 billion. That's the number going into the end of the year. They're going to be starting to buy bonds in two uh two days. So, one day, December 12th, and that 40 billion is going to be in short-term T bills, that essentially will start the end of quantitative tightening.</p>
</details>

美联储不再出售资产负债表上的债券，这接近量化宽松，即使不是几年前那种程度。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, the the fact that they're not selling bonds off their balance sheet is close to QE, even if it's not explicitly QE in terms of the level of quantitative easing that we had years ago, because, you know, I don't know if we're going to get back to that anytime soon. That was during a pandemic. rates were at near zero, but it's also not bearish.</p>
</details>

美联储购买国债，鲍威尔对通胀前景非常乐观。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have the Fed buying treasuries. You have JPAL incredibly bullish on the frame of reference for inflation.</p>
</details>

还记得去年11月，英伟达财报后，股价在一个小时内先涨5000亿美元，再跌5000亿美元，并拖累了整个市场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you had nine pe remember in November that one day. I mean, the last week of the last the second to last week of November sucked. But during that second to last week after Nvidia earnings, Nvidia went up 500 billion, then it went down 500 billion literally within an hour. And they it took the entire market down with it.</p>
</details>

这不仅是因为英伟达财报，还因为两位美联储主席表示不应降息，他们的言论足以给市场带来巨大痛苦。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it wasn't only because of Nvidia earnings. was cuz two Fed presidents came out and said, "We don't think we should have a cut." And like Fed speak was enough to create that much pain in the market.</p>
</details>

昨天，美联储最重要的发言人发表了非常强硬的言论，表示通胀不是问题，其他八人也表示同意。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You just had the biggest Fed speaker in the Fed yesterday give us very very strong Fed speak around the idea of inflation not being a concern. And you had eight other people agree with him.</p>
</details>

所以市场没有更大的动作，这有点令人困惑。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is a bit confusing for why markets are not making larger move right here.</p>
</details>

当然，可能存在“卖出新闻”的情况，但昨天我们确实得到了惊喜。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now obviously could there be a sell the news? of course, right? There there could definitely be sort of a component of, hey, let's sell the news because maybe this stuff was priced in, even though I do think we got a bit of a surprise yesterday.</p>
</details>

但我认为昨天所有势头之后，最终还是甲骨文导致了市场下跌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think what actually happened yesterday after all the momentum, I I don't think it's a carryen trade. I don't think it's Japanese bonds. I I really do think it ended up being Oracle.</p>
</details>

甲骨文股价下跌13%，因为我认为是甲骨文的问题，市场也可能很快反转，意识到这只是甲骨文，没那么严重。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's get into Oracle and see what happened right here. Oracle down 13%. And because I think it's Oracle, I think it can also easily reverse, aka the market can wake up and be like, it's freaking Oracle. Who cares? Like, this is not that serious.</p>
</details>

但问题是甲骨文对更广泛的数据中心行业产生了影响，这才是市场不满的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the problem is the implications that Oracle is setting for the broader data center trade is what the market is upset about and that's why I think it's really important to to discuss them.</p>
</details>

### 甲骨文财报电话会议的细节

我听了甲骨文的财报电话会议，简直是糟糕透顶。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Oracle. So, what happened? So, first of all, I listened to the Oracle call. I'll be live with Sam today, by the way, listening to Broadcom. So, for those that are on um for those that want to listen to Broadcom, then uh I'll be live today for the market close. Sam will join me and we'll try to see what Broadcom says and what they do. Broadcom basically up like 80% year to date. So they are they are priced to perfection. They've got to deliver a very good quarter. Yes. 78%. So we'll see what they end up saying later today. Um in terms of Oracle, I was listening to the call. The call was horrendous. Let me just say that right now. The call was absolutely horrendous.</p>
</details>

我无法理解一家6500亿美元的公司，麦克风竟然不好用，音频完全中断了五次。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If anyone was there listening to me, I don't understand how you have a $650 billion company and the mic doesn't work. There were five moments where the audio just completely cut out.</p>
</details>

而且在财报电话会议期间，竟然三次听到有人收到或发送短信的声音，这对于一家有数万人收听的6500亿美元公司来说，简直不可思议。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I I thought for a second it was my Wi-Fi. It wasn't my internet. It was just like Oracle's call not working. Someone was texting. If you have an iPhone, you know exactly what it sounds like when you receive a text or send a text. Three times you could hear someone getting a text or sending a text during an earnings call for a $650 billion company that tens of thousands of people are listening to.</p>
</details>

电话会议最大的问题是缺乏兴奋感。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The biggest issue I had with the call that I think a lot of people agreed with is that there was no excitement.</p>
</details>

这是一家**剩余履约义务**（RPO: Remaining Performance Obligations: 指客户已签订合同但尚未履行的服务或产品价值）增加了680亿美元，季度环比增长15%的公司，现在RPO总额达到5230亿美元，去年是4230亿美元。

<p class="english-text">300 billion of that is OpenAI, which when they were asked on the call, hey, like you know, what do you guys think about one of your customers not being able to pay you? They didn't, you know, the person asking the question didn't mention OpenAI, but they basically implied it was OpenAI. And I think the co-CEOs didn't really have a response. So, there was no real response to the remaining performance obligations being substantial, but not necessarily being strong enough to warrant uh a massive multiple.</p>

其次，他们谈论的AI内容非常无聊，例如关于检索增强生成（Retrieval Augmented Generation: RAG）、数据安全等，这些都是软件公司正在做的事情。

<p class="english-text">And the number two is just like the stuff they were talking about in AI had to do with retrieval, augmented generation, rag pipelines, securing your data on their servers. They're talking about how they were multiloud within their database and now they're trying to incorporate customer data within those clouds, which is fair. It's a growth opportunity. It makes sense. It's trying to do a lot of the stuff that the software companies are doing are doing in in the context of like uh operationalizing data with the LMS. They mentioned how they can use the LMS to make sense of your data. The problem is it was very boring.</p>

<p class="english-text">It's nothing ex you know it's not like some magical new workflow inside of the agentic enterprise that I think will get people excited and and so there was just no excitement on a you know you would think if you have half a trillion dollars of RPO you would have a lot more excitement for how you're talking about it and just in general if you listen to the call there was zero excitement there was zero energy for how they were speaking about this stuff.</p>
</details>

第二点是他们没有真正消除市场对债务的担忧，这可能是市场如此不满的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the number two is that they didn't really shake off the the the uh the fears of debt and I think that's why the street is really getting upset right here.</p>
</details>

他们增加了150亿美元的**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditures: 用于购买、改进或维护长期资产的资金），这本应是看涨的，但当他们解释如何管理这些资本支出时，首席执行官表示，他们预计不需要像分析师预期的那样花费1000亿美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So They increased capex by 15 billion which is super bullish right because they're going to be spending more on capex. The problem is when they had to explain you know how they're they're navigating that capex. This is the only thing that they had to say. So the CEO said we've been reading a lot of analyst reports and we read quite a few that show an expectation of upwards of 100 billion for Oracle to go out and kind of complete these buildouts. Based on what we see right now we expect we'll need to see less if not substantially less. So they said, "Hey, like we're not going to have to spend a hundred billion dollars."</p>
</details>

然而，花旗（Citi）分析师Tyler Radkkey预计甲骨文未来三年每年将花费200亿美元，总计600亿美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then you had some analysts come out. Uh in particular, you had city analysts Tyler Radkkey come out and said, "We think Oracle will have to spend 20 billion over the next three years each, which means 60 billion."</p>
</details>

加上他们已经发行的400亿美元，总计1000亿美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, they already issued 40 billion. So if you put 60 and 40 together, that's 100.</p>
</details>

这意味着未来三年至少需要1000亿美元，这仍然是一笔巨款，但甲骨文并未能消除这些担忧。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So maybe they're not going to have to issue a new hundred billion of debt, but they're assuming there will be a minimum of a hundred billion over the next three years in total, which is still a lot of money that Oracle is going to be putting out there. And they didn't really calm those fears of kind of what's going on.</p>
</details>

此外，甲骨文的运营现金流从去年的200亿美元增长到今年的222亿美元，增长合理。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, the operating cash flow for Oracle, uh, last year was 20 billion. This year 22.2 billion. Okay, that's up by 2.2 billion. Reasonable growth.</p>
</details>

但资本支出从100亿美元飙升到350亿美元，增长速度惊人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is the capital expenditures went from 10 billion to 35 billion. So their capex is growing at a pretty exponential rate which in the market of AI you've been rewarded for that.</p>
</details>

Meta、谷歌、亚马逊和微软等公司在过去几年中，运营现金流的增长速度快于资本支出，因为它们的业务更加多元化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is the companies that have been rewarded for that Meta not as of recently but over the past couple years Google Amazon Microsoft have grown their operating cash flow faster than their capex because their businesses are more diversified than Oracle.</p>
</details>

甲骨文每年增长20亿美元的现金流很棒，但每年增长200亿美元的资本支出就不那么好了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oracle's growing two billion a year, which is amazing, but their capex growing at 20 billion a year is not amazing.</p>
</details>

这意味着他们的支出是现金流的10倍，他们没有这些钱，所以不得不转向债务市场，这就是为什么他们的**信用违约掉期**（Credit Default Swaps: CDS: 一种金融衍生品，用于对冲债券违约风险）再次飙升。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there there's a 10x leverage between the amount of money they're spending, which they don't have that money because they only have two billion in cash flow. So they have to go to the debt markets, which is why their credit default spikes are spiking or credit default swaps are spiking again in the pre-markets in order to finance this entire buildup.</p>
</details>

我认为所有数据中心股票下跌，以及甲骨文拖累AI叙事的原因是，市场不相信甲骨文正在做的事情有任何令人兴奋或创新之处。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think the reason all the data center stocks are down and I think the reason Oracle is taking down a lot of the AI narrative right now is because the market does not believe that there's anything exciting or innovative in terms of what uh what Oracle is doing, which is fair because if you listen to the call, it was, you know, not something that would get you super excited.</p>
</details>

其次，他们正在花费大量他们没有的钱进行长期来看应该会成功的建设，但目前投资回报率（ROI）不明显，因此股价受到打击。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And then two, um they are spending a lot of money that they don't have for a buildout that should end up working long term. It's just right now the ROI on that is not as apparent and as a result, this stock is taking a hit.</p>
</details>

我原本考虑在财报前买入甲骨文，但最终没有，因为财报总是一场赌博。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's why we're seeing this take place right now. You know, I was thinking of playing Oracle before the earnings. I really was. And then this was the number one reason I didn't do it. Earnings are always a gamble. Like you just never know what's going to happen.</p>
</details>

主要原因在于，如果他们不明确解决债务问题，或者没有另一个客户能像OpenAI那样大幅增加RPO，那么这只股票很可能会下跌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the number one reason to not have played it yesterday is because if they don't explicitly address two things. If they don't explicitly address the debt situation, which they didn't, I mean, they really didn't give investors any calm here. Or they don't have another customer that increases RPO by like some massive 300%, which they didn't again because, you know, the only time they did it was from OpenAI, which no one even knows if that's going to be real. Then this stock was probably headed down.</p>
</details>

我没想到会下跌13%，5%到6%还可以接受，但13%有点过头了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't expect 13%. Five, six% I was like, okay, that's fine. 13% I think is a bit aggressive. So I do think there should be a rebound here, but that is the fear that we're having on Oracle as well.</p>
</details>

甲骨文的**自由现金流**（Free Cash Flow: FCF: 公司在支付所有运营费用和资本支出后剩余的现金）也是负的，而且看起来会长期保持负值。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Free cash flow also is negative, which is another thing to remember, and it's looked like it's going to be negative for a long time.</p>

资本支出现在占其收入的75%，大多数超大规模公司并非如此，但甲骨文是，这就是我们看到它面临困境的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And capex is now 75% of their revenue. Not most hyperscalers have capex being 75% of the revenues, but Oracle does, and that's why we are seeing some of the pain right here from Oracle.</p>
</details>

甲骨文财报的实际增长方面，每股收益（EPS: Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）超预期40%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I mean the actual growth itself on the earnings they beat EPS by 40%. A lot of people wondering why isn't the stock up because of that.</p>
</details>

但这是因为他们收购了一家公司，20亿美元的收益是会计处理，而不是快速增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They bought a company so the two billion gain they got from the companies was factor. So it was more like a tax thing accounting thing versus like a they're growing super fast which fooled me as well because when it was up 40% on EPS I was like goodness like why is the street down 7% on this? Unfortunately you know it wasn't necessarily the most exciting exciting uh EPS growth.</p>
</details>

我认为这不是AI的**看跌**（Bearish: 预期价格下跌）信号，甲骨文处于不稳定状态，但这不会对整个行业产生传染效应。
<details>

Well, look, the whole the whole idea is we're the only country we're the only great country that lets other people just come in without vetting them and deciding whether they're really going to help the economy of America. So, you know, in our current visa system, why shouldn't we expedite the people who are willing to step up, give a million dollars to the United States, go through the most rigorous vetting process that the United States has ever done, $15,000 of vetting to make sure they're the right people, and let's bring in the top of the of the best. And let's bring those people in. Let's help them grow America and build America. Why should we take people who are below average? It just doesn't make any sense. Let's think this through. Let's pick the best. Every other country does. It's time for America to do it correctly. The Trump gold card officially rolled out yesterday. So, I guess we'll see if it has any implications on the um on the immigration situation, but you can pay a million or five million for the platinum to get access to to the United States. I know they launched it like five different times, but yesterday they like officially put it out there.</p>

英伟达（Nvidia）和美国总统谈论了中国开发者使用美国技术栈的问题。

<p class="english-text">Vidia and the president of the United States, they spoke together. They talked about it a lot. I mean, I would say more than a dozen times. And the idea from the president's perspective is that the technology, the American technology stack, he wants the developers in China to also be using the American technology stack.</p>

They tried to seem like, "H, we don't need it." And then the Chinese tech executives came out and said, "Please, can we get our hands on these chips?"</p>

我们出售这些芯片的唯一原因是为了让英伟达赚钱，让美国经济持续发展。

So and we think it's about aka JPA was saying we we overstated the amount of jobs which means the labor market is weaker than expected justifying the rate cut.</p>

<p class="english-text">He basically said it's really tariffs that's causing most of the inflation overshoot. Overshoot means higher than our target. Tariffs likely create a one-time increase to prices. Our job is to make sure that it is. I think the hint there, David, is that, you know, as far as the overshoot, the fact that inflation is higher than they would like, the fact that he's pinning it on tariffs and saying that that's a one-time effect is actually code for we're not as worried about it.</p>

美国各地社区都在反对大型公司建造数据中心，因为这会破坏当地环境、推高电费并转移稀缺水资源。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In community after community, Americans are fighting back against data centers being built by some of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world. They are opposing the destruction of their local environment, soaring electric bills, and the diversion of scarce water supplies. Nationally, how will continued construction of AI data centers impact our environment?</p>
</details>

然而，如果没有Meta、OpenAI和甲骨文的数据中心建设，美国经济将停滞不前。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again the the the the the push back here is that if Meta was not spending on that data center if Open Eye and Oracle were not building out data centers, not even just over the next coming months as they start to build out those but over the past two years the American economy would be dead. 50% of our GDP since 2023 has been essentially data centers. I mean it's capex but capex is for what for the data centers.</p>
</details>

自2023年以来，美国GDP的50%来自数据中心。
<details>

<p class="english-text">So, you know, if we think we have a K-shaped economy, if we didn't have this data center buildout, which he's right about, it's going to increase electricity prices, and hopefully there's some way to navigate that, either by improving the grid, which is going to be very important. And I think there's a lot of opportunities there that will present themselves or by these companies potentially subsidizing the increase of prices which Google was thinking about in Ohio of just potentially like not a tax but them like giving more money to the I guess it's a functionally attack to the local community to to to help offset the electricity prices. But if we didn't have the data center buildout, we wouldn't have any GDP growth.</p>
</details>

数据中心建设会推高电价，需要通过改善电网或公司补贴电价来解决。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's a tricky thing to balance, but it's like when you paint it as black or white and and you know the the base of people that just hate billionaires and then they see the data centers and they see their electricity prices go up and they get pissed off about it's like yeah, but when you look under the hood and you you kind of understand economics like we also need GDP growth for the economy to keep moving so we can have jobs and over the past three years the GDP has come from capex which I don't know if that's necessarily healthy or not but it is what it is.</p>
</details>

过去三年，GDP增长主要来自资本支出。

<p class="english-text">Um I mean, cool. They're building their own hidden house chip. They probably thought there was a different architecture they could use outside of the Nvidia chips.</p>
</details>

他们似乎在使用**激光雷达**（LiDAR: Light Detection and Ranging: 一种利用激光测量距离和绘制三维地图的技术），这更符合Waymo和谷歌的自动驾驶思路，而不是特斯拉（Tesla）。

英伟达与通用汽车（GM）等汽车公司有其他合作，但Rivian开发自己的芯片确实改变了我对他们作为一家汽车公司的看法。

<p class="english-text">Um, Nvidia does have a lot of other partnerships with car companies like GM for their synthetic Cosmos platform. But that is really cool to see. I mean, Rivian developing their own chip definitely changes at least my immediate perception of how they think of or how I think of them as a car company.</p>

<h3>投资策略与市场情绪</h3>

霍华德·马克斯（Howard Marks）表示，有些事情虽然过度，但不意味着不能投资。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Howard Marx is live. We haven't heard from him in about a month. I guess let's take a little bit of a look of what he has to say. I mean, last time we talked to him, he said, "We are not in a bubble, but he did say valuations are aggressive." So, I guess we can see what he said. I enjoyed your interview with the young rapper, dude. He just text me this morning. He said, "You can let the chat know that I have now downsized to 60 positions from 250." So, we're we're getting him to consolidate. Hopefully, we get him down to 10 positions by the end of the year, but at least he's down to 60, which is not horrible. Um, okay, cool. So let's go to let's go to Howard Marks get his thoughts on current state of the economy right now and these actually push society ahead uh and change it irreversibly uh but in the process there's a bubble surrounding their implementation which is overly uh accelerated and overly financed and goes to excess and end up destroying a lot of capital but leave society uh greatly changed and I'm sure that AI is in the latter category in terms effect on society and the question is will the implementation uh prove to have been excessive in scope and in in the way it's financed. Just because something is excessive doesn't mean that you can't invest in it.</p>

<p class="english-text">No, but but it it you know when when when investors hate everything and won't touch it with the 10-ft pole, chances are it's going to be on sale because nobody has pushed up the price. In fact, their disinterest has pushed down the price.</p>

</details>

霍华德·马克斯认为，宁愿购买股权，因为AI的潜在不对称上涨空间比债务融资的下行风险更令人兴奋。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Howard Marks continuing to not be super bearish. Now a couple months ago I know some of the headlines were saying that he thinks the market's in a bubble. I guess he's changed a little bit of his perspective here, but um his argument here is you'd rather buy the equity because the upside on the asymmetry of the potential of AI is actually more exciting than the the the downside of of financing the debt because the downside is zero obviously because these companies could go out of business. So, you'd rather take a risk on the equity itself than the debt because if if you finance the debt, like your upside is not massive. Like, yeah, you'll get like maybe five 6% return, but the equity could go up 5 600% if the whole AI thesis works out.</p>

Palantir推出了“神经多样性奖学金”（Neurode Divergent Fellowship）。

</details>

首席执行官卡普（Karp）因为一次采访受到了很多批评，人们认为他吸毒。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Karp got a lot of flack. A lot of flack. Um, Chad says, "I was just looking at my bald eagle on my land right now." That's crazy, dude. The benefit of owning that much land. Um, he got a lot of flack for this for this for this interview. I'll play this 30 second clip. Um, and I thought it was unjustified, but this is the the clip that he's been getting a lot of [ __ ] for over the past week.</p>
</details>

卡普的风格就是这样，他会紧张不安，说话时会停顿。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so for people who don't know Karp and for people who have never watched a single interview of Karp, I fundamentally disagree with people saying it's not a good look. I just disagree. It's okay for us to disagree, but I disagree. If you know Karp, you know this is who Karp is. He's going to be jittery. He's going to be jumping up and down. He's going to be saying uh between every other word.</p>
</details>

他的公众形象越来越高，所以人们会立即认为他吸毒。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I know his profile has increased dramatically. He's not your Jensen Huang or your typical cookie cutter CEO that's able to like speak in proper sentences and like, you know, barely stutter in between his words. This is Karp we're talking about. I mean, part of the reason I invested in Palunteer 5 years ago is because I saw his crazy hair and I was like, dude, this guy's this guy is different. So, the fact of the matter is his brand profile has increased. So, now his content starts to get more viral distribution. And so, the thing that people look at immediately is like, "Oh, this guy's got to be on drugs."</p>
</details>

但卡普并不是吸毒，他只是与众不同。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which look, I understand why people immediately have that gut reaction. But that's why I think it was very important for Pounder to counteract that because he's not on drugs. He's just different.</p>
</details>

卡普患有**阅读障碍**（Dyslexic: 一种学习障碍，主要表现为阅读困难），他在书中详细谈论了这一点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if for anyone who read the the book that came out on him, I again I interviewed the the uh the author of that book a month ago, Karp is dyslexic. And he talks a lot in the book about being dyslexic and what that has done for him as an individual.</p>
</details>

当你有阅读障碍时，你必须独立思考，不能以传统方式思考。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the things he talked about deeply is that when you're dyslexic, you have to think for yourself. you cannot think in the conventional way because when you think because you literally when your mind is reading the text on the screen it's unconventional.</p>
</details>

卡普看到了网上人们取笑他“神经多样性”的言论，于是决定推出这个奖学金。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think he saw a lot of the [ __ ] that was going on online about people making fun of someone who in his own words is a bit neurode divergent and he said you know what screw this we're going to launch a new neurode divergent fellowship pounder said if you find yourself relating to him in this video unable to sit still or thinking faster than you can speak we encourage you to apply the final round of interviews will be conducted by Dr. car personally.</p>

<p class="english-text">Like I look, the internet is an ugly place. The internet is a weird place. The internet is a mean place. And given I've been on social media for the past couple years, you get people that know nothing about you, know nothing about who you are, but just like want to take shots at you and jab at you and like it's a very nasty place. And you have to protect your mental health when you see that stuff.</p>
</details>

卡普在过去20年里建立了一家4500亿美元的公司，成为世界上最重要的公司之一，但他没有迎合世界标准。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at the end of the day, he has built a $450 billion company over the past 20 years, taking it from 0 to 450 billion, one of the most important companies in the world. And he's does it he he did it and Paler did it without conforming to the rest of the world standards.</p>
</details>

他的与众不同是他的超能力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for people to see that, which means you're obviously going to get someone who's a little weird, just like Elon, right? Elon is a little weird to say the least, but nonetheless, he's freaking Elon for a reason. that weirdness, that difference in his personality is his superpower.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常棒的主意，Palantir没有为卡普的行为道歉，他们拥抱了自己的不同之处。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I just thought it was fascinating that the majority of X over the past week was like, "Oh, this guy's on drugs." It's like, first of all, like, have you built anything as substantial as he has in his life? Have you even tried? And if you haven't, and your first gut assumption is he's on drugs, it's like that it's just a loser take in my opinion. It's just a loser take. So, I thought it was a phenomenal idea to be like, "Oh, you think I'm crazy? You think I'm on drugs? Great. We're launching an application for people who are just like me, who are not crazy, who are not on drugs, but are different from the mainstream way of how tech entrepreneurs or people in general operate. And we're going to make a fallacy just for them. I thought it was a phenomenal idea and I think it was something very strong for a pounder to lean into. And again, this is why I love this company. They lean into their differences. They don't apologize for how Karp acted. He didn't do anything wrong. Being jittery on the chair is not doing anything wrong.</p>
</details>

Palantir的股票以100倍的销售额交易，而Adobe却难以获得高估值，这表明人们受到Palantir的启发。

首席执行官的工作首先是让股票上涨，这需要公司表现良好，也需要描绘一个愿景。

<p class="english-text">And like I think part of of of of building any mission or movement, I mean as the CEO's job first and foremost for shareholders is to get that stock to go up. The job is to make the stock go higher at its core. And in order to make it go higher, yes, the company has to perform, which counter has obviously done very well in terms of their top and bottom line growth, but they also have to paint a story.</p>
</details>

<p class="english-text">I mean, what is Elon doing right now? He's painting a story about data centers in space, which none of us knows if is even possible or not. But guess what? There's probably a lot of sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors saying, "Hey, you know, maybe that's a $10 trillion business." And and and that story is getting them to be excited to invest.</p>
</details>

卡普很有钱，但他仍然对工作充满热情，这表明他不仅仅是为了钱，而是为了实现使命。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Like, you've got to be someone who can inspire and motivate people. And that requires passion. And by the way, Karp's rich. Like, he's been rich for the past couple years. Like to still have that type of passion to care about what you're doing on a day-to-day basis means it's not really about the money. It's about actually implementing a mission.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么Palantir的员工流失率在科技行业最低，因为他们受到公司使命的启发。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's why the employees at Palunteer tend not to leave. That's why their turn rate is the lowest in the tech industry because people are actually inspired by what they're doing and the purpose they have, not not by the check that they're getting.</p>

今天的“每日一词”是**异方差性**（Heteroscadasticity: 当回报的方差随时间变化而非保持不变时，这是波动性建模中的一个核心概念）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, word of the day. I don't know how to say this [ __ ] What is this? Heteroscadasticity. When the variance of returns changes over time, instead of saying constant, a core concept in volatility molding.

So basically when you are going through a volatile time and an asset is uh reflecting that volatility, earnings obviously is one of the the core times where that'll when that'll happen. That is heterodasy. Okay, let's see how to pronounce this. Has anyone heard this word before? I've never heard this word before. Okay, hold on. We had an ad pop up.
