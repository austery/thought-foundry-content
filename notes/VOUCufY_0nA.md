### 序幕：老友重逢与职业渊源

**Kevin:** 很高兴我们能一起做这期节目，兄弟。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Anish, dude, I'm so glad we're doing this, brother.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 很激动，伙计。谢谢你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Excited, man. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 在我们深入主题之前，先介绍一下背景，这很重要。我们认识很久了，曾在谷歌、谷歌风险投资 (Google Ventures) 和谷歌公司共事。我们是多年的好兄弟了，但我觉得我们从没一起上过播客，对吧？你想简单介绍一下你的背景吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we get into the ketones kicking in. Let's get a little bit of background because it's important. I know we're going to be syndicating this across a couple of podcasts. So, I was telling people who we are. We've known each other for a long time. We worked together at Google, long time. We work together at Google Ventures and Google Corporate and yeah man it's been we've been good homies for many many many years. No one's ever seen us on a pod together I don't think right like we've never done anything. Yeah. So do you want to give a little your background?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 当然。谢谢你邀请我，这太棒了。我是 Anish，Andreessen Horowitz（a16z）的一名**GP**（General Partner: 风险投资公司的普通合伙人）。我和 Kevin 是老朋友了。我是一个产品人、工程师和技术专家。我创办过两家公司。现在可能是我有史以来最快乐的时光，无论是在个人生活、职业还是其他方面。今天很高兴能和大家聊聊这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Thank you for having me man. This is awesome. I'm Anish. I'm a GP at Andreessen. I've been friends with Kevin forever. I'm a product person. I'm an engineer. I'm a technologist. I started two companies. Um probably having the most fun I've ever had both personally, professionally, and all of that. And I'm excited to talk to everyone about it today.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 我们刚认识的时候真的很酷。我们都在 Google+ 项目上。我记得在项目早期和你一起工作时，我就觉得：“天哪，这家伙的产品思维太棒了。”于是我们想办法保持联系并继续合作，后来我们都跳到了谷歌风险投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's it was really cool when we first met. We both were uh I don't know how we ended up there and got on Google+. Yeah. But we were both on Google+ and I remember working with you like in the very early days and I was like oh like when you land into Google for the first time, you don't know what to expect, you know, like cuz you're getting in there and you don't know like what is this what is this whole thing going to be about? Like who am I going to work with? And very quickly you realize there's fantastic engineering talent there. And then there's also productwise I was like I don't know that these people actually live and breathe product. It was very much you're kind of in the Google bubble but you were one of the first people I was like oh my god this is like an amazing product mind and I got to work with this guy and so we figured out a way to like stay connected and work together you know when we bounced over to Google Ventures then and yeah.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** “想办法”这个说法太客气了。是你救了我的命。我记得当时你加入了 Google+ 几周后就说：“不行，这不是我想做的。”我当时还想：“什么意思？那**Vesting**（股权授予: 员工在满足一定服务期限或业绩条件后，逐步获得公司授予期权或股权的过程）怎么办？Google+ 怎么办？”但你非常笃定，而且你是对的。你转去了风险投资部门。我记得当时在 Google+ 大楼外跟你说：“Kevin，别丢下我，伙计。请带上我，我会让你脸上有光的。”这种话你说了也就说了，通常不会指望别人会真的回电话。但三个月后，你真的打给我了，说：“嘿，伙计，怎么样？要不要过来和我们一起干？”那一次职业上的慷慨之举，改变了我的一生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well dude figured out a way is generous. So, you saved my life. I remember I worked with you for 3-4 weeks and what's cool actually is you joined and you're like, "No, this is not it. I'm not doing it." I'm like, "What do you mean? What about vesting? What about Google+? What about this and that?" And you were just so sure and you were right. You moved over to Ventures. And I remember at the time talking to you outside of that building, the Google+ building, and saying, "Kevin, don't leave me behind, man. Please bring me with you, and like I'll make you look good." And that's a thing you say and you assume nobody will ever like call you back after that. And then 3 months later you called me. You're like, "All right, man. What's up?" Like, "Why don't you come over here and do this with us?" And I mean, that that single act of professional generosity changed my whole life.</p>

### AI 引爆消费级应用复兴

**Kevin:** 我觉得过去五年，作为一名投资人，消费领域对我来说相对乏味。巨头们，比如 TikTok 和 Instagram，依然占据主导地位。我没看到什么真正有趣的东西。感觉消费领域经历了好几年的低谷期，没什么新意。但现在 AI 加入战局，我觉得有机会重塑这个领域的每一个环节。你也有同感吗？AI 就像是给消费领域打了一剂强心针。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I feel like the last call it 5 years has been on the consumer side has been relatively boring for me as an investor because I've looked at stuff and I said gosh you know we got the bigs in the room. You got the Tik Toks. got the Instagram still dominating and then you see some of the folks like you know threads that are just like copying and somehow you know strapping on you know integrations with decentralized social and that's supposed to be a thing. Yes. But I hadn't seen anything that in my mind was that interesting. Like it felt like consumer had this kind of like down period of several years where there wasn't really anything new. And now that AI has come into the mix, I feel like there's a chance to kind of almost reinvent every piece of that framework. And do you feel that way as well? Like AI is a shot in the arm for consumer.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 百分之百同意。从投资者的角度来看，这简直是消费投资的复兴。我们自 2010、2011、2012 年以来就没见过这样的机会了。因为消费者正在自发地下载产品，这在很长一段时间里都没有发生过。消费者也愿意付费。看看顶级产品的定价：顶级的 ChatGPT SKU 每月 200 美元，顶级的 Gemini Ultra 是 250 美元，而 Grok 是 300 美元。消费者真的在付这个钱。所以我认为消费领域正以一种强有力的方式回归。科技爱好者消费者的兴奋程度是十年来前所未有的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100%. I mean, I'll give you the investor perspective and then the builder perspective. I want to hear yours. So from an investor perspective, this is like a renaissance for consumer investing. We haven't seen an opportunity like this. I think in since 2010, 2011, 2012 because consumers are downloading products organically. That hasn't happened in a long time. Consumers are willing to pay like you look at the price points of the top products, right? The top chat GPT skew is 200 a month. The top Gemini skew Google Ultra is 250 and then Grock is 300 a month. And consumers are actually paying that amount. I mean, how much do you think you've paid to cursor? A lot. A lot. Yeah. And some of that is professional behavior, but a lot of that is just consumer and hobbyist behavior. So, I think that consumer is like back in a big way. And like the tech enthusiast consumer is excited in a way that they haven't been for 10 years.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 但你刚才提到的公司，很大程度上还是那些巨头。让我震惊的一件事是，像财富 100 强的顶级公司，第一次能够推出消费级科技产品并真正获得规模化发展。过去总是巨头们搞不定消费产品，他们必须收购 Instagram 才能变酷。而现在，我们看到巨头们推出的消费应用获得了一些关注。当然，他们有规模，有用户基础，可以把产品推到很多人面前。但就像我们在 Google+ 看到的那样，仅仅拥有用户基础和眼球，并不意味着你就能在消费领域取得成功。我觉得现在巨头们开始做到了，这让我很惊讶。你也感到惊讶吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you the companies you just mentioned though, they're largely the bigs. Like one of the things that that's happened in consumer that I never thought would be the case that I was shocked by is that bigs like you know top tier you know fortune 100 companies can put out consumer tech for the first time and actually see it get scale. It was always the bigs that that couldn't figure it out, you know, they had to acquire Instagram to be cool. They had to buy the the cool. And I think with with Chat GBT and actually with with Google as well with, you know, their their banana model and whatnot. It's for the first time we're seeing the bigs put out consumer apps that are getting some traction. I mean, granted, they do have the scale. They have the install base. they can put that in front of a lot of people. But like we saw with the Google+ side, just because you have the install base and you have the eyeballs doesn't mean you're going to see success on the consumer side. That's right. And I feel like we're starting to see that with the bigs, which was kind of shocking to me. Did that shock you as well?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 从某种意义上说，巨头们发布的是模型，而不是产品。我认为这里有一个重要的区别。模型本身非常强大，巨头和实验室在资本等方面有优势来构建前沿模型，消费者也喜欢这些模型。这很好。但当涉及到在模型之上构建有独特见解的产品时，情况就不同了。比如 Cursor 就是一个好例子。陪伴（Companionship）也是一个非常有趣的类别，市场需求巨大。很多这类产品，比如 Janitor AI，它们处理的是人性中大公司不愿意触碰的部分，比如分歧、性、说服力。这项技术可以触及人性中那些在谷歌和 Facebook 里需要经过上千个委员会审批却不想被触及的领域。我认为这是其中一个有趣的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It so in a sense what the bigs have released are models, not products. And I think there's an important distinction here. So I do think that if you look at the models, the models are incredibly capable and the bigs and the labs obviously are advantaged in certain ways with capital, etc. to build great cutting edge models and consumers love those models. So that's great. They're playing in that space. It's definitely relevant. But when it comes to opinionated products on top of the models, like cursor is a good example. Companionship is actually a very interesting category where there's huge demand for companionship products. And a lot of these companionship products like janitor AI, you know, they they deal with parts of the human experience that big tech is not going to be comfortable shipping, right? It's disagreement, it's sexuality, it's persuasion. So so much of this technology can address parts of the human experience that a thousand committees at Google and Facebook don't want addressed and I think that is one of the interesting opportunities.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 百分之百同意。我认为这正是我们需要投资的领域。因为我每天看到的很多项目提案，要么是对现有产品进行一些边缘优化，要么就是我坚信某个巨头最终会主导该领域，所以我回避了这些投资。巨头们永远不会像他们应该或可以做的那样去触碰情感层面，他们会觉得不舒服。所以，那些因为其处理的主题而具有天然防御性的类别和垂直领域，才是我认为的机会所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100% I think that's well said and I think it is the space where we need to invest because if you think about what the pitches that we see on a on a daily or weekly basis a lot of the stuff that I see is a you know it can be a sanding down of the rough edges and it can also just be something where I wholeheartedly believe that one of the bigs is going to dominate that category and so I avoid those investments like they will never touch the emotional side as much as they should or could uh not should but that they wouldn't feel comfortable doing so right and so those are the categories and the verticals where I think is they're defensible by the pure nature of what they're addressing right.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 完全正确。我认为他们的结构设置就是会把产品的灵魂抽走。而当你谈论像陪伴这样的类别时，灵魂就是一切，没有灵魂就没有产品。另一个我认为实验室和巨头不会成功的有趣领域是那些受益于**多模型**（Multimodel: 指产品或系统能够集成和使用来自不同开发者或公司的多种 AI 模型）的产品。Cursor 之所以好，是因为你可以在里面使用任何模型。而谷歌永远不会发布内嵌 Anthropic 模型的产品。所以这也是一个非常有趣的点，他们受限于内部开发的模型，而那些受益于多模型的产品则完全不受限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100% I just think they're they're structurally set up to kind of take the soul out of products and when you talk about categories like companionship the whole thing is the soul there is no product without that. I think the other interesting area where the labs and the bigs are not going to be successful is products that benefit from being multimodel, right? Not multimodal but multimodel. So cursor is good because you can use every model inside of it and Google is never going to ship with anthropic models embedded. So that also is a very interesting they're sort of constrained to the models that they've developed in house and products that benefit from being multimodel are actually really unconstrained.</p>
</details>

### AI 陪伴的前沿：希望与隐忧

**Kevin:** 让我们来谈谈陪伴这个话题。你认为应该构建什么样的产品？你见过哪些已有的产品？你觉得这其中有多少是昙花一现，又有多少具有深度？比如拥有一个 AI 女友，这事既有趣又怪异。一年前，我一个朋友让我去体验一个类似的产品，那时的模型还是“无拘无束”的，你可以和模型对话，得到任何你想要的回应，无论是在性方面还是其他方面。你对这类产品塑造人性、取代真实关系有多担心？你是如何评估这类事物的？你会投资它们吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about companionship. So, on the companionship side, what do you believe should be built? What have you seen built? And how much of this do you think is fad versus depth? Meaning, it's funny and weird and awkward and strange to have an AI girlfriend. And I in the early days call it like, well, early days, let's call it a year ago, you know, way back in the day. I a friend of mine was like, "Hey, go check this out." And it was not something that was, you know, exed about or tweeted about. It was it was like this kind of like thing that you went into. And and I'll say that I went there and it was models unhinged, right? This is before Grock did it and you could basically talk to a model and get any type of response that you wanted. Uh meaning in terms of sexuality or whatever you were looking for, right? How much of that are you concerned about in terms of shaping humanity, replacing real relationships? Like what lens, how do you evaluate something like that? Do you invest in those types of things?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我总是倾向于乐观。我们都知道人际连接的重要性及其价值，但也许其中“人”的部分被高估了。你生活在社交资源极其丰富的环境中，有朋友，有职业联系，能遇到有趣的人。你最大的挑战是安排优先级。但我不认为这是这个国家普通人的体验。我认为存在着一种深刻的孤独感，任何我们为解决孤独感所做的努力都是人类的进步，并且非常有益于社会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is such a great topic. I wish we had Eugenia here who founded Replica because she'd have a ton of thoughts. I mean, okay, so I'm always going to give you the optimistic take is just how I'm wired. So, let me give you a couple of my most optimistic takes. So one is we all know the importance of human connection and the value of it. Maybe the human part is overvalued. You know you are you live in an embarrassment of social riches. You have friends, you have professional connections, you have interesting people you can meet. They all want to connect with you and your biggest challenge is prioritizing. I don't know that that's the experience of the average person in this country. You know, I think that there's a deep loneliness and any progress we make towards addressing the loneliness is human progress and is very pro-social.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 但你认为与聊天机器人对话能填补情感上的空缺吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think progress though to have a conversation with a chatbot. Do you think that starts to fill that emotional bucket up?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 是的。我认为这不仅仅是真实人类能提供的 10%。我们的大脑，就像爬行动物的大脑一样，天生就会在进行类人对话时产生情感和化学反应。我们理智上知道另一边是电脑，但你仍然能感受到那些情感。我认为这对于通过连接实现个人进步是必要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. I think more than 10%. I just think I look it it's like our lizard reptilian brains. We are wired to have these sort of emotional chemical responses when you're engaged in a humanlike conversation. We intellectually understand that these are computers on the other side, but you still feel the feelings and I think that's what's necessary to make personal progress as a result of connection.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 我的担忧在于，我早期在玩这些模型时注意到，它们非常顺从。而情感健康和需要锻炼的“肌肉”，恰恰不是在与朋友欢笑、附和时建立的，而是在出现分歧和不适时。如果你面对的只是一个付费来同意你一切观点的模型，那么当你转向真实关系时，你会习惯于一个顺从的、仆人式的东西，这种代理和现实的跳跃是不成立的。我们是否在训练人们去偏爱顺从的模型，而不是真实关系中那种能塑造品格的情感互动？

<details
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is my concern. I'll I'll play the the the doomer side of this. Um, my concern is that one of the things I noticed with these models early on while I'm playing with them is that they were very agreeable. And emotional well-being and kind of the um I would say the muscle that needs to be built is actually not when you're laughing and agreeing with friends and kind of going along with the flow. It's when there's disagreement and the discomfort that comes from the, "Oh, I don't agree with you. That that doesn't hit me. that doesn't feel right. Let's build a bridge and figure out how to find common ground here. And if you're dealing with models that are just paid to agree with you all the time, that then you're you're basically so I'll give an example. I was talking to Tim Ferris about this. We were like we we're taking screenshot I was taking screenshots of what this model was saying to me and it was basically agreeing to anything that I put in front of it... And his response because you you're not getting any push back. And so then, okay, when you make the jump to a real relationship... you're used to an agreeable, you know, kind of like this subservient like thing and and it doesn't the proxy and the jump doesn't make sense. And all of a sudden you're like, "Well, that's not as good. I want to go back to my model." Like, are we training people to want and favor agreeable models over real, you know, the real character building that comes with the emotional side of things?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我认为我们只是需要把它调整好。每个人都知道，一段另一个人总是同意你的关系是不真实的，也无法滋养你。你需要紧张感、分歧和探索。但我们得公平地看待我们所处的周期。ChatGPT 是 2022 年 11 月才出现的。我们现在正试图调整整个人类连接和体验，在“谄媚者”和“为反对而反对”之间找到正确的位置。我们正在调整，我们会做到的。因为从进化的角度来看，我们天生就知道适度的紧张感是什么样的，我相信我们的直觉会引导我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. I I think we just need to dial it in. Like everybody knows a human relationship where the other person always agrees with you is not authentic and it doesn't nourish you. You need to have the tension, the disagreement, the exploration. I mean, we've got to like be fair to where we are in the cycle. Yeah, chat GBT was November 22, right? Right. It's not even November 25. And we're trying to dial in the entirety of human connection and experience and find the right place between not being a sink fan but not being, you know, disagreeable for the purpose of it. We're dialing it in. We're going to get there. And again, because we're so wired from an evolutionary perspective to know what is the right amount of tension, I believe our intuition will guide us. We'll get there.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 我喜欢你的说法，因为我们就像处在 AI 的“大哥大”手机时代。我们甚至还没踏上赛场的第一局。想象一下二三十年后，我们会对这一切有更深的理解。我们现在就期望它第一天就完美，期望太高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like what you're saying because we've talked about this on the ride car ride over here where if if you just for a second imagine we are in the huge brick cell phone era of AI where it's like this is the very not even the first inning like we're just stepping on the field of this cuz if I mean imagine 20 30 years from now we're going to have a much deeper understanding of what's going on behind the scenes here what is required to make and we're expecting that on day one and the expectations are like so high it's like let's let's give it give it some time you know.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 过去 40 年的技术延伸了我们的智力和思维。但人类的大部分体验实际上是情感和主观的。现在我们有了一种技术，可以延伸我们的情感和主观体验。我喜欢 AI 电子表格，很高兴有人在做，但对我来说，那是对这个基本能力最没有雄心的应用。让我们开始通过这项新技术真正地去触及人类体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also think that this I'm glad we're talking about companionship, but I think broadly we've had 40 years of technology that extended our intellect and our minds. Right. But most of the human experience is actually emotional and it's subjective. Now we have a technology that extends our emotions, our subjective experience, and it can address that. Like I love AI spreadsheets. I'm glad that somebody is building them, but to me that's the least ambitious execution of the primitive. let's start to really address the human experience through this next new technology. And I think that's where all this goes, you know.</p>
</details>

### “怪异但有效”的产品投资哲学

**Anish:** 你既设计过很多新产品，也发现过很多新产品。你是怎么做到的？有什么模式吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've got actually a related question for you. So you've both designed, you've done a lot of new product thinking and you've spotted a lot of new product thinking. Like how do you do it? What are the patterns? How did you sort of see it all of these times?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 在产品方面，我总是被某些领域中原创思想的新颖性所吸引，无论好坏。如果只是对现有产品的边缘优化，那对我来说没什么意思。但我非常尊重那些构建像（Poke 应用的）价格谈判功能这样我前所未见的东西的人。这并不意味着它会成为顶级应用或价值数十亿美元的公司，但如果你在一个构建者的大脑中发现了这种信号，就意味着他们会将这种信号应用到产品的其他部分。对我来说，这足以成为一个信号，表明我们可能会在某个时刻翻开一张神奇的牌，获得本垒打或巨大的产品成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think that on the on the product side, what I've always been drawn to is the for for better or worse, the novelty of original thought in certain areas. um if it's something that is we've talked about this kind of sand sanding down of the rough edges like that to me is not that interesting but I really respect people that are building something like this price negotiation where I just haven't seen it done before. it doesn't mean that it's going to you know be a top 10 app and and it's going to be a multi-billion dollar company but if you find that signal in someone a builder's brain that means that they're going to apply that signal to other parts of the product that are building interesting, meaning that they will continue to reinvent and reimagine things through a lens that nobody else has. And that to me is enough signal to say, okay, we will probably turn over a card at some point that is the magic, you know, card that is going to get us that that home run or that massive product, right?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 这非常有趣，因为我们的一个观察是，预测消费领域的种子轮投资真的很难。我们的方法论是“怪异但有效”（weird and working）。但你却在消费种子轮投资上一直保持正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's super interesting because one of our observations is that it's just really hard to predict consumer seed. Yes. And we haven't done a ton of it for that reason. In fact, our stated sort of approach is weird and working. That's how we've tried to invest in consumer yet. You have been consistently right at consumer seed investing. It's interesting that that's what you look for.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 是的，我首先寻找的就是“怪异”。然后如果它开始有点苗头，那就是一个非常有趣的信号。“怪异”是内在的，它代表“我只是用一种不同的方式看待世界”，而这正是能赢的创始人的特质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think that's exactly right. Weird and working. Like I I look for weird first. Yeah. And then if it starts to have a little bit of smoke, like that's a very interesting signal. And then often times I've seen founders do this a handful of times where weird and working working ends up failing and then but they still have the weird because that's in their DNA. So they'll build the next weird and working right and that's what you want because they're going to need a several shots on goal and as long as you can't manufacture the weird. The weird is internal. The weird is I just see the world in a different way and that is the founder that is going to win.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 为什么“怪异”很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why why is weird important?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 因为在一个需要注意力的世界里，消费品是一个善变的类别。曾经“怪异但有效”的东西，过一段时间就会变得无聊和陈旧。所以如果你想找到下一个新事物，消费品的“啊哈”时刻往往是：“哦，我没这么想过”或者“我以前从未有过这种感觉”。我永远不会忘记当年投资 Twitter 的时候，对我来说，投资逻辑很简单。因为长久以来我们都习惯了双向关系，比如 MySpace 和之前所有的社交平台，都有“好友”这个概念。而 Jack、Ev 和 Biz 的天才之处在于，他们打破了这个模式，说：“实际上，你可以直接广播出去，告诉世界你有重要的事情要说，任何人都可以关注你，无论他们认不认识你。”就是这个简单的小小产品调整，开启了巨大的市场机会。这在当时看起来很怪异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because in a world where you need attention, well, we've we've talked about this socially in terms of what what is what draws you in and what what draws people into consumer products. Um, consumer is a finicky category because after a certain amount of time, what was weird and working ends up to ends up being bored boring and stale, right? It's the reason why, you know, DIG is no longer here... And so if you want to find the the next thing and and consumer is often um you play with something and the aha moment is, oh, I hadn't thought of that or I didn't feel this. I've never felt this way before. I I'll never forget when um you know I did the investment in Twitter way back in the day and the the thesis for me was it was very simple for me to see because we had had birectional relationships for the longest time and what I mean by that is the MySpaces and all the social platforms that had come before it had this idea of friendship. And the beautiful thing about what what Jack and E did and and Biz over there is they said, "Okay, we're going to take that and just open it up and say actually you can just broadcast out and say I have something important to tell the world and everyone can follow it whether they know you or not." And it was that one simple little product tweak that said, "Okay, it's no longer about birectional communication. It's it's about this idea of broadcast to to all, right? And when you see something like that, it it unlocks not only a massive product opportunity, a market opportunity... But I I think that is the weird thing. It seemed odd at the time.</p>

### 一段互联网历史：“点赞”按钮的起源

**Anish:** Digg 按钮是一个非常新颖有趣的想法。20 年后的今天，谈论这个应该很安全了。谈谈它是如何影响“点赞”按钮的吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me, you know, the dig button was a very new and interesting idea. Social news talked about I think we're we're sort of in a safe place 20 years later. Yeah. Talk about how it influenced the like button.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** “点赞”按钮是如何诞生的？在那个时代，当我们第一次有了**异步 JavaScript**（Asynchronous JavaScript and XML: 一种无需刷新整个页面即可与服务器交换数据并更新部分网页的技术），简称 AJAX，这听起来可能非常古老，但那是第一次你可以点击一个按钮，发出服务器请求，然后在浏览器里得到返回。过去你必须刷新整个页面才能看到任何新东西。当时还没有一种方式可以简单地说“我觉得这个很酷”，然后点一下来表示我的兴趣。所以当 Digg 在 2004 年末推出时，那是第一次有人对内容进行投票。我当时想，如果你点击某个东西，看到数字上升，而那个数字就是实际点击过的人数，那不是很酷吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how did the like button come into existence? What was it like back during that time? I think in the early days when we first had something called asynchronous JavaScript to get a little bit geeky. It was the first time, even though this sounds super archaic, that you could actually click a button, send out for a a server response, and get something back into your browser. It used to be a world that we'd have to refresh the page to see anything. There was no way to just say like, I think this is cool. Let me just like tap on it and like show my vote of interest on something. And so when DIG launched in late 2004, it was the first time that I had ever seen just because the Ajax had just been out for a couple months that anyone had voted on content. And obviously I didn't invent voting, but no one had done it on the web. And I was like, well, wouldn't it be cool if you clicked something and you saw the number go up and that number was the number of humans that actually had clicked on something.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 幸运的是，我申请了这项专利，不是为了强制别人使用，而是作为一种防御性措施。当时 Digg 的流量比 Facebook 还大。我和马克·扎克伯格有共同的投资人，我们一起吃过几次饭。他来过我的办公室，我们当时都还很年轻。他坐在地上，我们就在聊“digging”（Digg 网站的核心功能，意为“顶”）的意义。我解释说，我认为这是一种社交信号，可以反馈给算法，最终为你提供更多你喜欢消费的内容。这就是我申请专利的核心。当时 Facebook 还没有这个功能。几个月后，他们推出了“点赞”按钮，并将其作为类似社交信号的核心功能来推动。我从没因此感到被冒犯，我觉得很棒。他把它变成了自己的东西，称之为“like”，并应用到他的产品中，这完全合情合理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, wisely, just by luck, I just happened to be in contact with enough people to where they were like, "Hey, you should go out and file a patent on this." And so, I went and filed a patent on it, not because I wanted to enforce our own liking, but I was told and advised to do that because you want as a defensive practice. At that time we were larger than Facebook and so traffic-wise and Mark and I shared a common investor in Greylock. And we just had a lot of overlapping friends and he was like hey like... you should meet Mark you guys should hang. And so we went out and um grabbed dinner... and he came to my office. He drove up and came to the dig office... He was sitting on the ground and just like wouldn't sit in a chair. He was like sitting on the ground. He was we were just talking about what it meant to what what liking was all about, what digging was all about. And I was like, well, the way I see it is that this is social signal that will feed back into an algorithm that eventually give you more stuff that you would like to consume. And that was kind of the patent that I had gone and filed. And Mark didn't have this at the time... And then a few months later, they had rolled out the like button and and that was kind of like a big part of what they pushed as a as a similar thing like a social signal to feedback into the algorithm to give you better content. Uh they obviously hit a scale... it was cool. I was never offended by that. I was like, "Oh, that's awesome." He made it his own, called it like, and it made sense to apply that to what he was doing.</p>

### 新时代创造者的技术栈

**Anish:** 你现在在做什么？你对产品构建方式的看法如何演变？这又如何影响你的投资？我们正进入一个非常奇特的时代，即使是毫无工程经验的设计师也可以进行原型设计、构建和发布产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what are you doing these days what is your what what's your outlook for how products are being built? How's that evolved and and how does that play into your investments as well? Because in some sense, we're entering into a a really weird era. Um not weird, but it's just new where someone even a designer that has no experience on the engineering side can go prototype, build, launch. It it's deputizing a wider base of people to actually roll out products.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 我认为这太不可思议了。我非常兴奋。因为感觉每个人都被解放了，可以去做他们想做的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's I think it's incredible. So, I I'm so fired up. I haven't felt this way since, you know, I was on my computer working on my BBS. My mom was yelling at me to like, "What are you doing down there? Come up for dinner." You know, like that's the level of enthusiasm I have right now because it just feels like everybody is unlocked to do what they want to do.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 那么，你个人用来构建东西的工具栈是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are you personally using to build? What does your current stack look like?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 对于 VZero，我喜欢的是我可以从一张纸开始。我可以画一个原型，然后用手机拍照，作为图片附件上传，然后说：“你能构建一个像这样，并且能做 X 的东西吗？”因为它是在 Vercel 生态系统中构建的，它主要会为 Next.js 构建组件。然后你可以下载这些组件，把它们拖放到 Cursor 里。对于我这样更偏技术的人来说，Cursor 是一个更好的解决方案，因为我喜欢深入了解事物构建的细节。然后我就可以连接 Supabase 数据库，并将所有东西部署到 GitHub，它会自动部署到 Vercel，这意味着我有一个活跃的应用在运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think with Vzero, you know, this is a a product that was largely built to um you know, quickly put together uh a beautiful design, very simple design and kind of framework for any new app. So, you can go in there and discuss what you want to have built. Uh I liked it because I could start with a piece of paper. I could draw a prototype of how I think something should function and then I would take a picture with my phone. I would attach that as an image and say, can you build something like this that does X? It puts together, you know, because it is built in in the Verscell ecosystem, it's largely going to build components for Nex.js, uh, which is a fancy way of saying that's the server that serves all that stuff up. And then you can then take those components, download them, and then drop them into Cursor. And so cursor for me being someone that's slants more technical is uh a better solution because I like to be in the nuts and bolts of thing how things are being built. Yeah. I would drop those components in there and then basically I could say okay put together this and actually create a real app behind the scenes here... I can connect up superbase and you know have a postcrest database tied to it and then I'm deploying everything out to GitHub which automatically gets deployed to versel which means I have an active app that's up and running.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 但现在一个巨大的突破是，你可以对 VZero 说：“这很棒，现在给我 20 种其他完全新颖、独特、与第一种方式无关的实现方法，并把它们都放在一个页面上。”三四分钟后，你就有 20 种不同的方式。你可以从中挑选，比如“我喜欢第三种的缩放效果，但第八种的淡出效果也很好”，然后你就可以和 LLM 进行这样的对话。到一天结束时，你就能得到一些真正独特和与众不同的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now the big unlock is you say that's great give me 20 other ways to do it that are completely novel unique and don't have anything to do with the first way and put them all on a single page and it's turnurning churning churning turnurning 3 4 minutes later you have 20 different ways now I click down that was a weird interaction go down the next Oo, that I like how that kind of zoomed this way and brought it off to the side. Whoa, that would No, that's not going to work. And you just keep going down and you're like, "Oh, I like number three and number eight." Yes. Give me 10 different ways to do number three and 10 different ways to do number eight. And now you're getting deeper and deeper. And you you you you take a little from here. We're going to like I like the zoom on number three, but I really like the fade on number eight. And this is the conversation you have with the LLM. And then by the end of the day, you're left with something that is truly unique and different.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我喜欢这个工作流程，你不再考虑投资回报率，不再想“哦，我得和设计师谈谈，让他们想出 20 个变体，这听起来工作量很大，我最好排个优先级”。相反，你能够在一个看似微不足道的事情上无限深入，达到一种五年前根本不划算的精致和匠心水平。这就是软件发展的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">See what I love about one, that's such a fascinating workflow, but also you're not thinking about ROI. You're not thinking about, oh, let me talk to the designer and ask them to come up with 20 variants. That sounds like a lot of work. I better prioritize. is you're instead just able to go infinitely deep on something seemingly trivial and have this level of kind of polish and craftsmanship which just wasn't justified 5 years ago. That's where we're going with software.</p>
</details>

### 未来展望：创造力为何比代码更重要

**Kevin:** 我有几件事是确信的。第一，我认为工程的时代结束了。我们将成为信息的编排者，而不是工程师。任何有非主观结果的事情，AI 都会处理并解决。工程是一个可解决的问题。如果你想把一百万个故事分发到一个社交网络，这不是一个主观问题。有一种方法可以大规模、高效地做到这一点。AI 会解决这个问题。你不需要一个 10 人的工程师团队来解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will tell you that there are a Couple things I know to be true. One, I think engineering is over. I think we're going to be orchestrators of information, not engineers. I I think those will be solved problems. Anything where there is a non-subjective outcome, AI will tackle that and solve that problem. Like engineering is a solvable problem. Like if I want to fan out a million stories to a social network, that is not a subjective thing. There is a way to do that at scale, efficiently, and with the end result that we're all looking for. AI will figure that out. You won't need a team of 10 engineers to figure that out. It those will be solved problems. So, you know, I think there are certain things like that that I look to and like, oh, the world just hasn't woken up to this yet.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我想反驳你关于计算机科学（CS）学位的观点。能够进行技术性思考比以往任何时候都更重要。我认为，如果孩子们，尤其是那些非顶尖名校的孩子，因为觉得“CS 已死”而决定不学 CS，那将是一个真正的悲剧。技术能力的价值比以往任何时候都高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to quibble with your point about a CS degree. But first, I want to say that like so many good things in life are downstream of authentic curiosity. And I love that that's the way that you've done this, you know, cuz it's not some big brain sort of galaxy mind predicting the future thing. just like what gives me energy. ... I want to quibble about your point around CS degree because I actually think this is a really really important point. Um, if you're somebody that goes to Stanford or maybe Harvard or MIT, like those people are leaning into CS degrees in a big way. And unfortunately, I think this story has gotten out into broader society that CS is over, engineering is over. Like, sure, being able to write a certain kind of algorithm may be less value than it was 10 years ago, but being able to think technically is more important than ever. And I think it would be a real tragedy if especially kids that go to, you know, nonvy league schools decide not to do CS because CS is over. I think the value of being technical is higher than it's ever been. And while the future technologists may not be programming in the way that we are, like they're going to do something that needs that skill set.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 我之所以认为它结束了，是因为我主张在未来，创造力将比技术能力更重要。我们不需要在学校里教人们 SQL。你认为一个技术学位在十年后能带给你什么有用的东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I Well, I will say I think it's over. The reason I think it's over is because I would argue that creativity in the future is going to be more important than technical ability. And it's it's the we don't need to teach people SQL or or no one needs to learn these things in school. Like what I'm curious, let's crack that open a bit. What do you believe that a technical degree gives you that will be useful a decade from now?</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我认为很多是关于系统思维。系统思维实际上非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a lot of it was systems thinking and I think the systems thinking is actually really important.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 这很有趣，因为我认为这与传统的 CS 不同。我更欣赏那些培养创业者的项目，他们是全栈的：构建、设计、编码、发布。这种跨越整个堆栈的知识深度，影响到市场、创意、招聘、解雇等方方面面，这在未来至关重要。我认为仅仅专注于代码的技术焦点，我希望学位能更放开一些，更全面、更宏观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well that's really interesting because I think that's different than a classic CS3 one of the things that I like about some of these and they're largely kind of more the on the vocational school side of things when you hear about these programs and how they've evolved it is like training you to become an entrepreneur which is full stack. Building it, designing it, coding it, shipping it that depth of knowledge across the full stack which impacts marketing, creativity, you know, hiring, firing, like that full suite. Essential like it will of course be very important in the future. I think that just singular technical focus around, you know, the code piece of it, that's where I would like to see the degrees like loosen up a little bit and kind of be a little bit more holistic and overarching because I don't think and and don't get me wrong, there will be technical challenges that we have in the future, but I think if you get to scale as an entrepreneur, you will have plenty of everything to go solve those challenges, right?</p>

### 社交规范的演变：关于“永远在线”录音的辩论

**Kevin:** 我担心“永远在线”录音的趋势。你相信这会变得无处不在吗？未来是不是一个你基本上找不到安全空间的地方，因为你参加的每一次会议、每一次晚餐，都在被录音？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The I I worry that um I worry about this trend of of always recording and and I I just feel like it Do you believe that this is going to be ubiquitous? Like do you feel like we're always going to be recorded like the future is one where you can't I mean there will be safe spaces but you can't largely find a safe space because every meeting you go to every dinner you go to like it it's always on.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我认为技术和社会规范是同步适应的。是的，会有更多东西被记录下来，但我们也会发展出新的社会规范来适应它。技术是我们作为一个物种和社会所需要的下游产物，我们总是在调整。现在我们正处于一个尴尬的过渡期，但社会最终会赶上技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look I think that technology and social norms sort of adapt to each other in lock step. So yes I think there'll be more things recorded and I also think that we'll develop new social norms so that it can fit into our world. Right? Technology is downstream of what we need as a species in society and we've always adjusted. You know, we've always adjusted and I believe we will again. And right now we're in this awkward sort of transitionary period where, you know, if you're in a bar in New York, you're definitely getting punched in the face for recording. At an SF, like everyone's recording. So, it's it's just a moment of transition where society is not caught up with technology. But I do think we're going more in that direction than less.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 它必须走向**有损压缩**（Lossy Compression: 一种数据压缩方法，会永久丢弃部分数据以减小文件大小，保留核心信息而非全部细节）。无损记录，即逐字逐句地记录，让我感到困扰。但有损压缩的想法很有趣，因为它只捕捉更广泛的主题。如果你能同时捕捉情感背景，比如它提示我“Anish 对此感到沮丧”，我就可以给他发点东西鼓励他，这就很有价值了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it has to go there. I think the lossy nature of it in for people that don't know what we're talking about like a lossless would be every word verbatim record in a a diary somewhere that is you know one hack away from our personal conversation in the Uber being exposed to everyone that bothers me because you know as friendships and depth evolves you're like hey this was a tough thing I was going through or whatever it may be and like the fact that that is somewhere in the cloud is just bad I think it's bad for for all sorts of reasons but the idea of lossy is interesting because you pick up broader themes and if you can pull emotional context along for the ride where he says like hey we noticed that Anishh was feeling down about this. And I'm like, "Oh, let me send him a little something to like cheer him up because that was a great like call back to our conversation, you know." Totally.</p>
</details>

**Anish:** 我认为它会的。这就是社会动态和技术之间的相互作用。它会朝着那个方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it will. I think this is the interplay between social dynamics and technology. It's going to go there.</p>
