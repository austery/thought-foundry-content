### 研究背景与发现

**主持人**: Dr. Paul Kurtak是一位精神科医生和科学家，在多伦多的成瘾与心理健康中心工作，并且是ICE（成瘾与心理健康中心）心理健康与成瘾研究项目的资深科学家和负责人。他今天来到演播室，您好！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Dr. Paul Kurtak is a psychiatrist and scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and a senior scientist and lead of the mental health and addictions research program at ICE and he joins us in studio. How are you sir?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 很好，谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Great. Thanks for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。您的研究测量了安大略省不同群体中**精神疾病**的发生率。当您回顾这些研究结果时，最让您惊讶的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Your study measured the incidence of psychotic disorders across different groups in Ontario. When you stepped back and looked at the findings, what surprised you the most?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 嗯，我想首先让我惊讶的是——我应该先说明，我是这项研究的合著者。这项研究是由我在渥太华大学的一位同事，**Dr. Daniel Myin**领导的，他在这个项目上做得非常出色。当我们审视研究结果时，有几件事脱颖而出。一是，**发病率**，也就是新确诊个体的**比率**，正在随着时间的推移而**增加**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Well, I think the the first thing that surprised me uh and I should say at the beginning that I was a co-author on this study. Um it was led by a colleague of mine at University of Ottawa, Dr. Daniel Myin did a great job on this project. When we looked at the findings, the there are a couple things that struck out. one is that um that that the incidence which means the the rate of new newly diagnosed individuals is increasing over time.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 这种现象发生在**年轻个体**身上，而且是随着时间推移。第三点是诊断的**细分方式**。嗯，我们称之为精神疾病的诊断有不同的类型，这是研究中一个比较细微的方面，但对我们来说，这是第三个有趣的点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh it is happening in younger individuals over time. And then the third piece is the the the way that the diagnosis are breaking out. Uh, so there are different types of diagnoses that that are part of of what we call psychotic disorders and and that's a bit of a nuanced aspect of the study, but that was a third piece that was kind of interesting to us.

</details>

### 精神疾病的定义与分类

**主持人**: 好的，我们来深入探讨一下。当您说“精神疾病”时，我们指的是什么？我们有**精神分裂症**，也许这是一个总称，然后我们还有精神分裂症和精神病。请帮助我们理解一下这些术语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's let's pick up on that. When you say psychotic disorders, what do we mean? We have schizophrenia in one room, an umbrella term perhaps, and then we have schizophrenia and we have psychosis. Help us understand uh sort of the terms there.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的。有精神分裂症和分裂情感性障碍。要被诊断为这些疾病，人们需要满足一定的标准。这些诊断的发病率确实有所增加，但增幅不大。**增幅更大的是一种称为“未特指的精神病”（psychosis not otherwise specified）的诊断**。这是一种像我这样的临床医生在某人明显表现出突出的精神病症状时使用的诊断，比如**偏离现实**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Yeah. So, so there's schizophrenia and schizopeeffective disorders and for people to be diagnosed with those uh conditions they they need to meet certain criteria and and that uh the the incident rate for those diagnoses did have increased a little bit but not that much. The the one that's increased more so is called psychosis not otherwise specified. And this is a diagnosis that clinicians like myself use when somebody is clearly presenting with prominent psychotic symptoms like a deviation from reality.

</details>

**主持人**: 比如**幻觉**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sorry, hallucinations,

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: **妄想**。没错。嗯，但是，但是存在其他问题，阻止我们直接诊断为精神分裂症和分裂情感性障碍。所以，我们知道这个人有精神病，但可能还有其他因素最终导致了这种情况。嗯，比如可能与**物质使用**有关，可能与**医疗状况**有关，等等。所以，这有点像一个“权宜性”诊断。它**绝对是一种精神疾病**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: delusions. Exactly. And uh but but they but there are other issues that prevent us from saying it is clearly schizophrenia and schizoeffective disorder. So, we know that the person's psychotic, but there could be other factors that that may ultimately be contributing to it. Um, like it could be related to substance use, it could be related to medical conditions, etc., etc. So, so it's kind of like a hedge diagnosis. It is definitely a psychotic disorder

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 而且，大多数患有此诊断的个体随着时间的推移，确实会发展为精神分裂症的诊断。这表明在初次诊断时，对于是否是真正意义上的精神分裂症存在一定的不确定性。我不想过度简化，但可以说，正如您提到的，有一套特定的症状，其中一个就是精神分裂症是**慢性的**，是**长期的**，通常是六个月或更长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: and most individuals with this diagnosis do over time evolve to developing a diagnosis schizophrenia. just bel it it suggests a level of uncertainty that is truly schizophrenia at the time of first diagnosis. I don't want to simplify it but fair to say like you like you mentioned the specific set of symptoms one of them is it's chronic with schizophrenia that is longterm that's about usually six months or more

</details>

**主持人**: 正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: correct

</details>

### 图表解读与潜在原因

**主持人**: 好的。我想看一张来自这项研究的图表。这张图显示了**精神分裂症谱系障碍**（为深蓝色）的**发病率比率**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: okay all right I want to look at a graph uh from this study this graph shows the incidence rate ratios for schizophrenia spectrum disorder which is in the dark blue color

</details>

**主持人**: **未特指的精神病**（为绿色），以及**精神疾病**（包括精神分裂症和精神病，为黑色）。现在，对于研究中的每个队列，这是与1975-1979年队列相比。对于精神疾病（黑线），从1985-1989年队列出生的人开始，诊断率逐渐增加。当研究人员分离数据时，显示精神分裂症的发病率略有上升，然后开始下降，但精神病的发生率却像滑雪坡一样增加。这告诉我们什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: psychosis not otherwise specified in green and psychotic disorders which include both schizophrenia and psychosis in black. Now for each cohort studied, this is comparing to the 1975 1979 cohort. For psychotic disorders, the black line, there is a gradual increase in the rate of diagnosis starting with those born in the 198589 cohort. When researchers separated the data, it showed that the rate of schizophrenia goes up slightly but then starts to go down, but the rate of psychosis increases kind of like a ski hill. What is this telling us?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的。所以，如果我们回到“未特指的精神病”和真正意义上的精神分裂症谱系障碍之间的区别。嗯，是**“未特指的精神病”这个稍微不确定的类别**的显著增加。这意味着在初次诊断时，**不确定这是否是真正意义上的精神分裂症**，这意味着随着时间的推移，诊断的复杂性正在增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Yes. So, so if we return to the difference between psychosis not otherwise specified and and uh the something that is like truly a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Uh it is the the the market increase in in the sort of the slightly uncertain category. the psychosis not otherwise specified which means that

</details>

**主持人**: 很多头条新闻都在讨论是什么导致了这种情况。这项研究并没有探讨原因，但请帮助我们理解一下，**已经建立了一些什么样的联系**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: uh at the time of first diagnosis there is is less certainty that this is truly schizophrenia which means that there are there's complexities in in in the diagnosis over time that is increasing the most

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的。所以，我认为第一点很重要，这项研究在**描述发病率随时间的变化方面设计得非常好**。这项具体的研究并不能帮助我们理解为什么会出现我们所观察到的现象。所以，当我想到这些联系时，实际上是在**推断这项研究之外的证据**。嗯，但我想说，我们普遍观察到，在**年轻人**（通常是16至35岁的个体）中，他们比前几代人**受到的污名化要少得多**，并且**更倾向于寻求帮助**。这可能部分解释了为什么我们看到年轻人的发病率在增加。嗯，另一个因素是，随着时间的推移，省级**早期精神病干预项目**得到了更强有力的实施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: yeah so I think the the The first important point is that this study was very well designed to characterize changes in rates over time. There's nothing about this particular study that helps us understand why we're observing what we're observing. So when I think about the links, it's really like extrapolating to evidence beyond this study. Um but I would say uh what we are observing generally amongst young people and these are 16 to 35 year old individuals typically uh what we're observing amongst young people is they are far less stigmatized than previous generations and much more inclined to seek help. So that may partly explain why we're seeing more and younger. Um the other factor is that uh over time there has been more robust um implementation of early psychosis intervention programs proincially.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 所以，当你向一个省投入更多服务时，往往会吸引更多的病例。第三点，也是真正令人担忧的是，**“未特指的精神病”这种诊断率的上升，恰逢大麻合法化**。而大麻合法化带来的一个问题是，年轻人接触到了**高浓度大麻**，而这项研究之外的证据表明，这确实对精神病的发生构成了**严重风险**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: So anytime you put more services into a province it that there's a tendency to pull in more more cases. And then the third piece that that actually is the cause for concern is is the um is the fact that the rise in the less certain diagnosis the not otherwise specified is is occurring dramatically at a time of uh cannabis legalization. And and what comes with cannabis legalization is the young people are exposed with high potency uh cannabis which uh evidence outside of this study suggests does pose a serious risk for the onset of psychosis.

</details>

### 大麻对大脑的影响与性别差异

**主持人**: 大麻，无论是高浓度还是低浓度？嗯，我们谈论的是年轻人的大脑，他们还在发育，大约到25岁。它对大脑有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What does cannabis high high potency or not? Uh these are young brains that we're talking about. We're talking um you know when they're still developing up until about the age of 25. But what what does it do to the brain?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的。嗯，有很多方面。目前还不完全清楚，但似乎有越来越多的证据表明，大麻中的**THC化学物质**会与大脑中的某些受体结合，从而**导致生物学上容易出现精神病**。所以，我的理解是——当然，也有比我更专业的人士——我认为，如果你**容易患上精神疾病**，接触**高浓度大麻可能会增加你患上精神疾病的可能性**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Yeah. So, so there's lot So, it's not entirely clear, but that does seem to uh like there's a there's a aggregation of evidence that suggests that there's something about uh the THC chemical in cannabis that binds with certain receptors in the brain that causes a biological inclination to become psychotic. So the way I think about it and there are there are people who are more better experts than me on this is I think like if you are vulnerable to developing a psychotic disorder, exposure to high potency cannabis may increase your likelihood to develop a psychotic disorder.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。嗯，男性和女性之间有区别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Um is there a difference between uh men and women?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 男性和女性在精神分裂症的发病年龄上存在基线差异。男性**精神病发病年龄更小**。他们往往因此**病情更严重**。男性与女性的比例略高。当然，就大麻风险因素而言，以及实际的服务利用率而言，**年轻男性**很难让他们接受医疗保健。而且他们比女性**更可能滥用物质**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: There's there's been a a baseline difference in men and women in the onset of of schizophrenia. So men develop it uh psychosis at a younger age. They tend to be more disabled as a result of the condition. Uh the ratio of men to women is a little higher in men. And of course uh as it relates to the cannabis risk factor uh and actually to the service utilization. Men, young men are notoriously difficult to engage in healthcare. Uh and they are much more likely to consume substances than women.

</details>

### 大麻合法化政策与挑战

**主持人**: 嗯，我们谈到了2018年的大麻合法化。看看这些数据，当然这只是一个开始。这是正确的决定吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: uh we talked about legalization of course 2018 um looking at this data and of course this is just just the beginning here was that the right call

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的，这是一个重要的问题。政策本质上是一种妥协。我认为2018年的大麻合法化是为了回应几个重要问题。一是，如果你走在多伦多街头，很明显公众有**娱乐性大麻的即时需求**。我是说，这正是人们想要的，所以政策通常会遵循人们的意愿。我也认为，这一点非常重要，当大麻非法时，其非法的后果，比如**因持有而被监禁，并没有公平地发生**。我们知道，**边缘化个体更有可能被监禁**，并因此承担所有负面后果，比如留下犯罪记录等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: yeah so so uh it's it's an important question um the policy is inherently a compromise and I think that the the legalization issue in 2018 responded to a couple of important issues one is that that I mean, if you walk around Toronto, there's clearly a a public interest in having ready access to marijuana recreationally. I mean, that that is just what what people want and so policy follows what what people want typically. I also think, and this is a really important piece, is that um when cannabis was illegal, uh the the consequences of it being illegal, incarceration for possession did not happen equitably. and that we know we knew and that more marginalized individuals were more likely to be incarcerated and have all the negative consequences of having a criminal record etc.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 所以，这是制定政策的一个非常好的、合法的理由。但现在，随着更多证据的出现，我们希望能够做到的是，**监测政策的意外后果**。那么，我们现在该怎么办呢？对我来说，**烟草**可能比酒精是一个更好的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: uh as a result of that. So, so that was a very good legitimate reason to enact the policy. But now as more evidence emerges like this is what we want to be able to do, right? Monitor unintended consequences of policy. So now what do we do? and and and to me like uh tobacco is probably a better example than alcohol.

</details>

**主持人**: 烟草是一种合法的物质，但受到高度管制和重税。所以，我认为存在政策解决方案，可以在**维持政策初衷的益处**与**解决我们正在了解的风险**之间找到妥协或平衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Tobacco is a legal substance, but it's pretty highly regulated and highly taxed. So, you know, I think there are policy solutions to to find that compromise or balance between, you know, maintaining the benefits for which the policy was first enacted at the same time address some of the risks that we're learning about.

</details>

### 诊断的挑战与支持系统

**主持人**: 好的。接受这种诊断对很多人来说可能很可怕。您能解释一下这种诊断对个人或他们生活中的人来说有多么具有挑战性吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. receiving this kind of diagnosis uh can be frightening for many. Um, could you explain how this diagnosis is challenging for the indivi dual or for those who are in their lives as well?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 哦，这……你知道，我的临床工作是在**CAMH急诊部**，这是那种让你真正为患者感到难受的情况之一。嗯，它的表现通常是，它常常是**缓慢发展的现实偏离**，也常常是**缓慢发展的社交退缩**。所以，一个在高中时完全社交活跃、参与一切的年轻男孩，开始退缩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Oh, this is you know my my clinical work is in the CAMH emergency department and this is this is one of those ones where you uh you really feel for the individual. Uh so how it manifests um it typically it is a it often a slowly evolving sort of uh deviation from reality and also often uh a slowly evolving uh social withdrawal that that uh so a young man uh in high school like totally social engaged in everything starts to withdraw from stuff

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 然后开始回避上学，不愿去上学，家人开始注意到他可能在自言自语，有时不恰当地发笑。嗯，这就是它的表现方式。嗯，而且，**个体能够早期获得治疗是极其重要的**，因为我们知道，**未经治疗的时间越长，预后就越差**。如果我们能让人们早期得到治疗，我们就能真正改变一个年轻人的生活轨迹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: then starts like like avoiding school, reluctant to avoid school, family starts noticing that that he might be sort of talking to himself, laughing inappropriately at times. Um, so that's kind of how it it it manifests. Um, and and it's incredibly important that individuals uh have access to care early because we know that the longer an individual goes untreated, the worse the prognosis uh is. like like if we can get people into care early the we can really change the trajectory of a young person's life.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想我知道这个问题的答案，但**是否有足够的**支持来帮助那些寻求治疗的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think I know the answer to this but are there enough supports uh in place for those seeking treatment?

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 嗯，我想说的是，在我们省，我们知道**总体上没有足够的服务来帮助那些患有精神疾病的人**。在这种情况下，与其他心理健康系统的领域相比，我们确实拥有一个**强大的早期精神病干预项目体系**。嗯，但我的研究团队的证据表明，尽管这个省级网络存在，但并非所有患有该疾病的人都能或确实能够获得这些服务。其中一些与**资源不足**有关，一些与**意识不足**有关。所以，例如，如果你是由精神科医生诊断或在医院诊断，你更有可能被转介到这些项目之一，而不是如果你在初级保健中得到治疗。这可能只是一个意识问题。嗯，这是一个大问题，因为我们知道，除了长时间得不到治疗的后果之外，这是一种**致命的疾病**。你知道，在医院被诊断的16至35岁的年轻人，**五分之一的人会在五年内死亡**。如果在门诊诊断，则**四十分之一**。没有人应该在16到35岁之间死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: So uh I would say that um throughout our province we know that we don't have enough services uh for individuals struggling with mental illnesses generally. In this case, we do have a in comparison [clears throat] to other areas of our mental health system, we do have a robust system of early psychosis intervention programs that currently exist. Um, but evidence that has come out of uh my research team suggests that even though this provincial network exists, um not not everybody with the disorder can can can or does access them. And and some of of that has to do with inadequacy of resources. Some of it has to do with awareness. And so, for example, if you're diagnosed by a psychiatrist or diagnosed in a hospital setting, you're much more likely to be referred to one of these programs, excuse [clears throat] me, than if you were managed in primary care. And that's probably just an awareness situation. Um [clears throat] and and the the that's a big problem because uh what we know about the consequences in addition to like you know longer periods of no treatment uh this is a deadly illness that that um you know people who are diagnosed in a hospital these are 16 to 35 year olds uh one in 25 die within 5 years. If you're diagnosed in outpatient setting one in 40 nobody should be dying between the ages of 16 and 35. And

</details>

**主持人**: 他们是怎么死的？最常见的原因是**自杀**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: how do they how do they die? The most common cause is suicide.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 是的。**自杀率非常高**，这完全说得通，因为这些年轻人有自我认知和对未来生活的规划，而这种诊断**彻底动摇了他们的整个身份认同**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: Okay. Yeah. The the suicide rate is is incredibly high and and it just makes sense because these are young people who have a sense of who they are and what they're going to be doing in their life and their whole identity gets rocked by this diagnosis.

</details>

### 总结与展望

**主持人**: 好的。医生，我们就谈到这里。非常感谢您的见解。谢谢您。当然，随着这项研究的深入，未来还会有更多的研究和政策出台。我们期待着。非常感谢您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Uh doctor, we're going to have to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights. Uh thank you for this and of course um with this there will be more things to come out of this in terms of uh research and studies and policy. So, we look forward to that and uh thank you so much.

</details>

**Dr. Paul Kurtak**: 非常感谢您的邀请。
