title: 市场开盘：ADP就业数据疲软与微软AI销售风波
---

### ADP就业数据疲软，降息预期升温

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。我们有新的就业数据出炉了。坦白说，我之前并不知道今天会公布**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing, Inc.：美国自动数据处理公司，每月发布私营部门就业报告）的私营部门就业数据，但数据确实来了，而且有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live and folks, we've got some job data. I actually didn't know we had private ADP payrolls coming out today, but we do. And it's a little ugly.</p>
</details>

尽管数据不佳，但盘前市场仍然是绿色的，我认为我们能够维持这种上涨势头。今天有很多头条新闻要谈，涉及财报、宏观更新，特朗普也谈到了关于人工智能和机器人技术的一些事情，以及他今天可能会宣布的新能源燃料排放标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a little ugly. The pre-markets are green, and I think we can sustain this type of green. Got a lot of headlines to talk about, a lot of different news going on in regards to different earnings, macro updates, Trump saying some things about AI and robotics, and new energy fuel emission standards that he's probably going to be announcing today.</p>
</details>

具体来看，11月份的私营部门就业人数减少了3.2万人，而预期是增加4万人。这里有一些相关报道，但结论再次指向了我们可能需要降息。ADP私营就业公司表示，11月份私营部门就业人数减少了3.2万。这是该系列数据在过去六个月中第四次出现负增长。市场预期是增加4万人，所以这次华尔街的预测偏差很大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the November private payrolls are -32,000 versus 40,000 expected. Here's some coverage on this. But once again, the conclusion is that we probably got to cut rates. ADP private payroll company saying private payroll shed 32,000 workers in November. That's the fourth negative number in the past six months for this series. The estimate was for 40,000. So, the street was off on this one.</p>
</details>

那么，这个数字是怎么来的呢？商品生产行业减少了1.9万名工人，服务生产行业减少了1.3万名工人。但这里的重点，我稍后会展示更多细节，是小型企业的状况，其就业人数减少了12万人。中型和大型企业的表现尚可，分别增加了5.1万和3.9万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how did you get there? Well, goods producing shed 19,000 workers. Service producing shedding 13,000 workers. But the big story here, and I'll show you more detail on this, is what's happening with small business down 120,000. Medium and large business doing okay, up 51 and 39,000, respectively.</p>
</details>

看看这张图表。几乎所有的失业都来自小型企业，自4月份以来的七个月里，有六个月的数据是负数。如果不计入这些损失，ADP的数字实际上会是正的。但你不能排除小型企业。再按行业来看，教育、医疗服务、休闲和酒店业是增长的引领者，但制造业、信息业以及专业和商业服务业都在下降，后者减少了2.6万人，这是就业市场疲软的又一个迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But take a look at this chart here. Virtually all of the job losses have come from small business which has been negative in six of seven months since April. Without those losses, ADP numbers would actually be positive. But you can't get rid of or you can't exclude small business. And then you look at it by sector. Well, we've seen those two sectors do it. Education, health services, legion, hospitality leading the way, but manufacturing down, information down, and professional business services down by 26,000. Also another sign of weakness in the job market.</p>
</details>

对于留任员工，他们的工资上涨了4.4%，比上个月下降了0.1个百分点。而跳槽员工的工资增幅曾是一个重要数字，现在下降了0.4个百分点至6.3%。所以，至少根据ADP的数据，就业市场出现了更多疲软迹象，小型企业正遭受重创。有信息表明，其中部分原因可能是关税带来的冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Job stayers their their wages up 4.4% that's down a tenth from the prior month and job changers that was a big number or had been that's down 4/10 of a point to 6.3%. So at least according to ADP additional weakness in the job market and small business getting hammered and there is some information that some of this may be coming from being hammered by the tariffs.</p>
</details>

### 市场叙事转变：从“坏消息是好消息”到“坏消息就是坏消息”

好吧，看来我们这次降息是跑不掉了。这似乎是不可避免的，对吧？如果我们看看美联储观察工具，我们现在处于有史以来概率最高的时候。好吧，不是有史以来，但在过去几周里，我们一度达到95%左右。然后经历了11月的回调风波，概率降到了30%，现在又回到了88.8%。所以，降息似乎是板上钉钉了。现在甚至有人在讨论是降25个基点还是50个基点。我不认为会降50个基点，25个基点就足以让市场兴奋起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, yeah, we, we're getting this rate cut. It seems kind of inevitable, right? It seems kind of inevitable. If we look at the Fed watch tool, we are at the highest probability we have been at ever. Well, not ever, but in the past couple weeks, we were at like 95% at one point. Then we had the whole November debacle with the draw down. Got to 30%, now we're at 88.8. So, seems likely that we are going to get this rate cut. We got some people now questioning is it 25 or 50? I don't think we're going to get to 50. 25 would be enough to at least get the market excited.</p>
</details>

这里的微妙之处在于，降息的预期现在已经被市场消化了。让我们从投资者的角度来看待利率问题上的“好消息/坏消息”叙事。我们需要足够坏的消息，才能成为好消息，但又不能坏到无可救药，从而达到我们能够获得降息的这个节点。因为两周前，降息概率只有30%左右，我们都在想，天哪，为什么美联储就是不明白我们需要降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The nuance here is that now that the rate cut is baked into the market. So let's put on the perspective of what an investor would be looking at here in regards to the good news bad news type of narrative when it comes to interest rates. We needed bad news that was bad enough to be good but not bad enough to be horrible to get to this point where we would get the rate cut because two weeks ago it was like 30% and all of us were like goodness gracious why can't the Fed understand that we need to cut rates.</p>
</details>

我们已经得到了足够多的坏消息。现在，坏消息可能真的就只是坏消息了，对吧？我们不需要更多更多的坏消息，因为我们已经有足够多了。所以，如果我们继续得到劳动力市场疲软的数据，那可不是什么好事。因为市场已经知道了，美联储也已经知道了，现在最好是看到劳动力市场稳定下来，而不是继续恶化。因为那样会影响市场对我们是否会陷入衰退的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've gotten plenty of that. Now bad news might actually end up being bad news, right? Like we don't need more and more bad news because we we have enough bad news. So now if we keep getting data that the labor market is weak, well that's not the best thing, right? because the market already knows that, the Fed already knows that and now it would be nice to just see the labor market stable, not necessarily deteriorating because then it ends up affecting the market's perception of like, hey, are we getting into a recession?</p>
</details>

所以，如何解读好消息和坏消息，这是一个有趣的小谜题。但我们已经有了足够的坏消息，这些消息需要被市场消化，以促成降息并提高降息的概率。我认为这一点已经实现了。更多的坏消息只会进一步证实这一点。但我们得到的数据越差，就会有越多的人开始思考，降息真的能解决这个问题吗？你不想看到这种情况发生，因为那样一来，市场可能就不会处于最佳状态了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it is a fun little puzzle of how to navigate good news and bad news. But we had enough bad news that needed to be baked in to get these rate cuts and the probabilities of the rate cuts to go higher. I think that has happened. More fuel on the fire only confirms it. But the more and more the worse data we get, the more people start thinking, hey, can a rate cut even solve this issue. And you don't want that happening because then it's like, well, maybe the market's not going to necessarily be in the best position.</p>
</details>

### 加密货币反弹与零售商业绩观察

目前标普500指数上涨了2.28%。看起来我们确实要降息了。看看比特币，周一的时候它还在83,000美元，现在出现了一个不错的反转，回到了93,000美元。顺便说一句，十年期国债收益率略低于一周前的4.1%水平，现在是4.061%。比特币达到93,000美元，这真是个好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But S&P 500 right here up 2.28%. It does look like we're going to get that rate cut. Take a look at Bitcoin. This thing was at 83,000 on Monday. And you're getting a nice little reversal here to 93,000. The 10-year by the way, just below that 4.1 level it was at a week ago now 4.061, but 93 on Bitcoin, which is very nice to see.</p>
</details>

再次强调，美联储几天前结束了**量化紧缩**（Quantitative Tightening, QT: 中央银行减少其资产负债表规模以收紧货币供应的政策），这一点很重要。以太坊也涨到了3,910美元。BMR在盘前上涨了约5.7%，MicroStrategy在盘前也上涨了4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the Fed did end quantitative tightening a couple days ago, and that's important. And then Ethereum as well, 3,910. BMR is up in the pre-market. You're up about 5.7%. Micro Strategy is up in the pre-market, up 4%.</p>
</details>

我想问题是，加密货币是否已经触底？比特币的83,000美元和以太坊的2,640美元是底部吗？显然，很难确定地说那是不是底部。但如果这次反弹是有原因的，我甚至不知道具体是什么头条新闻。昨天有很多空头被清算，这与周日多头的情况正好相反。也许是降息的叙事，也许是流动性的叙事。我不确定核心叙事到底是什么。也许是更多关于加密货币的总统立法即将出台，但这确实在帮助加密货币衍生品股票。Robinhood也从中受益，他们在盘前也上涨了1.62%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess the question is, did we bottom on crypto? Was Bitcoin 83,000, Ethereum 2640 the bottom? Obviously, it's hard to say that it definitely was bottom or not, but if this rebound is baked into something and I don't even know what the headline is on this. I mean, you had a lot of shorts that got liquidated yesterday, which is the opposite of what was happening to the longs on Sunday, but maybe it's the rate cut narrative. Maybe it's the liquidity narrative. I mean, I'm not sure exactly what that core narrative is. Maybe it's a little bit more presidential legislation coming in on crypto, but it is helping the crypto derivative stocks. Hood is also benefiting from that. Robin, they're right. They're up 1.62% in the pre-markets as well.</p>
</details>

PolyMarket显示降息24个基点的概率为94%。是的，看起来降息是会发生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Poly Market 94% chance of a 24 basis point rate cut. Yeah, it seems like it is going to happen.</p>
</details>

这就是我们关于就业数据的情况。昨天我们有很多财报，我们也会谈到。我们还会谈到Marvell，它出现了大幅反弹。今天早上我们有梅西百货的财报。梅西百货表现如何？我其实没看到。我知道他们的营收和利润都超出了预期。股价是涨是跌？梅西百货，我们快速看一下。这是另一家消费品或零售公司。这里没看到他们的财报，但梅西百货股价是下跌的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we got for the jobs data. We had a ton of earnings yesterday. We'll talk about that and we'll get into Marvell, which had a massive rebound. We had Macy's earnings this morning. How did Macy's do? I actually didn't see. I know they beat on the top and bottom. Is the stock up or down? Macy's, let's just take a look at that real quick. That's another consumer company or retailer company. Uh, don't see their earnings right here, but Macy's, are we up? Macy's is down.</p>
</details>

好吧，看来他们的财报不怎么样。昨天我说过我认为梅西百货会表现不佳。原因是我收到了他们的一条通知。我不知道他们用的是什么样的人工智能，但它说：“嘿，Amit，这些女装可能会让你感兴趣。”我看着这条通知心想，我不是女性，所以你为什么要告诉我这个？但无论如何，我们来看看梅西百货的数据，看看他们的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, looks like they didn't have the best earnings. You know, I said that I thought Macy's would be bad yesterday. And the reason for that is because they sent me a notification. I don't know what type of AI they have, but it says, "Hey, Amit these women's clothing finds might interest you." And I'm looking at this notification like I'm not a woman, so like why are you why are you telling me this? But regardless, so we'll take a look at what's going on with Macy's numbers and see see what they've got going on.</p>
</details>

是的，今天将进行Fusaka升级。我需要阅读并理解一下。我知道这与以太坊网络有关。如果有人问我，我真的无法解释以太坊的Fusaka升级到底是什么。我完全不了解，我只是没有花时间去研究它，但我会的。所以，这也可能成为一个催化剂，对整个以太坊网络未来的发展可能很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, this Fusaka upgrade is happening today. Dude, I need to read about this and understand it. I know it has something to do with the Ethereum network. I really couldn't explain what the hell the Fusaka upgrade is on ETH if someone asked me. Like I I I have no clue. I just have not spent the time to look into it, but I will. And so that also could potentially be a catalyst that could be important for the entire Ethereum network as we as we go forward.</p>

### 杰克·马勒斯：为何“逢低买入”在美国依然有效

好的，在我们讨论财报和其他所有事情之前，我想播放一段Jack Mallers的短视频。我并非完全同意Jack Mallers的所有观点。他是比特币的坚定支持者之一。所以这个视频主要与他关于比特币的论点有关，但它提出了一个更广泛的观点。视频时长1分39秒。我认为他昨天提到的一个观点非常有趣，我们已经讨论了一段时间了，那就是本届政府不会让股市出现太大的下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, before we get into the earnings and everything else that we got to talk about, I want to play this quick video right here by Jack Mallers. Now, I don't agree with Jack Mallers on everything. He is one of the people that is very vocal on Bitcoin. And so this video has primarily to do with kind of his argument about Bitcoin, but it makes the broader point. It's a minute and 39 seconds. I thought it was pretty interesting yesterday about something we've been talking about for a while, which is that this administration is not going to let the stock market take that bad of a dip.</p>
</details>

每次下跌都应该买入。美国承担不起资产持续下跌的后果。美国股市是美国的**庞氏骗局**（Ponzi scheme: 一种金融欺诈形式，以后来投资者的钱作为快速回报付给早期投资者，以制造盈利假象）式退休账户。他们需要它来为美国人储存财富，并让美国人通过财富变现来获得税收收入。如果美国股市年增长率达不到10%到15%，它就会破产，因为它无法支付其债务的利息。所以，所有的下跌都应该被买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buy every dip. The United States cannot afford to have assets go down over a persistent time frame. The US stock market is a Ponzi retirement account for the United States. They need it to both store wealth for Americans and for Americans to monetize wealth where they earn tax receipts. If the US doesn't have a stock market that's up 10 to 15% a year, it is insolvent because it cannot afford the interest payments on its debt. So, all dips should be bought.</p>
</details>

这些下跌都不是在暗示比特币会跌到1万美元。这些下跌也与猫无关。我对猫过敏，是真的。你们每周都能了解到关于我的新事情。我身体上对猫过敏，不能和猫待在一起。所以我对猫一无所知，更不用说**死猫反弹**（Dead Cat Bounce: 金融术语，指资产价格在经历长期下跌后，短暂且小幅度的反弹）了。我对此一无所知。这一切都与全球流动性有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">None of these dips scream Bitcoin's going to 10K. None of these dips are talking about cats. I'm allergic to cats. Literally, I am. You learn something new about me every single week. I am physically allergic to cats. I can't be around cats. So, I know nothing about a cat, a dead cat bouncing. I know nothing about it. This is all to do with global liquidity.</p>
</details>

关键是我们正处于流动性紧缩之中。这也是我一直以来的主题，今天量化紧缩（QT）结束了。所以，首先告诉大家，QT今天结束了。**量化宽松**（Quantitative Easing, QE: 中央银行通过购买资产来增加货币供应，以刺激经济）很可能在短期内恢复。我们很可能会迎来降息。特朗普说过，他已经明确表示，他知道自己想让谁担任美联储主席。他们将被允许无限使用杠杆购买国债，创造大量信贷和新货币。我们有50年期抵押贷款，有刺激支票，有中期选举。我知道我为此承受了很多，但我认为这个周期比特币会达到25万到100万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The point is we're in the middle of a liquidity crunch. Again, that's kind of been my consistent theme is that today QT ended. So, first of all, for all of you, QT ended today. Quantitative easing QE is very likely to resume in the near term. We're very likely to get rate cuts going forward. Trump he said in communicated I know exactly who I want as my Fed chair. They're going to be allowed to use unlimited leverage for treasuries. Create a lot of credit. Create a lot of new money. We have 50-year mortgage. We have stimulus checks. We have midterms. I know I take a lot of for it. I think this cycle is 250k to a million.</p>
</details>

好吧，我不知道比特币是否会达到25万到100万美元，但他是对的。视频的前30秒，他是对的。还有那个关于猫的事情让我笑了。昨晚看的时候我就在想，他为什么在谈论猫和死猫？我觉得那段很有趣，他成功逗笑我了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I don't know if it's 250K to a million, but he's right. The first 30 seconds of the video, he's right. And and the cat thing got me. Like when I watched last night, I was like, why is he talking about a cat and the dead cat? I was like, that was good. That was good. You got me there. That was good.</p>
</details>

但看，他是对的。归根结底，特朗普政府明白他们背负着沉重的债务。能够将这些债务货币化或继续为其融资的唯一方法就是实现增长。而实现增长的唯一途径是确保有激励措施，让投资者，也就是你我，愿意投入资本并相信美国的市场故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But look, he's right. At the end of the day, the Trump administration understands that they are levered up on debt. The only way to monetize that debt or to be able to continue financing that debt is if they grow. And the only ability to grow is to make sure that there is an incentive for investors aka you and I to want to grow or want to grow into our capital and believe in the story of America of this market.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普政府的机器人产业雄心

你能相信的两个故事是什么？一个是美联储将放松政策，这是一个非常重要的故事；另一个是人工智能是真实存在的。所以，今天早上特朗普有很多不同的举措，我们将会讨论，特别是与机器人技术有关的。这实际上也印证了特斯拉在盘前上涨的原因，因为有一些关于特朗普政府将在机器人技术方面采取行动的传闻。特斯拉股价上涨了1.1%，他们很可能成为机器人领域的重要参与者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what are the two stories that you can believe in that the Fed is going to ease that's a really big story and that AI is real. And so we got a lot of different initiatives by Trump this morning that we'll talk about especially that have to do with robotics that actually kind of reinforces the reason Tesla's up in the pre-market is because you got some rumors about what the Trump administration is going to be doing with robotics. Tesla, they're up 1.1%. Tesla likely going to be a big player in robotics.</p>
</details>

但我认为特朗普政府知道，在未来四年里，他们必须实现3.5%到4%的GDP增长，才有可能确保债务和赤字是可持续的。所以，昨晚我和史蒂夫讨论过，每一次下跌都是买入的机会。这并不意味着如果市场下跌5%，你就应该立刻出去买入。它的意思是，如果你有需要配置的资本，并且需要将其配置到你认为能够增长的领域，当市场出现像两周前那样的极端恐慌时，很多股票都在打折出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the Trump administration knows the next four years they've got to get that GDP growth of 3.5 to 4% if they have any chance of making sure that the debt is sustainable and that the deficit is sustainable. So, you know, Steve and I were talking about this last night. Every dip is viable. Now, that doesn't mean if we have like a 5% dip, you just go out and start buying. It it means that if you have capital that needs to be allocated and it needs to be allocated into something that you think can grow when the market does present opportunities like extreme fear that we had two weeks ago and you know a lot of stocks were on sale.</p>
</details>

你还能把钱投到哪里去呢？显然，你可以持有现金，可以投资黄金、白银、房地产，但总得有东西让它增值。而政府与确保股市增长有着独特的联系，这就是为什么每一次下跌都是买入机会的更广泛论据。到目前为止，对于在过去一个月里利用了这一机会的人来说，效果还不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like where else are you going to put your money? You know, obviously you could leave it in cash, you could put it into gold, silver, real estate, but there's something that has to let it grow. And the administration is uniquely tied to making sure that the stock market grows, which is the broader argument around why every dip is viable. And so far, that has done well for people that took advantage of it over the past month.</p>
</details>

特斯拉股价434美元，BMR上涨5.6%，Robinhood上涨1.4%，MicroStrategy上涨3%。那么英伟达呢？这只股票昨晚一直在波动。哇，英伟达183.38美元。好的，又上涨了1%。昨天它确实达到了185.60美元。如果我们能让它回升到190美元，我认为那也将非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tesla right there 434, BMR, that's up 5.6%. Robin up 1.4. Micro Strategy up three. And then where's Nvidia? This one was moving overnight. Wow. Nvidia 183.38. All right, so that's up another 1%. It did hit 185.60 yesterday. If we can get that moving back up to 190, I think that would be very exciting as well.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，12月3日，也就是今天，往往是12月份的局部底部。从历史上看，自1950年以来，12月3日往往是这个月最糟糕的一天。所以，也许我们正准备迎接盘前市场的一次“拉地毯”式下跌，白天的情况会更糟。但从历史上看，过去75年里一直都是这样。

<details>

<p class="english-text">By the way, December 3rd, which is today, tends to be the local bottom for December. Uh, historically since 1950, December tends to be uh December 3rd tends to be the worst day of the month. So, maybe we're getting set up for a little bit of a rug pull from the pre-markets and things are going to be uglier throughout the day. But if it is historically, that's how it has always been over the past 75 years.</p>

### 突发：一则微软AI报道引发市场震荡

好的，我们来谈谈财报，然后再谈谈我们有的其他一些头条新闻。Marvell的财报非常出色，营收和利润都超出了预期。他们对某些利润率的指引略低于预期。这只股票曾下跌10%，但随后反弹上涨15%，现在在盘前上涨9%。他们在财报中表示，他们以32亿美元收购的人工智能公司将增加10亿美元的收入。他们还就与英伟达在某些类型的芯片设计上竞争发表了一些评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's get into earnings and then we'll get into some of the other headlines we've got. So, uh, Marvell crushed earnings. They beat on the top of the bottom. Their guidance for some of their margins were a little bit lower than expected. This stock was down 10%. It reversed up 15% now up 9% in the pre-markets. Uh, they said on their earnings that the AI acquisition that they did, they paid $3.2 billion for it is going to add a billion dollars in revenue. They also made some comments about competing with Nvidia and certain types of chip design.</p>
</details>

市场究竟喜欢它的哪一点并不完全清楚，但我想如果你非要找个原因，那就是他们增加了10亿美元的收入，而他们为此收购公司支付了32亿美元。所以，我认为这就像是增加了更多的增长，而华尔街甚至在早上收购消息出来时都没有预料到这一点。所以，如果你持有Marvell，昨天你经历了一系列的情绪波动，但它表现得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's it's it's not exactly clear what the market loved about it, but I think if you had to put your finger on it, it would be that they're adding a billion dollars in revenue and they paid 3.2 billion for a company to uh get that billion in revenue. So that I think is just like adding more growth and the street didn't expect that even when the acquisition news came out earlier in the morning. So if you have Marvell took you through a bunch of emotions yesterday, but that one did very well.</p>
</details>

今天盘后，我们有Snowflake和Path的财报，我知道很多人都感兴趣。Snowflake在盘前上涨了1.5%，而Path也上涨了约2%。在Marvell之后，还有American Eagle Outfitters，它再次超出了预期。他们将指引提高了4倍，这有点疯狂，并且每股收益超出了20%。你可以将其归功于Sydney Sweeney，也可以说美国零售商有可支配收入。

<p class="english-text">Today after the bell, we have Snowflake and Path that I know a lot of people are interested in. Snowflake up 1.5% in the pre-markets and then you got PATH right here also up about 2%. Uh and then after Marvell you add American Eagle Outfitters which once again crushed expectations. They increased their guidance by 4x which is kind of crazy and they beat EPS by 20%. Uh you can call it Sydney Sweeney or you can say the American retailer has disposable income.</p>
</details>

American Eagle、Burlington Coat Factory、Best Buy、Abercrombie、Urban Outfitters。这些公司本不应该有如此大规模的盈利超预期，但它们做到了。要么是人工智能提高了它们的效率，从而提高了利润率，要么是消费者在消费。在这种情况下，似乎是消费者在消费，American Eagle在盘前上涨了15%。

<p class="english-text">American Eagle, uh, Burlington Coat Factory, Best Buy, Abercrombie, Urban Outfitters. These are not companies that should be having these massive, massive beats on earnings, and they are. And either it's AI making them more efficient, so their margins are going up or the consumer spending. And in this case, it seems that the consumer is spending 15% of the pre-market for American Eagle.</p>
</details>

对此有两个看空的理由。一是消费者正在使用信贷消费，这很糟糕，因为这意味着有很多钱他们可能无法偿还。第二个看空的理由是，是富裕的消费者在进行所有这些消费，使得财报看起来很好。但已经有八九家零售领域的公司公布了这些非常好的数据。所以我不知道是否是富裕的消费者在进行所有这些消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the two bare cases to that is that the consumer is spending on credit and that uh so so that's bad because that means there's a lot of money that they might not pay back. The second bare case is that it's a wealthy consumer that's spending all this money to make the earnings look good, but it's just it's been like eight or nine companies that have put up these really good numbers from the retailer space. So, I don't know if the wealthiest consumer is the one that's doing all of that spending.</p>
</details>

昨晚有一些报道流传，称黑色星期五95%的消费都是通过融资完成的。这些都没有得到证实。我唯一的来源是一个在推特上写了这篇文章并走红的人。我不知道他从哪里得到这些数字。所以我确定其中很大一部分是融资，很大一部分是信用卡、先买后付等等。你还必须看到所有提供5%现金返还的公司，如果你使用先买后付，以及他们提供的各种激励措施和不同东西的细微差别。但说95%是融资，除非我看到确切的来源，否则那可能不是事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There were some reports going around last night that said 95% of the spending in Black Friday was finance. None of that has been confirmed. Like the only source I have is this guy who wrote it and went viral on Twitter. It's like I don't know where he got those numbers from. So, I'm sure a ton of it was finance. I'm sure a ton of it was credit cards, buy now pay later, etc. You also have to look at the nuance of all the companies that were giving 5% cash back if you use buy now pay later and all the incentives they had and different things. But 95% of it being financed. I mean, until I see a source for exactly that being the case, then that might not be what happened.</p>
</details>

所以，我们将来会看看这些零售商的财报会是什么样子，以及这对我们经历的所有黑色星期五销售意味着什么。J，谢谢你的超级留言。我得承认，请买一个比特币然后忘了它。昨晚我跟史蒂夫谈到这个。明年我想**定投**（Dollar-Cost Averaging, DCA: 在固定时间间隔内投资固定金额的策略）的两样东西，过去几年我真的没有开始定投，就是老牌的标普500指数。也许应该开始买那个了。还有比特币。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, we're going to kind of see in the future what these retailer earnings look like and what it means for all these Black Friday sales that we also had. J, thank you for the super chat. got to admit, please buy one Bitcoin and forget about it. You know, I was telling Steve about this last night. The two things I want to DCA into next year that I have really no I've not started a DCA into for the past couple years is the good old S&P 500. Should probably start buying that thing. Um, and Bitcoin. So, I think I think we'll do that next year.</p>
</details>

我想我们明年会这么做。我们会开两个独立的Robinhood账户，每个月往标普500和比特币里投点钱，确保我们开始定投。标普500是比较安全的选择。有人可能会说，如果我们继续像现在这样大量印钞，比特币才是更安全的选择。但是，是的，我确实计划就往里面投点钱。不管价格如何，我相信20年后，我会为自己这么做而感到高兴。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We'll open two separate Robin Hood accounts and just throw some money every month at the S&P and Bitcoin and uh we'll make sure we start that DCA. S&P is more the safe one. One could argue Bitcoin is the more safe one if we keep printing as much money as we print. But yes, I I I do plan to just throw some money in there. Regardless of what the price is, you know, 20 years from now, I'm sure I'll be happy that I did that.</p>
</details>

Robinhood股价上涨约1%，特斯拉上涨0.9%。好的，让我们转到特斯拉的新闻。特斯拉在机器人技术方面会发生什么？这就是我们昨晚所有的财报更新。我们只有两份财报。今天盘后，我们会有更多的财报。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Robin right here up about 1% then Tesla up .9%. All right, so let's transition to the Tesla news. What's going to happen with Tesla in terms of robotics? And that was all the earnings updates that we had from last night. We only had two earnings. Today after the bell, we'll have a lot more earnings.</p>
</details>

这很有趣。特朗普政府正计划加速美国的机器人技术发展。Politico报道称，商务部长Lutnik一直在与机器人公司的CEO们会面，并可能在明年发布一项行政命令。该倡议是在政府的人工智能加速计划之后提出的，据报道，一个联邦机器人工作组正在筹备中，新的立法也在制定中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, this was pretty interesting. So, the Trump administration is planning to accelerate US robotics development. Politico says Commerce Secretary Lutnik has been meeting with robotic CEOs and made back an executive order next year. The initiative follows the administration's AI acceleration plan with a federal robotics working group reportedly in the works and new legislation under construction.</p>
</details>

我觉得这很有趣，因为其核心是，一位商务部发言人说：“我们致力于机器人技术和先进制造业，因为它们对于将关键生产带回美国至关重要。”他们将宣布成立一个机器人工作组。这基本上就是他们为人工智能所做的事情。他们有一个类似人工智能沙皇的角色，由David Sacks担任，他上周末因为一些言论与《纽约时报》发生了一些争议，他们对他进行了一次大规模的负面报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought this was really interesting because at its core, you had a Department of Commerce spokesperson said, "We are committed to robotics and advanced manufacturing because they are essential to bringing critical production back to the United States." And they're going to be announcing a robotics working group. This is essentially what they did for AI. And they had like an AI czar, which is David Sacks, who had to deal with some controversy with the New York Times the uh over the weekend in terms of what he was saying, but and they just did like a massive hit piece on him.</p>
</details>

但人工智能机器人技术生态系统是事物发展的方向。如果你有一个机器人沙皇，那也将非常重要。为了得到那样的机器人沙皇，你需要激励公司们认识到机器人技术是一件大事。所以也许我们会得到，也许不会，但这对于特斯拉、Figure、谷歌来说都非常重要。顺便说一句，谷歌在一家名为Atronic的机器人公司持有股份。所以有很多公司都在追逐这个人形机器人技术生态系统。亚马逊，显然，这对他们来说将是一件大事，但我们还需要看看这是否会实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but the the AI robotics ecosystem is how things are going to grow. If you had a robotic czar, that would also be really important. And in order to get that type of robotic czar, well, you would need to incentivize companies to feel that robotics is a big deal. And so maybe we're going to get that, maybe we don't, but that would be very important for Tesla, Figure, Google, which by the way, Google has a stake in a robotics company called Atronic. So there's a lot of companies that are going after this humanoid robotics ecosystem. Amazon. Obviously, that would be a massive deal for them, but we're gonna need to see if that plays out.</p>

你们为什么说它在下跌？好的。是的，比特币下跌了大约700美元。那是一个700美元的蜡烛图。我不知道这是市场行为还是仅仅是比特币的行为。哦，它还在继续下跌。它会跌破92吗？标普。哦，不。标普。好的，是所有东西都在跌。不，是所有东西，不仅仅是比特币。好的，有什么新闻吗？这不一定是一次暴跌，但我很好奇为什么所有东西都变红了。标普指数正式转为红色。Hood，看看那个红色蜡烛图。BMR刚刚下跌了2%。哇，这太奇怪了。

</details>

如果只是比特币，我会……哇，比特币刚刚下跌了1000美元。嗯。伊朗继续下跌。我们稍后会谈到伊朗。它比昨天下降了15%，现在又下降了1%。英伟达即将转红。嗯？

12月3日。伙计，我喜欢这些小的宏观统计数据，当你们因为市场下跌而责备我时，我就可以说：“伙计们，看看74年来的数据。它说12月3日是我们的底部。所以你们不需要生我的气。我只是数据的传递者。”但这确实很奇怪。不仅仅是比特币，是所有东西。

我想知道这是否只是一个算法故障，然后会立刻反弹回来。但已经有一段时间了，在盘前市场我们没有看到几乎所有东西在上涨近3%到4%后突然暴跌。看看微软。为什么微软下跌了2%？看看那个。就看看那个图表，在几秒钟内。从490美元跌到480美元。这与其说是2%或1%的跌幅，不如说是所有东西都以同样的方式下跌。ADP就业报告是一个小时前发布的。

微软下调AI软件销售配额。哦，天哪。当然是《The Information》的报道。为什么？当然会是《The Information》。微软下调AI销售配额。好的，让我们看看。微软最好别毁了圣诞节，兄弟。纳德拉最好别毁了圣诞节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Microsoft lowers AI software sales quotas. Oh boy. Of course it's the information. Well, why? Of course it would be the information. Microsoft lowers AI sales quota. Okay, let's see. Microsoft better not ruin Christmas, bro. Nadella better not ruin Christmas.</p>
</details>

### 市场实时反应与深度分析

好了，各位，头条新闻来了。微软因客户抵制新产品而下调AI软件销售配额。哇，12月3日出现了一些看空AI的新闻。所有东西都在这里受到冲击。显然，这是微软。微软是一家非常大的人工智能公司。天哪，所有东西都受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, here's the headline, guys. Microsoft lowers AI software sales quotas as customers resist newer products. Wow, some bearish AI news on December 3rd. Um, everything getting hit right here. Obviously, it's Microsoft. Microsoft's a very big AI company. My goodness, everything getting hit.</p>
</details>

所以，这件事发生的原因，就在我实时反应的时候，是如果市场有任何一丝认为人工智能不是真实的迹象，并且你有一家**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscaler: 指提供大规模云计算服务的公司，如亚马逊AWS、微软Azure、谷歌云）出来说我们必须下调我们的预测，因为我们看不到客户采用这些人工智能工具，那么无论这是真是假，市场都会做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the reason this is happening just as I'm reacting to it in real time, if there is even a hint of the market thinking AI is not real, and if you have a hyperscaler come out and saying we have to lower our forecast because we don't see customers adopting these AI tools, whether it's true or not, that market's going to react.</p>
</details>

市场会做出反应。现在的问题是这份报告的质量，因为微软一周前刚刚开完一个大型会议，他们在会上谈论他们的代理生态系统和工作流程如何与他们的用户群整合等等。他们基本上是在说需求很好。而且，微软明年将在资本支出上花费1200亿美元，如果客户抵制人工智能产品，你是不会这么做的。所以我很难……我不是说这份报告是假的，但我很难断定这份报告是完全准确的，鉴于微软所说的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Market's going to react. Now the question is the quality of this report because Microsoft just got done having a big conference um a week ago where they were talking about how their agentic ecosystem and workflows are uh integrating with their user base yada yada right like they're basically saying demand is good also Microsoft is going to spend $120 billion next year on capex you don't do that if customers are resisting AI products so I'm struggling to I'm not saying the report is fake but I am struggling to conclude that the report is necessarily fully accurate given the things that Microsoft has said.</p>
</details>

而且，我只有这个标题。我没有看到更多信息。如果报告是真的，那么纳德拉就需要解释一下了。纳德拉可能得出来说：“是的，我们之前谈论的所有那些巨大的需求，我们是在撒谎。”我不认为纳德拉会说他撒谎了，尤其是因为他两周前才说过。除非我误解了他的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and again, that's the only thing I have. I'm seeing if I can get the article. The only thing I have is this headline. I don't see much more than that. If the report is true, then Nadella's got some explaining to do. And Nadella might have to come out and say, "Yeah, all that great demand stuff we were talking about, we were lying about it." Which I don't think Nadella is gonna say he lied about it. uh especially because he said it two weeks ago unless I misinterpreted what he said.</p>
</details>

另一个问题是，《The Information》到底是怎么得到这份报告的？另外，这是否只是针对一个产品类别和一个垂直领域，比如在金融领域，如果不是每个人都在使用Copilot？这是论点吗？但是，当你说下调AI软件销售配额时，你谈论的是像一个公开财报那样的评论，他们是从某个与微软关系密切的人那里泄露出来的。因为当你说一家公司下调他们的销售配额时，那就像是一个合法的，就像一个投资者需要知道的事情，对吧？那不是某个随机的、一次性的头条新闻，特别是如果你要下调指引或类似的事情，那就像是非常严肃的公司经济数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other question is how the hell did the information get this report? Also, is it just like one product category and one vertical like in finance if not everyone is adopting co-pilot? Is that the argument? But like when you say lower AI software sales quota, you're talking about like a a public earnings type of uh comment which they got leaked from someone who is close to Microsoft because when you say when you say a company lowers their sales quota that that's like a legit like it's like a legit like some something that investors need to know, right? That's not some random one-off piece of headline, especially if you're lowering guidance or something like that's like very serious type of economic data for a company.</p>
</details>

英伟达还在下跌。标普指数进一步下跌。看，标普指数之前是平的，现在实际上在下跌。比特币继续下跌。Hoodie刚刚失去了所有涨幅。Marvell从10%跌到了6%。英伟达下跌2%，Nebius下跌1%，Meta下跌1%。哇，这一下子成了今天的大新闻。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nvidia still going down. S&P going down even further. There you go. 0.2 S&P was flat and now it's actually dumping. Bitcoin continuing to go down. Uh Hoodie just lost all of its gains. Marvell just went from 10% to 6%. Nvidia down two. Nebius down one. Meta down one. Wow. This just became the story of the day.</p>
</details>

如果这与Azure无关，那就无所谓了。是的。我的意思是，如果这与Copilot有关，你知道，我同意。这听起来绝对像是MIT的报告，但话又说回来，他们把微软牵扯进来了。微软是家大公司。微软在Teams错误地定位客户后削减了AI销售配额，每个用户每月30美元的Copilot附加组件，客户坚持使用普通的Office 365。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If it's not related to Azure, it's a nothing burger. Yeah. I mean, if it's related to co-pilot and like, you know, I agree. It sounds like the It absolutely sounds like the MIT report, but then again, they're attaching Microsoft to it. Microsoft's a big deal. Microsoft cuts AI sales code after Teams mis-targets customers back at 30 bulk at $30 user per month. Copilot add-on, sticking with plain Office 365.</p>
</details>

好的。所以，从Cactus那里得到的标题有更多的细微差别，是客户拒绝Copilot。再次强调，The Information是如何得到这些信息的？这是更广泛的问题，比如微软的谁告诉了他们这些？因为事情是这样的。如果The Information采访了一些客户，他们说，是的，我们不使用Copilot，因为我们从中得不到任何价值。那没问题。但报告却说微软降低了他们的销售配额，因为我们匿名采访的一些客户说他们不喜欢Copilot。我的意思是，我不知道。我不知道这是否足以构成论据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, so some more nuance of the headline from Cactus right there is co-pilot rejection from customers again. How did the information get this in this information? That that is the the broader question like who at Microsoft told them this because here's the thing. If the information talked to some customers and and they were like yeah we're not using Copilot because we don't get any value out of it. That's fine. But then for the report to be Microsoft lowers their sales quota because some customers that we've uh anonymously talked to say that they don't they don't like copilot. I mean that's just I don't know. I don't know if that's enough to make the argument.</p>
</details>

作为投资者，你可以从那个标题中推断出任何你想要的东西。说微软降低了销售配额，尤其是在他们刚刚举办了一场活动，首席商务官还在谈论他们的Copilot代理企业有多么强大的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can extrapolate whatever you want as an investor from that headline. say Microsoft lowers sales quotas, especially when they just had a an event where the chief business officer talked about how strong their co-pilot Agentic enterprise has been.</p>
</details>

我不知道。这太奇怪了。我们还没有得到任何相关报道。我没看到有人在谈论这件事，但显然股市正在对此做出反应。我认为我们得给市场一点时间，看看他们怎么想。当然，当市场开盘时，你可能会得到关于这条新闻的更多细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. That's weird. We're not getting any coverage on it yet. I don't see anyone talking about it, but obviously the stock market is reacting to it. I I think we got to give the market a second to see how they think of this. Uh, and definitely when the market opens, you're going to probably get more details on this piece of news.</p>
</details>

### 微软官方回应，市场情绪反转

要么这条新闻被认真对待，现在所有东西都在像落下的刀子一样下跌；要么这条新闻根本无足轻重，我们会迅速反弹到盘前的位置。我认为非此即彼。我认为这将是一个剧烈的向上或向下的反应。但你得给市场一些时间，我想，可能是一两个小时，来获取更多关于这条新闻的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Either this news is taken seriously and everything is a falling knife right now or this news is an absolute nothing burger and we are quickly going to rebound to where we were in the pre-market. Like I think it's one or the other. I think it's going to be a violent reaction up or down. But you're just going to have to give the Amazon down 0.45. You're going to have to give the market some time, I think, which that time might be at, you know, maybe an hour or two to just get more data on this news.</p>

</details>

尽管进行了积极推广，但采用速度一直很慢。像Informatica这样拥有5000名员工的云软件公司，就是这种不情愿的例证。尽管符合Copilot的理想客户画像，但他们并未承诺进行广泛推广。客户通常坚持使用核心的Office 360工具，在预算紧张的情况下，将AI附加组件视为非必需品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Despite aggressive promotion, adoption has been slow. Companies like Informatica, a cloud software firm with 5,000 employees, exemplify the reluctance despite fitting the ideal profile for co-pilot, they have not committed to the widespread rollout. Customers often stick with core Office 360 tools, viewing AI add-ons as a non-essential amid budget constraints.</p>
</details>

引用“配额削减与重组”。这标志着在2025年销售团队裁员和内部批评之后，销售目标罕见地向下修正。这是简化AI销售宣传的更广泛努力的一部分，旨在整合解决方案领域以减少混乱并提高效率。听起来他们是从一些心怀不满的微软员工那里获得这些消息的，从措辞来看是这样。

</details>

为提高采用率的战略回应。微软正在加速Copilot的推广并捆绑垂直AI工具。该公司还在实现AI提供商的多样化。我们知道这一点。此举反映了全行业AI货币化的障碍，Salesforce等竞争对手也表达了类似的困难。分析师指出，2025年通过更便宜的硬件和优化的功能有增长潜力，但警告说，如果投资回报率不明确，持续的抵制将继续存在。

Analysts know potential for growth in 2025 via cheaper hardware and refined features, but warn of the ongoing resistance if the ROI is unclear.</p>
</details>

好的，无论The Information从哪里得到的消息，听起来都像是微软的员工，他们因为不得不销售这个实际上卖不出去的产品而感到恼火。是的，听起来像是企业没有达到他们的目标。你们很多人说Copilot很糟糕，我从很多人那里听过很多次，所以我从没用过。但我听过很多次，所以我不怀疑你们说的是对的。

<p class="english-text">All right, so whatever source the information got, it sounds like Microsoft employees that are getting annoyed of having to sell this if it's not actually being sold.

Um, but I I've heard it plenty of times, so I wouldn't doubt that you're wrong there.</p>
</details>

问题是微软在说什么。我记得两周前开车去看牙医的时候，我在车里播放微软首席商务官的讲话，听他谈论Copilot有多重要，表现有多好等等。所以，从我听到的来看，他对此非常兴奋。现在，也许他一直在胡说八道。或者也许这份报告是假的。非此即彼。但它正在伤害市场，正如我们现在所看到的。

### 深度分析：AI巨头的人才战与商业化困境

说到人工智能，我们来看看其他几件事。这里有两段我想给大家看的视频，来自Mark Chen。Mark Chen在OpenAI工作，微软持有其股份。他是首席研究官。他在一个播客中说了几段话，我觉得很有趣。第一段是关于扎克伯格为了从OpenAI挖走人才所做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of AI, let's uh take a look at a couple of other different things. So, you had two clips that I wanted to show everybody right here uh from Mark Chen. Mark Chen works at Open AI, which Microsoft owns a stake in. He is um the chief research officer. Here's a couple of clips in a podcast he said that I thought were pretty interesting. First clip is uh what Zucks has been doing to get talent away from OpenAI.</p>
</details>

你知道，Meta，他们试图挖走很多人，但都不是很成功。给你个背景，在我的团队里，我的直接下属中，在他们从OpenAI雇佣任何人之前，我想他们试图挖走我一半的直接下属，但他们都拒绝了。当然，如果他们每年有大约100亿美元的资本用于人才招募，他们总能招到一些人。所以我实际上觉得我们在保护顶尖人才方面做得相当不错。看到事情随着时间升级，也挺有趣和好玩的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, Meta, they've gone after a lot of people quite unsuccessfully. So just to give you context, right, within my staff, within my direct reports, uh before they hired anyone from open, I think they went after half of my direct reports and they all declined. Um and of course, you know, if they have something like $10 billion of capital per year to deploy towards talent, um they're going to get someone. So I actually feel like we've been fairly good about protecting our top talent. And you know it it's been kind of interesting and fun to see it escalate over time.</p>
</details>

这里有些有趣的故事，Isak（可能是指Yann LeCun或另一位高管）实际上亲自去给那些他想从我们这里挖走的人送汤，只是为了表明他愿意付出多大的努力。是的，我想他是亲手煮的汤，你知道，当时这让我很震惊，但随着时间的推移，我开始意识到这些事情可以用它们自己的方式发挥作用。

<p class="english-text">Um you know uh some interesting stories here are Isak actually went and yeah hand delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us like a just a just to show how far he would. Yeah. I think he he handcooked the soup and and you know it was it was shocking to me at the time but you know over time it kind of update towards these things can be effective in their own way right.</p>
</details>

所以，对于那些重仓Meta的人来说，用Mark Chen的话说，有人正在亲手为OpenAI最优秀的研究科学家送汤，以吸引他们离开加入Meta，而且他成功挖走了一些人。我的意思是，夏天的时候确实有很多人离开了。然后是下一段我觉得有趣的视频，这是Mark Chen对Gemini 3的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so for those that are heavy meta you've got someone who's in the words of Mark Chen hand delivering soup to some of the best research uh scientists at opening eye to get them to leave to meta and some of them he was successful I mean a lot of them did leave back in the summer and then here was the next clip that I thought was interesting uh this Is Mark Chen responding to Gemini 3?</p>
</details>

是的。具体说到Gemini 3，你知道，它是一个非常好的模型。我认为我们做的一件事是努力建立共识，你知道，基准测试只能告诉你这么多。仅仅看基准测试，我们实际上感到非常有信心。我们内部有性能达到Gemini 3水平的模型，我们很有信心很快就会发布它们，并且我们能发布比它们更好的后续模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. So, um to speak to Gemini 3 specifically, you know, it's a pretty good model. Um and I think one thing we do is try to build consensus, you know, um the benchmarks only tell you so much. Um and just looking purely at the benchmarks, you know, we actually felt quite confident. um you know we have models internally that uh perform at the level of Gemini 3 and we're pretty confident that we will release them soon and we can release successor models that are even better.</p>
</details>

但再次强调，基准测试只能告诉你这么多，而且我认为每个人都用自己的方式来探索模型。我喜欢给模型们一个数学问题。到目前为止，还没有一个模型能完全解决它，即使是那些会思考的模型。所以，是的，我会等待那个时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but yeah again kind of the benchmarks only tell you so much and I you know I I think everyone probes uh the models in their own way there there is this math problem I like to give the models uh I I think so far none of them has quite cracked it even the thinking models um so yeah I'll wait for that.</p>
</details>

我觉得那些片段相当有趣，因为根据我们看到的报道，OpenAI对Gemini 3一直处于某种“红色警戒”状态。他们将不得不很快推出一个新模型。事实上，他们可能会推迟一些OpenAI的商业应用，比如广告，以便推出一个更好的模型。所以你可以看出，他们内部是感到害怕的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I thought those clips were rather interesting because OpenAI has had this sort of code red based on Gemini 3 based on the reports that we've seen. They're going to have to come out with a new model pretty soon. In fact, they might be delaying some of their business applications of OpenAI in terms of advertising in order to come out with a model that's better. So, you can tell internally they are scared.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，即使是那个谈论它的人，他对Gemini 3也很客气，但他也像是在说，“嘿，别把我们排除在外。我们仍然有非常强大的模型，可能更好。”问题是，谷歌有数千亿美元可以用来继续做这件事。现在，OpenAI有战争基金，但他们的战争基金没有谷歌那么大，他们的员工也没有谷歌那么多。所以，这真的归结到人才问题上了。这就是为什么那段关于人才和扎克伯格挖走人才的视频如此重要，因为如果扎克伯格正在挖走你最优秀的人才，也许扎克伯格不会推出比Gemini 3更好的模型。但如果他从OpenAI挖走了最优秀的人才，也许他们也做不到了，因为他们没有钱来支付那些人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, even the way the guy that was talking about it, he was uh nice to Gemini 3, but he's also like, "Hey, don't count us out. Like, we still have models that are very sufficient and probably better." Uh, the problem is Google just has hundreds of billions of dollars they can use to keep doing. Now, OpenAI has a war chest, but they don't have a war chest as big as Google, and they don't have as many employees as Google. So, it really comes down to the talent at this point. And that's why that clip about the talent and Zux taking town talent was super important because if Zux is taking your best talent, maybe Zux is not going to come out with a better model than Gemini 3. But if he's taking the best talent from OpenAI, maybe they're not going to do it either because they don't have the money to pay for that talent.</p>
</details>

所以现在正在进行一场大规模的人工智能战争。最终消费者会赢。我认为归根结底，英伟达、AMD这些公司也会赢。但基础模型正在一个非常高的水平上竞争，看哪一个会胜出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a massive AI war going on right now. The consumer ultimately wins. I think at the end of the day, Nvidia, AMD, these guys win as well. But the foundation models are competing at a pretty high level to see which one is going to win.</p>

### 重磅嘉宾：投资高手“Stock Talk”的选股哲学

女士们先生们，Stock Talk。你好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ladies and gentlemen, Stock Talk. What's up?</p>
</details>

你好，大家好。很高兴见到你们中的许多人。我相信你们中的许多人可能以前在音频节目中听过我，在Spaces上，或者和Amit一起在我们正在开始的新节目Equity Edge上。但很高兴和你们在一起。我很兴奋能上这些直播。我看过很多次Amit的直播。所以很高兴能上节目聊天。那么，是的，我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's going on? What's going on guys? Good to see a lot of you. I'm sure many of you have probably heard me on audio before um on spaces or you know either with Amit on on the new space that we're starting with Equity Edge, but it's good to be with you guys. I was excited to come on these streams. I've watched these streams with it many times. So, it's good to be on um and and to chat. So, yeah, let's get into it.</p>
</details>

你通过Amcor这个名字让很多人赚了很多钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you made a lot of people a lot of money on this Amcore name. So, very included.</p>
</details>

是的。你知道，我想和你一起做这个节目的原因之一是，我非常尊重你作为一个选股人。我认为，当我真正尊重的人说“看看这只股票”时，这样的人屈指可数。因为每个人都有关于股票的想法，但不是每个人都做了足够的研究来说这只股票值得一看。你做到了，而且你在这一年里发现了一些真正被低估的宝藏，它们显然表现得非常好。所以，我想让我们从第一个问题开始。首先，你投资多久了？然后，第二个问题是，你在实际挑选股票时的一般理念是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And you know, one of the one of the reasons I I wanted to do the the show with you is because I've respected you a lot as a stock picker. And I think there's a literal handful of people, like I can count on one hand the amount of people I really respect when they say, "Look at this ticker." Because everyone has an idea of a ticker, but not everyone does enough research to say this ticker deserves to take a look at. You do, and you found some really undervalued gems throughout the year, uh, that have obviously done very well. So, I guess let's start off with that first question. First of all, how long have you been investing for? And then the second part to that is what is your general philosophy when it comes to actually picking a stock in the market.</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，很多人在推特上听到我的声音，他们认为我比实际年龄大得多。也许是因为我的声音，但我32岁。我并不老，但我从18岁就开始投资了。从18岁开始交易和投资。所以，你知道，已经14年了。就认真做这件事而言，真的已经超过十年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I mean a lot it's funny because a lot of people hear me on Twitter and they think I'm a lot older than I am. Maybe because of my voice, but um I'm 32. I'm I'm not I'm not old, but I've been investing since I was 18. Trading and investing since I was 18. So, you know, it's been 14 years. In terms of doing it seriously, it's really been a little over a decade.</p>
</details>

我会这样描述我的策略。我专注于中盘股的利基市场。我的投资组合中偶尔会有一些小盘股。现在就有一个。稍后我会和大家一起过一遍我所有的投资组合持股。我通常不公开这样做，但你们是Amit的观众，是我的朋友，所以我会这样做。我们会聊聊所有这些股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I would describe my strategy like this. I focus on the midcap niche. There are occasionally small caps around my portfolio. There's one right now. I'll go over all my portfolio holdings with you guys later. I don't typically do that publicly but you know from its audience. It's my boy so I'll do it. Um and we'll chat about all those stocks.</p>
</details>

我通常不投资小盘股，主要是中盘股。所以市值在20亿到100亿美元之间。我寻找的是一个即将发生转折的故事，这个转折可能发生在基本面、技术面或主题层面。对我来说，我高信念度的选择，Amcore就是其中之一，还有Nurses Systems, ENS。实际上，我在Equity Edge上和Amit一起讨论的三只股票，正是我最大的三个持仓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um I typically don't do small cap. It's typically midcap. So 2 to 10 billion market cap range. And what I'm looking for is I'm looking for a story that's about to inflect, right? And that can be an inflection that's happening fundamentally, technically, or thematically. And for me, my high conviction picks, Amcore being one of them, you know, Nurses Systems, ENS. Actually, three of the three stocks that I covered on Equity Edge with it were are actually my three biggest positions.</p>
</details>

简而言之，我试图找到处于拐点的中盘股。我高信念度的选择是那些同时满足所有条件的公司：它们在主题上具有相关性，基本面出现拐点，技术面也出现拐点。斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒（Stanley Druckenmiller）谈到过这一点。他说，他从不接受一个在基本面和技术面上都不是好主意的投资。我和他一样。我需要图表和故事告诉我同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, in a nutshell, what I try to do is I try to find midcaps that are at an inflection point. And my high conviction picks are when they check all those boxes. They're thematically relevant. They have a fundamental inflection and they also have a technical inflection. So, you know, Stanley Ducken Miller talks about this. He's like, I never take an idea where it's not fundamentally a good idea and also technically a good idea. And I'm the same way. I need both the chart and the story to be telling me the same thing.</p>
</details>

在推特上，很多人认为你必须站队。你要么是看资产负债表的人，要么是看图表的人，仅此而已。这就是你选股的方式。所有看图表的人都会说，“嗯，我不需要担心新闻、催化剂或主题。对我来说都是噪音。”然后你会看到看资产负债表的人说，“嗯，我这辈子从没用过图表，但我赚了很多钱。”在我看来，两个阵营都错了。应该把它们都当作客观的数据集来使用，并努力让概率最大化地对你有利，我认为这才是投资的目标。在我看来，你希望价格和故事告诉你同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like there are there's this thought process on Twitter from a lot of people I think that you have to be encamped. You have to be a balance sheet guy or a chart guy and that's it. That's how you pick stocks. And all the chart guys, you'll see them say, "Well, I don't need to worry about the news or the catalysts or the themes. It's all noise to me." And then you'll see the balance sheet guys say, "Well, I've never used a chart in my life and I've made great money." In my view, both camps are wrong. like be using them both as objective data sets and trying to get the most probability in your favor I think is the objective of investing. You want the price and the story to be telling you the same thing in my view.</p>

### “Stock Talk”投资组合全解析

好的。首先，我把这些按主题分开了。第一个是电网和电池。EnerSys (ENS) 是我最大的持仓，目前在整个投资组合中，当然也属于这个篮子。我也会给你们相对的权重。为什么不呢？因为你们知道。那个占15%到16%，因为它会在那个范围之间波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So the first theme I have these separated by thematic. So the first one is power grid and batteries. Um inus ENS is my biggest position. Um in the whole portfolio currently but obviously also in that basket. Um I'll give you the relative weightings too. Why not? Just because you know. That one's at a 15. just put that one at 15 to 16% because it's going to bounce between that and then.</p>
</details>

那个篮子里的下一个是PLPC，占8%到9%。那只是普通股。ENS的成本基础是112.87美元。PLPC是192.16美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">next one in the that basket is PLPC that's at 8 to 9%. That is just all common stock. Uh okay, the cost base on ENS is 112.87. PLPC is 192.16.</p>
</details>

好的，下一个篮子是美国半导体供应链。这以前是两只股票，Amkor和Pab。现在只有Amkor了。那个占13%...不，Amkor不再是13%到14%了。如果算上期权，它占16%到17%。所以Amkor现在已经超过了ENS。它的股票成本基础是24.35美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh okay then the next basket is US semiconductor supply chain. This used to be two socks. It used to be Amcore and Pab. Now it's just Amcore. Um that is 13 well actually nope. Ampcore is not 13 to 14% anymore. If you include the options it is 16 to 17%. Um so Amcore has now overtaken ENS. Um, and there is a 24.35 cost basis on the shares on on Amcore.</p>
</details>

另一个是我的小盘股，要小心，这是我投资组合中唯一的小盘股，但它会很波动等等。那就是OSS，Onetop Systems。我的成本基础是4.71美元。它的权重是5%到6%。

</details>

第三个是Vav，占9%到10%。成本基础是13.58美元。我们还有DigitalOcean和Path，这些更多是期权交易，但我确实有一些DigitalOcean的股票。我持有Path的14美元看涨期权，占4%，今天财报。然后是Docend，占2%到3%。

We also have digital ocean and path and that which are these are more so options plays, but I do have some digital ocean shares. Um I have path 14 calls. That's 4% that earnings is today. Um but that's 4%. And then dockend that's 2 to 3%.</p>
</details>

下一个篮子是核能，里面只有一只股票，LEU，权重为9%到10%。只有股票，成本基础是96.94美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">next basket is nuclear. That's just one stock in that uh LEU that is at 9 to 10%. Just shares uh cost bases on that is 96.94.</p>
</details>

航空航天与国防，Kratos。我有一些1月27日到期的35美元和40美元的看涨期权，但股票的成本基础是22.34美元。然后是HII，成本基础是219.30美元。那是Huntington Ingalls，美国唯一的造船商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, aerospace and defense Kratos. Um, I have some 35 and 40 calls expiring January 27, but the cost base on the shares is 22.34. Um, and then HIi, that's 219.30 is the cost basis on that. That's Huntington Engles. It's the only ship builder in the United States.</p>
</details>

Kratos的权重是3%到4%。HII的权重是2%到3%。

</details>

最后一类是传统持仓，这些权重也都很小。它们曾经是巨大的权重，但投资组合增长了很多。Robinhood占4%到5%，成本基础是19.74美元。特斯拉占3%到4%，成本基础是19.38美元。亚马逊占3%到4%，成本基础是88.93美元。

标普500指数683.07点，我们是绿色的。Amcor继续走高，达到43美元，英伟达180美元，AMD 215美元，Nebius 95美元，Palantir 173美元，Hoodie 131美元，特斯拉440美元。特斯拉今天表现相当不错。然后，那个早上搞乱市场的微软新闻，现在已经不那么重要了。微软仍然下跌2%，但他们确实做出了回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">683.07 on the S&P 500, we are green. Amcor continuing to move higher 43, Nvidia 180, AMD 215, Nebius 95, Pounder 173, Hoodie 131, Tesla 440. Tesla having a pretty decent day. And then that Microsoft news that kind of messed up the morning is not that big of a deal anymore. Microsoft still down 2% but they did come out with a response.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，《The Information》这些该死的记者，你想怎么称呼他们？记者？看看他们做了什么。他们不得不更换标题。看看这个。从“微软下调AI软件销售配额”改为“微软下调AI软件增长目标”，就在微软回应之后，因为他们不想因为诽谤而被起诉。这些AI头条新闻真是令人难以置信。但这已经不是新闻了，这只是在制造叙事，坦率地说，这可能是出于各种原因的经济激励，但似乎并不是为了探究事实真相。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, the information these freaking journalists, do you want to call it reporters? How do you want to frame this? I mean, look what they did. They had to replace the headline. Look at this. Microsoft lowers AI software sales quotas to Microsoft lowers AI software growth targets right after Microsoft responds because they don't want to be sued for defamation instead. Like it is incredible what's going on with these AI headlines. But this is not journalism. This is just nar and narrative creations that quite frankly might be financially incentivized for a variety of reasons, but it does not seem like it's trying to get to the the uh the truth claim of what's going on here.</p>
</details>

好了，就是这样。谢谢大家。感谢你们。很高兴你们喜欢今天的嘉宾。再次强调，他的推特账号是Stock Talk Weekly。我收盘时会再见。我们30分钟后在Twitter Spaces上直播，到时候再聊。谢谢大家。感谢。收盘时见。再见。祝大家有美好的一天。
