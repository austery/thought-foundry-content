### 纳入黑人历史的重要性

**Natasha**: 我将从你开始。将黑人加拿大人对历史课程的贡献纳入其中，为什么很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: I'm going to start with you. Why is including Black Canadian contributions to the history curriculum important?

</details>

**Natasha**: 这非常重要，因为它呈现了加拿大更准确的历史。它将非洲裔人士真正地定位在加拿大这个我们称之为“加拿大”的项目及其演变、其随时间的发展中，并且再次，真正地帮助人们理解我们在这里已经存在了很长时间，长达400年，与欧洲殖民化同步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: It's very important because it presents a more accurate history of Canada. It really locates people of African descent within this project that we call Canada and its evolution, its growth over time and again, really then helps people to understand that we've been here for a very long time, 400 years, alongside European colonization.

</details>

**Greg**: 格雷格，很多人会说黑人历史就是加拿大历史。你认为为什么将这些贡献纳入我们的历史课程很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: Many people will say black history is Canadian history. Why do you think it's important that we add these contributions to our history curriculum?

</details>

**Greg**: 你刚才说的正是我接下来要说的部分，我觉得，我认为，在不纳入声音的情况下教授历史，是一个挑战。我鼓励我的学生理解，我们教授历史的一部分就是“去学习”（unlearning）。在你“去学习”之前，你无法真正学习。我认为过去几十年来我们面临的问题之一就是，我们把自己置于一个可以真正学习真实历史的境地，并理解一直以来存在着许多被忽视的声音，而这些声音需要成为我们加拿大叙事的一部分。

**Greg**: It's interesting you just said part of what I was going to say, and I think, I think the idea of teaching history without incorporating voices is, is a challenge. I encourage my students to understand that part of what we do in teaching history is unlearning. You can't learn until you unlearn. And I think part of the problem that we faced with over the last how many decades is putting ourselves in a situation where we can actually learn true history and understand that there have been voices that haven't been heard for so long, and those voices need to be a part of our Canadian narrative.

### 课程延迟与政治考量

**Natasha**: 据我们所知，该课程原定于去年推出，但被推迟到2026年9月。现在，一些批评者说，这次暂停反映了政治上对进步课程内容的不适。我想听听你们两位的看法，娜塔莎。你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: As we know, the curriculum was slated to roll out last year but was delayed until September 2026. Now, some critics say that the pause was a reflection of political discomfort with progressive curriculum content. I want to get both of your takes on it, Natasha. What do you think?

</details>

**Natasha**: 嗯，我们可以从几个方面来解读。是的，你可以这样解读，并且会想，这是不是因为当时政治气候下某种程度的不适？或者我们也可以退一步想，希望教育部是想产出高质量的东西，这需要更多时间来审查反馈，以便实施他们收到的任何专家意见。所以，我希望在第二种解读中，会有高质量的产出，而他们需要时间来完成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Well, we can read that in several ways. Yes, you can read it, as you know and wonder, is it because of some level of discomfort, given the wider political climate of the time? Or we can also take a step back and think that maybe and hopefully that the ministry wants to produce something of high quality, which requires more time for the review process to gather feedback to implement, you know, any material that they receive from experts. And so, you know, I'm hoping in the second stream that that there will be something produced of high quality and that they needed the time in order to do so.

</details>

**Natasha**: 现在，格雷格，在我问你之前，我应该提到，卡兰德拉部长确实提到，暂停是必要的，既是为了允许引入更一致、全省范围的课程方法，也是为了，正如你所提到的，确保教师有足够的时间在他们的教室里正确地实施。作为一个身处教室的人，你知道当课程提供给你时，当有变化时，也是需要时间的。但你对这种暂停和理由有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Now, Greg, before I come to you, I should mention that Minister Calandra did mention that the pause was necessary for both to allow for the introduction of more consistent, province wide approach to the curriculum, but also to, as you mentioned, to ensure teachers can have the time they need to properly implement that in their classroom. As someone who is in the classroom, you know that when curriculum is given to you, when there's changes, time is needed as well. But what are your thoughts about sort of that pause and sort of the reasoning?

</details>

**Greg**: 我想我也会呼应娜塔莎刚才说的。我认为这次暂停，或者我希望这次暂停是为了给教育工作者提供适当的资源。我认为不幸的现实是，大多数黑人教育工作者在面对黑人历史、黑人历史月时，既充满热情，也带有一丝恐惧。我认为现实是，当我们集体，作为黑人教育工作者，成为知识的来源时，我们几乎成了讲述故事的人。而讲述故事可能会带来创伤。所以我认为我希望这次暂停也许能提供一个必要的机会，以确保所有教师都能获得资源，这样就不会出现“嘿，你的经历是什么样的？”的情况。这种情况经常发生，而且有很多学生会经历创伤，当他们可能是班上唯一一个时，老师会看着他们说，“嘿，顺便说一句，你作为黑人加拿大人，你的经历是怎样的？这很难。真的很难。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: I think I'd echo what Natasha said earlier as well. I think the pause potentially, or I'd like to think that the pause was done with the intention of equipping educators with the proper resources. I think the unfortunate reality is most black educators approach black history, Black History Month with excitement, but also with a little bit of trepidation. I think the reality is, is that when we collectively, as black educators, become the source of knowledge, it's almost like we have to be the ones telling the story. And telling the story can be traumatic. So I think I'd like to think that this pause maybe gives a necessary opportunity to ensure that all teachers can have access to resources so that it's not about saying, hey, what was your experience like? Because that happens all the time, and there are a lot of students who experience that trauma when there might be the only ones in the class, and the teacher looks at them and says, hey, by the way, what's your experience like being a black Canadian? It's hard. It's really hard.

</details>

**Natasha**: 是的。我还要补充一点，关于暂停，这是为了实际发布学习主题。在此期间，也在策划和开发一些资源。一旦这些资源发布了，就应该有培训。你提到了，你知道，黑人教师们很长时间以来，你知道，一直在坚持教授黑人历史。但一直存在不均衡。我认为还有很重要的一点是，教师需要更多的培训，尤其是在教学人口以白人为主的情况下，将会出现，正如你之前所说的，大量的“去学习”和新的学习，这些都需要发生在教育工作者身上，以便他们能将这些带入课堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Yes. And I would just add to that to say, you know, with the pause, it's the pause for the actual release of what the learning topics will be, and that in that interim, there are also curating and developing some resources. And then once those are rolled out, then there should be some training. And you talked about, you know, black teachers who have, you know, for a long time, you know, been consistent in teaching black history. And there has been an unevenness. And I think there's also an important thing to think about that teachers require more training, especially when the teaching population is majority white, that there will be, as you had said before, a lot of unlearning and new learning that would need to take place for educators in order for them to bring this to the classroom.
