title: 中国文化危机、程朱理学与“格物致知”的真实含义
---
### 引言：中国文化的深层危机

今天，我们继续探讨中国文化的危机，以及**理学**（Neo-Confucianism: 宋明时期儒家思想发展出的哲学体系）如何应对这场危机。在上一期视频中，我们谈到中国政治制度、意识形态和宗教信仰呈现出独特的演变轨迹。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Today's video, let’s continue to explore the crisis of Chinese culture. And how does science deal with this crisis? In the last video we talked about China's political system, ideology, and religious beliefs, there is a distinct evolution and development trajectory.</p>
</details>

中国文化的发展，就像一个濒临崩溃的生态系统。当系统遭遇小规模危机时，原有的负反馈机制尚能调整和修复问题，整个系统仍处于开放状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, the development of Chinese culture, like an ecosystem on the verge of collapse. When the system encounters a small-scale crisis, the original negative feedback mechanism can also adjust and fix problems, the whole system is still in an open state.</p>
</details>

然而，随着问题越来越多，系统失去了处理问题的工具和资源，结果只能是正反馈，不断强化现有模式，即便旧模式正在失效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, as more and more problems, the system loses the tools and resources to deal with the problem, the result can only be a positive feedback, constantly reinforcing existing patterns, even the old model is failing.</p>
</details>

人们越是想将其提升到神圣、无所不能的高度，最终整个系统就越是失去弹性，越来越陷入一种疯狂和失控的状态，这便是一种文化上的倒退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The more you want to elevate it to a sacred level, the height of omnipresence, finally, the whole system loses its flexibility. Falling more and more into a state of madness and loss of control, this is a cultural regression.</p>
</details>

我们说，一个人在经历创伤性事件后，往往会退回到一种更依赖、恐惧和非理性的状态。他会减少对外部世界的探索欲望和好奇心，反而会更加强化甚至神化自己的传统价值观，拒绝反思，躲回到最熟悉的“子宫”状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say, after a person has experienced a traumatic event, often retreat into a more dependent, fear and irrational states. He will reduce his desire to explore and curiosity about the outside world. Will be more strengthened, even deifying their own traditional values, refuse to reflect, hiding back to the most familiar state of the womb.</p>
</details>

他还会表现出更强的精神洁癖和控制欲，试图强化原有系统的纯粹性和纯洁性，以消除所有不确定性和模糊性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He will also show stronger mental cleanliness and control, trying to strengthen the purity of the original system and purity, to eliminate all uncertainty and ambiguity.</p>
</details>

这种对纯粹的追求和对异己的排斥，并不意味着系统强大，反而是一种脆弱的标志。它不再有信心面对一个开放、复杂的世界，不再相信自己可以与他人对话，只能通过构建一个自洽但封闭的系统来避免自身崩溃。宋明**程朱理学**（Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism: 由程颢、程颐和朱熹发展并集大成的理学流派）就清晰地反映了这种现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This pursuit of purity and rejection of others, this does not mean that the system is strong, it is a sign of fragility. He no longer has the confidence to face an open, a complex world, no longer believe that you can have a dialogue with others, only by constructing a self-consistent, but a closed system, to keep yourself from collapsing. The Neo-Confucianism of Song and Ming clearly reflects this phenomenon.</p>
</details>

### 秦制下的帝国权力演变

正如我们在上期视频中讨论的，尽管秦朝首次在全国推行了秦制，但要真正稳定运行这一制度，却面临着巨大的困难。从秦汉到唐宋，中国社会经历了无数制度和文化创新，最终形成了“外儒内法”的皇权体制日益巩固。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As we discussed in our last video, although the Qin Dynasty first promoted the Qin system throughout the country, however, to truly run this system stably, but faced with huge difficulties. From Qin and Han to Tang and Song, Chinese Society, experienced numerous institutional and cultural innovations, the imperial power system of Confucianism on the outside and law on the inside became increasingly solid.</p>
</details>

例如，汉代皇权为了避免秦朝被推翻的命运，将儒家思想神秘化、神学化，用虚幻的神意和天意来取代真实存在的人的意志。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, the Han Dynasty imperial power in order to avoid the fate of being overthrown by the Qin Dynasty, mystifying and theologizing Confucianism, with the illusory divine will and heaven's will, to replace the real existence of human will.</p>
</details>

因此，皇权被披上了一层神圣而温情的“外衣”。魏晋南北朝时期，是一个皇权相对退场的时代，皇帝们常常依靠妥协来维持与贵族的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thus, the imperial power, covered with a sacred and tender coat. Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, it was an era when imperial power was relatively withdrawn. Emperors often rely on compromise, to maintain relations with the nobles.</p>
</details>

然而，这种秦制的退场是暂时的。在这种旧结构中，一股恢复皇权的新力量开始萌芽，那就是汉族将领对兵权的掌控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, this retreat of the Qin system was temporary. In this old structure, a new force to restore imperial power began to emerge, that is the control of military power by the Han clan generals.</p>
</details>

在隋唐时期，一系列巩固和强化皇权的明确制度被重新塑造，例如**三省制**（Three Departments and Six Ministries System: 隋唐时期中央政府的行政体制）和**科举制**（Imperial Examination System: 通过考试选拔官员的制度）等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the Sui and Tang Dynasties, a series of explicit systems to consolidate and strengthen imperial power, re-shaping. For example, the three-province system, the imperial examination system, etc.</p>
</details>

然而，尽管唐朝有如此多强化皇权专制的措施，但仍未能阻止政治的衰落，最终进入了五代十国时期。中国社会陷入了彻底而全面的礼乐崩坏，弑父、杀兄、篡位、政变等事件极其频繁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, although the Tang Dynasty, there are so many measures to strengthen the imperial autocracy, but it still hasn't stopped the political decline, entering the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Chinese Society, it has fallen into a complete and comprehensive collapse of rituals and music. Patricide, fratricide, usurpation of the throne, coups, etc. are extremely frequent.</p>
</details>

因此，从唐中期到宋代，我们可以看到儒家学者对时局的焦虑远超前代。他们提出了许多有针对性的措施，例如进一步强化儒家**三纲五常**（Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues: 儒家伦理中君臣、父子、夫妇关系及仁义礼智信五种德行）的神圣性和高贵性，强化对皇权专制的推崇，以及更极端地排斥和消灭异端文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So from the middle of the Tang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, we can see, Confucian scholars, the anxiety about the current situation is far beyond that of previous generations. They have proposed a number of targeted measures, for example, further strengthen the sacredness and nobility of the Confucian Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues, strengthening the admiration for imperial autocracy, and more extreme rejection and elimination of heterodox cultures.</p>
</details>

### 儒家伦理的动摇与怀疑精神的兴起

然而，在藩镇割据、异族入侵等时代危机背后，还隐藏着更深层的精神危机：士大夫阶层自身对儒家伦理和宇宙秩序的全面动摇。如果儒家学者自己都开始怀疑信仰，那么任何外部的功利手段都显得毫无用处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in those times such as the separatist regimes, behind the crisis of alien invasion, there is also a deeper spiritual crisis hidden, the scholar-official class itself, a comprehensive shake-up of Confucian ethics and cosmic order. If the Confucian scholars themselves, they all began to doubt their faith, then any external utilitarian means, it all seems useless.</p>
</details>

#### 白居易对天道正义的质疑

一个著名的代表人物是**白居易**（Bai Juyi: 唐代著名诗人）。白居易生活在唐朝中期，他目睹了唐朝各种暴政对民生造成的危害。从他的作品中，我们可以轻易感受到他对时局的强烈不满和痛心疾首。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A famous representative is Bai Juyi. Bai Juyi lived in the middle of the Tang Dynasty, he witnessed the harm that various tyrannies in the Tang Dynasty had on people's livelihood. From his works, we can easily feel, his strong dissatisfaction with the current situation and heartbroken.</p>
</details>

我们知道，在儒家伦理中，天道不仅是宇宙秩序的体现，更是道德秩序的源泉，它赏善罚恶，天的正义性和神性在于它与民意相通，所谓“天视自我民视，天听自我民听”。当然，上天爱民，君主必须行仁政以顺天意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We know, in Confucian ethics, the Way of Heaven is not only the embodiment of the order of the universe, it is the source of moral order. It rewards good and punishes evil. The Justice and Divinity of Heaven, because he is in tune with public opinion, so-called "God sees me, the people see me", "Heaven listens to the people". Of course God loves the people. The monarch must exercise benevolent governance to comply with the will of heaven.</p>
</details>

然而，与普通儒家不同的是，白居易并没有简单地认为这些政治弊端是违背天道，而是开始怀疑天道本身的正义性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, unlike ordinary Confucian people, Bai Juyi did not simply think, these political malpractices are against the way of heaven. Rather, they began to doubt the justice of Heaven itself.</p>
</details>

例如，在他的《陶潜体诗十六首》中，他写道：“天不爱人，何用生人？天爱人，何用生豺狼？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, in his "Sixteen Poems in the Style of Tao Qian", he said: "God does not love the people, how can one make a living? God loves the people, why are you a jackal?"</p>
</details>

也就是说，如果上天不爱人，为何要生养人类？但如果真的爱人，却又为何放出这么多作恶之人来祸害人间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, if God does not love the people, why raise humans? But if you really love the people, but why did they release so many evil people to harm the world?</p>
</details>

接着，白居易进一步质疑“神道”是否公平。他说**孔子**（Confucius: 儒家学派创始人）一生坎坷，而像**秦始皇**（Qin Shi Huang: 秦朝开国皇帝）这样的残暴之人却能统一天下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then, Bai Juyi further questioned whether "Shinto" was fair. He said that Confucius' life was full of ups and downs. And a cruel person like Qin Shi Huang, instead, he could unify the world.</p>
</details>

因此，白居易开始怀疑整个宇宙的秩序。他说：“物理不可测，神道亦茫然。我向上苍看，苍苍亦何言。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thus, Bai Juyi began to doubt the order of the entire universe. He: Physics is unpredictable, and so is the way of God. I look up to the sky, and it is pale and grey.</p>
</details>

白居易质问上天，但上天却沉默不语，因此他感受到了一种对天道的幻灭。这使得白居易的思想深刻性，超越了以往儒家对具体事件的反思，呈现出一种怀疑主义的倾向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bai Juyi Questions Heaven, but God is silent, so he felt a kind of disillusionment with the way of heaven. This makes Bai Juyi's thoughts profound. It still exceeds the previous Confucian, reflection on specific events, a tendency to skepticism.</p>
</details>

这种倾向也体现在一首诗中：“不惊宠辱，不忧哀乐，不计恩怨，黄帝孔子无处问，焉知此不是梦？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This tendency, this is also reflected in a poem: "Don't be surprised by favor or disgrace, don't worry about happiness or sorrow, don't count favors or grudges, There is no place for Huangdi and Confucius to ask, so how do we know that they are not just in a dream?"</p>
</details>

我们知道，由宠辱引起的哀乐情绪是儒家士大夫最基本的情感坐标。儒家伦理强调士人应参政，事君治国，以实现自身人生价值，其中最重要且不确定的一环便是能否获得君主的赏识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We know, emotions of joy and sorrow caused by favor or disgrace, it is the most basic emotional coordinate of Confucian scholars. Confucian ethics emphasizes, scholars should participate in politics, serving the King and Governing the Country, to realize your own life value, this is the most important and uncertain part, whether you can gain the appreciation of the monarch.</p>
</details>

所以，宠辱对一个人的尊严具有决定性意义，由此产生的焦虑和喜悦是儒家士大夫无法摆脱的两种基本情绪。即便说“不以物喜，不以己悲”的**范仲淹**（Fan Zhongyan: 北宋著名政治家、文学家），也不是真正超脱了哀乐情绪，而是依然站在儒家“以天下为己任”的立场上，来表达自己的喜乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So favor and disfavor, to the dignity of a human being, of decisive significance. The resulting anxiety and joy, Confucian scholars, two basic emotions that you can’t get rid of. Even if you say that you should not be happy with material things, Fan Zhongyan, who did not feel sad for himself, it is not really about transcending the emotions of sadness and joy. But still standing on the Confucian, on the standpoint of "taking the world as one's own responsibility", to express your joy.</p>
</details>

然而，白居易却解构了“哀乐”的道德基础，他不仅不再因宠辱而喜悲，甚至认为这些情绪本身就是虚假的，恩怨也毫无意义，努力更是毫无价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Bai Juyi, this also deconstructs the moral basis of "sorrow and joy", not only did he no longer feel happy or sad because of favor or disgrace, even think that these emotions themselves are false, there is no point in grudges, hard work is worthless.</p>
</details>

接着，白居易表达了对圣人的怀疑，即“黄帝孔子无处问，焉知此不是梦？”**黄帝**（Huangdi: 中国传说中的人文始祖）是上古的圣王，孔子是儒家的圣人，他们都是中国正统秩序的象征。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then, Bai Juyi expressed his doubts about the saint, it is "Huangdi and Confucius have no questions, how do you know that this is not a dream? Huangdi was a sage king in ancient times, Confucius is a Confucian saint, they are all symbols of China's orthodox order.</p>
</details>

然而，白居易却说，谁知道他们是不是虚构的呢？这在儒家文化看来，是对圣人非常大胆的亵渎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Bai Juyi said, who knows if they are not imaginary? This is what Confucian culture sees, this is a very bold blasphemy against the saints.</p>
</details>

白居易的这种怀疑和困惑，在中国历史的后期变得越来越频繁和普遍。在中国传统小说和戏曲中，常常有一种无论在开创或发展阶段多么辉煌的成就，最终都会化为尘土，归于虚无的哀叹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bai Juyi's doubt and confusion, in the later period of Chinese history, it is becoming more and more frequent and common. In traditional Chinese novels and dramas, there is often a kind of, whether in the start-up or development stage, what a brilliant achievement, in the end, they will all turn to dust, disappeared, the Lament of Returning to Nothingness.</p>
</details>

例如，清代《桃花扇》中有一句名言：“眼看他起朱楼，眼看他宴宾客，眼看他楼塌了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, there is a famous quote in the Qing Dynasty's Peach Blossom Fan: "Seeing him build a red building, seeing him entertain guests, I watched his building collapse.”</p>
</details>

更著名的则是《红楼梦》中的《好了歌》。这种空虚和绝望感，与中国皇权专制程度的加深是同步的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More famous, the song "Hao Le Ge" from Dream of the Red Chamber. This feeling of emptiness and despair, it is synchronized with the deepening of the degree of imperial autocracy in China.</p>
</details>

#### 苏轼的虚无主义与对人本价值的思考

我们回到宋代，**苏轼**（Su Shi: 北宋著名文学家、书画家）也表达了类似的虚无主义和怀疑。他曾写道：“功名几何，哀乐无穷。回首人间，万事皆空。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let’s go back to the Song Dynasty, Su Shi also expressed similar nihilism and doubt. He once wrote: How much can honor and disgrace be? The joys and sorrows are endless. Looking back at the human world, nothing is true.</p>
</details>

这里也清晰地表达了对所有价值观的怀疑和虚无。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is also clearly expressed here, doubt and nihilism about all values.</p>
</details>

然而，苏轼并未止步于此，他还提出了更尖锐、更危险的问题。例如，苏轼在早年和晚年对《春秋》中**秦穆公**（Duke Mu of Qin: 春秋时期秦国国君）活埋三位大臣一事，思想上发生了巨大的转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Su Shi did not stop there, he also raised more pointed and dangerous questions. For example, Su Shi in his early and late years, for the Spring and Autumn Period, Duke Mu of Qin buried three ministers alive, there was a huge change in thinking.</p>
</details>

这里补充一下历史背景：秦穆公是一位重视发现人才的君主，他曾用五张羊皮换来了当时还是奴隶的**百里奚**（Baili Xi: 春秋时期秦国著名贤相）。后来，百里奚成为秦国的高级官员。在秦穆公的治理下，秦国聚集了大量人才，国力逐渐壮大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is the historical background, Duke Mu of Qin was a king who focused on discovering talents. He used five sheepskins, in exchange for Baili Xi, who was still a slave at the time. Later, Baili Xi became a high-ranking official in the Qin State. Under the reign of Duke Mu of Qin, the Qin State gathered a large number of talents, the country's power is gradually growing.</p>
</details>

从中国传统角度来看，秦穆公是一位贤明的君主。但他有一个巨大的缺陷，一直受到批评，那就是他在去世前要求一百多人陪葬，其中包括**三良**（Sanliang: 指秦穆公死后殉葬的三位贤臣），即三位深得民心的官员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the traditional Chinese perspective, Duke Mu of Qi was a wise king. But he has a huge flaw. Has always been criticized, that is, before he died, he asked more than a hundred people to be buried with him. Among them are Sanliang, that is, three good conducts, officials who are popular with the public.</p>
</details>

这三位官员去世后，秦人感到非常悲伤和痛心。《史记》和《左传》都对秦穆公提出了批评，认为这反映了秦国落后野蛮的殉葬制度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After the death of these three officials, the Qin people felt very sad and grief-stricken. Both the Records of the Grand Historian and the Zuo Zhuan were critical of Duke Mu of Qin, think, this reflects the backwardness and barbarity of the Qin Dynasty's system of burying people alive with the dead.</p>
</details>

但也有一些古人认为，这三位官员曾承诺与君主同生共死，因此他们的殉葬并非被迫，只是履行对君主的承诺。苏轼早年也持这种观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But some ancients believed, these three officials were, he promised to live and die together with the monarch, therefore, their burial was not forced. Just fulfilling the promise made to the king. Su Shi had this idea in his early years.</p>
</details>

在一首诗中，他说：“古人一饭尚能杀身，今人不见此，故以所见疑古人。古人不见此，今人更悲！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In one poem he said: "Ancient people were grateful for a meal and could still kill themselves. People today no longer see this, so they doubt the ancients based on what they see. The ancients could not see this, and people today are even more saddened!"</p>
</details>

苏轼认为，我们不能用后来的道德标准来评判古人。他们的行为恰恰体现了忠义精神，三良之死并非被迫，而是甘愿报答君恩。只是今人无法理解古人的高尚情操。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Su Shi believed, we cannot use later moral standards to judge ancient people. Their behavior precisely embodies the spirit of loyalty, Sanliang's death was not forced, but I am willing to repay the king's kindness. Just today's people, I just can't understand the nobility of the ancients.</p>
</details>

然而，在苏轼晚年，他对这件事的态度发生了180度的大转弯。在这首诗中，苏轼说：“此生重泰山，忽忽轻一羽……我非狗马，故问君以帷！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in Su Shi's later years, his attitude towards this matter, a 180-degree turn. In this poem, Su Shi said: "In this life, Mount Tai is as heavy as a mountain. Suddenly, a feather is left behind... I am not a dog or a horse, so I ask you for a curtain!"</p>
</details>

也就是说，这三个人的生命价值重如泰山，为何死亡却要轻如鸿毛？人不是狗马，为何要向君主乞求这遮盖尸体的帷幕？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, the value of these three people as human beings is as heavy as Mount Tai. Why should death be as light as a feather? People are not dogs or horses. Why beg the king? This veil covering the corpse?</p>
</details>

值得注意的是，古人对秦穆公的批评，都是从君主利益的角度出发，认为秦穆公要求大量臣子殉葬，导致秦国国力衰退，失去了争霸的资格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is worth noting that, criticisms of Duke Mu of Qin by ancient people, all from the perspective of the monarch's interests, it is believed that Duke Mu of Qin required a large number of his subjects to be buried alive, this led to the decline of Qin's national power. Lost the qualification to compete.</p>
</details>

儒家“民为贵，君为轻”的思想也是如此，它是提醒君主爱惜民力，重视民生，但归根结底是为了保证君主统治的长治久安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The same is true of the Confucian idea that "the people are more important than the king", it is to remind the monarch to cherish the people's strength and pay attention to people's livelihood. But in the final analysis, to ensure the long-term stability of the monarch's rule.</p>
</details>

然而，苏轼的批评是基于人的价值，认为人不是君主豢养的牛马，君主的话也是可以错的，臣子当然可以不服从。这当然严重违背了儒家的君臣原则，对中国传统文化而言，可谓非常大胆和危险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Su Shi's criticism is based on the value of human beings. Believe that people are not cattle and horses raised by the monarch, the monarch's words are also wrong, of course the minister can disobey. This is of course a serious violation of the Confucian principle of ruler and subject. For traditional Chinese culture, it can be said to be very bold and dangerous.</p>
</details>

### 程朱理学的应对：重建宇宙秩序

因此，在中国文化面临如此多内忧外患的情况下，**理学**（Neo-Confucianism: 前文已解释）应运而生。宋代理学与欧阳修、石介等儒家的区别，不在于是否需要政治改革、颁布行政措施、加强对民众的思想教育等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, in Chinese culture, faced with so many internal and external troubles, the science of physics came into being. The Differences between Neo-Confucianism and Ouyang Xiu, Shi Jie and Other Confucianists of the Song Dynasty, it is not about whether political reform is needed. Issue administrative measures, strengthen ideological education for the people, etc.</p>
</details>

在理学看来，这些都只是表面现象。他们敏锐地意识到，儒家文化本身面临着深刻的理论危机，堡垒总是从内部被攻破。因此，必须从哲学层面进行创新，完善理论体系，才能防止士大夫阶层的动摇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the view of science, these things are just the surface. They are keenly aware, Confucian culture itself faces a profound theoretical crisis, fortresses are always breached from within. Therefore, it must be innovated from a philosophical perspective. Improve the theoretical system, this will prevent the scholar-official class from wavering.</p>
</details>

用官方语言来说，就是“加强政治定力，确保政治信仰不变，政治立场不移”。那么，如何加强儒家自身的思想建设呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Use official language, it is to strengthen political determination, ensure political beliefs remain unchanged, political stance remains unchanged. So, how to strengthen the ideological construction of Confucianism itself?</p>
</details>

我们说，传统儒家是一种世俗功利主义，它不关心宇宙和世界的本体论，只关心实际效果，即治国平天下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say, Traditional Confucianism is a secular utilitarianism, it does not care about the ontology of the universe and the world, only concerned with practical effects, that is to govern the country and bring peace to the world.</p>
</details>

我们看到，孔子等人解释许多儒家道德价值观，都是从这个角度出发的。例如，为什么要诚信？为什么要仁爱？因为这样能赢得民心，使人爱戴你等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We see, Confucius and others explained many Confucian moral values, it's all from this perspective. For example, why should we be honest? Should we have a spirit of benevolence? Because it wins people's hearts, make people love you, etc.</p>
</p>
</details>

这些策略或许有帮助，但却无法为士大夫阶层建立一个更稳定的信仰体系。**程朱理学**（Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism: 前文已解释）更强调如何恢复士大夫阶层的精神信仰，即让他们相信一种无条件的、神圣且合理的秩序。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These strategies may be helpful, but it is not possible to, for the scholar-official class, build a more stable belief system. Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism places more emphasis on, how to restore the spiritual faith of the scholar-official class, that is to enable them to believe in an unconditional, the divine and reasonable order.</p>
</details>

他们认为，这才是应对中国文化合法性危机的根本，而非短期的政治或社会问题。

<p class="english-text">They will respond, it is a crisis of legitimacy of Chinese culture. It is not a short-term political or social issue.</p>
</details>

因此，**朱熹**（Zhu Xi: 程朱理学集大成者）试图重建一个无所不包的宇宙体系，也就是所谓的自然秩序。在理学看来，天之所以是正确的，因为它渗透于万事万物之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, Zhu Xi attempted to reconstruct an omniscient cosmic system, that is the so-called natural order. In the view of science, the reason why heaven is right, because it permeates everything.</p>
</details>

这与汉代**董仲舒**（Dong Zhongshu: 汉代儒家思想家）的儒家思想相比，可以说变得更加严谨。董仲舒提出的“天”，是一个有情感、有意志、有喜怒哀乐的**人格神**（Personal God: 具有人格特征的神）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is compared with the Confucianism of Dong Zhongshu in the Han Dynasty. It can be said that it has become more rigorous. The "Heaven" proposed by Dong Zhongshu, is a personal God with emotions, will, likes and dislikes.</p>
</details>

人们做了违背三纲五常的事情，就会受到上天的惩罚。所以，天是一种超自然的父权权威。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People do things that violate the Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues. Will be punished by God, so Heaven is a supernatural fatherly authority.</p>
</details>

但这种解释更适合道德上的劝诫和恐吓，它无法面对白居易那种质问，因为它将这个体系的合法性建立在外部的、偶然的原因之上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this explanation, more suitable for moral exhortation and intimidation, it has no way to face the kind of questioning that Bai Juyi asked, because it makes the legitimacy of this system, based on external, accidental causes.</p>
</details>

朱熹的“**天理**”（Heavenly Principle: 理学核心概念，指宇宙万物和人类社会的根本法则）是宇宙的本体结构，它没有人格，没有意志，也不是通过惩罚来恐吓人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zhu Xi's "Heavenly Principle" is the ontological structure of the universe. He has no personality, no will. It's not about scaring people by punishment.</p>
</details>

相反，朱熹以一种看似合理的方式告诉你，宇宙是一个有秩序、有内部结构的系统，你只是其中的一个差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the contrary, Zhu Xi is speaking in a way that seems reasonable. Tell you, the universe is an orderly, a system with an internal structure, you are just one of the differences.</p>
</details>

“理”是存在于万事万物中的法则，它是无处不在的秩序之源。大到江河湖海，小到一草一木，虽然它们看起来千差万别，但都共享一个本体，那就是天理。它们都是由这个本体所创生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">“Reason” is the rule that exists in all things, it is the source of order everywhere. As big as rivers, lakes and seas, as small as a blade of grass, although they look very different, but they all share one entity, that is the principle of heaven, they are all created from this entity.</p>
</details>

所以，理是宇宙的本体，也是社会伦理的基础。从本体论的角度来看，这确实让儒家伦理显得更有说服力，因为它使这种秩序超出了经验和历史的偶然性，不再依赖于现实世界的效应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Reason is the ontology of the universe, it is also the foundation of social ethics. From the perspective of ontology, this does make Confucian ethics seem more convincing. Because it makes this order, out of experience and historical contingency, no longer dependent on real-world effects.</p>
</details>

然而，这种思想听起来难道不荒谬吗？其实，我也觉得它很荒谬。

### “格物致知”的真实含义及其批判

那么，如何才能达到这种状态呢？关键在于**格物致知**（Investigating Things to Gain Knowledge: 通过探究事物来获取知识）。“格物致知”一词出自《礼记》和《大学》中的一段话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how can we achieve this state? The key lies in the pursuit of knowledge through investigation of things. The phrase "investigating things to gain knowledge" comes from a passage in "The Book of Rites" and "The Great Learning".</p>
</details>

这段话是这样说的：“古之欲明明德于天下者，先治其国；欲治其国者，先齐其家；欲齐其家者，先修其身；欲修其身者，先正其心；欲正其心者，先诚其意；欲诚其意者，先致其知，致知在格物。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This sentence says: In ancient times, those who wished to make the bright virtue known to the world, govern the country first. If you want to govern your country, you must first govern your family. If you want to manage your family, you must first improve yourself. If you want to improve yourself, you must first correct your mind. If you want to straighten your heart, you must first be sincere in your intentions. If you want to be sincere, you must first acquire knowledge, and acquiring knowledge lies in studying things.</p>
</details>

也就是说，一切的根本在于诚意正心，格物致知，也就是要端正人的态度和认识。朱熹将《大学》中的这段话，提炼为理学的纲领，因为它提供了一个重要的方法论，即一个人要学会从大自然的万事万物中，发现天理的存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is to say, the root of everything lies in sincerity and uprightness. Studying Things to Gain Knowledge, that is, to correct people's attitudes and understandings. Zhu Xi extracted this passage from the University, as a program of science, because it provides an important methodology, that is to say, a person must learn to learn from all things in nature, discovering the existence of the law of nature.</p>
</details>

许多人将“格物致知”理解为通过观察和研究万事万物来获取知识。实际上，这是一种受西方文化影响而产生的理解。理学所说的格物致知，并非此意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many people understand the concept of "investigating things to gain knowledge" as, gaining knowledge by observing and studying everything. Actually, this is an understanding that comes from the influence of Western culture. The Neo-Confucianism says that the study of things leads to knowledge, that's not what I meant.</p>
</details>

我们知道，在17世纪，欧洲流行一种**自然神论**（Deism: 相信上帝创造宇宙后不再干预其运行的哲学观点）。例如，**牛顿**（Newton: 英国著名物理学家、数学家）就认为上帝创造了宇宙，但创造之后，上帝就不再干预，而是让万事万物按照上帝所创造的自然法则运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We know, in the 17th century, a kind of deism was popular in Europe. For example, Newton believed that God created the universe. But after creation, God will no longer intervene. Instead, let everything run according to the natural laws created by God.</p>
</details>

人类可以通过学习、推理、演绎和实验，逐渐发现隐藏在自然中的法则和规律。正如那句名言所说：“自然和自然的法则隐藏在黑夜中。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Humans can learn, reason, deduce and experiment, gradually discover the laws and rules hidden in nature. As the famous saying goes: nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.</p>
</details>

然而，理学并非让人发现任何新知识，也不是让人去推理和思考。它强调的是，要依靠对万事万物的体悟和感受，你会发现天理无处不在，进而体验到一种美妙的审美境界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, science, it does not allow people to discover any new knowledge, it is not about asking people to reason and think. Instead, it emphasizes the need to rely on the understanding and feeling of all things, you will find that the law of nature is everywhere, and then experience a wonderful aesthetic realm.</p>
</details>

在这种境界中，人与天合一，从而感受到人融入宇宙本体的自由、快乐状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this realm, man and Heaven become one, so as to feel, the freedom of man's integration into the cosmic entity, happy state.</p>
</details>

例如，我们看朱熹的这首诗：“半亩方塘一鉴开，天光云影共徘徊。问渠那得清如许？为有源头活水来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, let’s look at this poem by Zhu Xi: A half-acre pond is open, and the light of the sky and the shadow of the water wander together. How can the water be so clear? Because it comes from a source of fresh water.</p>
</details>

现在我们来看这首诗，我觉得这简直就是在描述一种自然美景，我们也会感到很美。然而，我们对自然美的感受，背后可能有各种复杂的情绪，例如自由感、渺小感、苍凉、孤独等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let’s look at this poem now. I think this is simply, just describing a natural beauty, we will also feel beautiful. However, our sense of beauty in nature, there may be a variety of complex emotions behind it. For example, a sense of freedom, a sense of insignificance, desolation, loneliness, etc.</p>
</details>

我们也可能感受到大自然的奇妙，从而激发起对大自然的好奇心和探索欲。这些都是非常正常的情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We may also feel the wonders of nature. Arousing curiosity about nature, and desire to explore, these are all very normal emotions.</p>
</details>

然而，理学的格物致知，本质上是一种命题作文，它是要规范一个人的审美体验。也就是说，当你面对大自然时，你必须感受到万事万物中的秩序，一切都如此天衣无缝，从而让你感受到你与天道合一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the study of things to gain knowledge, essentially a propositional essay, it is to regulate a person's aesthetic experience. That is to say, when you face nature, you have to feel that order in everything. Everything is so seamless, so that you can feel that you are one with the Way of Heaven.</p>
</details>

在这种情况下，个人就不再需要怀疑什么，批判什么，孤独、异化、焦虑，都是偏离自然秩序的病态表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this case, then individuals don't need to doubt anything anymore. What to criticize, loneliness, alienation, anxiety, they are all pathological deviations from the natural order.</p>
</details>

所谓“**存天理，灭人欲**”（Preserving Heavenly Principle and Eliminating Human Desires: 程朱理学核心主张），当你的“人欲”被彻底消灭时，真理就从内部涌现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The so-called "preserving the principles of heaven and eliminating human desires", when your human desires are completely destroyed, the truth emerges from within.</p>
</details>

### 理学理想人格的扭曲与体系的瓦解

因此，理学培养的是一种精致而温顺的心态，它将麻木和逃避巧妙地包装成一种对自然的审美体验。既然一切都如此和谐有序，那么顺从君主所建立的礼制，接受现实的一切苦难，也就理所当然了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, science cultivates a refined and docile mentality, it turns numbness and escape, cleverly packaged in a, aesthetic experience of nature. Since everything is so harmonious and orderly, then follow the ritual system established by the monarch, it is only natural to accept all the sufferings of reality.</p>
</details>

正如俗话所说：“世上本无事，庸人自扰之。”只要你悟透了这个境界，你就会发现没有什么能阻碍你。但这本质上是一种心理按摩，也是一种麻痹自我的精神胜利法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As the saying goes, "There is no obstacle for man in the world." As long as you understand this state, you'll find nothing is holding you back. But this is essentially a psychological massage, it is also a way to numb yourself to a spiritual victory.</p>
</details>

正如我们在视频中谈到**王阳明**（Wang Yangming: 明代心学集大成者）时所说，自宋代以来，随着皇权的逐渐扩张，儒家士大夫的地位变得更加卑微。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As, we are talking about what Wang Yangming said in the video, since the Song Dynasty, as the imperial power gradually expanded, the status of Confucian scholars became more humble.</p>
</details>

例如，越来越多的士大夫对皇帝表达感激时，使用贬低的自称“**虮虱小臣**”（Kijie Xiaochen: 意为微不足道的臣子，自比为虱子般渺小）。他们越来越多地将自己比作狗、马、昆虫和老鼠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, more and more scholars and officials expressed their gratitude to the emperor, using the derogatory self-proclaimed title of "虮買小臣". They increasingly compare themselves to dogs, horses, insects, and rats.</p>
</details>

这恰恰说明，程朱理学所倡导的那种春光明媚、身心舒畅的境界，其本质是相当扭曲的。这严重违背了当事人的真实感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This just shows, the kind of spring and bright scenery advocated by Neo-Confucianism, physical state of comfort, it's quite twisted in nature. This seriously violates the true feelings of the parties involved.</p>
</details>

这类似于朝鲜官方发布的宣传片中，每个朝鲜人都如此热情洋溢，充满自信，没有烦恼和痛苦。但这种自信和热情背后，实际上是相当深重的压抑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is similar to what is shown in the official video released by North Korea. Every Korean is so enthusiastic. Full of confidence, no worries or pain. But behind this confidence and enthusiasm, it's actually a pretty deep depression.</p>
</details>

从这里，我们也可以看到中国社会一个普遍现象。许多人有这样的困扰，他们觉得身边的人似乎都完美地融入了秩序，并且看起来很幸福。在这种情况下，如果你感到焦虑，那是因为你的内心太过阴暗和肮脏，总是关注负面的东西，不够心胸开阔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From here, we can also see a common phenomenon in Chinese society. Many people have this kind of trouble. They feel that the people around them, seems to fit perfectly into the order, and looks happy. In this case, then you feel anxious, it's because my heart is too dark and dirty. Always focus on the negative things, not broad-minded enough.</p>
</details>

这暗示着一种理解：个人所有的情绪波动，都是个人道德修养不足的表现。中国文化习惯用非常简单的东西来比喻理想人格，例如水、玉和气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This implies a kind of understanding, all emotional fluctuations of the individual, it's all a sign of insufficient personal moral cultivation. Chinese culture is accustomed to using very simple things, metaphor for ideal personality, for example, water, jade, and qi.</p>
</details>

它们的共同点是都温润细腻，水和气清澈透明，无法保持自己的形状。因此，它们也是最能融入万事万物的。它们利万物而不争，能够融入环境而不反抗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Their commonality is that they are all gentle and delicate, water and air are clear and transparent, it can't maintain its shape. Therefore, they are also the most able to integrate into everything. They benefit all things without competing, able to blend into the environment without resisting.</p>
</details>

这也是程朱理学最推崇的理想人格：纯洁无瑕，光明磊落，表里如一，大公无私。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is also the ideal personality most respected by Neo-Confucianism. That is pure and flawless, bright and upright, be consistent and selfless.</p>
</details>

然而，这实际上是一种危险的诱惑和精密的规训。一个健康的人格，绝不是一尘不染、洁净无暇的，而必然存在矛盾、欲望或阴暗的部分。甚至这些东西，才是一个人前进和探索的动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, this is actually a dangerous temptation. and sophisticated discipline. A healthy personality, it is definitely not spotless and clean. But there must be contradictions, desires or dark parts. Even these things, it drives a person forward and explores.</p>
</details>

如果一个人真的像理学所倡导的那样，纯洁无欲、温顺，那么他就会失去自己的边界和判断力，成为权力所塑造的范本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If a person is really like what rationalism advocates, pure, desireless, gentle, then he will lose his boundaries and judgment. Becoming a model created by power.</p>
</details>

因此，理学的崩坏和瘫痪是必然的。它一方面强调天理无所不包，无处不在，但它感知世界的方式却是僵化、封闭和单一的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, the collapse and paralysis of science is inevitable. On the one hand, it emphasizes that the law of nature is all-encompassing. Ubiquitous. But the way it perceives the world, but it is rigid, closed and single.</p>
</details>

结果，它只能让人一遍又一遍地重复圣人的话，闭目塞听。在这种状态下，**王阳明的心学**（Wang Yangming's Philosophy of Mind: 强调“心即理”和“知行合一”的儒家学派）应运而生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Turn out, it can only make people repeat the words of the saints over and over again, close your eyes and ears. In this state, Yangming's philosophy of mind came into being.</p>

相较于程朱理学，它看起来更激进，更充满幻想和神秘色彩，但它实际上只是中国文化走向末路的一种回光返照。下一期视频，我们再来聊聊王阳明的心学。
