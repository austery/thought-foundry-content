title: 甲骨文巨额融资数据中心、特斯拉财报与Palantir合作：市场动态全解析
---

### 市场动态速览：甲骨文、Palantir与特斯拉

大家好，欢迎回到本频道。我们又回到了每日回顾节目。今天有很多事情要谈。首先，甲骨文（**Oracle**）在盘后宣布了一项380亿美元的债务发行，用于建设数据中心，你猜对了。我们将讨论这一事件及其对数据中心公司的影响。Palantir今天签署了一项相当大的合作协议，估计是与Lumen公司达成的潜在2亿美元的多年期合作。我们将讨论这项合作及其意义。财报季已经正式开始。下周将迎来许多大型科技公司的财报，但我们昨天已经看到了特斯拉（**Tesla**）的财报。因此，我们将回顾特斯拉的财报，并讨论过去48小时内发生的一些财报事件以及一些宏观数据。关于财报的基本论点是，根据我们今天收到的财报，第三季度看起来将是一个相当强劲的季度。英特尔（**Intel**）和福特（**Ford**）的财报表现也并非最差。所以，我们有很多要谈的。让我们开始吧。

<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. We have got a bunch to talk about today. Number one, Oracle after hours $38 billion debt offering in regards to building out, you guessed it, data centers. We're going to talk about it, the implications on what it means for those data center companies. Palier signed a pretty large partnership today. The estimate is potentially $200 million multi-year partnership with Lumen. We're going to talk about that partnership, what it means. earnings. We are officially in earnings season. Next week is really when we get a lot of the big tech earnings, but we did have Tesla yesterday. So, we're going to recap Tesla, talk about some of the earnings that have happened throughout uh the past 48 hours along with some macro stats. The basic argument here on earnings is that it's looking like Q3 is going to be a pretty strong quarter based on the earnings that we got today. Intel and Ford, not the worst earnings in the world. So, we got a lot to talk about. Let's get into it.</p>
</details>

### 甲骨文巨额债务融资与数据中心建设

好的，让我们从甲骨文的债务新闻开始。我认为这其中有几个非常重要的含义。首先，头条新闻是什么？甲骨文在一小时前盘后宣布，正在完成一项380亿美元的债务发行，很可能是通过某种形式的公司债券。他们在一个月前发行了130亿美元的债券，当时公司债券的利率约为6.5%。我们不知道这些新债券的具体利率，但其中235亿美元将用于德克萨斯州的一个数据中心，147.5亿美元将用于威斯康星州一个项目的设施建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's start off with this debt news around Oracle. So, there's a couple of implications to this that I think are really important. First of all, what is the headline? Oracle, and this came out really an hour ago after hours. Quite incredible to see this uh is completing a $38 billion debt offering uh likely through some version of corporate bonds. They did 13 billion a month ago, and they were giving out about 6.5% on those corporate bonds. We don't know the exact rate on these bonds, but it will be 23.5 billion towards a data center in Texas and 14.75 billion to a facility that is going to help a project in Wisconsin.</p>
</details>

Vantage Data Centers是负责开发这两个数据中心的公司，这两个数据中心将由甲骨文用于为**OpenAI**（一家人工智能研究与部署公司）提供支持。我们在这个频道上已经多次讨论过OpenAI对整个生态系统的重要性，以及OpenAI最终需要取得多大的成功。这里有一个有趣的数据：AMD、英伟达（**Nvidia**）、博通（**Broadcom**）和甲骨文在过去两个月宣布与OpenAI建立合作关系后，它们的总市值合计增长了6300亿美元。因此，OpenAI显然在许多正在发生的事情中扮演着不可或缺的角色。现在看来，这380亿美元将由摩根大通（**JP Morgan**）、富国银行（**Wells Fargo**）、高盛（**Goldman Sachs**）提供融资。一些沙特、日本和法国的一些欧洲银行也参与其中。许多不同的公司都参与进来，表示“嘿，我们想帮助你为这个整体的数据中心建设提供融资。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Vantage Data Centers is the name of the company that's going to be developing both of the data centers, which are set to be used by Oracle to power OpenAI. We've been talking a lot about on on this channel about how vital Open AI is to this broader ecosystem and how much OpenAI ultimately needs to succeed. Here's a fun stat for everybody. AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle all had their market caps collectively go up by $630 billion in the following days after they announced their partnerships over the past two months with OpenAI. So, OpenAI obviously is integral to a lot of what's going on. And now it looks like $38 billion is going to be financed by JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs. You have some of the Saudis jumping into this, some of the Japanese, uh, some of the European banks as well in France. You have a ton of these different companies coming in to say, "Hey, we want to help you finance this overall data center buildout."</p>
</details>

现在，对此有两种看法：看涨和看跌。首先，看涨方面。我提到了Cipher、Terwolf、Bit Farms、Nebius、CoreWeave、Galaxy等公司。我可能遗漏了一些数据中心公司的名字，但无论你投资的是哪只股票，显然，如果你投资了AMD、英伟达、博通等数据中心相关股票，似乎对这种产品的需求是世界上最大的，而且可能永远都是世界上最大的。对数据中心的需求是**永不满足的**（insatiable）。**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscalers: 指提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如亚马逊AWS、微软Azure、谷歌云等）正在为其提供资金。超大规模云服务提供商的自由现金流继续为其提供补贴，因此，像Nebius、INE、Cipher这样的公司可能会获得三、四、五、七十亿美元的合同。它们的市值只有100亿到150亿美元，有人可能会认为这很昂贵，但如果它们获得这些交易，就会变得不那么昂贵，因为它们最终会展现出真正的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, two perspectives on this. Let's do bullish than bearish. Number one, bullish. I ran Cipher, Terwolf, Bit Farms, Nebius, Cororeweave, Galaxy. I'm probably leaving out some data center names, but whatever stock that you are in, obviously AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, if you're in those data center plays, uh it seems like the demand for this product is the biggest product in the world and it might be the biggest product in the world forever. The demand for data centers is insatiable. The hyperscalers are financing it. The free cash flows from the hypersalers are continuing to subsidize it and as a result, your Nebius, your INE, your cipher, they might get a three, four, five, seven billion dollar contract. their market caps are only from 10 to 15 billion dollars, which one could argue is expensive, but if they get these deals, it becomes less expensive because they end up showing real growth.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为如果你持有这些在过去几周遭受打击的股票，这其实是件好事，对吧？股市中的一切都遭受了打击，无论是高动量股还是像谷歌（**Google**）这样的普通股票，一切都需要经历一点回调，这样我们才能迎来下一波上涨。这处理起来有点痛苦，但归根结底，它是健康的。也许这正是故事的一部分，新闻的一部分，可以帮助我们推动这些数据中心相关股票的下一波上涨。顺便说一句，**标准普尔500指数**（S&P 500: 由标准普尔公司编制的包含美国500家大型上市公司股票的指数）收于671点。我的意思是，整体而言，这是一个相对不错的一天。一些动量股，甚至像Oaklo这样从193美元跌至118美元的股票，当天收盘时也达到了125美元。所以，当然，它没有回到195美元，但也没有跌破100美元。因此，你看到市场上的动量正在趋于稳定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think if you're in any of those names, which have taken a beating over the past couple weeks, and I think it's kind of good, right? Everything in the stock market took a beating, whether it was high momentum or it was just a regular, you know, name like like a Google, like everything needed to take a little bit of a pullback so we can get that next leg to go higher. It's a little painful to deal with, but at the end of the day, it is healthy. And uh maybe this is a part of the story, a part of the news that can help make us get that next leg up for those data center plays. By the way, the S&P 500 closed at 671. I mean, it was a relatively good day across the board. Some of those momentum names, even in Oaklo that fell from 193 down to 118, ended the day at 125. So, of course, it's not back at 195, but it's also not down, you know, below 100. So, you are seeing a little bit of that momentum stabilization across the market.</p>
</details>

现在，看跌方面。这是债务。这是债务。我们必须对此诚实。这是我不想看到的事情。我相信你们很多人也不想看到。我对此唯一的回答，也是我过去几周一直在努力证明债务融资合理性的回答是，如果人工智能（**AI**）能带来**投资回报率**（ROI: Return on Investment，投资收益），那么如果你现在投资于股市，你必须相信，无论你投资什么，都必须相信AI会带来一些投资回报率。只要有投资回报率，你就可以为其辩护。如果没有投资回报率，如果甲骨文认为他们不会获得任何回报，那么他们就不会乐意支付这400亿美元的6.5%利息，因为他们会赚取远超6.5%的收益。那样的话，这一切都会崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here's the bare case. This is debt. This is debt. And we got to be honest about it. This is something that I don't love to see. I'm sure a lot of you guys don't love to see and my only response to this, which has been my response over the past couple weeks as I've been trying to justify why the debt financing makes sense, is that if there is an ROI from AI, which if you're invested in the stock market at this point, you've got to believe got no matter what you're in, you've got to believe there's going to be some ROI on AI. As long as there is an ROI, you can justify it. If there is no ROI, if there is no, you know, return that Oracle thinks they're going to get, which is why they're happy to pay this 6 and a half% interest that they have to pay on this 40 billion bucks because they're going to make way more than six and a half%. Then this all falls apart.</p>
</details>

所以，我的逻辑是人工智能的用例正在不断发展。AMD今天早上谈到通过人工智能与另一家公司合作，帮助在疾病发生前进行检测。我知道人工智能的初级用例，比如会议纪要，这仍然很重要，可以提高公司的生产力，但它不像我们预期的那样重要。**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 全自动驾驶）、机器人技术、个人助理——所有这些都将在未来出现。只要它能如我们所想的那样实现，我们不知道，我们都将亲身经历这一生，看看它是否会实现，那么这种投资回报率就会存在。所以，我认为对于那些害怕债务的人来说，你们应该害怕。我认为每个投资者都应该觉得“这笔债务很多”，但如果这项技术确实有价值，能够偿还债务，那么它很可能是有意义的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, my logic here is that the use cases of AI are just evolving. AMD this morning talked about helping to detect certain illnesses before they happen with a different company via AI. I know the you know elementary use cases of AI like taking a meeting summary which is still important and can make companies more productive is not as important as we're expecting FSD robotics personal assistance all of this stuff is coming in the future and as long as it manifests in what we think it can manifest into and we don't know we're going to have to see we're all living through this lifetime to see if that plays out this ROI is going to be there so I think for the people that are afraid that it's debt you should be afraid I think every investor should be like well it's a lot of debt but if the technology actually has value that can pay back the debt, then it likely makes sense.</p>
</details>

### 近期财报季表现强劲

好的，下一个话题。各位，让我们谈谈财报。我们一直在收到相当不错的财报结果，这真是令人难以置信。所以，我今天想分享几个数据。到目前为止，在**标准普尔500指数**（S&P 500）中已公布财报的60家公司中，85%的公司盈利超出了预期，平均超出8%。所以，你看到整体盈利增长，并且超出了部分预期。今天公布财报的一些公司，Digital Realty的盈利超出了510%。Nextracker的盈利超出了18%。福特（**Ford**），一家传统汽车公司，盈利超出了25%。顺便说一句，他们的营收超出了30亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, next topic. Uh let's talk about earnings, folks. We have been getting some pretty damn good earnings results across the board, and it is quite incredible to see. So, I just want to give a couple stats today. Out of the 60 companies that have reported in the S&P 500 so far, 85% of them have beat earnings by an average of 8%. So, you are seeing that earnings growth across the board and beating some of the estimates. Some of the companies today that reported digital realy, they beat earnings by 510%. Next Tracker beat earnings by 18%. Ford, you know, legacy auto company beat earnings by 25%. By the way, revenue they beat by three billion. I mean, just just a quick note on Ford, you know, Ford sells cars to the consumer.</p>
</details>

只是关于福特的一个简短说明，福特将汽车销售给消费者。消费者必须能够购买这些汽车，福特才能赚钱。我并不是说经济中没有问题或裂缝，但如果人们愿意在第三季度购买价值30亿美元的汽车，超出预期，这意味着消费者的情况可能并非最糟糕。他们并非处于最佳状态，但可能并非处于最糟糕的状态。Newmont的盈利超出了19%。Deckers，另一个消费品牌，销售鞋子和服装，盈利超出了15%。然后，今天的股票，今天的故事是英特尔（**Intel**）的盈利超出了2200%。每股收益23美分，而预期为1美分。英特尔取得了巨大的胜利。Donny T在几个月前确实持有90亿美元的股份。应该跟着Donny T。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The consumer has to be able to buy those cars for Ford to make money. I'm not saying that there's not issues or cracks in the economy, but if people are willing to buy $3 billion worth of cars in Q3 ahead of expectations, that means the consumer might not be in the worst situation. They're not in the best situation, but they might not be in the worst situation. Pneumont beat earnings by 19%. Deckers, another consumer brand, selling shoes and clothes, beat earnings by 15%. And then you had the uh basically stock of the day, story of the day. Intel beating earnings by 2,200%. 23 cents versus 1 cent expected. Massive, massive beat for Intel. Donny T did have that $9 billion stake that they took a couple months ago. Should have followed Donn T.</p>
</details>

那么，这对盈利前景意味着什么呢？我认为最重要的一点是，归根结底，许多公司在营收上超出预期，或者营收符合预期，但它们真正在**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share，指公司每股普通股所赚取的利润）上表现出色。为什么这很重要？每股收益是每股盈利的函数。你如何确定每股收益？你需要计算公司流通股的总数。你需要计算盈利，也就是**公认会计原则净收入**（GAAP Net Income: 指根据公认会计原则计算出的公司在扣除所有费用和税款后的净利润），而不是营业收入，而是公司在扣除所有费用后实际能够产生的收入，然后你必须将其除以股票数量，然后你就会得到每股收益。如果公司的利润率提高，它们的盈利就会更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so look what does this mean about the earnings picture? I think the most important thing that it says about the earnings picture is that the at the end of the day a lot of these companies are beating on revenue or they're beating you know in or they're coming in line with revenue but they're really beating on EPS. Now why does that matter? EPS is a function of earnings per share. How do you determine earnings per share? Well you have to take the total shares outstanding in a company. You have to take the earnings, aka the net income, the gap net income, not the operating income, but the actual income after all of your expenses that a company is able to produce, and then you have to divide it by the number of shares, and then you get an EPS, an earnings per share. If the margins on a company are going higher, they have better earnings.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你每赚一美元利润就能获得30美分，那么你的净利润率就是30%。如果你每赚一美元就能获得35美分，那么你的净利润率就是35%。利润率的增长超出了分析师的预期。**华尔街**（Wall Street: 指美国金融市场及其参与者）是什么？华尔街是一场感知而非现实的游戏。最终，它会变成现实，但在短期内，它是感知。如果华尔街的感知是AMD将达到每股1.50美元，而AMD实际达到每股1.75美元，那么就比华尔街预期高出每股25美分。我看到所有这些财报，对于那些每天关注市场开盘和收盘的人来说，我们看到所有这些财报，公司表现都相当出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you're making 30 cents on every dollar in profit, you have a 30% net income margin. If you're making 35 cents on every dollar, you have a 35% net income margin. at margin increase ahead of what the analysts are expecting. And what is Wall Street? Wall Street is a game of perception, not reality. Eventually, it becomes reality, but in the short term, it is perception. If the perception on Wall Street is that AMD is going to do a $150 a share, and AMD does $1.75 a share, that's 25 cents per share more than the street expected. And what I'm seeing in terms of all these earnings, and for those that follow the market, open, market, close every day, as we're looking at all these earnings, companies are beating pretty damn well.</p>
</details>

### 人工智能对盈利增长的影响

那么，这就引出了一个问题：这些表现出色的公司，它们表现出色是因为人工智能吗？它们表现出色是因为盈利吗？它们表现出色是因为它们的盈利如此之好，它们的利润率提升如此之好，它们的生产力如此之好，以至于人工智能让它们展现出如此好的盈利吗？我认为这是一个根本性的问题，我还没有一个明确的答案。在财报季结束后，我希望能够整理所有这些公司发布的财报，并从中寻找一些主题。但如果它们都开始提到，由于员工生产力提高，利润率正在上升，员工在公司中拥有更多的决策权，因为他们拥有更多的自主权来做出新的决策，在人工智能的进步下更具创造力。因此，我们实际上在内部和外部的产品和服务方面，以及与我们合作的公司和员工方面，都看到了进展，这带来了更好的业务成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then it begs the question for the companies that are beating um wait a second are they beating because of AI? Are they beating because of earnings? Are they beating because their earnings are so good then their margin enhancement is so good and their productivity is so good that AI is allowing them to show up these good earnings? I think that is the existential question and I don't have a definitive response for this yet. after earning season is done, I kind of want to compile all the transcripts that we've heard from all these companies and you know kind of look for some themes in what these the these companies are saying. But if they all start mentioning margins are going up because workers are becoming more productive, employees ultimately have more decisions in the company as they have more autonomy to make new decisions, be more creative with the advance of AI. And as a result, we are actually seeing progress internally and externally with our products and services than internally with the companies uh that we're working with and the employees that we're working with to produce those products and services which is leading to better business results.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这在一定程度上是人工智能在股市中的承诺，这也解释了**标准普尔500指数**（S&P 500）目前以26倍市盈率交易，而历史上应该以18倍市盈率交易的原因，即我们被一定程度上证实了标准普尔指数在这些水平上交易是合理的。市场要想以高于历史水平的价格交易，唯一的办法是如果有什么东西对市场来说确实很重要，能够给你一个理由，让投资者愿意支付更高的倍数。很多时候，投资者是基于纯粹的炒作而支付更高的倍数。如果盈利增长确实存在，而且并非所有公司都能做到这一点，但对于那些重要的公司来说，如果它们能做到，那么盈利倍数将继续扩大，因为你还能把钱投到哪里呢？是的，你有黄金，你有加密货币，但归根结底，如果你想让你的钱在一个能产生自由现金流和净收入的资产中复合增长，你需要把它投入到真正能增长的东西中。如果它显示出增长，你就会愿意支付更高的溢价，特别是如果存在有意义的长期增长轨迹，这正是支撑市场今天所处位置的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean that is the promise of AI at least to an extent in the stock market and also what that matters for the S&P 500 which is trading at 26 times earnings uh you know historically should be trading at 18 times is that we are validated to an extent to have the S&P trade at these levels. The only way you get a market to trade at higher than historical levels if is if something actually matters to that market to be able to give you a reason for why investors should pay a multiple. Lots of times investors pay a higher multiple based on pure hype. If the earnings growth is there and again not every company's going to put that up for but for the companies that matter if they can put that up then that earnings multiple will continue to expand because where else are you going to put your money right like yes you have gold you have crypto but at the end of the day if you want your money to compound inside of an asset that produces free cash flow and net income you need to put it into something that can actually grow and if it's showing the growth you're willing to pay a bit more of a premium especially if there is meaningful growth that is a trajectory of longevity and that's what justifies the market being where it is today.</p>
</details>

所以，看到我们迄今为止看到的盈利情况真是令人难以置信，我只希望在第三季度，当世界上最重要的公司从下周开始公布财报时，这种情况能够继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it is quite incredible to see the earnings that we've seen so far and I'm just hoping that in Q3 that can continue when we get the most important companies in the world that are starting next week.</p>
</details>

### 特斯拉财报分析与未来展望

好的，特斯拉。让我们谈谈特斯拉。特斯拉的这个季度，我们过去几天也讨论过，是一个不错的季度，但不是一个非常出色的季度。我的意思是，这只是一个让华尔街觉得“好吧，酷”的季度。你知道，我们只是想看看进展是否能像所有人认为的那样最终继续下去。特斯拉当天实际上收涨，因为整个市场都上涨了，收于448.98美元。盘后略有下跌。它一度跌至418美元。所以，如果你在418美元买入，现在大约在450美元。他们的**每股收益**（EPS）不及预期，实际为50美分，而预期为55美分。所以，他们的每股收益不及预期。他们在营收上超出预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Tesla. Let's talk about Tessy. So, look, Tesla had one of those quarters, we talked about it over the past couple days that was a good quarter, not a great quarter. Um, and you know, it was just one of those quarters where the street was like, "All right, cool." You know, we're just going to see if the progress can continue the way that everyone thinks it eventually will continue. Tesla actually ended green on the day as the entire market came up uh 448.98 a little bit red after hours. It did fall all the way to 418. So if you did buy that 418 dip uh you got it here now round about at 450. Uh they missed on EPS 55 cents versus 50 expected. Uh so or 50 cents versus 55 cents expected. So they missed on EPS. They beat on revenue. The biggest thing about this Tesla earnings is that when you listen to Elon on the call, I mean it was typical Elon, right?</p>
</details>

关于特斯拉财报最重要的事情是，当你听埃隆·马斯克（**Elon Musk**）在电话会议上的发言时，我的意思是，那是典型的埃隆。他充满活力。他谈论了业务周围的不同事情，**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 全自动驾驶）、自动驾驶、机器人。我的意思是，他最终说他将建立一支机器人大军，他不希望失去对这支机器人大军的控制权，所以每个人都需要投票支持他的薪酬方案。所以，我的意思是，你看到了典型的埃隆式言论。唯一让很多人不满的是，他们没有谈论未来的产品，我理解他们为什么不能这样做，但他们似乎没有真正回答大多数股东关心的问题。所以，这是让一些特斯拉忠实粉丝不满的一点，他们没有得到这些答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He you know he had some energy. He was talking about different things around the business, FSD, autonomy, robots. I mean, ended up saying that he's going to build a robot army and he doesn't want to lose controlling power of that robot army, so everyone needs to vote for his compensation package. So, I mean, you had the typical Elon thing there. The one thing that pissed off a lot of people was that they didn't talk about future products and I understand why they can't do it, but like they kind of didn't really answer the questions that most shareholders cared about. So, that was one thing that uh was not the best for some of the Tesla faithful that were just annoyed they didn't get those answers.</p>
</details>

我认为最重要的事情如下。根据埃隆在这次电话会议和上次电话会议上的发言，目前业务状况下，进入2026年似乎没有大规模的盈利增长潜力。原因在于，即使他们明年将能源业务翻倍，也无法对公司实际能够实现的净收入或盈利增长产生有意义的影响。汽车交付量是未知数。我的意思是，电动汽车补贴正在取消。所以问题变成了，在没有电动汽车补贴的情况下，他们能否像今年一样销售那么多汽车？现在利率正在下降，这应该会有所帮助。但无论如何，如果人们不购买那么多特斯拉汽车，他们就不会有那么多原始营收。所以这是另一个可能在明年无法帮助他们的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the biggest thing is as follows. Based on what Elon said on this call and the last call, it doesn't look like there's massive earnings growth potential going into 2026 at the current state of the business. And the reason for that is because energy, even if they double it next year, is not going to make a meaningful difference in terms of the actual net income or earnings growth that the company can put up. Vehicle deliveries, this is the wild card. I mean, look, the EV subsidy is going away. So, the question becomes, without the EV subsidy, are they going to be able to sell as many vehicles as they did even this year? Now you do have rates coming down which should hopefully be helpful. But nonetheless, if people aren't buying that many Teslas, they're just not going to have that much, you know, raw revenue coming through the door. So that's another problem that's potentially not going to help them next year.</p>
</details>

**擎天柱**（Optimus: 特斯拉正在开发的人形机器人项目），埃隆表示擎天柱的生产将于明年开始。这很棒，但这并不意味着他们已经收到了擎天柱的订单。当然，如果他们报告说像沃尔玛（**Walmart**）这样的公司正在购买200万个机器人，并且已经下达了采购订单，那将是完全不同的问题。这可能会在一夜之间完全改变股票的估值，但到目前为止，这还没有真正进入公众视野。那么问题就变成了**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 全自动驾驶）。FSD，你知道，我最近更新了。我还没有到14版本。我之前是13.2版本。我说FSD在强制你不断地看路方面很烦人，甚至如果你收到消息，4秒钟内都不能看手机。这真的很烦人。埃隆明确表示，如果我们能达到车内的人可以发短信和开车，也就是说，他们可以，你知道，发短信只是一个比喻，在车里做任何他们想做的事情，而不必担心被“请注意”之类的消息轰炸，那就是他们赢了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Optimus, Elon said production for Optimus is going to start next year. So that's great, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily getting orders yet for Optimus. Now, that could change if they report that like Walmart's buying two million robots and they already put in a purchase order for them. That's a whole different question. that could completely rebate the stock overnight, but uh that so far has not really, you know, put in into the the the ether. So then the question just becomes FSD. And FSD, you know, I updated recently. I'm not on 14 yet. I was at 13.2. And I said that the nagging that FSD does in terms of forcing you to like constantly look in the road, not even check your phone if you get a message for like 4 seconds. Um that was really annoying. And Elon said specifically if we can get to the point where people in the car can text and drive aka they can, you know, text being a metaphor, do whatever they want in the car without having to worry about getting bombarded with messages of like paying attention, that's when they win.</p>
</details>

我同意，如果特斯拉真的能实现无人监督的FSD，因为我每天都在使用它，我喜欢它。如果你能让车里的人做任何他们想做的事情，而不必担心驾驶的后果，那将是一个颠覆性的改变。不幸的是，特斯拉还没有达到那个阶段，但埃隆知道他们正在接近。如果他们最终实现了这个目标，无论他们销售多少辆汽车，他们都会赢，因为到目前为止，还没有其他公司能够做到这一点。现在，有很多公司正在与Waymo（**Waymo**）和所有这些其他自动驾驶初创公司竞争。但这是特斯拉最关心的事情之一。

<p class="english-text">And I agree if that if if Tesla can actually get unsupervised FSD because I use it every day and I love it. If if you could get someone to do whatever they want in the car without having to worry about the implications of like driving, that would be a game changer. Unfortunately, Tesla's not there yet, but Elon knows that they're getting closer. And if they do end up achieving that goal, they're going to win regardless of how much uh, you know, vehicles they sell because no other company has so far been able to do that. Now, there's a lot of companies that are competing with your Whimos and all these other AV startups. But that's one of the main things Tesla cares about.</p>
</details>

我认为进入2026年的大问题是，这只股票的估值非常激进。当然，特斯拉一直以非常激进的估值交易。所以，你知道，我喜欢特斯拉的原因之一是，你能够建立一个长期叙事和故事，并提前拉动增长，然后看着这种增长以S曲线增长。问题是现在股票不再是200美元了。股票是450美元。所以，如果你期望2026年出现上涨，问题是盈利增长将从何而来，或者他们甚至需要盈利增长吗？现在，你可以说他们不需要盈利增长，因为他们的盈利潜力如此之强，以至于他们现在没有盈利增长并不重要。它将在未来发生。这很公平。而且，随着利率下降等因素，这很可能会推动股价上涨。人们可能只是想把钱停泊在特斯拉。但是，如果我们再经历一年负30%的盈利增长，再次强调，特斯拉并没有增长。它是负30%的增长，尽管估值假设它们正在增长，那么问题就变成了明年还有多少上涨空间。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think the big thing going into 2026 is that this stock trades at a very aggressive valuation. Now, Tesla's always traded at a very aggressive valuation. So, you know, one of the reasons I like Tesla is because you're able to build a narrative and a story long term and kind of pull forward the growth and then watch that growth grow into an S-curve. The problem is the stock's not $200 anymore. The stock's at $450. So, if you're expecting upside in 2026, the question is where is the earnings growth coming from or do they even need earnings growth? Now, you could say they don't need earnings growth because the potential of their earnings is so strong that it doesn't really matter that they don't have the earnings growth right now. It's going to happen in the future. That's fair. And that might very well take the stock higher as rates come down, etc. people might just want to park their money in Tesla. Um, but if we have another year of negative 30% earnings growth, again, Tesla is not growing. It's negative 30% growth, even though the valuation is assuming that they're growing, then the question just becomes what's the upside going into next year.</p>
</details>

我确实认为有上涨空间。我只是认为这要到下半年，当你开始在**FSD**（Full Self-Driving）和**擎天柱**（Optimus）方面取得更多进展，并开始看到它真正实现时。在此之前，我认为一切照旧。我的意思是，这不是一个糟糕的季度。这不是一个非常出色的季度。这是一个不错的季度，而且股价相对于这个季度来说相对持平。我的意思是，昨天是440美元。今天是448美元。所以，你没有看到爆炸性的上涨，但也没有看到爆炸性的下跌。我认为这应该就是这样。我的意思是，特斯拉不应该出现大规模的下跌，因为所有人都知道这个故事：FSD、机器人技术。只是这个故事今天还没有在盈利中实现。2026年的问题是，投资者愿意为这个故事最终实现支付多少溢价。我很想知道在聊天中，我的意思是，你愿意以这些价格补贴特斯拉，而不是像英伟达（**Nvidia**）、亚马逊（**Amazon**）、谷歌（**Google**）、Meta（**Meta**）所有这些正在展现盈利增长的公司，因为你相信它们的S曲线的指数性质如此之强，以至于今天的倍数并不重要。重要的是特斯拉能否真正增长到那个倍数。如果情况确实如此，那么我们最终会看到特斯拉的故事如何发展。但这不是一个糟糕的季度，也不是一个非常出色的季度，只是一个普通的季度。如果特斯拉继续执行，希望这个季度能转化为2026年的正增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I do think there is upside. I just think it's towards the latter half of the year when you start to get more progress around FSD and optimist and you start to see that really materialize. Until then, I think it's business as usual. I mean, it was not a bad quarter. It was not a good quarter in or not a phenomenal quarter. It was a decent quarter and the stock is relatively flat based on the quarter. I mean, it was at 440 yesterday. It's at 448 today. So, you didn't have this explosive upside, but you also didn't have explosive downside. And I think that's how it should be. Like, you shouldn't have massive downside for Tesla when everyone knows the story. FSD Robotics. It's just that story is not materializing in earnings today. The question for 2026 is how much investors are willing to pay in terms of a premium for that story to materialize eventually. And I would love to know in the chat, I mean like are you willing to subsidize at these prices Tesla uh over like an Nvidia, Amazon, Google, Meta, all these other companies that are showing the earnings growth because you believe the expon exponential nature of their S-curves are so strong that it doesn't matter what the multiple is today. It matters can Tesla actually grow into that multiple. And if that's the case, then ultimately we're going to see how the story plays out with Tesla. But not a bad quarter, not a phenomenal quarter, just a regular quarter. And if Tesla keeps executing, hopefully that quarter turns into positive growth going into 26.</p>

### Palantir与Lumen的合作及Alex Karp的观点

好的，今天的最后一件事是Palantir和亚历克斯·卡普（**Alex Karp**）。现在，我将在视频末尾附上一个小型合集视频，其中包含Palantir首席执行官亚历克斯·卡普最新采访的一些精彩片段。这次采访是在**福克斯商业频道**（Fox Business）进行的。我认为这是一次很棒的采访。所以，我会在最后发布一些片段，让大家了解一些精彩亮点。主要内容是，Palantir和Lumen达成了一项大型合作，一项多年期合作，价值2亿美元。本质上，Palantir和Lumen将通过协作努力，为他们共同的客户提供价值，特别是在政府和商业领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, last thing for today is Palanteer and Alex Karp. Now, I'm going to attach a small compilation video at the end of this video that has a couple clips of the best moments of Palanteer's uh CEO Alex Karp's new interview. Uh this was on Fox Business. I thought it was a great interview. So, a couple clips that I will be posting at the end for you guys to get some of the juicy highlights. Main thing, Pounder, and Lumen, big partnership, multi-year partnership, $200 million. essentially pounder and lumen are going to be working in a collaborative effort to be able to deliver value to all the clients that they both share, especially in the government and commercial space.</p>
</details>

非常酷的事情。两位首席执行官都来到了福克斯商业频道，这与许多其他首席执行官谈论Palantir的方式非常相似。Palantir的价值来自于价值创造的下游。如果他们能够创造价值，他们就能获得报酬。你知道，这次采访的首席执行官基本上说：“卡普走进房间，向我们展示了价值，然后我们决定签署一份大合同，因为归根结底，Palantir能够以一种非常非常复杂的方式做到其他许多数据服务提供商无法做到的事情。”所以总的来说，听着，我过去几天一直这么说。我认为Palantir在财报后有机会达到200美元。我确实在17238美元买入了一点。我知道我正在购买一家以非常昂贵倍数交易的公司。我只是认为，从逻辑上讲，如果他们能实现50%到55%的盈利增长，我认为股价可能会更高。我可能错了，也许华尔街预期这个数字，而Palantir的表现略低于预期，然后下跌10%，这种情况可能发生。我愿意接受。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um, pretty cool stuff. They both the CEOs came on Fox Business and it's very similar to a lot of other CEOs and how they talk about Palunteer. Palanteer's value is downstream from value creation. If they're able to create value, they're able to get paid. And you know, the CEO of this interview basically said, "Carp came into the room, showed us the value, and then we decided to sign a big contract because at the end of the day, a palenteer is able to do what they can do in a very very sophisticated way that a lot of other data service providers just aren't able to do. So overall, look, I I I've said this over the past couple days. I think Paler has a shot at 200 after um after their earnings. I did buy a little bit at 17238. I know I'm buying a company that is trading at a very expensive multiple. I just think logically if they show 50 to 55% earnings growth I think the stock probably goes higher. I could be wrong and maybe the street's expecting that number and pounder comes in a little bit less and then it goes down 10% that can happen. I'm willing to deal with it.</p>
</details>

我愿意使用**平均成本法**（DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging，一种投资策略，定期定额投资，以降低市场波动风险），投资我真正相信的公司，即使我以更高的倍数购买它们，但我认为这可能是一个非常好的季度，如果确实如此，那么我认为这对Palantir及其发展轨迹来说可能非常好。在我们播放这些Palantir片段之前，我想快速说两件关于宏观经济的事情。第一，唐纳德·特朗普（**Donald Trump**）确认他将于10月30日与X会面。这对于缓解与中国的关系并可能达成谈判协议非常重要。所以这很重要。这将在10月30日发生。詹姆森·格里尔（**Jameson Greer**）和本特（Bent）将与中国副总理，也就是中国的贸易代表进行会谈。所以，美国贸易代表詹姆森·格里尔和本特与中国进行更多对话是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I I I am willing to DCA into the companies that I really do believe in even if I'm buying them at a higher multiple but I think it could be a really good quarter and if it is a really good quarter then I think that could be really good for Pounder and their trajectory. Two quick things I just want to say on the macro before we play these pounder clips. Number one, uh Trump confirmed he will be meeting with X on October 30th. very important for easing China relations and potentially getting a negotiated deal. Uh so that's going to be important. That's going to happen Octo October 30th. Jameson Greer and Bent are going to be speaking to the China vice premier which is China's trade representative. So it's good to have more conversation between Bent Jameson Greer who is the trade representative for the United States and China.</p>

### 宏观经济动态与股票回购

然后最后我想在这里说的是宏观经济。各位，股票回购正在开始。我们过去大约一个月一直处于股票回购的**静默期**（Blackout Period: 指公司在财报公布前禁止回购股票的时期）。随着财报季的到来，公司不能真正回购自己的股票。这个时期即将结束。所以这里的数据是，特朗普还赦免了**CZ**（Changpeng Zhao: 赵长鹏，加密货币领域的知名人物），他是加密货币领域的一个重要人物。所以这是今天发生的另一件事，基本上他说他受到了拜登政府对加密货币战争的个人起诉，这就是他获得赦免的原因。股票回购同比增长16%，达到创纪录的1.15万亿美元，连续第二年增长。美国四大银行的股票回购同比增长96亿美元。2025年第三季度为210亿美元，自2020年低点以来，股票回购授权已增加两倍多。我们即将进入一个有更多公司回购股票的11月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then final thing I want to say right here on macro. Uh buybacks are starting folks. Buybacks are starting. We've been in a blackout period for buybacks over the past basically month. As we get into earnings, companies can't really buy back their stock. That period is coming to an end. And so the stat right here also Trump pardoned CZ, which is like this massive figure in the crypto space. So that was another thing that happened today and basically said he was being personally prosecuted by the Biden administration's war on crypto and uh that's why he got a pardon. Uh buybacks have rose 16% year-over-year, reaching a record 1.15 trillion, second consecutive yearly increase. Uh buybacks by the four largest US banks jumped 9.6 billion year-over-year. Uh 21 billion is in Q3 2025 and since the 2020 low share repurchase authorizations have more than tripled. We're getting into a November where more companies are going to buy back their stock.</p>
</details>

在许多不同的个股中，市场已经出现了一定程度的回调。所以，如果这些公司能够执行，并且你能够获得第四季度的动量，也就是很多人谈论的“圣诞老人行情”，那么它们正在为一次良好的盈利反弹做准备。我的意思是，在获得这些收益之前，你确实需要经历一点痛苦。我的意思是，随着这些回购的开始，我们可能会在今年年底迎来一个非常好的第四季度。所以，这就是我们在股市中得到的一切。感谢大家的收听和观看。我非常感谢大家。这将是本周的最后一次每日回顾。已经是星期四了。这是一个很快的星期。我将在周日回来。所以，明天是周一或周五的市场开盘和收盘，然后，是的，我将在周一满28岁。所以，在市场收盘时，我今天说，我们将回顾我过去的一些照片，很多你们没有见过的照片。这将是我们在我生日那天可以做的一件有趣的事情，在10月27日的市场收盘时。所以，非常感谢大家。以下是Palantir的亚历克斯·卡普在今天最新采访中的一些片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you've already had a draw down in the market to an extent in a lot of different individual stocks. So, they're setting up for a good earnings rally if those companies can execute and you kind of have that Q4 momentum, which is that Santa Claus rally that a lot of people talk about. You kind of need a little bit of pain before you get those gains. I mean, we could potentially have a really good Q4 going into the end of the year as these buybacks commence. So, that's what we got in the stock market. Thank everybody for listening and watching. Deeply appreciate everyone. This is going to be the last daily recap for the week. It is already Thursday. Been a quick week. I will be back on uh Sunday for the future. So, tomorrow for the Monday or for for Friday's market open, market close, and then yeah, I'm turning 28 on Monday. So, uh on the market close, I said today uh we're going to go through a bunch of my pictures, like pictures from my past that a lot of you guys haven't seen. It'll be like a fun thing we can do on my birthday uh for that market close on October 27th. So, deeply appreciate everybody. Here are some clips of pounders Alex Karp in the latest interview that he did today.</p>

### Alex Karp谈AI军备竞赛与Palantir的价值

**Alex Karp:** 基本上，他们看待它的方式和我看待它的方式，这是我的观点，而不是其他任何人的观点，那就是我们正处于一场军备竞赛中。这都是学术性的，非常学术性。就像我们要么拥有人工智能并决定规则，要么我们的对手拥有它并决定规则。所以这就是为什么这些基础设施非常重要，因为为了让它发挥作用，你需要什么？你需要能够实际运行模型的基础设施，以安全且足够便宜的方式获取数据。你需要让模型真正有用。你需要**本体论**（Ontology: 在信息科学中指对特定领域概念及它们之间关系的正式表示和规范）来做到这一点。这意味着你必须在它们有用和无用的地方部署它们并进行编排。如果你开始对这种事实上的情况设置障碍，那么将会发生的是我们的对手会建立它，我们将从他们那里购买一切，包括我们如何管理国家的想法。所以，就像我的个人版本，Palantir，我们在Palantir代表什么，我们不强加给任何人的是，我们正在奔跑。我们正在拼命奔跑，我们将支持任何人，特别是那些能够激发这种基础设施的前线人员，以及我们在**美国国防部**（DoD: Department of Defense，美国政府管理军事事务的行政部门）的客户，并帮助使美国战士成为世界上最具杀伤力的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">that there's basically the way they look at it and the way I look at it, which is my view, than not uh not not anyone else's, which is we're in a we're in a we're in an arms race here. This is that's all academic, super academic. It's like we're going to either have AI and and determining the rules or our adversaries will have it and they'll determine the rules. And it and so this is why these infrastructure things are crazy important because in order to make it work, what do you need? You need infrastructure that can actually run the models, get the data there in a secure and cheap enough way. You need to make the models actually useful. You need ontology to do that. Meaning, you have to deploy them where they're useful and where they're not and and orchestrate them. And if you start putting impediments on this de facto, what's going to happen is our adversaries will build it and we will be buying everything from them including our ideas of how to run our country. And so like my personal version, Palanteer, what we represent at Palanteer, what we do not impose on anyone else is we're running. We're running like hell and we're going to support anybody, especially people on the front line who can like galvanize this infrastructure and then our clients in the DoD especially, and help make the American war fighter the most lethal in the world.</p>

**Alex Karp:** 我们有很多合同。我们做得很好。你知道，我们与美国政府完全一致。如果有什么，你知道，我实际上不认为有。但事实是，你知道，看，我们正在做，我们已经成为一个非常大的企业，实际上令大多数美国政府之外和美国工业界的人感到惊讶，我们在这些领域表现出色，但在美国政府中也是如此，我们与我们的客户非常一致，这是Palantir的秘密之一，因为我们从美国政府开始，完全一致。当我出现时，我不会说“付钱给我，我什么都不做”。我说的是“我们会向你展示结果，然后你再付钱给我们”。我们是价值创造的下游。如果价值创造的下游意味着我们正在做一些没有价值的事情，那么我想知道，因为它对你没有价值，明天它也不会有价值。

I'm like hey we'll show you results and then pay us. We are downstream from value creation.
