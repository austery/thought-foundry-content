title: Robinhood 财报惊艳，但英伟达 CEO 警告与消费疲软信号为市场蒙上阴影
summary: 本期市场分析深入探讨了 Robinhood 发布的卓越第三季度财报，其营收和利润增长展示了惊人的运营杠杆。然而，市场情绪并未完全乐观。英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋关于中国 AI 竞争的言论以及 OpenAI 对政府资金支持的需求引发了科技板块的担忧。此外，Duolingo、DoorDash 等消费类股票的疲软表现，叠加最新的就业数据显示裁员人数创下2003年以来新高，共同指向了消费者可能正在走弱的宏观趋势，为市场前景增添了不确定性。

### 本周市场回顾与热点预告

早上好，各位。欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是11月6日，星期四，我们正在直播。在我看来，这周过得非常快。其他人有同感吗？我感觉上周像是过了一年，或许是因为发生了太多事情。我简直不敢相信已经是周四了，明天就是周五，一周又要结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Thursday, November 6th and we are live. This week has actually been a very fast week in my opinion. Does anyone else feel like that? I felt like last week was like felt like a year going through a week. Maybe because we had so many things going on. I cannot believe it's Thursday. Tomorrow it's the end of the week and it's Friday and we're done.</p>
</details>

这周一我们有 Palantir 的财报，昨天有 Hood（Robinhood）的，我们稍后会讨论。这真是疯狂的一周，但感觉过得飞快。我们有很多头条新闻要谈，宏观层面也发生了很多事。AI 领域也出现了各种各样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we had Palantir earnings on Monday. You have Hood yesterday which we'll talk about. I mean it's just been a wild week and it feels like it's gone by very quick. We got a bunch of different headlines to talk about. A lot of different macro stuff is happening. You have a variety of different things happening in the AI sector.</p>
</details>

昨天，英伟达的 CEO 黄仁勋去了伦敦并发表了一些评论，他说的一些话确实让很多分析师感到恐慌，之后他又不得不澄清自己的言论。所以我们会谈谈黄仁勋到底说了什么。OpenAI 也在某个会议上发表了一些言论，同样惊吓到了市场，他们也必须澄清自己的说法。所以，我们将讨论 AI 世界里关于英伟达、黄仁勋等发生的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen went to London yesterday and made some comments and he said some stuff that really got a lot of the analysts freaked out and then he had to clarify his stuff and so we'll talk about what Jensen said. OpenAI also was at some conference. They said some stuff that really freaked out the market. They had to clarify what they had to say. So we're going to discuss everything going on in the world of AI with Nvidia, Jensen, etc.</p>
</details>

昨天有很多公司发布了财报，有好有坏。Robinhood 的财报是我在第三季度见过的最好的之一，甚至可能是过去几年里最好的。我们会详细讨论 Robinhood 的季度表现。同时，也有一些表现不佳的财报，比如 Duolingo，虽然季度本身还算可以，但有些地方不尽如人意，导致股价下跌了20%。DoorDash 下跌了15%，ELF 下跌了近25%。很多这样的消费类公司，要么交出了亮眼的数字，要么就是业绩不达标，并且在指引中说了些不太好的话，市场今天显然不会给它们溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had a lot of earnings yesterday. Some of them were good, some of them were bad. Robin Hood, it's up there as one of the best quarters I've seen in Q3. And likely over the past couple years, we'll talk about Robin Hood's quarter. We also had some quarters that weren't the best, like a Duolingo, which look, the quarter was decent, but there were some things that weren't that good. That stock's down 20%. Door Dash down 15%. ELF down almost 25%. I mean, you got a lot of these consumer names that really either put up the numbers or they didn't put up the numbers and they said something their guidance that wasn't really the best and the market is obviously not giving them the premium today.</p>
</details>

所以，我们会讨论这些。今天早上也有一批公司公布了财报，比如 D-Wave、Oscar。我们会逐一分析这些财报。今天盘后，我们也会直播，同样有很多财报要发布，包括 Soundtown、Airbnb、Trade Desk、Iren——我知道大家都很关心 Iren，我会听它的电话会议——还有 Archer、SMR、DraftKings、OpenDoor。天啊，今天会很疯狂。还有 Affirm、Square、MP Materials、Monster Energy Drink、Peloton、AbCellera——很多人喜欢这家公司——Sweet Green、Wynn Hotels、Dropbox、Texas Roadhouse、US AR 等等。今天内容非常多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're going to talk about that. We got a bunch of different names that reported this morning. D-Wave, Oscar. So, we're going to get through all that and go through all those earnings, but we have a lot of earnings to cover. Today after the bell, we are going to be live and we also have a lot of earnings. We are gonna have Soundtown, Airbnb, Trade Desk, Iren. I know everyone cares about Iren. I'll be listening to the call for Iren, Archer, SMR, DraftKings, OpenDoor is today. Oh man. Okay, today's going to be wild. Affirm Square, MP Materials, Monster Energy Drink, Pelaton, AbCellera, and a lot of people like that one. Sweet Green, Wynn Hotels, Dropbox, Texas Roadhouse, US AR, another rare earth company. We got a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff today.</p>
</details>

除此之外，我最近投资了一家初创公司，就是我之前跟大家提过的那个基于加密货币的金融科技公司。我会在上午11点左右，也就是节目快结束时，邀请这家公司的创始人来上节目。他们今天刚刚宣布由硅谷一家顶尖风投公司领投的股权融资。我很荣幸能参与其中。我能投资的唯一原因，是我在2016年和其中一位创始人辩论过。我们有10年没联系了，但他几周前在 LinkedIn 上联系我，向我介绍了这个项目，于是我做了这笔投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, I recently invested in a startup. I was telling you guys about this crypto-based finance startup. I'm going to have the founders of that startup come on at around 11 a.m., so towards the end of the market open. They just announced their equity race today by one of the leading VC firms in Silicon Valley. So, very grateful to be part of that. Again, the only reason I got to invest is because I debated one of the founders back in 2016. Have not talked to him in 10 years. But he hit me up on LinkedIn a couple weeks ago and pitched it to me and that's why I made the investment.</p>
</details>

我们会向大家介绍这家初创公司，他们的增长在过去三周达到了20倍，这有点疯狂。考虑到我们都处在金融生态系统中，我认为关注一些这样的新兴公司很重要，它们可能会在加密货币领域挑战像 Coinbase 这样的巨头。所以，在节目快结束时，我们会进行那场访谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll introduce that startup to people and their growth is like 20x in the past three weeks. It's kind of crazy and so given we're all in the financial ecosystem I think it is important to kind of look at some of these up and-coming names and potentially they're going up against the big dogs like the Coinbases of the world when it comes to crypto. So we'll do that interview as we get towards the end of the market open as well and we will keep going from there.</p>
</details>

### Robinhood 财报深度解析：运营杠杆的胜利

好了，我们开始吧。Robinhood，Robinhood，Robinhood。关于这份财报我能说什么呢？这是我见过的最惊人的财报之一。坦白说，我可能有些偏见，因为 Robinhood 和 Palantir 是我最大的两个持仓，但我认为它们交出了我所见过的股市历史上最好的两份季度报告之一。我不是在夸大其词，真的不是。我认为我通常对这些公司都相当客观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood earnings. What can I say about these earnings? These were some of the most phenomenal earnings I've seen. Honestly, and obviously I'm biased here because these are two of my biggest holdings, but Robin Hood and Palantir put up, I think, two of the best quarters I've ever seen in stock market history. And I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, like I'm really not. I think I tend to be pretty objective on these names.</p>
</details>

但如果你仔细研究这份财报，深入了解他们所做的一切，那简直是不可思议。他们的收入同比增长了100%，达到12.7亿美元。净利润为2.71亿美元，净利润率高达50%，意味着每1美元收入中就有50美分是利润。每股收益（EPS）为61美分，同比增长近300%。调整后EBITDA增长了177%。黄金会员数接近400万。平台资产增长了119%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you look at these earnings, if you actually go under the hood and see what they've done, it is just incredible. They're growing revenues at a 100% year-over-year, 1.27 billion. Net income is 271 million. There's a 50% net income margin, 50 cents on every dollar becomes profit. 61 cents of EPS up almost 300% year-over-year. Adjusted EBA is up 177%. Gold subscribers almost 4 million. And then platform assets 119%.</p>
</details>

然而，股价却持平。我昨天就说过，股价可能会持平，因为很多利好已经被消化了。今年以来，它已经上涨了240%。我能想象今天开盘后，随着大量交易涌入，股价会上涨吗？是的，因为那个季度的表现实在太好了。但即使不涨，也完全可以理解。实际上，财报发布后，股价一度跌至137美元左右，因为财报出来时，算法交易通常会占据主导。但如果你真的仔细看这份财报，我的天，这是一个好到无法估量的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The stock is flat. And this is something that I said yesterday that the stock would probably be flat because a lot is baked into it. It's up 240% year to date. Could I imagine it pops today when the market opens and we get a ton of volume? Yes, because that quarter was just really good. But even if it doesn't, again, it's understandable. And the stock actually dumped it. We got to like 137 as soon as the earnings came out because, you know, the algos kind of take control when these earnings come through. But if you really look at the earnings, my goodness, this was just an unfathomably good quarter.</p>
</details>

这个季度之所以如此出色，是因为 Robinhood 正在创造的**运营杠杆**（Operating Leverage: 指公司利用固定成本来放大收入变化对利润影响的能力）是我认为我们前所未见的。说实话，只有两家公司能做到这种程度，那就是 Hood 和 Palantir。它们能够在以令人难以置信的加速速度增长营收（top line）的同时，管理好利润（bottom line）以提高效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason why the quarter was so good is because the operating leverage that Robin Hood is creating is something that I don't think we've ever seen before. Honestly, the only two companies that are doing it like this are Hood and Palantir. They are able to grow the top line at an unbelievably accelerated rate while also managing the bottom line to become more efficient.</p>
</details>

任何投资的圣杯就在于：你能在以同样方式增长营收和利润的同时，确保业务的整体运营杠杆具有增长轨迹吗？与此同时，他们回购了100万股股票，提高了调整后EBITDA，运营支出（OPEX）保持相对平稳，净利润也在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the holy grail of any investment is like can you grow the top line and the bottom line in the same way while being able to make sure that the operating leverage of of of the business overall has a trajectory for growth. At the same time they bought back a million shares. They increased adjusted IBIDA. They kept OPEX relatively flat. Net income is up.</p>
</details>

我认为一些人忽略了最重要的数据，也是我进入年底对 Robinhood 最大的担忧，那就是他们长期以来都有很低的**比较基数**（Comps: 即去年同期的业绩数据，用于衡量同比增长）。也就是说，他们只需要超过第三季度的6.37亿美元，这相对容易做到。他们做到了12.7亿美元，所以超出了100%以上。下一个季度，也就是第四季度，他们需要超过10亿美元的收入。要实现100%的增长非常困难，因为那意味着他们需要达到20亿美元的收入，这在第四季度可能不是最容易做到的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the biggest stat that I think some people are overlooking and my biggest concern actually for Robin Hood going into the end of the year was that they've had easy comps for a long time. aka they had to beat 637 million from Q3, which is relatively easy to do. They did 1.27 billion, so they beat by over 100%. Next quarter for Q4, they've got to beat a billion dollars of revenue. It's really hard to grow a 100% because then they would have to put up like $2 billion of revenue, which might not be the easiest thing to do in Q4.</p>
</details>

但他们披露，10月份在股票、期权、预测市场、加密货币等方面的数字，比整个第三季度还要好。我再说一遍，他们10月份的数字比整个第三季度都好。这意味着即使11月和12月表现平平——鉴于我们在这两个月看到的势头，这不大可能——我们很可能会在第四季度看到一个巨大的业绩超越。即使不是巨大的超越，也肯定会超过10亿美元。他们在展示增长方面不会有任何问题，而这正是我之前担心的：他们真的能展示出增长吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They disclosed that their October numbers on equities, options, prediction markets, crypto, etc. was better than the entirety of Q3. I'll say that again. their October numbers were better than the entirety of Q3, which means even if November and December are a dud, which they're not going to be given we're seeing momentum in these two months, we are likely going to see a massive beat going into Q4 or even if it's not a massive beat, it's definitely going to beat a billion dollars. They're not going to have any problem being able to show growth, which I was actually concerned about is like could they actually show the growth?</p>
</details>

但他们以一种加速的方式发展业务，吸引了如此多的新账户、新订阅者、新高净值账户。你可以从他们的净存款中看出来，三个月内有200亿美元流入平台。看看世界上其他的金融科技公司，他们连30亿美元都很难吸引到，因为要把钱从摩根大通和美国银行转到一个像 Robinhood 这样的小众公司真的很难。但他们做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they've accelerated the business in such a way that they brought in so many new accounts, so many new subscribers, so many new higher level accounts, and you can tell their net deposits. Take a look at that. $20 billion in three months came to the platform. I mean, you look at a lot of the other fintexs of the world, they're not bringing in 20 billion. They're barely bringing in $3 billion because it's really hard to bring over money from JP Morgan and Bank of America into a small niche company like a Robin Hood. But they've figured it out.</p>
</details>

这200亿美元中包括了许多大额账户。他们的保证金利息，也就是人们向 Robinhood 借钱支付的利息，达到了1.53亿美元，高于之前的1.14亿。现在他们的保证金账簿上有160亿美元，创下历史新高。这一点之所以非常重要，原因有二：第一，它显示市场存在风险偏好，因为人们愿意借钱并支付利息；第二，许多更富有的高净值人士会使用保证金。因此，如果你能将这些账户吸引到你的平台上，他们借贷数百万美元并支付利息，这对 Robinhood 来说是一笔非常好的生意。随着利率下降，这种情况很可能只会加速，因为资本成本将继续降低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that 20 billion includes a lot of large accounts. Their margin interest, aka the amount of people that are paying interest to borrow money from Robin Hood, went to $153 million, up from 114, 16 billion on their margin book now, which is an all-time high. And the reason that's also really important, number one, it shows that there's a risk on appetite in the market because people are willing to borrow money and pay interest on it. But number two, a lot of wealthier, high net worth individuals utilize margin. And as a result, if you're bringing those accounts onto your platform and they're borrowing millions and millions of dollars and they're paying interest on that, you know, for Robin Hood, that's a very, very good deal. And as rates come down, that likely is only going to accelerate because the cost of capital will continue to get cheaper.</p>
</details>

### 万亿市值之路：Robinhood 的宏大叙事与代币化未来

这次财报电话会议有很多值得关注的地方。从保证金利息到预测市场，再到10月份的指引预示着比整个第三季度更好，以及创纪录的交易量和净利息收入（达到4.56亿美元）。然后是这张我认为非常重要的幻灯片：他们正在大规模地抢占市场份额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, there's a variety of different things to look at in this earnings call. I'll probably do a separate video on it to go deeper on it, but from margin interest to prediction markets to the October guidance signaling that it's better than the entirety of Q3 to record transaction volumes, record net interest revenues at 456 million. And then this slide right here that I thought was really important. They are taking market share at scale.</p>
</details>

看看这里，他们现在拥有1%的股票市场份额，7.4%的期权市场份额，1%的加密货币市场份额，以及1%的保证金市场份额，这几乎还没怎么渗透。在我看来，未来10年，当我们在讨论所有这些不同产品的全球市场份额时，这个数字将远远超过10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look at this right here, they now have 1% of the equity markets, 7.4% of options, 1% of crypto, and 1% of margin that it's barely penetrated. I mean, over the next 10 years, this is going to get well above 10% in my opinion when we're talking about a global market share of all these different products.</p>
</details>

在我看来，而且我昨晚也发了推文，我认为他们正在为万亿美元市值奠定基础。我真的这么认为，而且我说这话并没有太多犹豫。我知道有人会说：“等等，摩根大通的市值也才8000亿美元，你怎么能说 Robinhood 会成为一家万亿美元的公司？”这是一个合理的观点。我不是说这会一夜之间发生，甚至不是说未来10年就会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in my opinion, and I tweeted this last night, I think they're setting up the foundation for a trillion dollar market cap. I really do. And I say that not with a lot of hesitancy. And I know people are like, "Wait a second, JP Morgan's only at $800 billion. How are you saying, Robin, it's gonna be a trillion dollar business?" That's a fair point. I'm not saying it's happening overnight. I'm not even saying it's going to happen over the next 10 years.</p>
</details>

我想说的是，我们从这家公司看到的创新水平，以及我对管理层不断推出更多产品、拓展新垂直领域的信任程度，都指向了这一点。举个例子，预测市场在整个第三季度完成了23亿份合约。而在10月份，它完成了25亿份合约，一个月内就为公司带来了2500万美元的净利润。Robinhood 进入这个市场还不到一年，而且他们甚至不是第一个进入者，PolyMarket 和 Kalshi 已经占据了领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I am saying is the level of innovation that we are seeing from this company, the level of trust I have in management to just ship more and more products, expand into new verticals. Case in point, prediction markets did 2.3 billion contracts in all of Q3. In October, it did 2.5 billion contracts, 25 million, boom, right to the bottom line in one month. Robin had entered this market less than a year ago. And they weren't even the first entrant. Poly market and Kalshi already had the lead.</p>
</details>

银行业务明年即将推出，还有各种AI服务也接踵而至。我认为他们将要拓展的垂直领域如此之多，以至于在我关注这家公司的整个生命周期里，他们将超过万亿美元。他们将成为我们所见过的从婴儿潮一代到千禧一代最大规模财富转移的受益者。我认为宏观顺风加上公司自身的执行力，让这一切变得显而易见，他们会达到万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like I just and banking's coming next year. You got all these AI services coming next. I think there's so many verticals that they are going to expand into that I think over the lifetime of covering this company, they will be over a trillion dollars. they will be the beneficiaries of the largest wealth transfer we've seen from boomers to millennials. And I think the macro tailwinds along with the company specific execution is kind of making this blatantly obvious that it's going to get to a trillion.</p>
</details>

当然，这并不意味着在143美元买入在短期内是个好主意，因为特朗普可能发条推文，2026年可能出现熊市，然后 Hood 股价下跌50%，任何事情都可能发生。但关键是，如果你真的对它有长远的眼光，我认为这是一家有朝一日将达到万亿美元的优质的、代际性的公司。基于他们公布的财报，我对此非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that doesn't mean buying it at $143 is going to be good in the short term because Trump could tweet something and then 2026 could be a bare market and then hood falls 50%. like anything could happen. But the point is if you really do have a long-term trajectory on this, I think it's a quality generational company that is going to a trillion dollars one day and very very excited based on the earnings that they put up.</p>
</details>

我问了他们一个关于**代币化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的权利转换为区块链上的数字代币的过程）的问题。这是我没怎么谈到的另一件事。我认为我们都还没有真正理解代币化这件事。我问 Vlad（Robinhood CEO）能否谈谈这个机会有多大，对于所有 OpenDoor 的多头来说，他提到了房地产。他还提到了私人信贷，以及除了股票之外可以在区块链上扩展的各种不同资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I essentially asked him about tokenization. That's the other thing I didn't talk about too much. I think this tokenization thing we all are really not understanding. I asked Vlad to say hey can you speak on how big the opportunity is and for all my open door bulls he mentioned real estate. He mentioned private credit he mentioned a variety of different assets outside of just equities that can scale on the blockchain.</p>
</details>

当你想到资产上链时，这就是我超级看好以太坊的原因，但我也超级看好能够成为收取这些资产所有交易量“过路费”的公司。当我们思考传统金融市场的交易量时，正如 Larry Fink 所说，将有近4.5万亿美元的资产上链，为每个人增加更多的流动性，因为你不再需要银行账户或在某个经纪商注册才能交易这些资产。你只需要一个钱包地址就可以进行买卖。这是一个非常大的市场，我们谈论的是数以万亿计美元的市场。Robinhood 不会得到整个市场，但即使他们只得到4%到5%，对他们来说也将是一项巨大的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you think of assets coming on chain, that's why I'm super bullish Ethereum, but I'm also super bullish on the company that can become the toll booth to collect all the trading volumes on those assets. And when we think about trading volumes in the traditional financial market, it's as Larry Fink said, almost $4 half trillion dollars that coming on chain and increasing more liquidity to everyone because you don't need to have a bank account to now trade these assets or be registered with some broker. You can just have a wallet address to be able to trade them up and down. That's a really big market. like we're talking about many many tens of trillions of dollars that market is. Robin Hood is not going to get the entire market, but if they even get four to 5% of it, that's going to be a massive business for them.</p>
</details>

### 盘前财报速览：分化的市场表现

好了，我们来快速看一下一些财报结果，然后再谈谈关于AI的头条新闻。今天早上有很多公司发布了财报。我不会深入探讨，只会给大家一个顶线结果，看看它们的股价表现如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so that's what we got on Robin Hood and that's what we had yesterday. Let's get into some of the other headlines. So, a couple of different things that we got going on. First of all, OpenAI, actually, let's do earnings. Let's do earnings real quick. Let's just look at some earnings results and then we'll get into some of the headlines around AI. So, we have a bunch of earnings this morning. I'm not going to go super deep into them. I'm just going to give you guys their topline results and we'll see how their stocks are doing and then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

首先是 D-Wave Quantum，股票代码 QBTS，今天发布了财报。我相信他们在营收和利润上都超出了预期。是的，他们的每股收益超预期29%，营收超预期23%，达到373万美元，预期为303万美元。他们每股亏损5美分，而预期是7美分。营收同比增长约100%，每股收益同比增长58%。该股股价持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, let's get into D-Wave Quantum stock that had earnings today. I believe they beat on the top and the bottom. Let me pull this up. D-Wave, yes, they beat by 29% on revenues. or sorry, EPS beat by 23% in revenue, 3.73 million versus 3.03 million expected. They lost 5 cents versus 7 cents. Revenue is up about 100% year-over-year and EPS is up 58% year-over-year. That's what you have on D-Wave, ticker symbol QBTS, that stock is flat.</p>
</details>

华纳兄弟（Warner Brothers）可能会被收购。他们的每股收益未达预期50%，营收未达预期1%。显然，作为一家企业，他们的运营状况并不理想。有传言称 Netflix 或 Comcast 将会收购他们。他们的股价也持平，而且他们公布的财报数据并不像一个能够长期生存的上市公司应有的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Warner Brothers, these guys are potentially going to be bought out. Missed by 50% on EPS, missed by 1% on revenue. Obviously, not in the best operating shape as a business. There are very large rumors that Netflix or Comcast is going to buy them out. These guys are also flat and you know, they're not really putting up earnings that you would think that a public company that is going to survive long term is putting up.</p>
</details>

Moderna 制药公司，每股收益超预期76%，营收超预期17%。MRNA 股价上涨了7%。顺便说一下，上午11点，特朗普将发表一项声明，与药品有关。我们不会观看，因为它与经济无关，而是关于 Trump RX 和 Ozempic 之类的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Moderna pharmaceutical, they beat by 76% on EPS, beat by 17% on revenue. MRNA, that stock is up 7%. By the way, at 11:00 a.m., Trump is going to be making an announcement. That announcement has to do with drugs. We're not going to be watching it because it's not about the economy or anything like that. It's about Trump RX and Ozempic and stuff like that.</p>

DataDog 表现出色。每股收益超预期20%，达到55美分，预期为46美分。营收为8.85亿美元，预期为8.52亿美元。又一家软件公司持续实现营收增长，这非常好，因为你希望看到AI成为许多这类业务的顺风。每股收益同比增长20%，营收同比增长28%。他们实际上在盘前市场表现最好，上涨了19%。

<p class="english-text">Data Dog, they crushed it. They beat by 20% on EPS. 55 cents versus 46 cents expected. 885 versus 852. Again, more software companies continuing to put up revenue, which is really good because you want to see that AI is a tailwind for a lot of these businesses. EPS up 20% year-over-year. revenue is up 28% year-over-year. They're actually having the best performance in the pre-markets. Look at that. Up 19% right here, which is not too bad for Data Dog as that one goes green.</p>

Celsius，我很困惑。他们的股价下跌了，但每股收益超预期50%，达到42美分，预期为28美分。营收7.25亿美元，预期为7.15亿美元。该股下跌了15%。我不明白为什么会下跌15%。我的意思是，当你每股收益超预期50%时，肯定是管理层在指引中说了些让人们非常不安的话。

<p class="english-text">Now, Celsius, I was confused. Their stocks down, but they beat by 50% on EPS. 42 cents versus 28 cents expected. 725 versus 715. That stock down 15%. I don't know why it's down 15%. It's kind of confusing. I mean, when you beat EPS by 50%, there's got to be something management is guiding for saying that's really troubling people.</p>

Oscar 每股收益超预期9%，每股亏损53美分，预期亏损58美分。营收为29.8亿美元，预期为30.8亿美元，营收略有未达。Oscar 股价先涨后跌，现在当天上涨了10%。

### 昨日盘后回顾：消费股集体承压

昨天我们有很多不同的财报。正如你在这里左手边看到的，Duolingo，天哪，189美元。我只想对这只绿色的猫头鹰说声非常非常感谢。我的感谢不是代表我自己，而是代表 Matt Money。因为在我的选股比赛中，我想让这只绿色的猫头鹰知道，Matt Money 非常感激我，因为即使我拥有 Palantir、Hood、特斯拉、AMD 和 Nebius，我也永远无法恢复并赢得这场该死的比赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yesterday we had a lot of different earnings. As you can see on the left hand side right here, Duolingo, my goodness, 189. I just want to give a big thank you, a very big thank you to the Green Owl. And my thank you is not on behalf of myself. It's on behalf of Matt Money because in my stock draft, you know, I just want to let the Green Owl know that Matt Money is very grateful for the fact that I am never going to recover and even have a chance even after having Palantir, Hood, Tesla, AMD, and Nebius to be able to win this damn draft.</p>

我不知道这只股票怎么了。我个人并不持有它。当我做深度研究时，对于那些真正读到最后的人来说，结论是我不能买这只股票。原因是我无法购买这只股票，是因为AI威胁的叙事。我在那篇深度研究的结尾花了很多时间解释，我认为从指标上看，它有护城河。看看这些指标，很难说它没有护城河：日活跃用户（DAU）历史新高，月活跃用户（MAU）历史新高，订阅收入历史新高，付费订阅用户历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know what's going on with this stock and I don't personally own it. When I did the deep dive on it, for those that actually read towards the end of the deep dive, the conclusion was I can't buy the stock. And the reason is I can't buy the stock is because of the narrative of the AI overhang. I spent a lot of time in that deep dive towards the end of it actually explaining, look, I think there's a moat in regards to the metrics. And look, it's hard to say there's not a moat when you look at these metrics. DAU's all-time highs, MAU's all-time high, subrevenue all-time high, paid subscribers all-time high.</p>
</details>

但是存在一种叙事，这种叙事实际上渗透到了 Duolingo 昨天的一些数据中，他们没有给出第四季度的预订量指引，而且付费订阅用户占总收入的百分比连续第五个季度下降。我不知道这是否表明没有护城河？也许吧。我认为长期来看，你必须观察它到底有没有护城河。但我所理解的是，当一个企业在所有方面都表现出色，每个指标都创下历史新高，也许只有一两个指标不是最好的，或者没有市场期望的准确指引，但其他一切都很好，而股价却下跌了30%。对我来说，这更多的是一个叙事问题，而不是基本面问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there is a narrative and that narrative actually infiltrated itself in terms of some of the numbers on Duolingo yesterday when they didn't give I believe bookings a guide for Q4 and their percentage of paid subscribers as a percentage of overall revenue went down for like the fifth quarter in a row. So I don't know is that indicative of not having a moat? Maybe. I think the long term you're going to have to see like is there a mode or is there not a moat but what I what I do understand is that when a business is firing on all cylinders and every single metric is at an all-time high and maybe one or two metrics are not the best or there's not like an accurate guide on them that the street is looking for but everything else is good and the stock gets hit by 30%. That to me is a narrative issue more than anything. I don't know if that's a fundamental issue.</p>
</details>

以下是 Duolingo 的 CEO 谈论一些关于 Duolingo 的看空担忧：

> “关于竞争格局，人们常说的两件事是：第一，当你可以用 ChatGPT 学习语言时，为什么还要用 Duolingo？我们对此并不特别担心。我们做得非常好的一点不仅是教得好，更主要的是我们能让人们保持参与。要学习一门语言，你需要持续参与数年。第二，人们担心的另一件事是，因为我们会有同声传译，所以没人想学语言了。好吧，我们也不担心这个。在过去10年的谷歌I/O大会上，他们每年都在展示同声传译，而且效果很好。但这已经发生了10年了，我们并没有看到学习语言的愿望有任何下降。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is the CEO of Duolingo real quick just talking about some of these bare market or bearish concerns about Duolingo: "of the competitive landscape. The two things that people say about the competitive landscape with AI are number one why would anybody want to learn a language with Duolingo when you can just learn it with ChatGPT. We're not particularly worried about that. The main thing that we do really well is keep people engaged. And in order to learn a language, you need to be engaged for years. And then the other thing that people have said that they're worried about is oh well nobody's going to want to learn a language because we're going to have simultaneous language translation and okay also not worried about that. In 100% of the Google IO conferences over the last 10 years, they have showcased simultaneous language translation. They do it every single year and it's good. It works. But this has been happening for the last 10 years and we have not seen the desire to learn a language go down at all."</p>
</details>

DoorDash 的财报也很奇怪。他们在财报中基本上说，他们更关心用户增长而不是盈利。他们用一种奇怪的方式说：“我们希望能有一种方法让婴儿一夜之间长大成人而无需投资，但我们不相信生活或商业是这样运作的。” 我认为他们是在为财报不及预期以及一个理论上自己开车两英里去取只要8美元的汉堡，现在要卖27美元的需求可能没那么高找借口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Door Dash, this was just really weird. Door Dash on their earnings basically said they're more concerned about user growth than monetization. And they said it in a weird way. They said, "We wish there was a way to grow a baby into an adult without investment or to see the baby grow into an adult overnight, but we do not believe this is how life or business works." I think they were trying to cope with the fact that they missed on earnings and that demand for a $27 burger that theoretically would cost like $8 if you just drove two miles and got it yourself might not be as high.</p>
</details>

我们从 Chipotle、麦当劳和 Cava 的评论中都看到了这一点。你可能正面临低端消费者的压力，他们无法负担得起这样的价格。DoorDash 的每股收益确实未达预期，虽然营收超预期，但每股收益未达预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're seeing this with Chipotle. We had some commentary from McDonald's the other day. Cava said the same thing. I mean, you just might have some stress on the lower-end consumer that's not able to afford paying these types of prices. Door Dash did miss on EPS. They beat on revenue, but they did miss on EPS.</p>

### AI 领域的震动：英伟达与 OpenAI 引发市场担忧

昨天发生的事情很奇怪，因为黄仁勋和 Sam Altman 说了一些市场不太喜欢的话。黄仁勋在伦敦的一个会议上基本上说，中国将赢得AI竞赛。简而言之，他就是这么说的。市场开始恐慌，并开始抛售股票。四个小时后，黄仁勋不得不发表评论说：“正如我一直以来所说，中国在AI领域仅落后美国纳秒之差。美国通过领先并赢得全球开发者来获胜至关重要。” 换句话说，黄仁勋加倍强调了他的论点，他不会因为股价下跌5美元、市值蒸发1200亿美元就收回自己的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yesterday was really weird because Jensen and Sam Altman said some things that the street just didn't really like. Jensen at a conference in London basically said China's going to win the AI race. That that's in a nutshell that's what he said. And the streets started freaking out and they started selling off the stock and then Jensen four hours later had to comment and say, "As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide." Aka, Jensen double down on the thesis that wait a second, I'm not going to take back what I said just because my stock is down five bucks and it just lost 120 billion in market cap.</p>
</details>

黄仁勋为什么要这么说？我想我们都能读懂言外之意，他希望能向中国销售产品。而现在，他没有能力向中国销售。他显然是在努力挽救公司，表示不让我们向中国销售是不公平的，如果我们不这样做，中国最终会击败我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why is Jensen saying that? I think we all, you know, can read between the lines, he wants to be able to sell into China. And right now, he doesn't have the ability to sell into China. He's obviously trying to save the company a little bit and say it's not fair for us to not be able to sell into China and if we don't then China's eventually going to beat us.</p>
</details>

然后，OpenAI 在某个会议上表示，他们正在寻求政府支持以增加AI投资。他们的首席财务官说：“我们正在寻找一个由银行、私募股权，甚至可能是政府组成的生态系统。联邦贷款担保将真正降低融资成本。” 这显然让很多人担心，因为他们要花费1.4万亿美元，有所有这些支出承诺，却没有相应的现金流来支持。现在你又说希望政府参与进来为这些贷款提供担保。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then OpenAI came out at some conference and they basically said, "We are seeking government backing to boost AI investments." The quote was from the CFO. "This is where we're looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, and maybe even governmental. federal loans guarantees would really drop the cost of the financing." Obviously, this got a lot of people worried because they're going to spend 1.4 trillion dollars, have all these spending commitments, and not really have the cash flows to be able to put up for it. And now you're saying you want the government to be involved in backstopping these loans.</p>
</details>

首席财务官在 LinkedIn 上澄清说：“我想澄清我今天早些时候的评论。OpenAI 并没有为我们的基础设施承诺寻求政府的支持。我用了‘支持’这个词，它模糊了重点。我的观点是，美国在技术上的实力将来自于建设真正的工业能力，这需要私营部门和政府发挥各自的作用。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The CFO clarified on LinkedIn, "I want to clarify my comments earlier today. OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word backstop and it muddied the point. I was making the point that American strength and technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part."</p>

### 宏观经济观察：关税裁决、就业数据与市场情绪

最高法院昨天开始听取关于关税的意见。特朗普在福克斯新闻上表示，这个决定对美国来说是生死攸关的。我的理解是，决定要到一月份才会出来。有报道称，最高法院的法官们更倾向于认为这是违宪的。另一些人则说，他们正在研究特朗普政府用来通过行政命令推行这一政策的不同规则和条例，并站在他这边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Supreme Court started hearing comments of tariffs yesterday. Here is what Trump had to say on Fox around what's going on with the Supreme Court and these tariffs. Trump has said this decision is going to be life or death for the United States. Now, my understanding of the decision is that it's not coming out till January. There are mixed reports. Some reports are saying that the Supreme Court justices are more on the side that it's unconstitutional. Other are saying that they're looking at the different rules and regulations that the Trump administration used to pass this through executive order and they're on his side.</p>
</details>

如果最高法院裁定这些关税违宪，根据我昨天读的几篇文章，特朗普将不得不偿还大约一万亿美元的资金，因为过去几个月通过这些关税征收了大量资金。而且很多依赖于关税的交易，比如欧洲在美国投资7500亿美元用于天然气，因为特朗普威胁说如果他们不这样做就会对他们征收高额关税，这些交易都将化为泡影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if the Supreme Court says these tariffs are unconstitutional, from a couple of different articles I was reading yesterday, Trump would have to pay back about a trillion dollars of money because a lot of money has been collected over the past couple months via these duties and a lot of those deals that were hinging on the tariffs, aka Europe's investing 750 billion into natural gas in the United States because Trump was going to tariff the crap out of them if they don't. Like, well, that goes away because now there's no more tariffs.</p>
</details>

关于就业数据，我们今天早上得到了一些第三方就业报告。根据 Challenger 的数据，美国企业10月份宣布裁员15.3万人，同比增长175%，是自2003年10月以来的最高水平。雇主将削减成本和采用AI作为这些裁员的主要驱动因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jobs data, we got some third party jobs reporting this morning. The exact quote right here from Challenger is that US employers announced 153,000 job cuts in October, 175% year-over-year, the highest since October 2003. Employers are setting cost cutting and AI as the primary drivers of these cuts.</p>
</details>

摩根大通今天早上表示，市场因裁员因AI而激增的头条新闻而动摇。市场正在权衡劳动力市场疲软和潜在支出，与AI的效力和投资回报率以及生产力提升的证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">JP Morgan this morning said that the market is rocked by headlines that layoffs are spiking due to AI. The market is weighing a weaker labor market and potential spending versus evidence on the efficacy and ROI of AI plus productivity gains.</p>
</details>

所以，当你看看 Chipotle、DoorDash 以及其他一些消费品牌所说的话，关于消费者存在一些问题，他们并没有明确说消费者处于可怕的境地，你需要为最坏的情况做准备，但他们确实在说我们看到了疲软的迹象。我认为进入2026年，我们必须权衡正在投入的大量资本支出、消费者支出的水平或缺乏，以及盈利增长。然后你再把通货膨胀和利率的图景放进去，那会让我们对2026年的预期有一个更好的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you look at what Chipotle said, when you look at what Door Dash said, when you look at what a bunch of these other consumer brands are talking about ELF in regards to having some issues with the consumer, they're not explicitly saying the consumer is in a horrible situation and you guys need to prepare for the worst, but they are saying we are seeing signs of weakness. And I think going into 2026, we have to weigh the massive level of capex that is being spent against the level of consumer spending or lack of consumer spending versus the earnings growth. And then you put into the picture of inflation and interest rates and that'll give us a little bit better of understanding of what to expect in 2026.</p>

### 市场开盘：普遍下跌与板块轮动

好了，标普500指数开盘下跌。我们昨天有很多财报，所以我们将看看其中一些股票价格在开盘后的反应。如你所见，标普500指数确实是红色的。Robinhood 下跌2.39%，跌幅约3%。Palantir 在186美元，也下跌了。我们看到整个市场都在下跌。

<p class="english-text">All right, S&P 500 opens up red on the day. Again, we had a lot of earnings yesterday. So, we're going to see how some of these stock prices react as we get into it.

</details>

Duolingo 当日下跌27%。Bitmine 下跌2%，Palantir 下跌1%，Rocket Lab 下跌1%，AMD 下跌2%。SMCI 略有上涨。Rivian 下跌1%。Pinterest 上涨2%。Zeta 的财报非常出色，他们理应达到20美元。几天前这只股票还在16美元。

</details>

我真的不确定为什么市场会在这里下跌，除了最高法院的案子。我看到屏幕上有一些头条新闻说，市场可能担心特朗普将不得不偿还他征收的所有关税收入，这肯定不是好事，但我不确定这是否足以让我们下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm really not sure why. I don't see the broader macro reason for why the market's taking a dip right here outside of the Supreme Court case. I mean, I'm seeing some headlines come across the screen that the market might be worried that Trump will have to pay back all the tariff revenue that he collected, which definitely wouldn't be good, but I don't know if that's enough to get us down.</p>
</details>

Palantir 有所回升，回到了187美元。Hoodie 呢？我们是不是在抛售 Hoodie？Hoodie 是138美元，确实在下跌。下跌了3%。这个季度的财报非常出色。我认为本周的主题是，嘿，公司可以公布好的财报，但这并不意味着他们的股票必须上涨。如果他们的股票在过去九个月里已经上涨了超过200%，那么有时候你必须以平常心看待，并记住，如果你是真正的投资而不是交易，那么你希望的是盈利轨迹在正确的轨道上，即使股价没有真正配合，或者没有因为好的财报而上涨更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palantir recovering a little bit back to 187. Where's Hoodie? Are we dumping on Hoodie? Hoodie is 138. It is indeed taking a bit of a dump. Down 3% again. The quarter was exceptional. I think the theme of this week has been, hey, companies can put up good earnings. that doesn't mean their stocks have to go up. If their stocks are already up more than 200% in the past nine months and so sometimes you got to just take it with a grain of salt and remember that if you really are investing and not trading it then you're hoping that the earnings trajectory is in the right space even if the stock price is not really cooperating or going up even more based on a good earnings.</p>
