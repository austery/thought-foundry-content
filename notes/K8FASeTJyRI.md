title: Robinhood财报惊艳但市场为何抛售？深入解读财报季与宏观逆风
---
### 本周市场速览与宏观动态

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月6日，星期四，我们正在直播。在我看来，这周过得非常快。其他人有同感吗？上周感觉像过了一年，可能是因为事情太多了。真不敢相信已经是周四了，明天就是周五，一周又要结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Thursday, November 6th and we are live. This week has actually been a very fast week in my opinion. Does anyone else feel like that? I felt like last week was like felt like a year going through a week. Maybe because we had so many things going on. I cannot believe it's Thursday. Tomorrow it's the end of the week and it's Friday and we're done.</p>
</details>

周一有 Palantir 的财报，昨天有 Hood（Robinhood）的，我们稍后会讨论。这周简直是疯狂的一周，但感觉一晃而过。我们有很多头条新闻要谈，宏观层面也发生了很多事情。AI 领域也出现了各种各样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we had Palantir earnings on Monday. You have Hood yesterday which we'll talk about. I mean it's just been a wild week and it feels like it's gone by very quick. We got a bunch of different headlines to talk about. A lot of different macro stuff is happening. You have a variety of different things happening in the AI sector.</p>
</details>

昨天，英伟达的CEO黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）去了伦敦，发表了一些评论，有些话确实让很多分析师感到恐慌，之后他不得不澄清。所以我们会谈谈他到底说了什么。OpenAI 也在某个会议上发表了一些让市场震惊的言论，他们也必须澄清。所以我们将讨论 AI 世界里发生的一切，包括英伟达、黄仁勋等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen went to London yesterday and made some comments and he said some stuff that really got a lot of the analysts freaked out and then he had to clarify his stuff and so we'll talk about what Jensen said. OpenAI also was at some conference. They said some stuff that really freaked out the market. They had to clarify what they had to say. So we're going to discuss everything going on in the world of AI with Nvidia, Jensen, etc.</p>
</details>

昨天我们有很多公司发布财报，有好有坏。Robinhood 的财报是我在第三季度见过的最好的之一，甚至可能是过去几年里最好的。我们会详细讨论 Robinhood 的季度表现。当然也有一些不那么理想的，比如 Duolingo，虽然季度本身还行，但有些地方不尽如人意，导致股价下跌了20%。DoorDash 下跌了15%，E.L.F. 下跌了近25%。很多消费类公司的业绩要么达标，要么未达标，并且在业绩指引中透露了一些不太好的信息，市场显然没有给它们溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had a lot of earnings yesterday. Some of them were good, some of them were bad. Robin Hood, it's up there as one of the best quarters I've seen in Q3. And likely over the past couple years, we'll talk about Robin Hood's quarter. We also had some quarters that weren't the best, like a Duolingo, which look, the quarter was decent, but there were some things that weren't that good. That stock's down 20%. Door Dash down 15%. ELF down almost 25%. I mean, you got a lot of these consumer names that really either put up the numbers or they didn't put up the numbers and they said something their guidance that wasn't really the best and the market is obviously not giving them the premium today.</p>
</details>

今天早上也有一批公司公布了财报，比如 D-Wave 和 Oscar。我们会逐一分析这些财报。今天盘后，我们也会直播，届时还会有大量财报发布，包括 SoundHound、Airbnb、The Trade Desk、Iren——我知道大家都很关心 Iren，我会听他们的电话会议——还有 Archer、SMR、DraftKings、OpenDoor。天啊，今天会很疯狂。Affirm、Square、MP Materials、Monster Energy Drink、Peloton、AbCellera，很多人喜欢这家公司。还有 Sweetgreen、Wynn Hotels、Dropbox、Texas Roadhouse、USA Rare Earth。今天内容非常多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're going to talk about that. We got a bunch of different names that reported this morning. D-Wave, Oscar. So, we're going to get through all that and go through all those earnings, but we have a lot of earnings to cover. Today after the bell, we are going to be live and we also have a lot of earnings. We are gonna have Soundtown, Airbnb, Trade Desk, Iren. I know everyone cares about Iren. I'll be listening to the call for Iren, Archer, SMR, DraftKings, OpenDoor today. Oh my god. Okay, today's going to be wild. Affirm Square, MP Materials, Monster Energy Drink, Pelaton, AbCellera, and a lot of people like that one. Sweet Green, Wind Hotels, Dropbox, Texas Roadhouse, US AR, another rare earth company. We got a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff today.</p>
</details>

### 个人投资与创业公司访谈预告

除此之外，我最近投资了一家初创公司。我之前跟大家提过，这是一家基于加密货币的金融科技初创公司。我会在上午11点左右，也就是市场开盘直播快结束时，邀请这家公司的创始人来上节目。他们今天刚刚宣布了由硅谷一家顶尖风投公司领投的股权融资。能参与其中，我感到非常荣幸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, I recently invested in a startup. I was telling you guys about this crypto-based finance startup. I'm going to have the founders of that startup come on at around 11 a.m., so towards the end of the market open. They just announced their equity race today by one of the leading VC firms in Silicon Valley. So, very grateful to be part of that.</p>
</details>

我能投资的唯一原因，是我在2016年和其中一位创始人辩论过。我们有十年没联系了，但他几周前在 LinkedIn 上联系我，向我介绍了这个项目，于是我做了这笔投资。我们会向大家介绍这家初创公司，他们在过去三周的增长达到了20倍，这有点疯狂。考虑到我们都身处金融生态系统中，我认为关注这些新兴公司很重要，它们未来可能会挑战像 Coinbase 这样的加密货币巨头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the only reason I got to invest is because I debated one of the founders back in 2016. Have not talked to him in 10 years. But he hit me up on LinkedIn a couple weeks ago and pitched it to me and that's why I made the investment. So we'll introduce that startup to people and you know their growth is like 20x in the past three weeks. It's kind of crazy and so given we're all in the financial ecosystem I think it is important to kind of look at some of these up and-coming names and potentially they're going up against the big dogs like the Coinbases of the world when it comes to crypto.</p>
</details>

### 深度解析：Robinhood 现象级的财报

好了，我们开始吧。Robinhood，Robinhood，Robinhood。我们花几分钟时间谈谈 Robinhood 的财报，然后再讨论其他的宏观事件。关于这份财报，我能说什么呢？这是我见过的最惊人的财报之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood, Robin Hood earnings. Let's do a couple minutes on Robin and then we'll get into all the different macro stuff we've got going on. What can I say about these earnings? These were some of the most phenomenal earnings I've seen.</p>
</details>

说实话，我可能存在偏见，因为 Robinhood 和 Palantir 是我最大的两个持仓，但我认为它们交出了我所见过的股市历史上最好的两份季度报告之一。我不是在夸大其词，我倾向于对这些公司保持客观。但如果你仔细研究这份财报，深入了解他们所做的一切，那简直是不可思议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, honestly, and obviously I'm biased here because these are two of my biggest holdings, but Robin Hood and Palantir put up, I think, two of the best quarters I've ever seen in stock market history. And I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, like I'm really not. I think I tend to be pretty objective on these names. But if you look at these earnings, if you actually go under the hood and see what they've done, it is just incredible.</p>
</details>

他们的收入同比增长了100%，达到12.7亿美元。净利润为2.71亿美元，净利润率高达50%，意味着每1美元收入中就有50美分成为利润。每股收益（EPS）为61美分，同比增长近300%。调整后EBITDA增长了177%。黄金会员数接近400万。平台资产增长了119%。然而，股价却持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're growing revenues at a 100% year-over-year, 1.27 billion. Net income is 271 million. There's a 50% net income margin, 50 cents on every dollar becomes profit. 61 cents of EPS up almost 300% year-over-year. Adjusted EBA is up 177%. Gold subscribers almost 4 million. And then platform assets 119%. The stock is flat.</p>
</details>

我昨天就说过，股价可能会持平，因为很多利好已经被计入了。今年以来，该股已经上涨了240%。我能想象今天开盘后，随着大量交易涌入，股价会上涨吗？是的，因为这个季度的表现实在太好了。但即使不涨，也完全可以理解。实际上，财报发布后，股价一度下跌至137美元左右，因为算法交易在财报发布时占据了主导。但如果你真正审视这份财报，天哪，这简直是一个好到难以置信的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is something that I said yesterday that the stock would probably be flat because a lot is baked into it. It's up 240% year to date. Could I imagine it pops today when the market opens and we get a ton of volume? Yes, because that quarter was just really good. But even if it doesn't, again, it's understandable. And the stock actually dumped it. We got to like 137 as soon as the earnings came out because, you know, the algos kind of take control when these earnings come through. But if you really look at the earnings, my goodness, this was just an unfathomably good quarter.</p>
</details>

这个季度之所以如此出色，是因为 Robinhood 正在创造的**运营杠杆**（Operating Leverage: 指公司利用固定成本来放大营业利润增长的能力）是我们前所未见的。说实话，只有 Hood 和 Palantir 做到了这一点。它们能够在以令人难以置信的加速速度增长营收的同时，管理好底线，提高效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason why the quarter was so good is because the operating leverage that Robin Hood is creating is something that I don't think we've ever seen before. Honestly, the only two companies that are doing it like this are Hood and Palantir. They are able to grow the top line at an unbelievably accelerated rate while also managing the bottom line to become more efficient.</p>
</details>

任何投资的圣杯都是：你能在增长营收的同时，以同样的方式增长利润，并确保业务的整体运营杠杆具有增长轨迹吗？与此同时，他们回购了100万股股票，提高了调整后EBITDA，运营支出（OPEX）保持相对平稳，净利润也在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the holy grail of any investment is like can you grow the top line and the bottom line in the same way while being able to make sure that the operating leverage of the business overall has a trajectory for growth. At the same time they bought back a million shares. They increased adjusted IBIDA. They kept OPEX relatively flat. Net income is up.</p>
</details>

我认为一些人忽略的最重要的数据，也是我年底前对 Robinhood 最大的担忧，是他们长期以来都面临**轻松的同期对比基数**（Easy Comps: 指去年同期的业绩基数较低，使得今年的增长率看起来非常高）。也就是说，他们只需要超过第三季度的6.37亿美元，这相对容易。他们做到了12.7亿美元，超出了100%以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the biggest stat that I think some people are overlooking and my biggest concern actually for Robin Hood going into the end of the year was that they've had easy comps for a long time. aka they had to beat 637 million from Q3, which is relatively easy to do. They did 1.27 billion, so they beat by over 100%.</p>
</details>

而第四季度，他们需要超越10亿美元的收入基数。要实现100%的增长会非常困难，因为那意味着他们需要达到20亿美元的收入，这在第四季度可能不是易事。然而，他们披露了10月份在股票、期权、预测市场、加密货币等方面的交易数据，这些数据已经超过了整个第三季度的总和。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next quarter for Q4, they've got to beat a billion dollars of revenue. It's really hard to grow a 100% because then they would have to put up like $2 billion of revenue, which might not be the easiest thing to do in Q4. They disclosed that their October numbers on equities, options, prediction markets, crypto, etc. was better than the entirety of Q3.</p>
</details>

我再说一遍，他们10月份的数据比整个第三季度都好。这意味着即使11月和12月表现平平——考虑到我们在这两个月看到的势头，这不大可能——我们很可能会在第四季度看到一个巨大的业绩超越，或者即使不是巨大的超越，也肯定会超过10亿美元。他们展示增长将毫无问题，而这正是我之前担心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll say that again. their October numbers were better than the entirety of Q3, which means even if November and December are a dud, which they're not going to be given we're seeing momentum in these two months, we are likely going to see a massive beat going into Q4 or even if it's not a massive beat, it's definitely going to beat a billion dollars. They're not going to have any problem being able to show growth, which I was actually concerned about is like could they actually show the growth?</p>
</details>

他们以一种特殊的方式加速了业务发展，吸引了大量新账户、新订阅用户和更高级别的账户。你可以从他们的净存款中看出来，三个月内有200亿美元流入平台。相比之下，许多其他金融科技公司连30亿美元都难以吸引，因为从摩根大通和美国银行这样的巨头那里转移资金到像 Robinhood 这样的小众公司非常困难。但他们做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they've accelerated the business in such a way that they brought in so many new accounts, so many new subscribers, so many new higher level accounts, and you can tell their net deposits. Take a look at that. $20 billion in three months came to the platform. I mean, you look at a lot of the other fintexs of the world, they're not bringing in 20 billion. They're barely bringing in $3 billion because it's really hard to bring over money from JP Morgan and Bank of America into a small niche company like a Robin Hood. But they've figured it out.</p>
</details>

这200亿美元中包括了许多大额账户。他们的保证金利息，即人们向 Robinhood 借款支付的利息，从1.14亿美元增至1.53亿美元，保证金账面规模达到160亿美元，创下历史新高。这一点之所以重要，首先，它显示了市场存在风险偏好，因为人们愿意借钱并支付利息。其次，许多高净值人士会使用保证金。因此，如果你的平台吸引了这些账户，他们借贷数百万美元并支付利息，这对 Robinhood 来说是一笔非常好的生意。随着利率下降，这种情况只会加速，因为资本成本会持续降低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that 20 billion includes a lot of large accounts. Their margin interest, aka the amount of people that are paying interest to borrow money from Robin Hood, went to $153 million, up from 114, 16 billion on their margin book now, which is an all-time high. And the reason that's also really important, number one, it shows that there's a risk on appetite in the market because people are willing to borrow money and pay interest on it. But number two, a lot of wealthier, high net worth individuals utilize margin. And as a result, if you're bringing those accounts onto your platform and they're borrowing millions and millions of dollars and they're paying interest on that, you know, for Robin Hood, that's a very, very good deal. And as rates come down, that likely is only going to accelerate because the cost of capital will continue to get cheaper.</p>
</details>

### 市场份额与万亿市值之路

这份财报中有许多值得关注的方面。从保证金利息到预测市场，再到10月份的指引预示着比整个第三季度更好的表现，交易量创纪录，净利息收入达到4.56亿美元。还有这张幻灯片，我认为非常重要：他们正在大规模地抢占市场份额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, there's a variety of different things to look at in this earnings call. I'll probably do a separate video on it to go deeper on it, but from margin interest to prediction markets to the October guidance signaling that it's better than the entirety of Q3 to record transaction volumes, record net interest revenues at 456 million. And then this slide right here that I thought was really important. They are taking market share at scale.</p>
</details>

看一下这里，他们现在拥有1%的股票市场份额，7.4%的期权市场份额，1%的加密货币市场份额，以及1%的保证金市场份额，这几乎是刚刚起步。在我看来，未来十年，当我们在讨论这些不同产品的全球市场份额时，这个数字将远超10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look at this right here, they now have 1% of the equity markets, 7.4% of options, 1% of crypto, and 1% of margin that it's barely penetrated. I mean, over the next 10 years, this is going to get well above 10% in my opinion when we're talking about a global market share of all these different products.</p>
</details>

在我看来，我昨晚也发了推文，我认为他们正在为万亿美元市值奠定基础。我真的这么认为，而且我说这话时并没有太多犹豫。我知道有人会说：“等等，摩根大通的市值也才8000亿美元，你怎么能说 Robinhood 会成为万亿美元的公司？”这是一个合理的观点。我不是说这会一夜之间发生，甚至不是说未来十年内会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in my opinion, and I tweeted this last night, I think they're setting up the foundation for a trillion dollar market cap. I really do. And I say that not with a lot of hesitancy. And I know people are like, "Wait a second, JP Morgan's only at $800 billion. How are you saying, Robin, it's gonna be a trillion dollar business?" That's a fair point. I'm not saying it's happening overnight. I'm not even saying it's going to happen over the next 10 years.</p>
</details>

我想说的是，我们从这家公司看到的创新水平，以及我对管理层不断推出新产品、拓展新业务领域的信任，都表明了这一点。举个例子，预测市场在整个第三季度完成了23亿份合约。而在10月份，就完成了25亿份合约，一个月内就为公司带来了2500万美元的净利润。Robinhood 进入这个市场还不到一年，而且他们甚至不是第一个进入者，Polymarket 和 Kalshi 已经领先了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I am saying is the level of innovation that we are seeing from this company, the level of trust I have in management to just ship more and more products, expand into new verticals. Case in point, prediction markets did 2.3 billion contracts in all of Q3. In October, it did 2.5 billion contracts, 25 million, boom, right to the bottom line in one month. Robin had entered this market less than a year ago. And they weren't even the first entrant. Poly market and Kalshi already had the lead.</p>
</details>

银行业务明年即将推出，还有各种AI服务也接踵而至。我认为他们将拓展到如此多的垂直领域，以至于在这家公司的生命周期内，它的市值将超过一万亿美元。他们将成为我们所见过的从婴儿潮一代到千禧一代最大规模财富转移的受益者。我认为宏观顺风加上公司自身的执行力，使得它达到万亿市值变得显而易见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like I just and banking's coming next year. You got all these AI services coming next. I think there's so many verticals that they are going to expand into that I think over the lifetime of covering this company, they will be over a trillion dollars. they will be the beneficiaries of the largest wealth transfer we've seen from boomers to millennials. And I think the macro tailwinds along with the company specific execution is kind of making this blatantly obvious that it's going to get to a trillion.</p>
</details>

当然，这并不意味着在143美元买入在短期内是好的选择，因为特朗普可能发条推文，2026年可能出现熊市，然后 Hood 股价下跌50%。任何事情都可能发生。但关键是，如果你真的有长远的眼光，我认为这是一家有朝一日将达到万亿美元市值的优质的、具有时代意义的公司。基于他们公布的财报，我对此非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that doesn't mean buying it at $143 is going to be good in the short term because Trump could tweet something and then 2026 could be a bare market and then hood falls 50%. like anything could happen. But the point is if you really do have a long-term trajectory on this, I think it's a quality generational company that is going to a trillion dollars one day and very very excited based on the earnings that they put up.</p>
</details>

### 财报季的市场反应与估值压力

这就是关于 Robinhood 的情况。如果你是股东，我认为你应该对此感到满意。这和 AMD 的情况类似，他们财报非常出色，但股价相对平稳。在进入第三季度财报季时，很多股票价格已经计入了很多预期。你不会看到太大的上涨动力，因为华尔街必须认真思考，是否能给一个已经有溢价的东西更多的溢价。但如果增长上升而股价持平或下跌，那么估值倍数就会下降，这对于股票长期而言是好事，有助于其巩固当前的估值水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's what we got on Robin Hood. Uh we'll talk more about it throughout the entire show, but uh if you're a shareholder, I think you got to be happy with this. Again, same thing like AMD, they had a phenomenal earnings. Stock was relatively flat. A lot is baked into a lot of these equity prices as we're getting into Q3 earnings. you're just not going to see a ton of momentum because the street has to really ask themselves, can they give more of a premium to something that has a premium, but if the growth goes up and the stock stays flat or the stock comes down, the multiple goes down, which is also really good long term for the stock to consolidate into the quality of the multiple that it has right now.</p>
</details>

我之前问过 Vlad 一个关于**代币化**（Tokenization: 指将现实世界资产的权利转换为区块链上的数字代币的过程）的问题。我认为我们都还没有真正理解这件事的重大意义。实际上，我投资的那家初创公司，我们几个小时后会采访其创始人，他们也涉足这个领域。我基本上是问 Vlad，这个机会有多大。对于所有看好 OpenDoor 的人来说，他提到了房地产，还提到了私人信贷以及除了股票之外的各种可以在区块链上扩展的资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I essentially asked him about tokenization. That's the other thing I didn't talk about too much. I think this tokenization thing we all are really not understanding and in fact the startup that I invested in when we're going to interview the founders in a couple hours. They are also in this tokenization world and like basically I asked Vlad to say hey can you speak on how big the opportunity is and for all my open door bulls he mentioned real estate. He mentioned private credit he mentioned a variety of different assets outside of just equities that can scale on the blockchain.</p>
</details>

当你想到资产上链时，这就是我为什么超级看好以太坊，但我也超级看好能成为收取这些资产所有交易量“过路费”的公司。当我们谈论传统金融市场的交易量时，正如拉里·芬克（Larry Fink）所说，将有近4.5万亿美元的资产上链，为每个人增加更多的流动性，因为你不再需要银行账户或在某个经纪商注册才能交易这些资产。你只需要一个钱包地址就可以进行买卖。这是一个非常大的市场，我们谈论的是数十万亿美元的市场。Robinhood 不会占据整个市场，但即使他们只占有4%到5%，对他们来说也将是一项巨大的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you think of assets coming on chain, that's why I'm super bullish Ethereum, but I'm also super bullish on the company that can become the toll booth to collect all the trading volumes on those assets. And when we think about trading volumes in the traditional financial market, it's as Larry Fink said, almost $4.5 trillion dollars that coming on chain and increasing more liquidity to everyone because you don't need to have a bank account to now trade these assets or be registered with some broker. You can just have a wallet address to be able to trade them up and down. That's a really big market. like we're talking about many many tens of trillions of dollars that market is. Robin Hood is not going to get the entire market, but if they even get four to 5% of it, that's going to be a massive business for them.</p>
</details>

### 盘前财报综述

好了，这就是我们昨天关于 Robinhood 的情况。现在我们来看看其他一些头条新闻。首先，我们快速看一下财报。我们先看看一些财报结果，然后再讨论关于AI的头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so that's what we got on Robin Hood and that's what we had yesterday. Let's get into some of the other headlines. So, a couple of different things that we got going on. First of all, OpenAI, actually, let's do earnings. Let's do earnings real quick. Let's just look at some earnings results and then we'll get into some of the headlines around AI.</p>
</details>

今天早上有很多财报。我不会深入探讨，只给你们看一下主要数据和股价表现。首先是 D-Wave Quantum，股票代码 QBTS。我相信他们营收和每股收益都超出了预期。是的，每股收益超出29%，营收超出23%，达到373万美元，预期为303万美元。他们每股亏损5美分，而预期是7美分。营收同比增长约100%，每股收益同比增长58%。该股股价持平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, we have a bunch of earnings this morning. I'm not going to go super deep into them. I'm just going to give you guys their topline results and we'll see how their stocks are doing and then we'll keep going from there. First of all, let's get into D-Wave Quantum stock that had earnings today. I believe they beat on the top and the bottom. Let me pull this up. D-Wave, yes, they beat by 29% on revenues. or sorry, EPS beat by 23% in revenue, 3.73 million versus 3.03 million expected. They lost 5 cents versus 7 cents. Revenue is up about 100% year-over-year and EPS is up 58% year-over-year. That's what you have on D-Wave, ticker symbol QBTS, that stock is flat.</p>
</details>

华纳兄弟（Warner Brothers）可能会被收购。他们的每股收益未达预期50%，营收未达预期1%。显然，作为一家企业，他们的运营状况不佳。有传言称 Netflix 或 Comcast 将收购他们。他们的股价也持平，而且他们公布的财报数据并不像一家能够长期生存的上市公司应有的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Warner Brothers, these guys are potentially going to be bought out. Missed by 50% on EPS, missed by 1% on revenue. Obviously, not in the best operating shape as a business. There are very large rumors that Netflix or Comcast is going to buy them out. These guys are also flat and you know, they're not really putting up earnings that you would think that a public company that is going to survive long term is putting up.</p>
</details>

Moderna 制药公司，每股收益超出预期76%，营收超出17%。MRNA 股价上涨了7%。顺便说一下，上午11点，特朗普将发表一项声明，内容与药品有关。我们不会观看，因为它与经济无关，而是关于 Trump RX 和 Ozempic 之类的事情。所以我不认为观看会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderna pharmaceutical, they beat by 76% on EPS, beat by 17% on revenue. MRNA, that stock is up 7%. By the way, at 11:00 a.m., Trump is going to be making an announcement. That announcement has to do with drugs. We're not going to be watching it because it's not about the economy or anything like that. It's about Trump RX and Ozempic and stuff like that. So, I really don't think it's going to be that interesting to watch.</p>
</details>

DataDog 表现出色。每股收益超出预期20%，达到55美分，预期为46美分。营收为8.85亿美元，预期为8.52亿美元。又一家软件公司持续实现营收增长，这非常好，因为我们希望看到AI成为许多这类业务的顺风。每股收益同比增长20%，营收同比增长28%。他们在盘前表现最好，上涨了19%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Data Dog, they crushed it. They beat by 20% on EPS. 55 cents versus 46 cents expected. 885 versus 852. Again, more software companies continuing to put up revenue, which is really good because you want to see that AI is a tailwind for a lot of these businesses. EPS up 20% year-over-year. revenue is up 28% year-over-year. They're actually having the best performance in the pre-markets. Look at that. Up 19% right here, which is not too bad for Data Dog as that one goes green.</p>
</details>

Celsius 的情况让我很困惑。他们的股价下跌了，但每股收益却超出了预期50%，达到42美分，预期为28美分。营收为7.25亿美元，预期为7.15亿美元。该股下跌了15%。我不知道为什么会下跌15%。当你每股收益超出50%时，管理层肯定在指引中说了些让人们非常不安的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Celsius, I was confused. Their stocks down, but they beat by 50% on EPS. 42 cents versus 28 cents expected. 725 versus 715. That stock down 15%. I don't know why it's down 15%. It's kind of confusing. I mean, when you beat EPS by 50%, there's got to be something management is guiding for saying that's really troubling people.</p>
</details>

Oscar 每股收益超出预期9%，每股亏损53美分，预期亏损58美分。营收为29.8亿美元，预期为30.8亿美元，略低于预期。Oscar 股价一度上涨，然后回落，现在又上涨了10%。我不太了解 Oscar 业务的所有细节，只知道他们处于医疗保健领域，那些《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的补贴对他们长期发展至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oscar beat by 9% on EPS. Lost 53 cents a share versus 58 cents, 2.98 billion versus 3.08. They missed revenues by a little bit. Oscar was up and then it came down. Now it's back up 10% on the day. It did get to like 19.50, I think, then it fell to 17. Now it's back at 18.79. Again, I don't know all the nuances of Oscar's business. I know that they're in the healthcare space and those ACA subsidies are going to be very important for them long term.</p>

### 消费股的困境：Duolingo 的叙事危机

昨天我们有很多不同的财报。正如你在这里左手边看到的，Duolingo，天哪，189美元。我只想对这只绿色的猫头鹰说声非常非常大的谢谢。我的感谢不是代表我自己，而是代表 Matt Money。因为在我的股票选秀中，我只是想让这只绿色的猫头鹰知道，Matt Money 非常感激我，因为即使我拥有 Palantir、Hood、特斯拉、AMD 和 Nebius，我也永远无法恢复并赢得这场该死的选秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yesterday we had a lot of different earnings. Um, as you can see on the left hand side right here, Duolingo, my goodness, 189. I just want to give a big thank you, a very big thank you to the Green Owl. And my thank you is not on behalf of myself. It's on behalf of Matt Money because in my stock draft, you know, I just want to let the Green Owl know that Matt Money is very grateful for the fact that I am never going to recover and even have a chance even after having Pounder Hood, Tesla, AMD, and Nebus to be able to win this damn draft.</p>
</details>

我不知道这只股票出了什么问题，我个人并不持有它。当我深入研究它时，对于那些读到最后的人来说，结论是我不能买这只股票。原因是我无法接受AI威胁的叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know what's going on with this stock and I don't personally own it. When I did the deep dive on it, for those that actually read towards the end of the deep dive, the conclusion was I can't buy the stock. And the reason is I can't buy the stock is because of the narrative of the AI overhang.</p>
</details>

尽管从指标上看，它有护城河。每日活跃用户（DAU）、每月活跃用户（MAU）、订阅收入、付费用户数都创下历史新高。但存在一个叙事，这个叙事昨天渗透到了 Duolingo 的一些数据中，他们没有给出第四季度的预订量指引，而且付费用户占总收入的百分比连续第五个季度下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I spent a lot of time in that deep dive towards the end of it actually explaining, look, I think there's a moat in regards to the metrics. And look, it's hard to say there's not a moat when you look at these metrics. DAU's all-time highs, MAU's all-time high, subrevenue all-time high, paid subscribers all-time high. But there is a narrative and that narrative actually infiltrated itself in terms of some of the numbers on Dualingo yesterday when they didn't give I believe bookings a guide for Q4 and their percentage of paid subscribers as a percentage of overall revenue went down for like the fifth quarter in a row.</p>
</details>

当一个企业各项业务都火力全开，每个指标都创下历史新高，也许只有一两个指标不尽人意，或者没有华尔街期待的准确指引，但其他一切都很好，而股价却下跌了30%。对我来说，这更多的是一个叙事问题，而不是基本面问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That to me is a narrative issue more than anything. I don't know if that's a fundamental issue because you know when you beat the estimates and you you're consistently profitable you are putting up good earnings. It's either the multiple is way too high and the street can't stomach it or the narrative is so bad and we saw this with Google for a long time until Google was able to change the narrative with the DOJ.</p>
</details>

现在买入 Duolingo 怎么样？现在它的股价低于200日移动平均线，估值倍数大幅压缩，看起来更具吸引力。问题是，你现在是在抄底。如果你在抄底，你必须明白，你是在以一个被压缩的估值买入一个基于我们所见数据的高质量企业，因为华尔街不理解它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about buying Duolingo right now? Well, so now it's below the 200 day moving average. Now you know the multiple has compressed dramatically. Now it looks a lot more attractive. The problem is now you're bottom fishing. And if you're bottom fishing, you have to understand that you're bottom fishing with the intention of buying a very high quality business based on the numbers that we've seen at a multiple that is compressed because the street doesn't understand it.</p>
</details>

这是 Duolingo 的 CEO 谈论一些关于公司的看空担忧：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here is the CEO of Duolingo real quick just talking about some of these bare market or bearish concerns about Duolingo and then we'll keep going from there</p>
</details>

> 关于竞争格局，人们常说两件事。第一，既然可以用 ChatGPT 学习语言，为什么还要用 Duolingo？我们对此并不特别担心。我们做得非常好的一点，不仅是教得好，更是能让用户保持参与。学习一门语言需要数年的持续参与，而我们能让你坚持下去。第二，人们担心实时翻译会让人不想学语言。我们也不担心这个。过去十年，谷歌几乎在每次 I/O 大会上都展示实时翻译，但我们并未看到学习语言的需求有任何下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> of the competitive land landscape. Uh you know I think people you know people say things like uh the two things that people say about the competitive landscape with AI are number one why would anybody want to learn a language with Duolingo when you can just learn it with ChachiPT. Um okay uh I you know we're not particularly worried about that. The main thing that we do really well is keep people engaged. And in order to learn a language, you need to be engaged for years. And then the other thing that people have said that they're worried about is oh well nobody's going to want to learn a language because we're going to have simultaneous language translation and okay also not worried about that. For the last 10 years we have not seen the desire to learn a language go down at all.</p>

### AI 领域的震动与宏观经济逆风

让我们谈谈可能导致市场下跌的另一个原因，那就是昨天英伟达和 OpenAI 发生的事情。在伦敦的一次会议上，黄仁勋基本上说中国将赢得AI竞赛。这让华尔街开始恐慌并抛售股票。四小时后，黄仁勋不得不评论说：“正如我一直所说，中国在AI领域仅比美国落后纳秒。美国通过领先并赢得全球开发者来获胜至关重要。”他基本上是在重申自己的观点，即中国在AI能力上非常接近美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about the other reason why we might be having a little bit of a red market, and that has to do with what happened with Nvidia and OpenAI yesterday. Jensen at a conference in London basically said China's going to win the AI race. That that's in a nutshell that's what he said. And the streets started freaking out and they started selling off the stock and then Jensen four hours later had to comment and say, "As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide." Aka, Jensen double down on the thesis that wait a second, I'm not going to take back what I said just because my stock is down five bucks and it just lost 120 billion in market cap. I'm gonna double down and say, "Guys, no." Like, China is very close to America when it comes to AI capabilities.</p>
</details>

为什么黄仁勋要这么说？我想我们都能读懂言外之意，他希望能够向中国销售产品。目前，他无法向中国销售。他与特朗普关系很好，但特朗普听从像马可·卢比奥这样的顾问的意见，他们认为不应允许英伟达向中国销售这些高质量芯片。所以，黄仁勋显然是在试图挽救公司，表示不让我们向中国销售是不公平的，如果我们不这样做，中国最终会击败我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why is Jensen saying that? I think we all, you know, can read between the lines, he wants to be able to sell into China. And right now, he doesn't have the ability to sell into China. In fact, he has a great relationship with Trump, but Trump is like on the side of his advisers like Marco Rubio that are saying we shouldn't be allowing Nvidia to sell these high quality chips into China. So, Jensen right here is obviously trying to save the company a little bit and say it's not fair for us to not be able to sell into China and if we don't then China's eventually going to beat us.</p>
</details>

然后，OpenAI 在某个会议上表示，他们正在寻求政府支持以增加AI投资。首席财务官的原话是：“我们正在寻找一个由银行、私募股权，甚至可能是政府组成的生态系统。联邦贷款担保将真正降低融资成本。”这显然让很多人担心，因为他们计划花费1.4万亿美元，却又没有足够的现金流来支持，这听起来很有泡沫。现在你还想让政府参与进来为这些贷款提供担保。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then OpenAI came out at some conference and they basically said, "We are seeking government backing to boost AI investments." The quote was from the CFO. This is where we're looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, and maybe even governmental. federal loans guarantees would really drop the cost of the financing. Obviously, this got a lot of people worried because everyone...the question continues to remain, is this unsustainable to say they're going to spend 1.4 trillion dollars, have all these spending commitments, and not really have the cash flows to be able to put up for it. It already is screaming. It's very bubblish. And now you're saying you want the government to be involved in backstopping these loans.</p>
</details>

首席财务官后来在 LinkedIn 上澄清说：“我想澄清我今天早些时候的评论。OpenAI 并没有为我们的基础设施承诺寻求政府的支持。我用了‘支持’这个词，它混淆了重点。”我认为这有点公关辞令，试图掩盖原话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The CFO clarified on LinkedIn, I want to clarify my comments earlier today. Opening eye is not seeking a government backstop for our infrastructure commitments. I used the word backstop and it muddied the point as the full clip of my answer shows. I think that's a little, you know, PR to try to cover up the quote.</p>

### 关税裁决与就业数据引发担忧

最高法院昨天开始听取关于关税的意见。特朗普在福克斯新闻上表示，这个决定对美国来说是生死攸关的。据我了解，决定要到一月份才会出来。有报道称，大法官们更倾向于认为关税违宪，也有人说他们支持特朗普政府。但如果裁决对特朗普不利，可能会对市场产生巨大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Supreme Court started hearing comments of tariffs yesterday. Here is what Trump had to say on Fox around what's going on with the Supreme Court and these tariffs. Trump has said this decision is going to be life or death for the United States. Now, my understanding of the decision is that it's not coming out till January. There are mixed reports. Some reports are saying that the Supreme Court justices are more on the side that it's unconstitutional. Other are saying that they're on his side. But from my understanding, we're not going to get a decision until January. If it ends up happening before January, then that is very important. I'm going to try to get some clarity on when exactly the Supreme Court will make their ruling. But if it's before the end of the year, that's a big deal because that could affect markets dramatically if somehow the ruling ends up going against Trump.</p>
</details>

我们今天早上得到了一些第三方就业报告。根据 Challenger 的数据，美国雇主在10月份宣布裁员15.3万人，同比增长175%，是自2003年10月以来的最高水平。雇主们将成本削减和人工智能列为裁员的主要驱动因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jobs data, we got some third party jobs reporting this morning. The exact quote right here from Challenger is that US employers announced 153,000 job cuts in October, 175% year-over-year, the highest since October 2003. Employers are setting cost cutting and AI as the primary drivers of these cuts.</p>
</details>

摩根大通今天早上表示，市场因裁员因AI而激增的头条新闻而动摇。市场正在权衡劳动力市场疲软和潜在支出与AI效能、投资回报率以及生产力提升的证据。当你看到 Chipotle、DoorDash 以及其他许多消费品牌谈论消费者面临的一些问题时，他们并没有明确说消费者处于可怕的境地，但他们确实表示看到了疲软的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">JP Morgan this morning said that the market is rocked by headlines that layoffs are spiking due to AI. The market is weighing a weaker labor market and potential spending versus evidence on the efficacy and ROI of AI plus productivity gains. And so when you look at what Chipotle said, when you look at what Door Dash said, when you look at what a bunch of these other consumer brands are talking about ELF in regards to having some issues with the consumer, they're not explicitly saying the consumer is in a horrible situation and you guys need to prepare for the worst, but they are saying we are seeing signs of weakness.</p>

### 市场开盘表现与个股动态

标普500指数今日开盘下跌。我们昨天有很多财报，所以我们将看看一些股价的反应。如你所见，标普500指数确实是红色的。Robinhood 下跌2.39%，跌幅约3%。Palantir 也在下跌。整个盘面一片红。

Duolingo 当日下跌27%。DoorDash 下跌13%。特斯拉也下跌了，今天将举行股东大会，这对伊隆·马斯克能否获得薪酬方案至关重要。我认为它会以压倒性优势通过。

### Meta 与 Grab 深度分析

昨晚我和一位非常好的朋友进行了交谈，我想和大家分享一些谈话的要点。我们深入探讨了 Grab 和 Meta。关于 Grab，尽管财报轨迹良好，但股价持平。我们再次审视了数据，并得出结论，我们并没有遗漏什么。我们可能在给予其较高的**企业价值与息税折旧摊销前利润比率**（EV to EBITDA multiple: 一种估值指标，用于衡量公司价值，常用于比较不同资本结构的公司）方面有些激进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I had a conversation last night with a really good friend and I want to give you guys some takeaways from the conversation. The basic thesis on grab right here that I wanted to ask him for is look the stock is flat although the earnings trajectory is good. We concluded the answer is no. And again, we spent a lot of time going through this. We really looked at the thesis and we said the only part we might be being a little bit aggressive on is giving it a higher uh EV to Ebida multiple.</p>
</details>

昨天 Grab 有一笔4300万股的**暗池**（Dark Pool: 指机构投资者进行大宗交易的私人交易平台，其交易细节不向公众披露）订单。我们不知道是买入还是卖出。根据我最近几天观察的期权流向，我倾向于认为是买入，因为看涨看跌比率已经高得离谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a darkpool order yesterday for 43 million shares. What is a darkpool order? A darkpool order usually is conducted by institutions to not be seen by the market makers or by you know the general public when they are executing a trade. We don't know if it's a buy or if it's a sell. Based on the option flow that I've been looking at over the past couple days, I'm leaning towards a buy because the put call ratio is getting stupid.</p>
</details>

关于 Meta，我朋友的最大持仓也是 Meta。我问他是否应该逢低买入。他的回答是斩钉截铁的“不”。他认为华尔街完全有理由打压这只股票，因为 Meta 除了广告业务外，没有展示出任何能产生投资回报率的东西。Reality Labs 正在亏损，智能眼镜是个失败品。扎克伯格在2022年已经表明他愿意花钱，只是因为股价跌到88美元才转型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Sebastian also has Meta as his largest position. I said, "Dude, do I buy the dip?" His answer unequivocally was no. Do not buy the dip on Meta. He said the street is completely justified in taking this stock down because Meta has not shown that they can do anything in their business to generate an ROI outside of advertising. And his argument is that they did 72 billion of capex this year. Reality Labs is losing money. The glasses are a dud. Zuck already showed people in 2022 that he's willing to spend money and the only reason he pivoted was because the stock fell to $88.</p>
</details>

他的论点是，谷歌和微软在资本支出上与 Meta 相当，但他们有云业务，而云业务正在产生大量收入。Meta 没有云业务，只有广告。最让他生气的是，扎克伯格在电话会议上轻描淡写地说，如果有多余的GPU，他们会建立自己的“NeoCloud”数据中心。他觉得扎克伯格对AI毫无计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Sebastian's argument is Google and Microsoft and Meta that are spending almost the same amount a little bit more than Meta but almost the same amount that Meta is spending. They have something called a cloud and that cloud is generating a lot of freaking revenue. Meta does not have a cloud. Meta has advertising. And the biggest thing that pissed him off on the call is that Zuck kind of like said on the call to a response to a question about Capex that oh if we have leftover GPUs we'll come up with our own NeoCloud data center. And he was just like this guy has no plan. This guy has absolutely no plan. He doesn't know what he's doing with AI.</p>

### 特朗普关于药品定价的声明

特朗普总统就药品定价发表了讲话，宣布与礼来（Eli Lilly）和诺和诺德（Novo Nordisk）达成协议。他表示，这两家公司已承诺以“最惠国待遇”价格向美国患者提供其突破性的减肥药 Zepbound 和 Wegovy。这将大幅降低药品成本，例如 Wegovy 的月费将从1350美元降至250美元。此外，Medicare 和 Medicaid 将首次覆盖这些减肥药的费用，患者的共付额最低可至50美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Eli Lily and Novo Nordisk are committing to offer Zepbound and Wiggoi at most favored nations rates for American patients. This will slash the cost of Wiggoi from $1,350 a month to ultimately $250 a month. In addition, they're both committing that future GOP1 weight loss drugs taken orally, which are currently under development, will be sold at no more than $149 per month. Just as significantly, Medicare and Medicaid will finally cover the costs of these weight loss drugs for millions of patients suffering from obesity. Co-pays for Medicare patients will be as low as $50.</p>

### 市场总结与展望

今天市场一片惨淡，我们仍在试图弄清楚确切的原因。理由尚不明确。特斯拉的投票将在收盘时进行，我们届时会报道。高动量股今天遭受重创。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ugly, ugly stuff today. And again, I still don't think anyone has a full reason. I know we've pontificated about a variety of reasons, but there's not that core headline that everyone can point to. Tesla vote is at the market close, so we'll cover that when we're back on the close. The banks are somewhat green. Everything high momentum is getting wrecked today.</p>
</details>

我能拼凑出的原因包括：对政府停摆的担忧加剧；第三方就业数据显示10月份裁员人数创2003年以来新高，这可能是一个令市场不安的头条；最后，可能仅仅是对10月份涨幅的盘整。

<details>

在这样的一天，保持**镇定**（Equanimity: 尤其是在压力或紧张情况下保持精神上的平静、沉着和镇定）非常重要。如果你没有使用杠杆或保证金，不必担心账户被强平，那么最好的做法可能就是放下投资组合，等待更多的数据出现。

Um, you kind of just don't look at it and wait for more data is what I would say.</p>
