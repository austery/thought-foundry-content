title: AI的三个未来：我们如何选择？| Alvin W. Graylin | TED
summary: Alvin W. Graylin在TED演讲中探讨了人工智能（AI）的现状，指出当前存在大量关于AI的误解和信息不准确。他描绘了AI发展的三个潜在未来：由大型实验室主导的“Elysium”式未来，导致贫富差距加剧；冲突升级的“Mad Max”式未来，可能引发AI战争乃至核战争；以及技术共享、造福人类的“Star Trek”式未来。Graylin驳斥了“AI竞赛”是为阻止中国发展的说法，认为其本质是追求巨额利润。他提出应对AI冲击的三个关键策略：建立“AI的CERN”以汇聚全球人才进行合作研发；整合全球数据以避免AI偏见，实现普惠AI；以及借鉴历史经验，推出“AI时代的GI Bill”，为可能被AI取代的劳动者提供教育和支持，确保技术进步惠及全人类。

### AI的现状与迷思

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 人类，依然了不起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Humans, still amazing.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 我认为我们现在还不可替代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: I don’t think we’re replaceable yet.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 还没有。但Alvin，我们要来点直白的谈话。对我来说，对于普通人而言，今年是AI之年。而且我认为没人真正知道现在该怎么想。所以，Alvin，你一直在这个领域——AI、网络安全、VR、半导体——你已经做了35年了。但让你与众不同的是，你既在美国，作为美国公民，也长期在中国。我认为很多人对AI感到矛盾。他们会想，到底发生了什么，什么是炒作，什么是正在改变我们的存在？在你看来，我们现在处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: No, not yet.
But, Alvin, we're going
to get some straight talk.
To me, for normal people,
this was the year of AI.
And I don't think anyone really knows
what to think right now.
So, Alvin, you have been in this field --
AI, cybersecurity, VR, semiconductors --
35 years you've been doing this.
But what makes you very different
is that it's been both
in the United States,
as a US citizen,
and in China a lot of the time.
I think a lot of people feel
ambivalent about AI.
They feel like, what is actually
really happening,
what is hype
and what is transforming our existence?
Where are we right now according to you?

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 我觉得这是我们今天社会面临的最大问题之一。不幸的是，存在着大量错误信息。我的回答可能与硅谷的普遍看法略有不同，尽管我在**斯坦福**（**Stanford**）工作，而且对很多人来说，这可能会有点吓人。但希望到最后，它能说服你们采取行动。就像TED，以及我在TED看到的小纸条上写的，你打算在这次活动后采取什么行动？我们正处于一个转折点，而且不是那种传统意义上持续上升的转折点。我们现在实际上正处于一个岔路口，面临三种可能的未来。一种是大型实验室通过尽可能地增长其权力和资源，基本上控制政府，然后创造一个由万亿富翁组成的阶层，而其他人则处于其外。这就是我们面前的“**Elysium**”式未来。第二种选择是，我们正朝着“**Mad Max**”式未来迈进，我们加剧国家间的冲突，从AI竞赛到AI战争，再到实体战争，最终可能走向核战争。我与华盛顿的人谈过，他们实际上认为这是“不可避免的”，这有点吓人。而我们现在拥有的第三种选择，可能是“**Star Trek**”式选择，即技术被使用和共享，并带来某种东西——你知道，在《星际迷航》的故事里，基本上是瓦肯人给我们带来了先进技术。和平、理性的物种为我们带来技术，拯救我们免于自我毁灭，并开启这个发现的世纪或千年的发现。我们有潜力到达那里。不幸的是，今天，我们正朝着前两种未来发展。而驱动它的力量，实际上需要我们付出很多努力，才能从最初的驱动力转向前两种，再转向最后一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: I mean, this is one
of the biggest questions
that we have as a society today.
And unfortunately, there's just
a lot of misinformation.
And my answer to you is probably
going to be a little different
than the Silicon Valley consensus,
even though I work at Stanford,
and it's going to be probably
a little scary to a lot of you.
But hopefully, by the end of this,
it will convince you to take action.
Just like what TED,
and the little note I saw in TED,
it says, what action are you going
to take after this event?
We are really at this inflection point
and the inflection point,
not the traditional one
that just keeps going up.
We are essentially at a fork in a road
between three possible futures right now.
One where the big labs
essentially take control
of the government by growing their power
and their resources as much as possible,
then creating essentially a class
of trillionaires and everybody else.
This is kind of the Elysium future
that's ahead of us.
The second option is that actually
we are heading towards a Mad Max future,
where we intensify the conflict
between countries,k
and going from AI race to AI war
to kinetic war and potentially
to nuclear war.
And I've talked to people in DC
who actually see that as "inevitable,"
which is a little scary.
And the third option
that we have right now
is potentially the Star Trek option,
the option where technology
is being used and shared,
and something brings us -- you know,
in the Star Trek stories, essentially,
the Vulcans bring us advanced technology.
Peaceful, rational species brings us
technology and saves us from ourselves
and brings on this century of discovery
or millennia of discovery.
We have a potential to to get there.
Unfortunately, today,
we are heading towards the first two.
And the forces of what's driving it
is actually going to take
a lot of work for us
to move from the first forces
towards the first two,
towards that last one.

</details>

### AI竞赛的神话

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 能不能再深入谈谈？因为我认为我们被告知的叙事，至少肯定是由**Sam Altman**和其他一些AI高管提出的，就是我们必须锁住这项技术，我们必须快速发展它，因为如果我们不发展，中国就会。你同意吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Can we get into that
a little bit more?
Because I think the narrative
we've all been told,
at least certainly by Sam Altman
and maybe some other AI executives,
is that we've got to lock
this technology down,
we've got to grow it,
we've got to grow it fast,
because if we don't, China will.
Would you agree with that?

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 这实际上是一个最大的迷思之一，也是最可怕的事情之一。事实上，两天前，我刚从中国回来。我职业生涯的一半时间都在那里工作，我认为，今天的AI产业实际上在使用过去一个世纪以来军事工业复合体所使用的相同工具——即你必须制造一个敌人，一旦你做到了，你就能获得资金、支持、放松管制，你就能更快地前进，然后就能赚钱。AI实验室实际上想做的不是拯救世界。而是要创造数十亿，实际上是数万亿美元的财富。事实上，他们明确表示AI价值数万亿美元。他们想成为第一个创造**AGI**（**人工智能通用智能**）的公司。而Sam的定义是，这项技术可以取代普通工人。这意味着他想创造一项能够夺走这里所有人工作的技术。表面上看，这可能很可怕，但我认为如果它来自正确的动机，它实际上可能是一件好事，因为这意味着我们被解放了，我们可以花时间从事艺术、音乐，以及观看TED。但不幸的是，我认为现在还没有讲出另一面的故事，那就是我们如何保护那些将被这项技术取代的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: That's actually one
of the biggest myths out there,
and actually one of the most
scary things out there.
In fact, two days ago,
I just came back from China.
I've worked there half my career,
and I think essentially,
the AI industry today
is using the same tools
that the military industrial complex
has used over the last century
in terms of you have to create an enemy,
once you do that, then you get funding,
you get support, you get deregulation,
you get to move faster,
and then you get to make money.
And what the AI labs
are actually trying to do
is not to save the world.
It is actually to create billions,
actually trillions of dollars.
In fact, they specifically said
AI is worth trillions of dollars.
And they want to be
the first one to create AGI,
artificial general intelligence.
And it's defined, actually by Sam,
as a technology that can replace
the average worker.
And what that means is
he wants to create a technology
that can take everybody's jobs here.
Now on the surface,
that actually may be scary,
but I think if it's coming
from the right place,
it actually could be an amazing thing
because that means we get liberated
so that we can spend time
doing art and music
and watching, coming to TED.
But, unfortunately,
I think right now there isn't
the other side of the story being put in,
which is how do we protect the people
who are going to be displaced by it?

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 好的，所以，尽管我们刚才谈了这么多，Alvin实际上是个乐观主义者。（笑）我保证，他是。请解释一下你提出的关于我们如何走上正轨的愿景，我们如何抓住这个转折点并真正朝着好的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: OK, so I mean, despite what
we've just talked about so far,
Alvin is actually an optimist.
(Laughter)
He is, I promise.
Explain the vision
that you have come up with
about how we take the right track,
that we take this moment of inflection
and we actually pivot in a good way.

</details>

### 三条未来之路

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 是的，我刚提交了一篇关于AI政策的论文给斯坦福，内容是关于我们未来需要做什么，以及如何从今天的轨迹转向更好的方向。这是一个三部分的故事，听起来很简单，但执行起来非常困难。第一，我们必须决定，与其争夺资源，在世界各地创建数百个实验室，试图复制同样的工作，并导致芯片、内存和人才供应不足，不如我们应该联合起来，创建一个被一些人称为“**AI的CERN**”的机构。基本上，建立一个汇聚全球所有人才的单一实验室。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: Yeah, so I actually just turned
in the paper to Stanford,
which is an AI policy paper
about what we need to do going forward
and how we move from today's trajectory
into something better.
And it's a three-piece,
a three-part story,
which sounds simple,
but it's actually very hard to execute.
One is we actually have to decide
that instead of competing over resources
and creating hundreds of labs
around the world,
trying to create, duplicate,
actually, the same work
and having a undersupply of chips
and memory and talent,
rather than doing that,
we need to come together and create
what some people call the CERN of AI.
Essentially a single lab that aggregates
all of the talent around the world.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 像空间站一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Like the space station.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 像空间站，像CERN，像我们为其他技术做过的ITER实验室。这是非常可行的。然后，无论从中产生什么，都不要被一个公司或一个国家独占，而是与世界分享，这就是**开放科学**的全部理念。这使得这个世界取得了进步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: Like the space station,
like CERN, like the ITER labs that we do,
we've done for other types
of technologies.
It is very doable.
And then whatever comes out of it,
rather than hoarding it
for one company or one country
to do it and share it with the world,
which is the whole idea of open science.
This is what's made progress
in this world happen.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 为开放科学欢呼，是的，TED观众，好了，书呆子们，我爱你们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Woo for open science,
yeah, TED crowd,
alright, nerds, I love it.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 是的。第二，我们需要整合来自世界各地的所有人的数据，这样我们就不会创造——事实上，很多人今天想做的是创造“**主权AI**”（**sovereign AI**），这意味着一个为你的国家、文化服务的AI，并代表你。它本质上是一个输入数据的子集。听起来不错，因为我这边有东西了。但现在的数据，研究表明，你提供的数据越少，这些AI就越有偏见。我们真正需要做的是确保全世界的数据，我们所有的历史、所有的语言都被代表，所有的文化，这样AI才能进来，为每个人创造一个最优化的结果，找到一种平衡每个人需求的方法，而不损害他人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: Yes.
And then two, is that we need
to put together everybody's data
from around the world
so that we're not creating --
in fact, the thing that a lot of people
want to do today is create "sovereign AI"
which means an AI that works
for your country, culture
and represents you.
And it essentially is a subset
of data feeding into it.
And it sounds like, OK, that's good,
because I have something on my side.
But what data right now,
what research is showing
is that the less you give data,
the more biased these AI become.
And what we really need to do
is to make sure
that the entire world's data,
all of our history, all of our languages
are represented, all of the culture,
because then the AI can come in
and create an optimal for everyone,
that there is a way to find a way
to balance everybody's needs
without taking other people down.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 那么，我们该如何说服人们，包括技术人员和政府，接受这一点呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: So how are we going
to convince people to do this,
technologists, governments,
to go along with this?

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 我认为这是最难的部分。关键是，我们需要理解，或者需要他们理解，世界不是零和的，实际上通过合作，这并非软弱。合作是开明的自利。因为当你合作时，你实际上是提升了所有人。当你提升了所有人，就少了很多冲突的理由，少了很多我需要让我的孩子飞越一万英里去杀死你的孩子的理由。当我拥有这项技术所能给予我的一切时，我为什么要这样做？因为这是一项惊人的技术。它将治愈癌症，它将为我们带来更好的能源，它将解决饥饿问题，所有这些。但我们必须选择与世界分享，我们必须选择将其用于人类的福祉，而不是一个国家的利益。但计划还有第三部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: That's the hard part, I think.
The thing is, we need to understand
or we need them to understand,
that the world is not zero sum,
and that actually by working together,
it's not weakness.
Working together
is enlightened self-interest.
Because when you work together,
you actually raise everybody up.
And when you raise everybody up,
there's a lot less reason
to have conflict,
a lot less reason to have my children
fly 10,000 miles around the world
to kill your children.
Why would I need that
when I have everything around me
from this technology
that’s going to give us.
Because this is amazing technology.
It's going to solve cancer,
it is going to bring us
better energy sources,
it's going to solve hunger,
all these things.
But we have to choose
to share with the world,
and we have to choose
to use it for humanity's good,
not for one country's good.
But there was a third part to the plan.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 抱歉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Sorry.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 计划的第三部分是所谓的“**AI时代的GI Bill**”（**GI Bill for the AI age**）。我为什么这么说？因为在1944-45年，大约有1500万美国军人从第二次世界大战归来，他们将给世界带来巨大的就业冲击，因为他们将失业。美国决定怎么做？政府说，我们将提供免费教育，零利率贷款，免费医疗，然后我们将帮助你们，基本上是买房，因为这是人们拥有稳定生活所需要的。这创造了美国的中产阶级。它创造了我们经济的繁荣，并将我们变成了今天的样子，即世界上最成功、最强大的国家。我们可以再次做到这一点，但不是为1500万人，可能是为1.5亿人，可能是为15亿人。因为美国有1.7亿工人，而我们正在看到的失业比例将是人们预测的比例。仅在美国，就可能影响1亿多人。在全球范围内，将有数十亿人。我们必须照顾好他们。因为如果我们不这样做，这个世界将不会是我们愿意待的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: The third part of the plan is
something called
the GI Bill for the AI age.
So why do I say that?
Because in 1944-45,
there was about 15 million
American service people
coming back from World War II,
and they were going to create a giant
employment shock to the world
because they're going to come in,
they're going to be unemployed.
What did America decide to do?
The government says,
we're going to give you free education,
we're going to give you
zero-interest loans,
free medical,
and then we're going to help you,
essentially, buy homes,
because that's what's needed
for people to have secure lives.
And it created the American middle class.
It created a boom in our economy
and turned us into what we are today,
which is the most successful
and most powerful nation in the world.
We can do that again,
but not for 15 million people,
maybe for 150 million people,
maybe for 1.5 billion people.
Because America has 170 million workers,
and the displacements that we are seeing
is going to be the proportions
that people are predicting.
It could get to 100-plus million people
affected just in this country.
And globally, it will be
billions of people.
And we have to take care of them.
Because if we don’t,
this world not going to be
a very good place for us to hang out in.

### 应对AI冲击

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 好的，这信息量很大。（笑）我确实想给我们一些可操作的东西，对吧？因为可能会让人觉得，哦，AI这件事正在发生在我们身上，而且是不可避免的，但我们能做什么？就像我们离开这里的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: OK, that's a lot to take in.
(Laughter)
I do want to give us
something actionable, right.
Because it can feel like,
oh, this AI thing is happening
to us and that it's inevitable,
but what can we do?
Like when we walk out of here.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 我认为你需要做的是开始改变你的心态，开始理解世界不是零和的。而且你作为企业主，你们大多数人都拥有企业或在企业中担任高级职位，你们实际上负有责任。你需要考虑你的公司如何整合AI，不是以取代人的方式，而是以提高效率的方式。而不是说，“我要裁掉30%的员工”，有些公司正在这样做。最近两个月，我与50家公司谈过他们如何实施AI，其中许多公司说，“我就是要取代我的员工。”给予他们四天工作制，或者转岗培训到其他地方，我们需要减轻这项技术对我们社会造成的冲击。之前的工业革命花了80年、60年和40年才完成。这次将在未来5到10年内，甚至可能更短的时间内发生，而我们的社会还没有准备好以这种速度发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: I think what you need to do
is actually to start
to change your mindset,
to start to understand
that the world is not zero-sum.
And you actually have a responsibility
as business owners,
most of you guys own businesses
or work in very senior
positions in businesses.
You need to see about how
does your company integrate AI,
not in a way to replace people,
but in a way to make
things more efficient.
And rather than saying,
I'm going to lay off
30 percent of my staff,
which some companies are doing,
recently I've talked to 50 companies
in the last two months
about how they were implementing,
a lot of them are saying,
I'm going to just replace my people.
Giving them four-day workweeks,
or reskilling to other places,
we need to reduce the shock
of what this technology is going to do
to our society.
The prior industrial revolutions took 80,
60 and 40 years to play out.
This one is going to happen
in the next five to 10 years,
maybe shorter,
and our society is not equipped
to move at that speed.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: 所以玩玩这些模型，看看它们是什么样的，了解这些公司在谈论什么。你推荐这样做吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: So play with the models,
see what they're like,
know what these companies
are talking about.
Do you recommend that?

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 哦，你必须这样做。你必须真正使用这些模型，因为你会听到人们说，“哦，这个东西没那么可怕，这个东西永远不会取代人类。”现实是，你使用得越多，你就越能理解它们有多强大，以及它们每天变化的速度有多快，如果你不使用它，你就不会理解它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: Oh, you have to do it.
You have to actually use these models,
because you’ll hear people say,
oh, this thing is not that scary,
this thing will never replace humans.
The reality is, the more you use,
the more you understand
how powerful they are
and how quickly
they're changing every day,
and if you don't use it,
you won't understand it.

</details>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Alvin Graylin，感谢你让我们得以一窥我们的未来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manoush Zomorodi**: Alvin Graylin, thanks for giving us
a glimpse into our future.

</details>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: 谢谢你，Manoush。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alvin W. Graylin**: Thank you, Manoush.
