title: “AI 将颠覆教育：一场不容忽视的危机”
summary: “本文深入剖析了生成式人工智能对教育体系构成的潜在威胁。演讲者认为，AI并非通过作弊威胁教育，而是通过接管教学职责，将教师降级为‘看管者’。文章批判了教育体系过度依赖标准化测试作为衡量成功的唯一标准，并将其比作‘斯金纳箱’的操纵模式。演讲者警告，这种以分数至上的教育模式将导致人类在与AI的竞争中彻底失败，并揭示了AI驱动教育背后隐藏的伦理困境、商业驱动以及对学生批判性思维和现实应对能力的长期损害。”

### AI 对教育的颠覆性威胁

演讲者开篇点明，随着“返校季”的到来，他开始思考并担忧人工智能（AI）正朝着摧毁学校、教师和教育体系的方向发展，并且能从中获利丰厚，除非我们加以阻止。他强调，这种威胁并非指学生利用AI作弊，而是AI将全面接管教学职责，使“教师”一职沦为“看管者”，而令人意外的是，一些意想不到的人正在助推这一进程。

演讲者回顾了自己近期关于教育类YouTube频道主张的视频，指出其中一些频道试图引导观众将注意力集中在AI可能带来的、尚属虚构的未来科幻式危险上，从而故意淡化和最小化当前生成式AI已造成的实际问题。他明确指出，我们当下已有的生成式AI正被大型AI公司积极准备，以颠覆教育市场。他强调，这并非虚构，而“我们”是阻止这一切发生的唯一力量。

演讲者进一步阐述，此次的真正问题并非AI本身，而是那些本应支持教育的人，却被支付报酬来转移公众对AI接管教育计划的关注；以及那些对此欢呼雀跃，或仅仅袖手旁观的人。演讲者Carl，一位自20世纪80年代起就从事软件行业的专业人士，致力于让互联网更安全、更可靠、更少出现bug，而近期他的工作很大一部分就是对抗AI的负面影响。

他指出，当前的人工智能，特别是生成式AI技术（而非未来理论上的AI），在某种程度上可以被视为比任何人类教师都更“有效”和“成功”的教师。但这并非AI的内在优势，而是源于我们对待教师和学校的方式，这种情况之糟糕，以及演讲者多么希望它不是事实，都难以言喻。他表示，自己已观察这种趋势数十年，如同目睹一场慢动作的火车事故。

为了铺垫，演讲者以自己在美国德克萨斯州成长的经历为例。在乔治·W·布什担任总统之前，他曾是德州州长，在其任期内，德州创建了一个项目，该项目最终演变为联邦层面的“不让一个孩子掉队”（No Child Left Behind）计划。该计划与当前讨论最相关的一点是所谓的“问责制”（accountability），包括学校问责和教师问责。在此语境下，“问责制”的含义实际上就是“学生在标准化测试中的表现”，几乎不包含其他任何衡量标准。演讲者承认这是从美国视角出发的观点，但他通过阅读了解到，将标准化测试成绩作为衡量教育成功的首要标准，似乎是一个比美国更广泛存在的问题。

Welcome to the week of Back to School after the holidays, at least where I live.
And that has me thinking, and worrying.
You see, it seems to me that AI is on track to destroy schools and teachers and education and make a ton of money doing it if we don't stop it.
And I'm not talking about "kids using AI to cheat," I'm talking about "AI taking over all teaching duties and making the job of 'teacher' equivalent to the job of 'babysitter'", and some of the last people you would expect are helping to make that happen.
I did a recent video about how several trusted educational youtubers push an agenda that tries to convince you to spend any time you have to worry about AI having you focus on the hypothetical future sci-fi danger of some hypothetical sci-fi AI that may or may not ever actually happen, and how that agenda deliberately downplays and minimizes a number of current problems that are being caused right at this moment by the generative AI that's already even inflicted upon us.
And that generative AI that we already have right now is being prepped by the big AI companies to disrupt the education market.
And there's nothing hypothetical about it, and the only thing that stands in their way is us.
And this time, it's actually not AI itself that's the real problem.
The real problem is the people you'd expect want to support education being paid to distract you from the plans to take it over, and the people cheering it on, or even just standing by and letting it happen.
Which is not good, because these days, if you've got even worse problems than AI, you are seriously fu-----
This is the Internet of Bugs.
My name is Carl.
I've been a software professional since the 1980s, and I'm trying to do my part to make the Internet a safer, more reliable, and less buggy place, which lately has been a lot of pushing back against AI.
And here's the thing, AI, and I mean, today's generative AI technology, not some future theoretical AI, can actually, unfortunately, be arguably seen as a much more "effective" and "successful" teacher than any human really can be, although that's just not because of the AI.
It's because of the way that we treat teachers and schools, and I cannot stress to you enough how bad that is, or how much I wish that wasn't true.
So I've been watching this happen for decades, like a very slow motion train wreck.
To set the stage, I grew up and went to school in Texas, and back before George W. Bush became president, he was the governor here, and under his watch, a program was created in Texas that eventually evolved into the "No Child Left Behind" program at the federal level.
The aspect of that program that's relevant to this discussion is the bit that they call "accountability," both school accountability and teacher accountability, because what "accountability" means in this context is effectively "how well students do on standardized tests," and basically nothing else.
Now, I'm speaking here from an American point of view.
I have not extensively studied education in other countries, although from what I've read, it appears that treating standardized test scores as the primary measure of education success is a much wider problem than just here in America.

### AI 的“斯金纳箱”教育模式

演讲者解释说，AI非常擅长优化其功能以最大化由简单、可重复规则设定的分数。标准化测试分数恰好符合这一特点。AI教师可以生成无限数量的标准化测试题目变体，并对每个学生进行反复测试、重测和“实验”，以优化与其互动的激励和威慑机制，所有这一切都是为了提高他们的测试分数。演讲者特意选择了“实验”一词，这凸显了这种方法的令人不安之处。

为了说明这一点，演讲者引入了**斯金纳箱**（Skinner box）的概念。斯金纳箱是一种训练设备（通常用于老鼠等啮齿动物），通过使用奖励（如食物、药物）和惩罚（如电击），可以教会动物可靠地执行几乎任何你想要它执行的行为。演讲者令人不寒而栗地指出，一个配备了AI驱动屏幕、耳机和摄像头的学生课桌，几乎可以充当一个斯金纳箱。教学AI将能够访问互联网上所有关于如何激励、奖励或与学生交流的建议列表，并能在每个学生身上循环尝试这些技术，以找出哪些方法能让孩子在标准化测试题目上表现得更好。

在无需任何技术突破的前提下，如果评判教师质量的唯一标准是学生在标准化测试中的表现，那么AI可以做到与任何人类教师一样好，甚至更好。就AI而言，它在围棋、国际象棋或蛋白质折叠等游戏中变得更强的核心机制，与它在促使学生提高测试分数方面的能力是相同的。你只需不断地调整事物，当某项改进有效时，就增加其使用频率；当某项无效时，就减少其使用频率。

这引出了一个根本性的社会问题：我们是否真的希望“在标准化测试中表现更好”成为衡量学校系统成功的标准？演讲者的答案是明确的“否”。这是一个至关重要的问题，因为一个将标准化测试作为成就终极衡量标准的世界，将是一个人类再也无法在与AI的竞争中取得优势的世界，就像在国际象棋或围棋比赛中一样，人类将无法匹敌。这显然是AI公司所期望的世界，也是他们试图说服我们所有人相信我们已经身处其中的世界。

And there are things that AI's do well, and things that AI's don't do well, and one thing that AI's are really good at is optimizing their functionality to maximize a score that's given by simple rules in such a situation that can be repeated over and over in a loop.
What a student scored on a standardized test is a really simple rule to measure, and it's a really simple to determine score, and an AI teacher could generate effectively infinite variations of standardized test questions to use his measurements, and then test, retest, and "experiment on" each student over and over to optimize what incentives and deterrence to use to interact with that student.
And when I said "experiment on" there, I chose those words very deliberately, and I very much wish I didn'
