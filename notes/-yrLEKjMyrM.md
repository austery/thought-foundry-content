### 达沃斯论坛开场与加密货币监管

**主持人**: 这家伙真的要盘旋在我们头顶了。这飞行员肯定讨厌播客。真是个混蛋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This guy is literally gonna hover over us. This pilot hates podcasting. What a prick.

</details>

**主持人**: 各位听众，我们正在**世界经济论坛**的**美国之家**进行广播。本期节目由**纽约证券交易所**赞助。如果你想改变世界并筹集资金，请选择**纽约证券交易所**。**纽约证券交易所**是一个现代化的市场，一个为规模化和长期影响力而构建的巨大平台。所以，如果你正在为未来而建设，**纽约证券交易所**就是实现梦想的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The besties are broadcasting from the **USA House** at the **World Economic Forum**. Our episode is sponsored by the **New York Stock Exchange**. Are you looking to change the world and raise capital? Do it at the **NYSC**. The **NYSE** is a modern marketplace and a massive platform built for scale and long-term impact. So, if you're building for the future, the **NYSC** is where it happens.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我是**Jason Calakanis**，这里是**All-In**访谈节目。我们临时被加到达沃斯**世界经济论坛**的名单上，有时间做了六次访谈。**Brian Armstrong**，**Coinbase**的创始人，也是我们节目的老朋友，他在这里。这大概是你第四或第五次来我们节目了。你来达沃斯不是为了社交，而是为了全球范围内的严肃监管问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I'm **Jason Calakanis**. This is the **All-In** interview show. Last minute we got added to the roster here at the **World Economic Forum**, and we had time to do a halfozen interviews and **Brian** was here, and this is your **Brian Armstrong** from **Coinbase**, of course, and friend of the pod. This is probably your fourth or fifth appearance on the pod. You come to Davos because this actually isn't for you about networking. This is about serious regulations on a global basis. Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯，这次来达沃斯的主要目的就是推动加密货币的市场结构立法。但实际上，这里也有很多社交活动。我们进行了很多商业会谈。全球前20大银行中，有五家正在使用**Coinbase**将其加密基础设施整合到他们的产品中。我们还会见了不同国家的领导人，与他们讨论经济自由以及加密货币如何更新他们的金融系统。所以，这里有很多有益的会议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Well, that's been the focus of this attendance at Davos is we are trying to get market structure legislation done for crypto. But actually there I mean there is a lot of networking that happens here. We've done a lot of commercial meetings. Five of the top 20 global banks are now using **Coinbase** to build their crypto infrastructure into their products. We meet with heads of leaders of different countries and talk to them about economic freedom and how crypto can update their financial system. So there's all kinds of good meetings.

</details>

### 银行合作与监管环境变化

**Jason Calakanis**: 你提到了与银行的合作关系。这是一种白标（white label）合作吗，这样他们就可以向客户销售加密货币？哪些银行正在这样做，具体如何运作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: So you had embedded in there these partnerships with banks. Is that like a white label type thing so they can sell crypto to their customers? Is it disclosed which banks are doing that and how that works?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 其中有几家是公开的。我们已经谈论过与**摩根大通**（**JP Morgan**）和**PNC银行**的整合。还有几家尚未公开，但全球前20大银行中，有五家正在为此使用**Coinbase**。此外，我们还在为**贝莱德**（**BlackRock**）等公司提供整合支持，他们表示希望将其所有基金都代币化。因此，很多金融机构都在链上发展，这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: A couple of them are public. We've talked about integration with **JP Morgan**, **PNC Bank**. There's a couple others that are not public yet, but five of the top 20 gibs are now using **Coinbase** for that. And then we're also powering integrations with like **BlackRock** and they've said they want to tokenize every single one of their funds. And so, a lot of these financial institutions are coming on chain, which is great.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这很了不起。我来这里的路上还在想，过去十年你一直在努力与监管机构合作。我记得在**拜登政府**时期，你去了华盛顿特区，说：“我来了，我很乐意与你们交流。”但他们却说：“我们不想和你谈。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And this is quite I mean, I was thinking on the way over here how you've really struggled to work with regulators over the last decade. I remember under the **Biden administration**, the 46th administration, you went to DC and were like, "I'm here. I would love to talk to you." And they were like, "Yeah, we don't want to talk to you."

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 有些人可能对我们的第47任总统**唐纳德·J·特朗普**（**Donald J. Trump**）有不同的看法。但他有一点做得非常出色，那就是与商界打交道，并非常认真地对待加密货币的监管和法律途径。过去一年情况如何？对你来说，过去一年发生了哪些变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Now, some people might have varying feelings about **Donald J. Trump**, our 47th president. But one thing he has nailed is interfacing with the business community and taking regulation and creating a legal path for crypto specifically very seriously. What's the how's the last year? How have the how have things changed for you in the last year?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我知道你喜欢客观评价。我认为客观来看，**拜登政府**在我看来确实试图非法扼杀美国的这个行业。而**唐纳德·J·特朗普**，你必须给他点赞。他竞选时就提出了将美国打造成世界加密货币之都的想法，他信守了诺言。他积极推动通过明确的规则和法规，让美国公司能够蓬勃发展，让美国消费者能够从他们的资金中赚取更多收益。他也明白这是一个重要的政治议题。现在有大约5200万美国人使用过加密货币，他们希望看到明确的规则，希望美国能有更好的金融服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Well, I know you like to call balls and strikes and I think just looking at it objectively, the **Biden administration** really tried to unlawfully kill this industry in America from my point of view. And **Donald J. Trump**, you got to give him credit. I mean, he campaigned on this idea of making the United States the crypto capital of the world. He's kept his promises. He's leaned in and tried to get clear rules and regulations passed so that American companies can thrive, American consumers can earn more money on their money. And he understands also it's an important political issue. There's a huge base of there's like 52 million Americans who've used crypto now, right? And they want to see clear rules. They want to see this, you know, get better financial services in the United States.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 坦率地说，这也是一个全球竞争力问题。中国刚刚宣布将对其央行数字货币支付利息。一些最大的稳定币发行方仍在海外。他希望将这些资本遣返并带回美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It's also, frankly, a global competitiveness issue, right? China just announced that they're going to pay interest on their central bank digital currency. Some of the largest stable coin issuers are still offshore. He wants to repatriate that capital and bring it into the US.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这就是我们经历的疯狂之处。我从来都不喜欢那些不合规的行为，但更不喜欢前一届政府根本不与我们见面，也不说：“嘿，这确实与众不同，让我们想办法给你一条正确行事的道路。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: This is the crazy thing we went through. I was never a fan calling balls and strikes of people doing things that weren't buttoned up. But I was even less of a fan of the prior administration just not meeting and saying, "Hey, this is uniquely different. Let's figure out a way to give you a path to do it properly. And so,"

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 在我们的行业中，有时你必须重新解释规则。**Airbnb**、**Uber**，我投资生涯中最成功的案例，它们也曾“弯曲”规则。加密货币也“弯曲”了一些规则。有些情况下，人们违反了规则，也付出了代价。但现在，规则集正在完善。我认为对你来说最重要的是稳定币以及你与银行的竞争。你与银行是合作伙伴，但你也是它们的竞争对手，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: In our industry, sometimes you have to reinterpret rules. **Airbnb**, **Uber**, the biggest success of my investment career, they bent rules too. Crypto bent some rules. Some cases people broke them and they paid the price. But here we are now the rule set is being refined. The most important one I think for you is stable coins and your competition with the bank. You have banks as partners, but you're also a competitor to them. Yeah.

</details>

### 稳定币与银行的合作与竞争

**Brian Armstrong**: 我会说这主要是合作关系。我在这里遇到的银行CEO中，大多数实际上都非常看好加密货币。他们正在开始整合它。我昨天会见了全球前十大银行之一的CEO，他告诉我：“加密货币是我的首要任务。我们认为这事关存亡。我们全力以赴。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Well, I'd say it's mostly collaborative. I'd say the of the bank CEOs that I've met with here, most of them are actually very into crypto. They're starting to integrate it. I met with one of the top 10 global banks in the world yesterday and the CEO told me, "**Crypto** is my number one priority. We view that this is existential. We're all in. We're going to put all"

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 为什么这对他们来说是生死攸关的？你认为他们看到了什么？这就像互联网出现时，**亚马逊**与**巴诺书店**（**Barnes & Noble**）竞争，或者博客与印刷版的《**纽约时报**》竞争一样，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Why is it existential for them? What do you think? They're seeing it's like it's like when the internet came around, you know, and you had **Amazon** competing with **Barnes & Noble** or you had blogs competing with not **New York Times** like in print, right? Yes.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，世界总是在变化，你可以将其视为机遇，也可以视为威胁，然后把头埋在沙子里假装它没有发生。但现实是，加密货币规模巨大，全球约有5亿人使用过它。**比特币**是过去十年表现最好的资产类别。全球最大的金融机构现在正在整合它。所以，在这一点上，我认为假装这一切没有发生是愚蠢的。顺便说一句，我们还有**Genius法案**，稳定币法案现在已经通过成为法律。我们不会推翻它，那是国家法律。国会刚刚将其写入法律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And so anytime there's always change happening in the world and you can think of it as an opportunity or you can think of it as a threat and bury your head in the sand and pretend it's not happening. But the reality is that crypto is massive like something like 500 million people have used it globally. **Bitcoin** was the best performing asset class of the last decade. The largest financial institutions of the world are now integrating this. And so at this point, I don't I think it's foolish to pretend that this isn't happening. And we also, by the way, have the **Genius Act**, the stablecoin bill is now passed into law. So we're not going to undo that. That is that is law of the land. Like Congress just put that into law.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这非常重要，因为**David Saxs**，我的好朋友，我认为他主导了这些稳定币必须经过审计，必须透明。我们不能让稳定币出现挤兑，毕竟人们曾预计**Tether**在某个时候会发生挤兑。他们收到了很多罚款。当时有很多证明文件，人们不知道他们是否有足够的资源。现在很清楚，你必须将资产存放在国库券中。对，没错。根据去年通过的**Genius法案**，美国受监管的稳定币必须将100%的资产存放在短期美国国库券中。所以，我认为是30天左右。我相信最长是30天国库券。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And it's very important because **David Saxs**, my bestie, I think led there was these have to be audited. These have to be above board. We can't have a run on stable coins, which let's face it, people anticipated **Tether** would have at some point. There were lots of fines they got. There was these attestations people didn't know if they even had the resources they had. And now it's pretty clear you have to keep your assets in treasuries. Correct. That's correct. Under the **Genius Act** that got passed into law last year, US regulated stable coins have to have 100% of the assets stored in short-term US treasuries. So I something like 30 days. 30-day treasuries are the max I believe.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 所以，那几乎是你所能得到的最安全的东西。你基本上是在相信美国政府在30天内不会破产，我认为这是一个相当安全的赌注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: So that's pretty much the safest thing you can get. You know, you're basically trusting the United States government is not going to fail in 30 days, which I think is a pretty safe bet.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我会选择安全赌注。是的。而且，我一直在强调这一点，银行会进行所谓的**部分准备金贷款**。它们实际上并没有把你的所有钱都存起来，而是把钱贷出去了。这就是为什么它们有如此高的监管成本，因为可能会发生银行挤兑，这给了它们一个非常独特的商业模式。它们基本上可以把钱贷出去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I'm going to go safe bet. Yeah. And, you know, I've been making this point as well that, you know, banks do something called fractional reserve lending. They actually don't store all your money there. They're lending it out. That's why they have such high regulatory overhead because there can be a run on the bank and it gives them a very unique business model. They can basically lend it out.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 那个老笑话是，你以6%的利率贷出去，支付3%的利息，然后下午3点去喝茶。但是，除非你有银行执照，否则你无法使用那种商业模式。但在一个拥有100%储备的稳定币世界里，你不需要银行执照，而且你可以给人们提供。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: You know the the old joke is like you lend it out at 6% you pay three and you're on the you know the tea time by 3:00 or whatever. But that business model is not available to you unless you have a business a bank license. But in a stable coin world with 100% reserves, you don't need a bank license for that and and you can give people

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 因为它更安全，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Because it's safer, right?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我们看到**硅谷银行**（**Silicon Valley Bank**）基本上是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And we saw this **Silicon Valley Bank** essentially

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 他们的国库券配置时机不对。结果呢？他们发生了银行挤兑。我当时正在开董事会会议，我记得那是一个星期四，挤兑就发生在星期四下午。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Had mistimed their allocations with treasuries, I guess. And what happened? They had a run on the bank. Literally, I was in a board meeting and in the board meeting on I think it was like a Thursday and the run happened Thursday afternoon.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我收到一条短信，说把你的钱从**硅谷银行**取出来。我正在开董事会会议，议程上的第三件事就是讨论**硅谷银行**，我们100%的钱都在那里。两位董事会成员说：“我们不能把所有钱都从**硅谷银行**取出来。他们是30年来我们难以置信的合作伙伴。”我说：“那我们取出一半，这样我们就能支付工资了。”我坚持这么做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I get a text like get your money out of **Silicon Valley Bank**. I'm in the board meeting. We're having it's on the docket like the third thing is to talk about **Silicon Valley Bank** and we're have 100% of our money in there. Two of the board members are like we can't just take all the money out of **Silicon Valley**. They've been incredible partners for 30 years. I said how about we take out half so we can make payroll. I insisted.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，就在那天晚上，砰！所以现在关键问题是你的商业模式。你需要有收入，而这些稳定币的收入是支付一些利息，让那些把钱存进去的人能够从他们辛苦赚来的资本中获得一些利息。是的，这是你的症结所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. Literally that night, boom. And so the key issue now is your business model. You you need to have revenue and the revenue from these stable coins is paying some interest and the people who are putting their money in there being able to make some interest on their hard-earned capital. Yeah, that's the sticking point for you.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，这不是利息，而是一个奖励计划。这是在**Genius法案**中精心谈判达成的。是的，这就是我们的观点。我的意思是，在我看来，它实际上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. And it's not interest, it's a rewards program. This was carefully negotiated in the **Genius Act**. And yes, that's that's our view. I mean, look, in my opinion, it's actually

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 有什么区别？奖励计划，我们应该把它看作是**美国运通**（**American Express**）积分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: What's the difference there? What what the reward program, we should think of it like **American Express** points.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，有很多信用卡奖励计划，但法律上的区别在于，奖励不能仅仅基于你持有的余额。客户必须进行某种其他活动，比如支付或交易，或者他们订阅了**Coinbase One**。所以，当客户这样做时，我们实际上会将大约100%的经济收益传递给他们，以奖励他们与我们持有这些稳定币。这是增长的一个重要驱动力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. I mean, there's lots credit card reward programs, but the difference legally is that rewards can't be based solely on the balance you're holding. The customer has to do some sort of other activity like payments or trading or they have a subscription to **Coinbase 1**. So, when customers do that, we actually pass along about 100% of the economics to them for holding those stable coins with us. And that's a big driver of growth.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 现在，你知道，货币市场和银行存款之间一直存在这种平衡。我认为加密货币在这方面并不是真正的新事物。它只是这种现象的另一种形式。而且，很多人一直在担心，这会摧毁整个贷款市场。我不认为这是真的。货币市场已经有数万亿美元的规模，而且还有高收益支票账户。但这些银行不必应对一个颠覆性的竞争对手，一个在他们所做的事情上非常出色的技术竞争对手。所以，他们对自己的特许经营权有点紧张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Now, you know, there's always been this balance between do people want to put their money in money markets or do they want to put it as bank deposits. I think that that is not this crypto is not really new in that dimension. Like it's just another flavor of this happening. And there's been a lot of hand ringing about, you know, this is going to destroy all the lending market. And like I don't think that's true. Like money markets are already trillions of dollars and there's high depos high yield checking accounts. But these banks haven't had to deal with a disruptive competitor, a technology competitor who's really good at what they're doing. So, they're a little bit nervous about their franchise. Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这是我的解读。我说的对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Is my interpretation. Am I correct?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 有些银行确实紧张，有些则将其视为机遇。我认为后者更好，我们希望每个人都能在这里获胜。我认为，嗯，我不能代表总统发言，但根据我对他的言论的理解，他希望所有美国企业都能获胜。这里有一个双赢的结果。但是，如果有人试图破坏他在**Genius法案**中刚刚通过的立法，他可能会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Some of again, some of them are nervous, some of them are leaning into it as an opportunity. I think the latter we want everyone to win here. I think that's what, I don't speak for the president, but like my interpretation of his comments is that he wants all American businesses to win. There there is a win-win outcome here. But if someone, you know, is going to try to undermine his legislation that just got passed in **Genius**, he'd probably

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 现在正在发生这种事吗？银行正试图重新谈判这笔交易？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Is that what's happening now? The banks are trying to retrade the deal.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我不想，我的意思是，这里要小心。我认为银行行业协会正在试图推翻**Genius法案**。它才刚刚在四个月前通过成为法律。对我们来说，这是一条红线。我与业内许多其他人谈过，对他们来说，这也是一条红线。我认为我们必须接受那是法律，并且它将继续存在。但这并不意味着银行和加密公司不能在这个新世界中共同获胜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I, you know, I don't want to like I mean, be careful here. I There's the bank trade groups which I believe are trying to undo the **Genius Act**. It just got passed into law 4 months ago. And for us, that's a red line. I've talked to many others in the industry that for them that's a red line. I think we have to accept that that's law and that's going to continue to exist. But that doesn't mean banks and crypto companies can both win in this new world.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，这只是一个经典的关于现有企业的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. So this is just a classic tale of incumbents.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，现有企业和新来者，你希望与他们合作。你希望促成它？你与**Jeremy Lair**，我在**Circle**的老朋友，有很好的合作关系。他们是**Coinbase**的默认稳定币吗？或者你如何看待与他们的关系？我们应该如何看待与他们的关系？是的，我们与**Circle**有很强的合作关系，而**USDC**是最大的受监管稳定币，因为它在美国符合**Genius法案**，在欧洲符合**Mika**等法规。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Incumbents and and new folks and you want to partner with them. You want to enable it? You have a good partnership with **Jeremy Lair**, old friend of mine at **Circle**. Are they like the default stable coin in **Coinbase** or how do you think about the relationship with them? How should we think about the relationship with them? Yes, we've got a strong relationship with **Circle** and **USDC** is the largest regulated stable coin because it is compliant under **Genius** in the US. They're compliant under **Mika** in Europe, etc., etc.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯，你知道，还有一个你熟悉的，它仍然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Um, you know, there's another one that you're familiar with which is still,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 但我认为它正在被。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: But I think it's in the process of being

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我的理解是他们正在努力清理它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: They're trying to clean it up is my understanding.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这样他们就可以参与进来。很可能的情况是会有两种**Tether**，一种是符合美国法规的，另一种是美国以外的“狂野西部”版本。你也是这么听说的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: So that they can participate. The likely scenario is there'll be two tethers, a United States one and then that complies and then there'll be the Wild West one outside the US. Is that what you've heard as well?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。我应该提一下，我们与**Circle**并没有独家合作之类的。我们实际上在我们的平台上列出了其他稳定币。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. And I should mention we don't have like an exclusive with **Circle** or anything like that. We we actually list other stable coins on our platform.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你有列出**Tether**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Do you list **Tether**?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我们在某些方面支持它。你知道，特别是那些想要转换**Tether**的人，但我们支持它。我们也支持**PayPal**稳定币。我们也乐于列出其他稳定币。所以，我们对**USDC**没有独家合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: We support it in certain ways. Especially people who want to convert **Tether**, but we we support it. We also support **PayPal** stable coin. We're open to listing others, too. So, we we don't have an exclusive on **USDC**.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，但你并没有认可它。你允许人们交易**Tether**，还是只允许他们卖出**Tether**？它在机制上是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. But you're not endorsing it. And do you let people trade into **Tether** or just let them trade out of **Tether**? Like, how does it work mechanically?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我认为在不同的国家有所不同。我想确保我说的完全正确。但在我们被允许这样做的国家，我的意思是，我们支持**Tether**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I think it's different in different countries. I want to make sure I get it exactly right. But in countries where we're allowed to do it, I mean, we support **Tether**,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Right?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 这很微妙。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It's it's nuanced.

</details>

### 稳定币风险与平台责任

**Jason Calakanis**: 你是否担心，或者历史上是否一直担心**Tether**及其在监管和交易方面有点“散漫”的做法？我用这个词来形容，而不是你。但我会认为，在你的平台上拥有它，而监管机构在过去5到10年里一直非常关注它，并且存在这种信念，认为它可能会崩溃并引发挤兑，对你来说，这不值得冒太大的风险，不值得与它走得太近，以防它真的翻车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Are you concerned about or have you been historically concerned about **Tether** and like their little bit of a loosey goosey approach to regulations and trading? I'm giving it that descriptor, not you. But I I would think having it on your platform with regulators pretty focused on it over the last 5 or 10 years and this, you know, belief that this thing could all come apart and create a run that to you is just not worth the risk to to be too close to it in case it does flip over. Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我们确实收到了很多关于它的问题。听着，我在这里要小心。我实际上很喜欢**Tether**的那些人。我认为他们在世界上做了很多好事。有些人确实在与本地货币作斗争，这些货币每年有70%到100%的通货膨胀。因此，对美元的需求很高。他们在许多新兴市场拥有很好的分销渠道。我实际上认为他们为世界做了很多好事。

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. We we've definitely gotten questions on it. And look, I I want to be careful here. I actually like the **Tether** guys. I think they've done a lot of good things in the world. There's people who really are they're struggling with local currencies that are have like 70 100% inflation year-over-year. And so there was high demand for the dollar. They got great distribution in a lot of the emerging markets. I actually think they've done a lot of good for the world.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 但是的，它目前不符合美国**Genius法案**的规定。所以，据我所知，它不遵循相同的100%储备和短期美国国库券的规定。所以人们必须自己做出判断。我认为其他国家也在效仿，清理这个问题。现在加密货币中是否有办法提供一种客观的评级，让消费者可以说这个有这个等级？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: But yeah, it's not currently compliant under the **Genius Act** in the US. And so it doesn't follow those same 100% reserves and short-term US treasuries is my understanding. So people have to make their own determination on that. And I think other countries are following suit in terms of cleaning this up. Is there in crypto now a way to give a rating that is sort of objective for consumers to say like this one has this grade?

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Mhm.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 并且遵循这些规定。嘿，这个遵循这个级别，它的等级较低，而这个不遵循，它是一个迷因币。随便什么。这是狂野西部。就像赌场里不能哭的硬币一样。作为一个平台，你的责任或机会是什么，来告知那些参与者？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And follows these regulations. Hey, this one is follows this level. It's a lower grade and this one doesn't follow and it's you know it's a memecoin. Whatever. This is the wild west. Like no crying in the casino coins. Like what what is your responsibility as a platform or opportunity as a platform to like inform the people who are participating?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我们努力做的就是制定最低上市标准。所以，如果我们认为存在网络安全风险，或者开发者可能会“跑路”，或者从合规角度来看是非法的。你知道，我们关注几个不同的领域。所以，如果它符合最低标准，我们就会将其上市，然后让客户自己决定。我不认为我们的工作是推荐投资。你知道，就像在传统金融世界中，有这些AAA级债券。我总觉得那些进行评级的组织总是有点政治化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So what we try to do is have minimum listing standards. So if we believe that there's a cyber security risk to it, the developer could rug everyone or if if it's really it's illegal from a compliance point of view. You know there's a few different areas we look at. So if it meets the minimum bar, we will list it and then we let customers decide it. I don't feel like it's our job to be recommending investments, you know, like in the traditional financial world, there's like these AAA rated bonds and, and I it always felt a little bit like those organizations that do the ratings are kind of always be politicized and like

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 去看《**大空头**》（**The Big Short**）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Go see **the big short**.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，没错。所以我不，我把它看作有点像应用商店，对吧？我的意思是，你或者亚马逊。我的意思是，你想要一个“万物交易所”。你想要一个“万物商店”。你知道，所有合法的东西都应该在商店里，但也许我们可以在某个时候添加客户评论。我们实际上尝试过一段时间。如果你在**亚马逊**上看到一个两星评级的东西，你仍然可以购买它，但至少你被告知了。我们曾经尝试过用户评级，但效果不佳，因为人们基本上是根据自己的喜好投票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah, exactly. So I don't it's I think of it a little bit like the app stores, right? I mean you or the or let's say **Amazon**. I mean, you want to have the everything exchange. You want to have the everything store. You know, everything that's legal should be in the store, but maybe there's customer reviews we we could add at some point. We actually tried that for a little bit. Like if you see a two out of five star thing on **Amazon**, you can still buy it, but it's kind of at least you're informed. We we tried making user ratings at one point. It didn't go that well cuz people were basically voting with their whatever they like, you know.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 当然，他们都在自卖自夸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Sure. They're talking their book.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，自卖自夸。所以，无论如何，我们现在处于只进行披露和最低上市标准的制度下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Talking their book. So, anyway, we we right now we're in the regime of just disclosures and minimum listing standards.

</details>

### 加密货币三大趋势

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。你现在觉得哪些加密项目最吸引人？像**Bit Tensor**这样的项目，一些正在涌现的，它们实际上正在为问题提供技术解决方案，分布式计算等等。我觉得那些很吸引人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. Which crypto projects do you find the most fascinating right now? The **Bit Tensor** one, some of these ones that are popping up that are actually providing technological solutions to problems, distributed computing, etc. You I find those fascinating.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 它们确实如此。我的意思是，人们正在尝试将数据中心和石油储备代币化。我认为目前加密货币领域最大的趋势是：第一，它是一个“万物交易所”。所以它不仅仅是加密货币，你还可以交易股票，你知道，股票越来越接近于能够在链上交易。预测市场正在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: They are. I mean, people are trying to tokenize data centers and like oil reserves. I think I think the biggest trends happening in crypto right now is number one it's the everything exchange. So it's not just crypto you can trade, you're getting equities you know are increasingly getting closer to being able to trade onchain, you know, prediction markets are

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你有这方面的合作伙伴，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: You have a partner for that right?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我们目前正在与**KI**合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah we're working with **KI** currently

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 那是独家的吗？还是你愿意让任何人参与？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Is that exclusive or are you willing to put anybody up on the thing?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 不是独家的，所以我们也在关注其他公司。我知道你们节目也和**Poly Market**合作。我的意思是，我是**Robin Hood**的原始天使投资人之一，我认为他们也在做**Kelsey**。似乎人们正在接入不同的公司。**Poly Market**是我们的最爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It's not exclusive so we're looking at others as well I know you guys work with **Poly Market** or whatever on the show. I mean, I'm a I was one of the original angel investors in **Robin Hood** and I think they're doing **Kelsey**, too. It seems like people are plugging different ones in. **Poly Market**'s our favorite.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我们正在与**Poly Market**洽谈，但我们也可以列出我们自己的预测市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. We So, we're talking to **Poly Market**, but you know, we can also list our own prediction markets.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 哦，是的。所以你可以自己启动一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Oh, yeah. So, you could fire up your own.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以，无论如何，我认为最大的趋势是所有资产都将上链进行交易。预测市场正在疯狂增长，稳定币支付也在疯狂增长。这些可能是目前加密货币领域的三大趋势。你认为稳定币何时会进入企业支付领域？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So, anyway, we're along I think that Yeah, the biggest trends are all assets are coming on chain for trading. Prediction markets are growing like crazy and stable coin payments are growing like crazy. Those are the probably the three biggest trends in crypto right now. When do you think stable coins tip into the area of businesses

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 这是一个两部分的问题：企业使用它进行支付？你知道，也许是为了减少摩擦。比如，某个设计师为**Coinbase**做了一些工作，设计了一个新标志，你想给他们寄25000美元。这通过稳定币完成。这何时会开始发生？然后对于消费者来说，人们何时会在扑克游戏中通过他们的**Coinbase**账户用稳定币结算？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Two-part question businesses using it for payments? You know, maybe to reduce friction. You know, some designer does some work for **Coinbase** and makes sure a new logo and you want to send them $25,000. It goes through a stable coin. When does that start to happen? And then for consumers, when do people at a poker game start settling up with, you know, through their **Coinbase** account with a stable coin?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以过去一年最大的增长领域是B2B跨境支付和跨境业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So the biggest growth area over the last year has been B2B crossber payments and crossboarder.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，跨境支付尤其如此，因为有很多公司，你知道，他们可能从亚洲或欧洲购买商品，试图在巴西的商店出售，或者其他任何地方，他们必须等待7天，而且有很高的外汇费用，以及所有这些移动资金的费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. Cross border especially because there's a lot of these companies you know they might be buying goods from Asia or Europe trying to sell it in their shop in Brazil or whatever it is and they have to wait 7 days and there's high FX fees and all this kind of stuff to move

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 费用太高了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Crazy the fees.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以这增长得非常好。我们推出了一个名为**Coinbase Business**的产品，它服务于许多中小型公司，这些公司希望进行跨境支付、开具发票、税务和会计等所有这些业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So that's been growing really nicely. You know we we launched a product called **Coinbase Business** which is serving lots of small and mediumsized companies who want to do crossber payments and invoicing and tax and accounting and all that.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你是如何找到这些客户的？我的意思是，那是一个非常独特的群体，还是他们自己找上门来的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: How do you find those customers? You I mean that that's like a real unique group of people or do they just find you?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 目前他们正在主动找上门来。我们实际上有大量的积压工作，很多人在等待入驻。所以我们需要扩充那个团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Currently they're beating a path to our door. We we actually have a huge backlog we need to people waiting to onboard. So we need to staff up that team.

</details>

### 资产代币化与财富民主化

**Brian Armstrong**: 我们还推出了一个名为**Coinbase开发者平台**的产品，它提供了一种类似**AWS**的服务。所以你可以像银行那样进行白标，但许多其他企业也正在使用它进行钱包、交易、支付、质押、融资等各种操作。你提到了代币化。我当时正在和**Vlad**谈话。他做了一个小实验。他说：“嘿，我为什么不把一些**OpenAI**的股份代币化呢？”**Sam Altman**对此并不太高兴。你如何看待这个机会？我是一个私人市场投资者。我很乐意能够将我在**Robin Hood**或**Uber**的早期头寸在它们上涨时放到市场上，让人们进行交易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: We also launched something called **Coinbase developer platform** which provides it's kind of like **AWS** if you want. So that's like you can white label anything like with the banks but lots of other businesses are using that for wallets, trading, payments, staking, financing, all kinds of things. You mentioned tokenization. I was talking with **Vlad**. He did a little experiment. Hey, why don't I tokenize some **OpenAI** shares? **Sam** wasn't **Sam Altman** wasn't too thrilled with that. How do you think about that opportunity? I'm a private market investor. I would love to be able to take my early position in **Robin Hood** or my early position in **Uber** as it was going up and put it into a market and let people trade it.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 那对风险投资家、天使投资人来说会非常有趣，能够灵活地转移这些资产。你对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: That would be very interesting to for VCs for you know angel investors to be able to move that around. How do you think about it?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我认为这必须在公司允许的情况下进行，因为如果你是一家私人公司，你不会希望你的员工在一年后就能变现。你想要的是留存机制，对吧？让我们一起建设，也许当我们上市的时候。因为有一些创始人的故事，他们过早地进行了二次出售，然后公司没有成功，结果很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Well, I think it has to be done with the permission of the companies cuz you know if you're if you're a private company you don't want your employees to be able to get liquid after one year. You're trying, you know, that's why you have vesting. That's why it's it's a retention mechanism, right? Let's all build this together and like maybe when we go public because there are stories of founders who like took a little secondary too early, then the company didn't didn't work out and it's, you know, bad off.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 所以，我认为在加密货币的私人市场中会发生的是，首先，我们应该让链上资本形成对私人公司来说更容易。所以，如果你想。这就是我们正在与**SEC**和其他机构讨论的问题，比如，你能不能注册一个证券？目前，在美国你只能从合格投资者那里筹集资金。我知道你和我都同意这一点，我们希望扩大成为合格投资者的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: So, I think what's going to happen in in crypto is that in the private markets like first of all, we should make onchain capital formation way easier for private companies. So, if you want to go this is this is what we're chatting with the **SEC** about and others is like, you know, can you go register a security? Right now you'd only be able to raise money from credit investors in the US. I know you you and I agree on this like we'd like to expand how you can become an accredited investor.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 现在有一项法案正在推进，它基本上意味着**SEC**，他们已经被指派做这件事，但他们，我不知道你是否研究过**SEC**，他们倾向于慢慢来，然后不按要求行事。而这正是他们应该做的事情之一，就是创建一个认证测试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And there is a bill right now that's working its way and it would basically mean the **SEC** and and they've already been charged with this, but they they I don't know if you've studied the **SEC** at all. They tend to take their time and then not do what they've been told to do. And that was one of the things they were supposed to do is create an accreditation test.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯，我会说这个**SEC**实际上行动非常迅速。但这个，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Uh, well, this I say this **SEC** is actually moving very quickly. But this one is Yes.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。我认为那会是一个更公平的方式，因为否则它有点像累退税，只有富人才能通过私人投资变得更富有。但无论如何，我认为链上资本形成对私人公司来说将是巨大的。我认为最终，你实际上将能够完全在链上上市。而且，是的，这些市场只会变得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. But yeah, I think that would be a more fair way because otherwise it's kind of like a regressive tax like only rich people can get richer on private investments. But anyway, I think onchain capital formation is going to be massive for private companies. I think eventually like you'll actually just be able to go public totally onchain too. And yeah, these markets are just going to get

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这将大大降低成本，减少摩擦，并增加财富创造的民主化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Would lower the cost massively, reduce the friction and increase the democratization of wealth creation.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 如果你回想你还是一家私人公司的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: If you think about when you were a private company.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Mhm.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你有所有这些被压抑的需求，人们疯狂地想买股票。他们都在做一些幕后、有点 shady 的事情，冒出各种SPV。我不知道你有没有关注现在的SPV市场，但它已经变成了一个“锅炉房”。不再是**Chris Saka**代表**Twitter**，做一些有秩序的事情，或者**Elon**每六个月做一次有秩序的事情，让**SpaceX**保持控制。现在人们出去从牙医、普通民众、高净值个人那里筹集资金，去购买**SpaceX**或**Anduril**或其他任何公司的股份，然后他们去找股票，向他们收取10%的加载费，没有附带权益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Like you had all this pent-up demand, people trying to buy the shares like crazy. They were all doing backdoor kind of shady stuff, popping up SPVS. I don't know if you've been following the SPV market now, but there's like it's turned into a boiler room. It's no longer **Chris Saka** representing **Twitter** and you know doing an orderly thing or **Elon** doing every six months an orderly thing where **SpaceX** keeps control of it. Now people are going out raising money from dentists and civilians high net worth individuals to buy **SpaceX** or **Anduril** or whatever it is and then they go try to find the shares and they charge them 10% loadin fee no carry.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Mhm.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我的意思是，想想这有多疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I mean think about how crazy that is.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，对一些大型私人公司的需求非常高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. There's such high demand for some of these large private companies and

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 这有点像更高监管有时会带来意想不到的后果的一个好例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: You know it's kind of a good example of like the unintended consequences of higher regulation sometimes.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 就像**萨班斯-奥克斯利法案**（**Sarbain Oxley**）之类的东西，确实减少了公司在上市前保持私有状态的时间。然后，是的，我的意思是**Uber**和**Airbnb**以及很多这样的公司，所有的钱都是由私人投资者或合格投资者赚走的，比如你自己，然后当它们最终上市时，情况就有点不顺了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Like, you know, **Sarbain Oxley** and all that kind of stuff really cut down the number of how how long companies stayed private before they went public and then yeah I mean **Uber** and **Airbnb** and a lot of these things like they all the money was made by private investor or credit investors like you know yourself and then when they went finally went public it kind of went sideways.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 哦，是的。**Airbnb**、**Uber**，它们都经历了大约五年的“消化不良期”，我想说，你知道，而且，我认为**Instacart**上市时从300亿美元跌到了100亿美元，这就像是，好吧，我们必须从一个坑里爬出来，最后一批投资者。这就是这种意想不到的后果，因为没有人以合理的方式为公司设定一个合适的估值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Oh yeah. **Airbnb**, **Uber**, they all had like a 5-year indigestion period, I would say, you know, and it it and some people, I think **Instacart** wound up going from 30 billion down to 10 billion when they went public and it was like, okay, we got to dig out of a hole the last series of investors. And that is the unintended consequence of this because you don't have anybody setting a proper valuation for the company in some reasonable way.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 基金呢？你知道，很多海外的人会来找我，说：“嘿，拿你的下一笔种子基金。你打算做5000万美元的基金。把它放到链上。”然后，嘿，如果我是你的有限合伙人（LP），我说：“哦，我需要流动性。我可以把它卖给别人。”或者如果我是**红杉基金**（**Sequoia fund**）的有限合伙人，我想把权益卖给你，你可以替我买下来，我们就可以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: What about funds? You know, I get approached by a lot of people offshore, etc., hey, take your next seed fund. You're going to do a $50 million fund. To put it on the chain. And then, hey, if you were one of my LPs and you were like, "Oh, I need liquidity. I could just sell it to somebody else or if I was an LP in a **Sequoia fund** and I wanted to sell you the interest, you could buy it for me and we could just"

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 拿出我们的钱包，刷刷刷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Take our wallets out and zip zip.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我认为这绝对会发生。我的意思是，**Coinbase**实际上推出了一款名为**Coinbase Tokenize**的产品。所以，我们正在帮助任何基金、房地产项目或任何想要将其产品代币化的人。它只是民主化了访问权限。它增加了需求。它消除了大量的后台费用，消除了结算风险，因为它可以在链上即时结算。而且有一些非常创新的公司。我的意思是，像**贝莱德**（**BlackRock**）、**阿波罗**（**Apollo**）这样的世界顶级基金都公开表示，他们希望将其所有产品都代币化。这绝对正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah, I think that's that's absolutely going to happen. I mean, **Coinbase** launched a product actually called **Coinbase Tokenize**. So, we're helping any fund or real estate project or anybody who wants to tokenize their products and it just democratizes access. It increases demand. It gets rid of a lot of the back back office fees, gets rid of the settlement risk because it can be settled instantly on chain and there's some very innovative company. I mean like **BlackRock**, **Apollo**, like these the top funds in the world are putting they they've come out publicly and said they want to tokenize every single one of their products. It's it's absolutely happening.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 他们如何保持控制？因为你有了这种更强的流动性，这会导致下游效应、二阶效应、三阶效应。如果一个风险投资基金或房地产投资信托基金（REIT）在链上，会发生哪些三阶、二阶效应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: How do they keep control of it? Because you have this more liquid back to consequences or this would be downstream effects, second order effects, third order effects. What are the third second and third order effects that would happen if a venture fund or a REIT were onchain?

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你考虑过这个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Have you thought that through?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 你考虑过吗？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Have you thought it through? Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我的意思是，有不同类型的基金。有些基金只对机构合格投资者开放。有些则对散户开放。所以，对于散户方面，我的意思是，你实际上可以在五分钟内让全球数千万人参与进来，平均价格可能是100美元或1000美元，对吧？所以它开始真正民主化了访问权限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. I mean there so there's different types of funds. Some are going to be only available to institutions accredited. Some would be open to retail and so for the retail side I mean you could actually get I don't know like tens of millions of people around the world in five minutes to all put in in the average price might be $100 or $1,000, right? So it starts to really democratize access.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我的意思是，我们最近发布了这份报告，人们听说过“无银行账户者”，但实际上还有40亿成年人是“无经纪账户者”，这意味着他们没有任何能力投资这些高质量资产。所以，这就像是我们这些资本家的财富创造引擎。很多人只是被困住了。他们唯一能赚钱的方式就是通过劳动，对吧？他们可能想投入，即使他们有100美元或1000美元，他们可能想把其中10%投入到**S&P 500**、**Coinbase**股票或**英伟达**（**Nvidia**）等任何东西中。但他们做不到，因为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I mean, we actually just published this this report recently and people have heard about the unbanked, but there's actually 4 billion adults who are unbrokered as well, which means they don't have any ability to invest in these highquality assets. So, it's like this is the engine of wealth creation for capitalists, you know, like you and I. A lot of people are just stuck. The only way they can earn is from their labor, right? And they they want to probably put like even if they're they have $100 or $1,000, they might want to put 10% of that into the **S&P 500** or **Coinbase** stock or whatever, **Nvidia**, whatever. And they can't do that because

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 但他们可以使用**PrizePicks**。他们可以使用其他东西。不，我喜欢**PrizePicks**。我用**PrizePicks**来赌**尼克斯队**的连赢。但他们最终会把钱投到别的地方，为什么不能呢？你知道，如果他们想赌**尼克斯队**，那没问题。或者去拉斯维加斯，那也没问题，去参加扑克锦标赛。是的，也许他们听说过**领英**（**LinkedIn**）这家公司，因为他们在人力资源部门工作。是的。人力资源部门的每个人都对它欣喜若狂。那个拿着7.5万美元薪水的普通人力资源员工，他们明白下一个大产品会是什么。他们会知道**Indeed**或**领英**会成功，他们只需1000美元就能进行一次改变人生的赌注。他们能获得1000倍的回报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: But they can use **PrizePicks**. They could use some other thing. No, and I like **PrizePicks**. I use **PrizePicks** to bet on **Nick's** parlays. But they they wind up putting it somewhere else and why not being able to, you know, if they want to bet on the **Knicks**, that's fine. But or go to Vegas, that's fine, too, and play in a poker tournament. Yeah, maybe they hear about this company **LinkedIn** because they work in the HR department. Yeah. And everybody in the HR department's over the moon about it. That rank and file 75K person working in HR, they understand what the next big product will be. They'll know **Indeed** or **LinkedIn**'s going to work and they can make a life-changing bet with just $1,000. They make it a,000x return.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。我的意思是，这其中也包含金融素养的成分。我认为**AI代理**现在做得非常好。我们已经将一个**AI代理**整合到**Coinbase**应用程序中。它可以教人们关于**美元成本平均法**和**税收损失收割**。所以，金融教育素养是其中一部分，但之后，是的，让我们为他们提供高质量的投资，并民主化它。这就像帮助人们摆脱贫困一样，很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a financial literacy component to this as well. And I think actually the **AI agents** are now getting really good. That we've integrated one into **Coinbase** app. It can kind of teach people about dollar cost averaging and you know tax loss harvesting. So there's a the financial educa literacy is is a part of it but then yeah let's make high quality investments available to them and democra it's just like lifting people out of poverty. It's great.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Considering options

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 正在考虑。我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Considering I mean

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 就像我们所有人一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: As we all are.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我两年前搬到了奥斯汀，三年前。我当时想，我受够了。社会问题，你知道，我看到了预兆。我的意思是，我实际上认为加州有破产的可能，我在播客上说过，这感觉就像是走向破产。我从没想过他们会征收财富税，或者直接没收人们的资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I two years ago I moved to three years ago I moved to Austin. I was like I'm done. I just the social issues and you know I saw the writing on the wall. I mean I actually think there's a chance that the that California goes bankrupt and I said that on the podcast like this feels like it's trending towards insolveny. I never thought they would get to the wealth tax or just seizing people's assets.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你对这一切有什么看法？我今天早上读到一些东西，说实际上那些已经离开的人，大概是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: What's your take on all that? Some I was reading something this morning which said that actually just the people who have already left which is probably like

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我的估计是，加州大概有20%的亿万富翁已经离开了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: My my estimates would probably be 20% of the billionaires have already left in California

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这已经造成了100亿美元的税收漏洞，即使算上他们希望从留下的人那里筹集的金额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: That it's already created a negative 10 billion tax hole even if even with the amount that they hope to raise from the people who stay.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 所以这是我见过的最大的电话之一。这是一场灾难，而且我，你知道，我实际上很矛盾，因为总有这种“发声”或“退出”的问题，对吧？“发声”是你试图从内部解决问题，“退出”是你像你一样离开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: So it's one of the biggest cell phones I've ever seen. It's a disaster and I you know I'm torn actually because part there's always kind of this question of voice or exit right like voice do you try to fix it from within exit do you leave like you did

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我认为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And I think um

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 激励机制很奇怪，因为一方面，我爱加州，但另一方面，它有点像一种虐待关系，你知道，它不断地带来新的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: The incentives are strange because on the one hand like I love California but on the other hand it's been kind of um it's like an abusive relationship you know it just keeps coming back with another thing and another thing

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 在某些方面，如果你真的决定离开，那么在那时你真的没有多少动力去尝试解决它。你实际上希望在那时把很多建设者和顶尖人才从加州带走，然后全部重新安置到一个欢迎我们和企业的新地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And in some ways like if you do make the decision to leave, you don't have really much incentive to try to fix it at that point you actually want to get a lot of the the builders and the top talent out of California at that point and just all resettle in a new place that is welcoming to us and businesses.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。我认为人们不明白对于某个阶层的人来说，在全球范围内运营是多么容易。我每年都会在四块不同的大陆上坐飞机，你知道，对我来说，我在哪里并不重要。重要的是我的妻子和孩子是否快乐，他们是否喜欢我们居住的地方，我们爱奥斯汀。然后，我看到你可能在**Coinbase**与员工和团队打交道时最困难的事情之一，就是他们住房的价格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. I don't think people understand how easy it is for somebody who's in a certain strata to is already operating globally. I'm on planes and on four different continents every year, you know, like I it doesn't matter where I am. It matters my wife and my kids are happy and they love the place we live and we love Austin. And then the thing I've seen you the probably one of the hardest thing you had to deal with with your employees and your team at **Coinbase** is the price of their housing.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你有多少次试图招募某人来加州？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Like how many times did you try to recruit somebody to come to California

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 就像一个四口之家，他们需要私立学校，他们需要一套房子，你就会想：“天哪，他们在这里的开销会是多少？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And it's like a family of, you know, four and they need private school, they need a house and you're like, "Oh my god, what is their nut going to be here?"

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，他们的开销。我喜欢这个词。有一集很棒的《**南方公园**》（**South Park**）讲的就是这个。但是，是的，我的意思是，你说得对。这是一个主要的障碍，每当我们向加州或**New Limit**（生物科技公司）的某人发出要约时，他们总是会说：“我的生活成本会翻倍，你需要给我更多钱。”所以，这会通过你，企业主，转嫁为开支。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. My their nut. I love that. There's a great **South Park** episode on that. But yeah, I mean I you're right. That's a major barrier whenever we make an offer to somebody in California, you know, or for **New Limit** the Biotech, like that's always like, well, my cost of living is going to double like you need to pay me more. So, it's getting expensing through to you, the business owner.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，确实如此。我的意思是，旧金山有一种基于收入的税收，对金融服务公司非常惩罚性。**Stripe**在发生这种情况时就搬走了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah, it does. I mean, San Francisco had this kind of like revenue based tax that was very punitive on financial services companies. **Stripe** **Stripe** moved out when that happened.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我认为**Marc Benioff**后悔支持了那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I think **Mark Benoff** regrets supporting that one.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的，我想是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah, I think so.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。但公平地说，他确实想资助无家可归者工业综合体，但这在减少无家可归者人数方面完全无效，因为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. But in fairness, he did want to finance the homeless industrial complex, which has been completely ineffective in reducing the number of homeless individuals because

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 他们不是无家可归，他们是毒瘾患者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: They're not homeless. They're addicted to drugs.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 一个家并不能解决那个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: A home doesn't help that problem.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 没错。我的意思是，我在这里是老生常谈了，但是的，我认为如果人们觉得它有效，他们会更愿意支付更高的税。但加州过去10年的历史是，预算大幅增加，但服务却变得更糟。这实际上是在制造错误的激励。我们花在无家可归问题上的钱越多，无家可归者就越多。所以，你知道，还有浪费和欺诈。天哪。就像你们这些**Nick Shirley**之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Exactly. I mean, I I'm I'm preaching to the choir here, but yeah, I think people would have a lot more tolerance to pay higher taxes if they felt like it was working. But the history of the last 10 years in California is that the budget has gone up dramatically and the services have gotten worse. It's like it's actually creating the wrong incentives. Like the more ser the more money we spend on homelessness, the more homeless people are. So, you know, and then the waste and fraud. Oh my gosh. Like you guys **Nick Shirley** and all that.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你认为，我的意思是，我们甚至可以猜测加州的滥用程度是多少？它会，它会使明尼苏达州看起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I think what do you what I mean what could we even guess is the level of abuse in California? It's going to it's going to make Minnesota look

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 就像小巫见大巫。如此庞大的经济体，却有如此多的非营利组织和无家可归者组织，仅旧金山就拿走了数亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Like peanuts. Such a big economy with so many NOS's and so many homeless organizations taking down hundreds of millions of dollars in San Francisco alone.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

### 生物科技副业与长寿研究

**Jason Calakanis**: 那么，给大家讲讲你的副业，你的另一家公司吧。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Um so tell everybody about the the side hustle your your other company. Yeah. That you

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 哦，生物科技公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Oh, the biotech.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。当**Coinbase**在2021年上市时，我获得了一些流动性，我仔细思考后觉得：“好吧，我想继续担任**Coinbase**的CEO。成为一家上市公司CEO是一件很酷的事情。我只是觉得我们才刚刚开始旅程。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Well, when **Coinbase** went public in 2021, you know, I got some liquidity from that and I just I thought it through and I was like, "All right, I want to be CEO of continue to be CEO of **Coinbase**. Being a public company CEO is a really cool thing. I just feel like we're at the beginning of our journey."

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 但我也觉得我想开始利用一些资本去进行这些“大赌注”，对吧？我有点受到**Elon Musk**的启发。我认为，你知道，他做了**PayPal**和**X**的事情，然后，你知道，他进入了原子世界，而不是比特世界，对吧？实际上，在软件领域，它更宽容。创业都很艰难，但软件更宽容一些，因为你有更高的利润。原子世界则不那么宽容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: But I also felt like I wanted to start to use some of that capital to go after these like big bets, right? I was kind of a little inspired by **Elon** actually. I think, you know, he did the thing with **PayPal** and **X** and and then, you know, he went into these like the world of atoms, not bits, right? It's actually like in software is more forgiving. Startups are all hard, but software is a little more forgiving because you have higher margins. The world of atoms is much less forgiving.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 所以无论如何，我很幸运能遇到一些非常棒的联合创始人，他们带着长寿领域的这个想法走到了一起，它被称为，你知道，其背后的基础科学叫做**表观遗传重编程**。它有点像你可以重新编程你的细胞，以恢复它们年轻时的功能。当时正在进行一些非常酷的研究。我组织了几次晚宴。无论如何，我决定资助这些人，现在还有很多人也投资了，而且我是一名董事会成员。我一直在小范围地帮助他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: So anyway, I was lucky enough to meet some really amazing co-founders that came together with this idea in the longevity space and it's called, you know, there's the fundamental science behind it is called epigenetic reprogramming. It's sort of you can reprogram your cells to restore function they had when they were younger. There was some really cool research being done. I hosted a couple dinners. Anyway, I decided to fund these guys and a bunch of other people have invested now and I'm a board member. I've been helping them in in small

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 它的名字是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And the name of it is

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: **New Limit**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: **New Limit**. Yes,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: **New Limit**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: **New Limits**.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 所以，他们取得了令人难以置信的进展。它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: So, they've been incredible progress. It's

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 他们什么时候会有产品？这感觉像是一个20年的投资，而不是两三年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: When will they have a product? This feels like a 20-year investment, not a two or five.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。生物科技确实发展得比较慢，但它比我预想的要快。我原以为这会是五年纯基础研究。但实际上，在最初的两三年内，他们就成功地证明了可以重新编程人类细胞，以恢复它们年轻时的功能，而第一款候选药物很可能在明年进入临床试验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Well, biotech does move more slowly, but it's moved faster than I would have thought. I thought this was going to be like five years of just basic research. But it turned out actually within the first two or three years they were able to successfully demonstrate reprogramming of human cells to restore function they had when they were younger and the first drug candidate is probably going to go into clinical trials next year.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Amazing.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 这真是太有意义了。五分钟。是的。好的，太棒了。那么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: That's super rewarding. Five minutes. Yeah. Okay, great. Um so

</details>

### 达沃斯论坛的转变与全球经济展望

**Jason Calakanis**: 从达沃斯回来，你对世界状况有什么看法？每个人来到这里似乎都，过去一两年，ESG、DEI那些大合唱的东西似乎已经变成了，你知道，实实在在的交易，无论是国家之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Coming out of Davos, what's your take on the state of the world? Everybody when they get here seems to it seems like the ESG DEI kumbaya stuff has switched in the last year or two to you know brass tax deal making whether it's between countries

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 以及企业之间，这正在变成一个商业会议，而不是以前那样，这是每个人在街上、在会场里告诉我的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Um and businesses like this is turning into a business conference that used to be this is what everybody's telling me on the streets in in the you know in the houses

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 嗯，现在是关于商业的，而且在边缘地带，有一种全球化与民族主义的色彩。你对2026年世界状况的看法是什么，与监管机构、与政府工作人员交流后？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Um it's it's about business now and on the margins there's a patina of you know globalization versus nationalism. What's your take on the state of the world in 2026 talking to regulators, talking to, you know, people who work in government?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Mhm.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我认为你说得对。我的意思是，我之前只来过一次达沃斯，但那时感觉更像是，你知道，我们如何建立一个全球政府？我们如何做大量的ESG和DEI？现在没有人谈论这些了。我认为部分原因是因为**Larry Fink**的到来，他或多或少是新的领导者。而且我认为也因为**唐纳德·特朗普**。我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I think you're right. I mean, I've only been at Davos once before, but it did feel more um, you know, how do we make a global government? How do we do lots of ESG and DEI? And that's really not what anyone's talking about now. I think partially it's because of **Larry Fink** coming in, the new leader defect, you know, more or less. And I also think it's because of **Donald Trump**. I mean,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，他搅动了局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah, he shook it up.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。就像美国在GDP增长和低通胀方面的表现，以及商业环境。这就像是，嘿，我们如何才能都赢？这就是为社会上每个人创造繁荣的方式。我认为这实际上对每个人都有利，你知道，即使是社会上最贫困的人，他们在经济自由度高的国家也表现最好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Like the numbers that the United States is putting up in terms of GDP growth and low inflation and just that business environment. It's like, hey, how do we all win? That's how you create prosperity for everyone in society. I do think it actually benefits everyone like you know even the poorest people in society are they do the best in high economic freedom countries that are anyway.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 增长解决了很多问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Growth solves a lot of problems.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 确实如此。确实如此。我的意思是，而且增长客观地讲是惊人的。自从我们在疫情期间投入大量资金并印制大量美元以来，我们还没有看到这种GDP水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It does. It does. I mean, and the growth is objectively calling balls and strikes spectacular. We have not seen this level of GDP since we pumped a bunch of money and printed a bunch of dollars during co like

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 5.6%的GDP增长相当惊人。希望它能保持下去。失业率非常合理，4.6%，是我们有生以来最低的。我认为最低曾达到4.3%。通货膨胀，是的，接近3%而不是2%，但你知道，实际平均值大约是2.8%到2.9%。所以2%是目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: 5.6 GDP is pretty spectacular. Let's hope it keeps up. Unemployment very reasonable 4.6 lowest of our lifetime. I think 4.3 was the lowest it hit. Inflation, yeah, closer to three than two, but you know, the actual average has been like 2.8 2.9. So the two is the target.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以我们就在平均水平附近。还没有达到目标，但我想我们会达到。所以，是的，看起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So we're right around the average. Not hitting the target yet, but I think we'll get there. So, yeah, it seems like

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 增长并非来自政府支出，对吧？这才是关键。我认为这种凯恩斯主义经济论点基本上是错误的。增长来自放松管制，来自低成本能源，允许私人市场建设，让他们有明确的规则知道什么被允许，什么不被允许，然后创造一个公平的竞争环境。每个人都竞争，消费者受益，公司受益，所有员工和股东都受益。资本主义是最大的双赢。你知道，最近有人对此大发牢骚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Growth does not come from government spending, right? That's like the key that this is this Keynesian economic argument I think is basically wrong. Like growth comes from having like deregulation, having lowcost energy, allow the private markets to bill, let them have clear rules about what's allowed and not and then create a level playing field. Everyone competes, the consumer benefits, the b the companies benefit, all the employees, the shareholders. Capitalism is like the biggest win-win. You know that someone had a great rant about that recently.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 所以我们看到美国的私营公司正在蓬勃发展。这很棒，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And so we're seeing the private companies in the United States really cook. It's great,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 对吧？如果你发展得好，你就会创造更多就业机会，希望能缴纳更多税款，所有这些都会让循环朝着正确的方向发展。我最后谈谈AI。播客上对此有很多争论。你有一段时间没有和我们四个人一起上节目了，但如果有人生病，我们肯定会让你替补。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Right? And if you're cooking, you create more jobs, hopefully pay more taxes, all that just starts the cycle in the right direction. How do you I'll end on AI. Big debate on the pod. You haven't been on with the four of us in a while, but when somebody gets sick, we'll definitely rotate you in.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 每个人都喜欢你和那个四人组一起上节目。顺便说一句，你是粉丝最爱。但是，我很好奇你对**AI**和**工作岗位替代**有什么看法。**Saxs**和我一直在争论这个问题。它什么时候会到来？它已经来了吗？年轻人找不到工作，但我们整体失业率仍然很低，但**Elon**和**Bernie Sanders**的立场却是一致的：“嘿，听着。将会有很多工作岗位替代。”那么，你对此有什么看法？显然，**亚马逊**也是我关注的一个，因为在**Optimus**、**Robo Taxi**和**Waymo**时代，有人会驾驶包裹或打包包裹的想法听起来很疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Everybody loves when you are on like the the quartet. You're like a fan favorite, by the way. Um, but I'm curious what you think about **AI** and job displacement. **Saxs** and I have been debating this. When is it going to be here? Is it here? Young people can't find jobs, but we're still a pretty low unemployment rate overall, but then **Elon's** position and **Bernie Sanders** position is in sync. Hey, listen. It's going to be a lot of job displacement. So, how do you think about it? Obviously, **Amazon** also is the one I'm watching because the idea that somebody's going to drive packages or pack packages in the age of **Optimus** and **Robo Taxi** and **Waymo** sounds crazy.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 所以，这些工作岗位会消失。你如何看待**工作岗位替代**？你从**Coinbase**那些最先使用**AI**的员工身上看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: So, those jobs are going away. How do you think about job displacement? And what are you seeing with the most **AI** first employees in **Coinbase**?

</details>

### AI与就业：乐观展望

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。退一步讲，我认为加密货币和**AI**是世界上最重要的两大技术趋势。而且很酷的是，大多数人没有意识到它们实际上会结合在一起，因为**AI代理**需要完成工作，它们需要进行支付。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Well, just zooming out for a second, I think like crypto and **AI** are the two most important technology trends happening in the world. And what's cool, most people don't realize actually they're going to come together because **AI agents** need to get work done and they have to do payments

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 而整个传统金融系统都是围绕着了解你的客户，每个产品背后都有一个人，你上传你的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And the whole traditional financial system is built around kind of knowing your a human behind every product with your you upload your

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 哦，了解你的客户。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Oh, know your customer. Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以**AI代理**我认为将使用稳定币和加密钱包。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So **AI agents** I think are going to use stable coins and wallet crypto wallets.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 了解你的代理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Know your agent.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯，我甚至不知道你是否需要知道，但是的。无论如何，这是我们正在努力促成的重要趋势之一。关于**工作岗位替代**。嗯，我不知道。我，也许这有点技术乐观主义的看法，但我实际上认为，如果你回顾19世纪初，我认为大约80%的美国人口从事农业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Well, I don't even know if you need to know the just but yeah. Anyway, that's one of the important trends that we're trying to help happen in terms of job displacement. Um I don't know. I I maybe this is a bit of a techno optimist take um but I actually think you know if you go back and look at like the 19 early 1900s I think it was like 80% of the US population was in was working in agriculture

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 所以那是田间辛苦的体力劳动。当农业自动化后，现在只有大约3%的劳动力从事农业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: And so that's like hard manual labor out in the fields and when agriculture got automated you know now it's like 3% or something of the workforce working

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 那发生在30年间。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: That happened over 30 years. Yeah.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以我想他们会认为你我谋生的方式，比如我们在达沃斯进行一次很酷的对话，他们会觉得那不是一份真正的工作。真正的工作是田间体力劳动，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. And so I think they would look at what you and I do for a living like we're just having a cool conversation in Davos talking. They'd be like that's not a real job. Like real job is like manual labor in the fields, right?

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 你只是总在度假。但我们认为那是一份工作，你知道，那些整天在键盘上打字的人，你可以在有空调的办公室里工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Uh you just you're on vacation all the time. But we we think of it as a job and you know people who are like typing on a keyboard all but you get to sit in an air conditioned office or whatever.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 压力很大。那是一定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: It's stressful. That's for sure.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 可能会有压力，但我宁愿做那个，也不愿在太阳下挖沟之类的做苦力。所以，我认为**工作岗位替代**实际上不是一件坏事。如果这意味着人们可以从事新型工作。现在是否会有一个过渡期？是的。我基本上认为，如果**AI**像我们所有人认为的那样，与机器人一起发展，将会发生**工作岗位替代**，但这意味我们将生活在一个更富足的世界，人们将从事他们喜欢的工作，比如在**YouTube**上直播视频游戏之类的。我不知道那会是什么，但。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It can be stressful but that's just I'd rather be doing that than be doing backbreaking labor in this in the sun digging a ditch or something. Right. So I think that job displacement is like not a bad thing actually. Um if it means that people can do new kinds of work and new kinds of job. Now is there going to be a transition period? Yes. I I basically I think if the **AI** plays out as we all think it will with robots and a lot of there will be job displacement but it means that we'll be in a world of more abundance and people are going to have jobs that's there like they're streaming on video games on **YouTube** or whatever. Like I don't know what it's going to be but

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 或者他们会思考未来。他们会思考伟大的哲学著作可能会被写出来，因为我们不必再为打包箱子的琐事所累。所以我基本上对此持乐观态度。我认为这会是好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Or they'll think about the future. They'll think about like great philosoph you know philosophical works might be written because we don't have to burden ourselves with like the tedium of packing boxes. So I I'm basically an optimist on it. I think it'll be good.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我也对此相当乐观。我只是看了**Robo Taxi**自动驾驶的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I'm pretty optimist about it as well. I just having watched the **robo taxi** self-driving thing

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 并且看到了它改进的速度，以及近距离观察了**Uber**的故事12年。我想，是的，那会在六个月内发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And just watching the velocity that it's getting better and having watched the **Uber** story up close for 12 years. I'm like yeah that's going to happen in six.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Mhm.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 我认为它只是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: I think it's just like it's going to just

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。我觉得，我开始在现场看到的是，武汉和北京正在发生抗议，他们说：“好吧，我们只发放一定数量的自动驾驶执照。我们会限制它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. It feels to me and the thing I'm starting to see in the field is you have in Wuhan there and and Beijing, they're having protests and they're saying, "Well, we're just going to give out a certain number of self-driving license. We're going to contain it."

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 然后你看到波士顿和加州现在说：“嘿，听着。我们只允许一定数量的**Robo Taxi**。”或者波士顿说：“我们不会让你们在这里拥有它们。我们要保护这些工作岗位。”所以，我认为这将在未来几年成为一个非常阶级化的辩论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And then you have Boston and a couple and California now. They're saying, "Hey, listen. We're only going to allow a certain number of robotoxies." Or Boston's like, "We're not going to let you have them here. We're going to protect these jobs." So, this is going to become, I think, one of these very class, you know, debates we're going to have over the coming years.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 但公司里的员工呢？你现在的员工数量和几年前一样。你可能曾经过度招聘了一段时间，或者为了增长而招聘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: But what about employees in the company? You have the same number of employees as you had a couple years ago. You overhired for a bit maybe or hiring for growth.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Mhm.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 现在，你如何看待招聘与招聘和培训年轻人，以及自动化或仅仅拥有那些**AI**？你的员工中肯定有人在使用**Claude Co-work**之类的东西，他们就像是10倍的知识工作者。开发者是显而易见的，但，是的，跟我谈谈知识工作者以及你从那些最先使用**AI**的员工身上看到了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Now, how do you think about hiring versus hiring and training young people versus just automating stuff or just having those **AI**? You must have some people on the staff who are using **Claude Co-work** or something and they're just like 10x knowledge workers. Not developers are obvious, but yeah, talk to me about knowledge workers and what you're seeing with your most **AI** first employees.

</details>

### AI在企业内部的应用与“反向提示”

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。所以，我们去年的一大举措是，我们拥有了自己的内部托管**AI模型**，它连接到我们所有的**数据源**，对吧？所以，它就像是每一条**Slack**消息，每一个**Google文档**，每一个**Salesforce**数据，**Confluence**，你知道。所以现在，所有这些都连接在一起，数据都被聚合起来，你可以向这些**AI代理**提问。所以每个团队，法律团队，抱歉，每个团队都在使用它，法律、财务，所有一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. So, one of the big pushes we made in the last year was we got our own internal hosted **AI model** that was connected to all of our data sources, right? So, it's like every **Slack** message, every **Google doc**, every **Salesforce** data **confluence**, you know. So now this is all linked up in one like the data is all aggregated and you can ask these agents. So every team's legal is sorry every team is using it legal finance everything just

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 它就像**Coinbase**的**神谕**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: It's like the oracle of **Coinbase**.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。我开始问它，它不仅仅是像提示它：“嘿，你能帮我写一份这样的备忘录吗？”之类的。我作为CEO，现在会问这些**AI代理**：“我应该注意公司里哪些我可能没有意识到的事情？”它会告诉我：“你知道吗，这个团队对战略存在分歧？”我当时想：“实际上，我不知道，因为它能阅读每一条**Slack**消息和每一个**Google文档**。”然后，你知道，我一直在提示它，就像我董事会上的**Toby**，他称之为**Shopify**的“反向提示”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. And I've started to ask it really it's not just like prompting it hey can you write this kind of memo for me or something. It's like I'm asking these **AI agents** now as CEO like what should I be aware of in the company that I might not be aware of? And it'll tell me, "Did you know that like there's actually disagreement on this team about the strategy?" And I was like, "Actually, I didn't know that cuz it can read every **Slack** message in every every **Google doc**." And then, you know, I've been prompting it like I actually **Toby** on my board, he he he said this is like it's call he's calling it reverse from **Shopify**.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。是的。他说这就像是**反向提示**。所以，你不是告诉**AI代理**你想做什么，而是问它你更应该思考什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah. Yeah. He he said this is like reverse prompting. So, instead of telling the **AI agent** what you want to do, you ask it what you should be thinking more about,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 对吧？而且。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Right? And

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 它是一个导师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: It's a mentor.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。它就像一个教练。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. It's like a coach.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。比如：“什么能让我成为一个更好的CEO？”它会说：“好吧，我注意到你上个季度的时间分配。你曾说你想这样分配，但你实际上把32%的时间花在了这个上面，而不是20%。”而且它会，我问过它其他问题，比如：“你知道吗，过去一年我改变主意最多的是什么？”诸如此类。所以，它现在正在变成，它会主动向你提供你应该思考的信息，而不是反过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. Like, what could make me a better CEO? And it's like, well, I notic I looked at all how you spent your time in the last quarter. Here's how you said that you wanted to spend it, but you actually spent like 32% of your time on this instead of 20. And it'll I've asked it other questions like, you know, what's the thing that I changed my mind on the most over the last year? Things like that. So, it's been it's now becoming like it'll it'll like prompt you with information you should be thinking about instead of the other way around.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我最近做了这个，我不知道你有没有玩过**Claude Co-work**。你玩过吗？这周玩一下，有**Claude Opus 4.5**之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I recently did this and I I don't know if you play with **Claude Co** yet. Uh, have you played with it? This week play with there's **claude opus 4.5** or something.

</details>

**Brian Armstrong**: 是的。但有**Co-work**，它有点像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Armstrong**: Yeah. But there's **co-work** which is kind of like

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你描述你想作为一个知识工作者做什么，然后它就开始构建。所以，你不是做那种“氛围编程”，说：“嘿，我想为这个写代码。”你只是描述你想要最终应用程序和结果是什么，然后它就像一个向导一样引导你完成。这很吓人，因为我把我的**Notion**、**Slack**连接到它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: You describe what you want to do as a knowledge worker and it starts to build it. So instead of doing vibe coding and saying hey I want to write code for this you just describe like what do you want the end application and the result to be and then it kind of like a wizard kind of takes you through it. It's pretty scary cuz I connected my **notion** to it, my **Slack** to it

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 还有我的**Google文档**，它也做了同样的事情。我当时想：“告诉我关于我自己。”它就像：“哇，你需要花更多时间与那些成功的创始人在一起，而不是花更多时间与你的内部团队在一起。”这。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And my **Google Docs** and it did the same type of thing. I was like, "Tell me about myself." And it was like, "Whoa, you need to spend more time with your founders that are winning as opposed to more time with your internal team." It was

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 分析你的团队真的很有趣。我认为这将是未来的趋势。好了。听着，**Brian**，你还有很多会议要开。谢谢你来参加节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Really interesting to analyze your teams. And I think that's going to be like the future of this. All right. Listen, **Brian**, you got a lot more meetings to do. Thanks for coming on the program.

### Cerebras Systems：AI芯片的先驱

**主持人**: 我很高兴，因为我的嘉宾在**ChatGPT**推出前六七年就开始制造**AI芯片**了。**Andrew Feldman**当然是**Cerebras Systems**的CEO，他们正在构建**晶圆级引擎**（**WSE**）。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm thrilled because my guest started building **AI chips** seven six seven years. Six, seven years before **Chat GPT** was launched. **Andrew Felman** is of course the CEO of **Cerebras Systems** and they are building **wafer scale engine WSE**. Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 那就是你正在研发的芯片类别，它们用于推理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's the category of chips you're working on and they're for inference.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 用于推理或训练，两者皆可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: For inference or for training both

</details>

**主持人**: 或者用于训练，或者两者皆可。你带了一个吗？我带了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Or for training or both. And you have one with you? I do.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以，这是一个**晶圆级引擎**。记住，通常芯片只有邮票大小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: So here is a way for scale engine. Remember usually chips are the size of a postage stamp.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以这比**B200**大56倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And so this is say 56 times larger than a **B200**.

</details>

**主持人**: 哇。它是一个4万亿晶体管的部件。对于**AI**工作来说，大芯片处理的信息更多，交付结果所需的时间更少。所以你可以更快地得到你的查询结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Wow. And it's a 4 trillion transistor part. And for **AI** work, big chips process more information and they deliver results in less time. So you can faster results for your your query.

</details>

**主持人**: 今天的典型系统成本是多少？它如何与**H100**、**H200**等竞争？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And what does that cost for the typical system today? And how does it compete with like the **H100 200s**?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嗯，第一个花掉了我们5亿美元来制造。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Well, the first one cost us half a billion to make.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听说第一个是最贵的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: First one I've heard is the most expensive.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 结果第一个才是关键，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Turns out the first one's the kicker,

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这些都集成在一个系统中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: These come in a system.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。我们可以现场交付系统。是的。或者你可以在我们的云中使用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right. And we can deliver the system on premise. Yeah. Or you can use it in our cloud.

</details>

**主持人**: 现场部署大约需要一百万到一百五十万美元，具体取决于你的配置。在云端，你可以按令牌租用。所以每百万令牌的价格从50美分到几美元不等，具体取决于不同的模型。或者你可以按月或按年租用。你如何知道在**ChatGPT**推出前七年，**AI革命**会如此迅速、猛烈、不可阻挡？我的意思是，过去两年发生的事情甚至让你感到惊讶吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: On premise they're about a million million and a half depending on how you have it configured. And on in the cloud you can rent it by the token. So by the million tokens it'll vary by different models from 50 cents a million tokens to several dollars per million tokens or or you can rent it by the month or the year. How did you know seven years before **Chat GPT** was launched? Or did you that the **AI** revolution would be this fast, furious, you know, unstoppable? I mean, it and has what's happened in the last two years even surprised you?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 当然。我想，是的，我想除了**Sam Altman**和**Ilia Sutskever**之外，所有人都感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: For sure. I I think Yeah, I think anybody except maybe **Sam** and **Ilia**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 谁真正看到了它？嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Uh who really saw it? M

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你知道，我们在2015年和他们谈过，他们当时说的话，现在看来，他们是多么正确，令人难以置信。但我认为我们看到的是一种新的计算问题——**AI**的兴起，它将对处理器施加新的、不同的压力。我们看到了这个地平线上的事物，我们说，如果它变得巨大，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: You know we talked to them in 2015 and and what they were saying is now it was unbelievable how how right they've been but I I think what we saw was the rise of a new computational problem called **AI** and it would put new and different pressure on a processor and we saw this on the horizon and we said what would happen if this got giant

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们不知道它会变得多大，或者它会来得有多快，但作为一名计算机架构师，你会尝试思考我能否构建一台在这种新事物上速度快得多的机器？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And we had no idea how big it would get or how fast it would come but as a computer architect you try and think about could I build a machine that's way faster at this new thing

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 而且是否有足够的需求来围绕它建立一个业务？所以我们看到了**AI**的曙光。我们自问，我们能否构建一个在性能上独一无二的处理器？我们能否构建一个不是快一两三五倍，而是快20或50倍的东西？我们最终相信我们可以。我们选择了一种方法，解决了计算机行业75年来一直未解决的问题。没有人制造过如此大的芯片。许多聪明人失败了。我们成功交付了它，而且速度惊人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And will there be enough of it to build a business around? And so we saw **AI** on the horizon. We said to ourselves, could we build a a processor that would be unique in its performance? Could we build something not one or two or three or five times faster, but 20 or 50 times faster? And we came to believe we could. We chose an approach that that solved a problem that had been open in the comput industry for 75 years. Nobody had ever built a chip this big. Many smart guys had failed. And we delivered it and it's blisteringly fast.

</details>

**主持人**: 最初的应用是什么？你知道，**英伟达**（**Nvidia**）通过视频游戏玩家，然后是**比特币**和加密货币，完善了他们的计算能力，并真正发展了他们的公司。在**AI**出现之前，这几乎就像有一些中间点。你没有那些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What were the first applications? You know, **Nvidia** got to perfect their compute and really their company off of the backs of video game players, then **Bitcoin** and crypto. It was almost like there were just a number of way points before **AI** emerged. You didn't have those.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们没有那些。你知道，如果你看看**英伟达**从2004年到2010年的股价，它是持平的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We didn't have that. And you know, if you look at **Nvidia's** stock price from 2004 to 2010, it was flat.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？他们当时正在寻找新的市场，对吧？他们已经占据了大部分图形市场，而那个市场有点停滞不前。他们通过游戏玩家找到了热爱。他们试图进入超级计算领域。我们完全专注于**AI**。所以最初，我们通过国家实验室、军队以及一些制药公司找到了热爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. And they were trying to find a new market, right? That they had a lot of the graphics market and that market was sort of flat. They they found love with gamers. They tried to go into the supercomput world. We were focused entirely on **AI**. And so at first we we found love with with the national labs, with the military, with some pharma.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们当时使用的应用是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What were the applications they were using?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 他们正在训练各种类型的模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: They were training various types of models.

</details>

**主持人**: 明白了。这在大型语言模型出现之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Got it. And this is before large language models.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这在语言模型存在之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: This is before language models existed.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以他们当时正在为蛋白质测序等做模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So they were doing models for sequencing you know proteins.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 测序模型。他们正在做不同形式的视觉模型。他们正在高性能计算和**AI**的边缘领域工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Sequencing models. They they were doing different forms of vision models. They were doing work at the at the edges of high performance computing and **AI**.

</details>

### AI计算需求与速度优化

**主持人**: 现在什么消耗的计算量最大？我们现在看到很多应用，图像、视频制作、模型训练，以及真正的深度学习、深度思考，我想，它会触发许多多线程任务。其中哪一个计算量最大，限制最多？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What is now taking the most compute? We see a lot of applications now images, video production, the training of the models, and really deep learning, deep thinking, I guess, where it's firing off many many threaded jobs. Which one of those is the most compute, the most limited? Right now,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 深度研究。深度研究消耗了巨大的计算量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Deep research is deep research uses an enormous amount of compute.

</details>

**主持人**: 向观众解释一下，当他们进行一次深度研究查询时会发生什么。举个例子，我一直在玩最新的**Claude**，他们有一个**Co-working**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Explain to the audience what happens when they do one of those deep research queries. As an example, I've been playing with the latest **Claude** and they have a **co-working**. Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 类似副驾驶的应用，我每次播客有嘉宾时都会设置一个提示。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Co-pilot type application and I made a prompt every time we have a guest on the podcast

</details>

**主持人**: 我让它做，你知道，大概15到20个步骤，包括你参加过的每一次播客，每一条新闻，一个时间线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I had it do, you know, maybe 15 or 20 steps every podcast you've been on, every news item, a timeline,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right?

</details>

**主持人**: 当它生成这份文档时，简直令人难以置信。它比任何人类为我制作的都要好。我做了20年的访谈，有很多非常聪明的助手，他们的工作就是做这件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And it was unbelievable when it makes this document. It's better than anything a human has ever made for me. And I've been doing interviews for 20 years. Lots of pretty smart assistants whose job that exact thing was.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我告诉你，他们需要48小时才能完成一份只有这个20%内容的档案，而这个在10分钟内就能完成，我一点都不开玩笑。去年我告诉他们，你可以用它来获取一些想法和链接，但还是要用老方法做。所以它把他们的时间从16小时缩短到8小时。现在是16小时，我不需要他们了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And when I tell you they would ask for 48 hours to do a dossier that was 20% of what this does in under 10 minutes, I I'm I'm not even joking. And and last year I told them like you can use it to kind of get ideas and get some links, but you know, keep doing it the old way. So it kind of cut their time from 16 hours to 8. Now it's 16 hours to I don't need them.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 确实不需要他们做这项工作。对。现在想象一下，如果你能在10秒内得到它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Literally don't need them to do this work. Right. Now imagine if you could get it in 10 seconds.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对。这就是我们所做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. That's what we do.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 就是这样。没错。那么会发生什么呢？记住，我们通过训练来创建**AI**，我们通过推理来使用**AI**。好的。这是最简单的方式。推理需求飙升的原因是每个人都在使用**AI**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's it. Exactly. And so what what happens remember we we make **AI** with training and we use **AI** with inference. All right. And that's the simplest way. The reason inference is going through the roof is because everybody's using **AI**. Yes.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。你启动了一个任务，对吧？它启动了一堆小线程，每个线程都发出查询，每个查询都提供结果作为其他查询的输入。所以你有一个查询的级联正在进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right. A task that you kicked off, right? It starts a bunch of little threads and each of those asks queries and each of those queries deliver results that are the input to other queries. So you've got a cascade of queries that is going on.

</details>

**主持人**: 这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's wild.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 每一个都需要更多的计算。所以你有，你知道，20个不同的查询被启动。每个查询又发出20个查询。在传统计算中，每个查询都需要10、15或20秒才能完成。所以你有一个巨大的时间瀑布和答案。我们构建这个部件，这样你就可以在4秒或10秒内得到所有这些答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And each of those requires more compute. And so you've got, you know, 20 different queries being kicked off. Each query asks 20 queries. Each one of those requires 10 or 15 or 20 seconds to get done in traditional comput. So you you have this giant waterfall of time and answers. And we built this part so you can get all those answers back in 4 seconds in 10 seconds.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这种情况何时会发生？你知道，现在看来，当我做这种深度研究时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And when does that happen? You know, right now it seems like when I do these kind of deep research,

</details>

**主持人**: 就像，你知道，去泡杯咖啡的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's, you know, grab a cup of coffee time,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right?

</details>

**主持人**: 5分钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: 5 minutes,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right?

</details>

**主持人**: 不是15分钟，但平均似乎是5分钟。当你处理一张图片或一个5秒的视频时，似乎是90秒左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not 15, but it seems like about 5 minutes is what it averages. When you're doing an image or a 5-second video, it seems like it's 90 seconds or so.

</details>

**主持人**: 什么时候能像我们从拨号上网到光纤那样，体验到速度的飞跃？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When does that come down to, you know, the experience we had with dialup going to, you know, fiber?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 那是完美的类比，对吧？当互联网很慢的时候，**Netflix**通过信封递送DVD。我知道你记得这个，对吧？哦，我记得。当**Netflix**变快，当互联网变快时，**Netflix**并没有在递送DVD方面变得更好。**Netflix**变成了一家电影制片厂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That that's the the perfect analogy, right? When when the internet was slow, **Netflix** delivered DVDs and envelopes. I know you remember this, right? Oh, I do. When **Netflix** got fast, when the internet got fast, **Netflix** didn't get better at delivering DVDs. **Netflix** became a movie studio.

</details>

**主持人**: 它使他们能够成为不同的东西。这不是程度上的改变，而是本质上的根本改变。速度对**AI**的作用也是如此。所以，我们有像**Cognition**这样的客户，他们使用我们的技术来驱动他们的编码引擎。好的。如果你阅读推文和人们的评论，他们很奇怪。他们的请求和答案之间没有延迟。所以他们可以在编写代码时保持流畅。好的。所以这就是想法。想法是你不应该等待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It enabled them to be something different. It wasn't a change in degree. It was a fundamental change in kind. And what speed does for **AI** is the same. So, we have customers like **Cognition** who use us to power their coding engine. All right. And if you read the tweets and you read people's comments, they're they're odd. There is zero latency between their requests and their answers. So they can stay in the flow as they write code. All right. And so this is the idea. The idea is you shouldn't have to wait at all.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且**Claude**不是**Anthropic**的客户，但我们最近宣布了**OpenAI**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And **Claude** is not a **anthropic** is not a customer, but we recently announced **OpenAI**,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？他们是最初的投资者。他们是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right? They were original investors. They were

</details>

**主持人**: 现在他们刚刚下了一笔大订单。他们有，这真的很令人兴奋，我认为部分原因是因为我们能够提供非凡的速度，从而改变了用户体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And now they've just put in a major purchase order. They have and this is really exciting and part of it I think was because what we could do is we could deliver extraordinary speed so that the user experience changed

</details>

**主持人**: 而且正如我们所知，我们观察了**谷歌**的**Larry**、**Sergey**、**Marissa**和团队，他们得出了一个结论：当我们缩短毫秒级的时间时，这是提高使用率的第一方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And as we know having watched **Google** **Larry** and **Sergey** **Marissa** the team over there came to a conclusion when we shave off milliseconds it's the number one way we get usage to go up

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错，他们多年前发表了一篇论文，说即使是毫秒级的时间，即使是用户察觉不到的时间，也能显著影响使用率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's exactly right published that paper years ago that said even milliseconds even even amounts of time that the individual user doesn't recognize noticeable That's exactly what is it GM?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 什么是心理上的刚可觉察的感知？我相信你妈妈会知道。她是一位行为学家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: What is the psychological just notible perception? I believe your mom would know. She's a behavioral

</details>

**主持人**: 她会知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She would know.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 刚可觉察的差异是任何数字的15%。所以，如果你能缩短15%的时间，人们就会更多地使用它，更少地离开。是的。你知道，**Paul Graham**发了一条很棒的推文。他说：“如果**ChatGPT**不那么慢，我使用**谷歌**的次数会减少一半。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Just noticeable. It's 15% of whatever the number is. So like if you could cut 15% off the time people they use it more, they leave less. Yes. You know, there's a **Paul Graham** had a had a great tweet. He said, "I I' I'd use **Google** half as much if **Chat GPT** weren't so slow."

</details>

**主持人**: 如果你仔细想想，就会发现确实如此，对吧？当你等待**Claude**或**ChatGPT**时，你会去喝杯咖啡或在别处逛逛，你就失去了客户。这就是慢的代价，客户会去别的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And if you think about that, that's what happens, right? While you're waiting for **Claude** or you're waiting for **Chad GPT**, you you get a coffee or you poke around somewhere else and you've lost the customer. That's the cost of being slow is the customer has gone somewhere else

</details>

**主持人**: 或者你做我做的事情，我有一台漂亮的宽屏**戴尔**（**Dell**）显示器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Or you do what I do which is I have a nice wide **Dell** monitor.

</details>

**主持人**: 我打开了三个浏览器窗口。我为所有三项服务付费。我同时使用**Gemini**、**Claude**、**Chat**。我为所有这些付费。我个人每月大概支付600到700美元。所以，我每年光自己就花1万美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I have three browser windows open. I pay for all three services. I have them all **Gemini**, I got **Claude**, I got chat. I pay for all of them. I'm paying probably close to $600 700 personally a month. So, I'm spending 10,000 a year just for me,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right?

</details>

**主持人**: 我只是用同样的查询，然后砰砰砰砰，全部启动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I just take the same query and I go bing bing bing bing and I start them all

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 或者全部启动。而且。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Or start them all. And

</details>

**主持人**: 我可能烧掉了10棵树。我的意思是，这可能有点贪婪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm probably burning like 10 trees. I mean, there's it's probably probably being a little greedy.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 它不是10棵树，但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It's it's not 10 trees, but um

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为那是一种非常有趣的管理速度慢的方式，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It uh I I think that's a really interesting way to manage how slow it is,

</details>

**主持人**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以我们的存在就是为了解决这个问题。我们与**OpenAI**合作，就是为了在全球最流行的模型上提供极快的速度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And so we exist to fix that problem. And what what we partnered with **OpenAI** to do is is to to deliver blisteringly fast speed across the world's most popular models.

</details>

**主持人**: 这笔交易的范围是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the scope of the deal? Uh

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们宣布的是750兆瓦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: What we announced was 750 megaww

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是宣布的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is what was announced.

### 数据中心能源与冷却

**主持人**: 我们什么时候从谈论芯片数量、销售单位数量，转变为谈论销售电量？这让人们有点困惑，而且大概是从去年夏天开始的。实际上，这种变化已经持续了更长时间。我们过去用平方英尺来谈论数据中心。我有一个10万平方英尺的数据中心，对吧？现在没有人关心你拥有多少平方英尺。他们关心你拥有多少电力。所以数据中心的限制因素始终是它们的电力足迹。而现在对于大型部署来说，限制因素是能够提供的电力。所以通过谈论提供了多少电力，你是在用限制因素的单位来谈论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When did we switch from talking about the number of chips, the number of units being sold to the amount of power being sold? It's a little bit confusing for folks and it started probably about last summer. So actually what happened was that the change has been coming a lot longer. We used to talk about data centers in terms of square footage. I got 100,000 square foot data center, right? And now nobody cares how many square feet they you have. They care about how much power you have. So the limiting constraint on data centers is always their power footprint. And right now for large deployments, the limiting constraint is how much power can be delivered. So by talking about how many p how much power is delivered, you're talking in in the unit of the limiting constraint.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嗯。所以限制因素是电力。我们正在为**OpenAI**寻找大量的电力。它将在几年内交付。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Mhm. And so the limiting constraint is power. We're trying to find this huge amount of power for **OpenAI**. It'll be delivered over several years.

</details>

**主持人**: 你也负责电力吗？还是那是共同努力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you're responsible for the power as well or is that like a joint effort?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以，这是一个云交易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: So it's a cloud deal. So

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，所以他们正在使用你的云。所以你必须做所有的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, so they're utilizing your cloud. So you've got to do all the work.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们正在建设云基础设施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We are we are building the the cloud infrastructure for it.

</details>

**主持人**: 明白了。你打算在哪里建设你的数据中心？2026年最佳的选址在哪里？是在天然气附近吗？还是在水电附近？现在的最先进技术是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Got it. Where are you going to where are you building your data centers? What's the best location here in 2026 to be placing these things? Is it overn gas? Is it near hydro? What's the state of the art now?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以世界上最便宜的电力是水电。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: So the the the cheapest power in the in the world is is hydro. Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 毫无疑问。其次是天然气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Without question. After that is natural gas.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以有天然气的地方，你就有相对低成本的丰富电力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And so where places have natural gas, you you have an abundance of relatively lowcost power,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 也就是德克萨斯州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Which is Texas.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 西德克萨斯州、怀俄明州，在美国以外，加勒比地区、加纳，有大量的天然气。在北欧，你有地热能，那是另一回事。但天然气是一种非常便宜的方式，特别是如果它是石油开采的副产品，以前被称为“燃烧气体”。他们以前只是把它扔掉。他们以前只是在顶部烧掉它。**比特币**矿工发现了，**比特币**矿工发现了那个，对吧？所以我们会利用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: West Texas, Wyoming, outside the US, in the Caribbean, in Gana, you have a huge amount of natural gas. You do in you have geothermal, which is its own thing in in the Nordics. Um, but natural gas is a is a very inexpensive way, particularly if it's coming from as a byproduct from from petroleum mining where where what you have is it used to be what's called flare off gas. They used to just throw it away. They used to just burn it at the top. **Bitcoin** miners found the **Bitcoin** miners found that, right? And so, we'll take that.

</details>

**主持人**: 没错。就像，哇，不要制造那个火，制造。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's right. Like, whoa, don't make that fire make

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，基本上，你寻找现有的燃烧气体。然后告诉我关于水电的情况，因为在我看来，人们很久以前就知道，他们把数据中心搬到那里。热量仍然是你的芯片和其他设备的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, basically, you look for the existing flare off. And then tell me about hydro because it does seem to me that people knew that for a long time they were moving data centers there. Heat still an issue with your chips and others.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们是水冷的，所以水是一种极其高效的冷却剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We're water cooled and and so water is an extremely efficient coolant.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以，你知道，我们很早就知道我们会转向水冷。我们是第一批使用水冷的生产型**AI系统**之一。**TPU**早期也转向了水冷。在此之前，有一些水冷，主要是在能源部的超级计算实验室中使用了一些水冷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: So, you know, we we we knew early on that we'd be going to water. We were some of the first production **AI systems** to use water. The **TPU** early on moved to water as well. Before that, there'd been some water cooling, mostly in the the **Department of Energy** supercomput labs that they'd used some water.

</details>

**主持人**: 这有关系吗？因为我记得十年前人们谈论水冷时，水的来源以及水有多冷很重要，还是只要是水就足够冷了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Does it matter because I remember early on when people were talking about water to cool 10 years ago, the source of the water and how cold that water is coming in or just water's cool enough?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: No.

</details>

**主持人**: 你很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you're fine.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这取决于你的具体设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It depends on on your particular design,

</details>

**主持人**: 但你喜欢更冷的水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But you'd like cooler water.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Sure.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Is better.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以阿拉斯加和加拿大感觉很好。或者你带冷却器，或者你冷却水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, Alaska and Canada feel pretty good about that. Or or you bring chillers or or you cool the water,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对吧？你通常可以利用地下水或其他形式的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right? You can often you can take general groundwater or other forms of other locations for

</details>

**主持人**: 今天有一个巨大的误解，认为这些水没有被回收，而且**AI**正在使用所有这些水，而实际上它甚至无法与高尔夫球场相比。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's a huge misperception today that this water is not recycled and that **AI** is using all this water when it's it's not even comparable to golf courses. Let's say

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 首先，高尔夫球场的用水效率极低。我们大多数数据中心都使用闭环系统，对吧？所以我们让水流过芯片背面。它们带走热量。它们加热水。热水流下，通过闭环系统冷却后再泵回。所以你没有使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: First golf courses are are extremely water inefficient. Most of our data centers use a closed loop, right? So we we're we're passing the water by the back of our chip. They pull the heat off. They warm the water. The warm water goes down and through a closed loose system is chilled and pumped back. And so you're not using

</details>

**主持人**: 而且水没有被污染。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And the water is not damaged.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 水没有被污染。它只是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: The water's not damaged. It's just

</details>

**主持人**: 不是像一些化学物质之类的东西被放入其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not like some chemicals or anything that gets put into them.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 不，完全没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: No, not at all.

</details>

### AI数据中心建设的公共关系与挑战

**主持人**: 现在有很多关于**AI**的误解。似乎有一些黑暗的公关力量在运作，试图让数据中心的建设看起来比实际情况更糟。然后，我认为也有一些关于就业的合理担忧。当你审视这些问题时，作为一名建设数据中心的**AI**高管，你认为哪些问题最令人沮丧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's a lot of misperceptions about **AI** right now. There's a bit of a it seems like it's almost like there's some dark PR forces at work trying to make the data center build out seem worse than it is. And then there's also I think maybe some valid concerns around jobs. When you look at each one of those issues, what do you think is, you know, the ones that are most frustrating as an **AI** executive building data centers?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这是一个非常好的观点。我认为一些超大规模运营商在进入一些农村社区的方式上做出了错误的决定。对。那么你在寻找什么？你正在寻找一个土地便宜、电力充足的地方，他们去了这些社区，但没有很好地与人们沟通。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It's a really good point. I think some of the hyperscalers sort of they they made a bad call in the way they they went into some of these rural communities. Right. So what are you looking for? You're looking for a place that land is cheap that has an abundance of power and they went to these communities and they didn't do a good job talking to people.

</details>

**主持人**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对。而且。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. And

</details>

**主持人**: 科技人员没有很好地与人沟通。对。真是个惊喜。他们进入这些社区，与电力公司达成协议。电力公司正在寻求建设新的基础设施来支持他们。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Tech people didn't do a good job talking to humans. Right. What a surprise. And they went into these communities and they cut deals with the power company. And the power company was looking to build new infrastructure to support them. Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 传统上，受监管的电力行业会把这些成本分摊到20或30年。所以他们最终提高了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And traditionally the regulated power industry would then advertise that cost over 20 or 30 years. So they ended up increasing

</details>

**主持人**: 当地居民的电费，对吧？所以人们很生气，这非常合理，非常合理。如果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The local people's power rates, right? And so the people got upset and that very reasonable, very reasonable. If instead

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你本可以进去说：“看，太棒了。我们会成为好公民。我们会成为大纳税人。让我们建设更多的学校。我们可以为你建一所学校。这在这个设施的成本中只是一个零头。我们会创造很多建筑工作岗位，我们会成为好公民。”是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: You'd have gone in and said, uh, look, great. We we we're going to be good citizens. We're going to be big taxpayers here. Let's build more schools. We we can build a school for you. It's it's a rounding error in the cost of this facility. We're going to make a bunch of construction jobs and we're going to be good citizens. Yes.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 他们会采取非常不同的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Um they would have had a very different approach.

</details>

**主持人**: 不仅如此，他们早期有点强硬，说：“我们要让三个社区互相竞争，看谁能给我们最大的税收优惠？”对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And not only that, they kind of were a little heavy-handed early on where they said, "We're going to play three communities off each other and who's going to give us the biggest tax discount?" Right.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 那是另一个严重的错误。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That was another cell phone mistake. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，我刚刚看到的是**微软**发布了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Now, what I just saw is that **Microsoft** just put out,

</details>

**主持人**: 我们这周在节目中讨论了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We talked about it this week on the show.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为这对于像**微软**这样一家“国家冠军”公司来说，是一种非常周到和合理的方法，对吧？他们会成为好公民。他们希望确保你的电费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I thought it was a very thoughtful and reasonable sort of approach for a company that's sort of a national champion, right? That that they're going to be good citizens. They want to make sure that that your rates.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们基本上说，为了让观众了解，我们保证我们的能源使用不会增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They basically said just to catch the audience up, we guarantee you our usage of energy will not increase the uh

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你的公用事业成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: The cost of your utilities.

</details>

**主持人**: 你的公用事业成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The cost of your utilities.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这很公平。我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's fair. I mean,

</details>

**主持人**: 我的意思是，非常合理。而且我认为下一步，我们在播客上集思广益。有人在屋顶安装太阳能，还有基础电力。**Michael Dell**的儿子正在做一个非常有趣的项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean, very reasonable. And I think the next step we were brainstorming on the pod. There are people putting solar on roofs and there's base power. **Michael Dell's son** doing a really interesting project.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。他们只是把电池放在你家旁边。它们不需要非常复杂，当有多余的廉价电力时，他们就给这些电池充电，然后在需求高峰时部署。所以如果你认为**微软**，你谈论的是四舍五入的误差，那么，如果你给每个人家里都配备一个电池，在电力便宜时储存一些能量，然后这些能量可以回流到数据中心。我认为我们可以生活在一个你说：“嘿，我们在这里建一个数据中心，每个人的能源都是免费的。”的世界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah. Where they just put batteries on the side of your house. They don't have to be super intricate and they load those batteries up when there's extra power and it's cheap and they deploy it when you know the duck curve or whatever the demand hits. So if you think **Microsoft** and you talk about rounding errors, well, if you give everybody a battery at home to store some energy when it's cheap and there it's and then that can be used to flow back into the data centers. I think we're could live in a world where you say, "Hey, we're going to put a data center here and everybody's energy is free."

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为，嗯，有几件事。首先，我们作为一个国家，在过去40或50年里没有投资于我们的电网，对吧？所以我们的电网落后，非常需要改进，对吧？与其他先进国家相比，特别是与中国所做的相比，我们的电网已经破旧不堪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think well, there are a couple things. First is we chose as a nation not to invest in our grid for 40 or 50 years, right? And so our our our grid is behind and vastly in need of improvement, right? Our our grid is is decrepit compared to other advanced nations and in particular compared to what what China has done.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为在家中储存电力并在电力最昂贵时使用它的能力显然是合理的事情，对吧？显然是合理的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think the ability to store power at your home and to use it when power is the the most expensive is an obviously a reasonable thing to do, right? Obviously the reasonable thing to do

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 它也减轻了电网的负荷。人们也喜欢有点韧性的想法，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And it takes load off the the grid as well. And people like the idea of being a little resilient, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 他们确实如此。如果你真的断电了，在加州，我记得在半岛上，你每年大概断电六次？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They do. If you do lose your power, which in California, I think they turn it off about on the peninsula, was it about a half dozen times a year for you?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 只有在天气很热或很冷的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Only when it's really hot or really cold.

</details>

**主持人**: 无论是哪种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Either either one.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们会断电两天，因为有风，这简直是一场彻底的灾难。哦，顺便说一句，我不知道你是否知道，法国核电站周围的居民获得了核能补贴，他们说，作为居住在核电站附近的交换，有些人可能对此有担忧。也许是合理的，也许是不合理的。撇开这些不谈，我们只是给你提供终身免费能源。这很有趣。你对小型模块化核能有什么看法？它只是太遥远了。是的。你现在不必担心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And they'll leave it off for 2 days cuz it's wind and it's just a complete disaster. Oh, and by the way, I don't know if you knew this, there were subsidies given for nuclear where the people living around nuclear power plants in France and where they just said in exchange for living near a nuclear power plant, which some people might have concerns about. Uh maybe they're reasonable, maybe they're unreasonable. Put that aside, we're going to just give you free energy for life. Very interesting. What is your thought on small modular and nuclear? It's just it's too far out. Yeah. For you to be concerned with right now.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为这既是显然正确的事情，也可能不是未来三四年数据中心的能源来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think it's both the obviously the right thing to do and probably not the source of data centers for the next three or four years.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 两者兼有。对。显然我们需要为此努力。显然，它是一种极其高效的能源创造形式。核能，嗯，在20或30年内，比我们所知的任何其他能源创造方式都高效得多。它有一个缺点。它的前期成本有点高，对吧？所以费用是前期支付的，然后你会在几年内获得收益。但显然我们应该为此努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Both. Right. That that obviously we need to be working on that. Obviously, it's an extremely efficient form of power creation. Nuclear has over 20 or 30 years is vastly more efficient than any other power we know how to how to create. It has a disadvantage. It upfront it's a little more expensive, right? So the fees are are are upfront and then you get the benefit over years. But clearly we should be working on this.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果你有能力做，你就会做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And if you had the ability to do one, you would do it.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 哦，是的，当然。你看到一些更积极的国家正在这样做。**阿联酋**（**UAE**）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Oh yeah, for sure. And you're seeing some of that in the more aggressive nations. The **UAE**

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 正在建设模块化核能数据中心。通过核能向电网输送大量电力。这是一个很棒的主意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Is building modular nuclear data center based data centers. Putting huge amounts of power on the grid with nuclear. And what a great idea.

</details>

### AI的地缘政治与就业影响

**主持人**: 几周前的一个周日下午我去见了**Elon Musk**。我们聊着，他真的认为将数据中心和芯片放到太空，冷却在太空非常容易，太阳能效率更高。你觉得呢？他一直在公开谈论这个，所以我不是在泄密，但你对太空数据中心有什么看法？你开始研究了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I went to see **Elon** a couple weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon. And we're talking he really thinks that putting data centers and chips in space, cooling's pretty easy in space, solar is much more effective. What do you think, and he's been talking about this publicly, so I'm not speaking out of school, but what do you think about data centers in space? Have you started researching it?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们有。我认为首先，押注**Elon**的想法，长期来看可能不是一个好的投注策略。然而，他能否把握好时机，这方面一直不太。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We have. I think first betting against **Elon's** ideas is is probably longterm not a good betting strategy. However, he getting the timing right is something that that has been less a less

</details>

**主持人**: 他从不错。他只是经常迟到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He's never wrong. He's frequently late.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。我总是，我认为这是远见者的祝福和诅咒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's right. I always I look I I think that's the both the blessing and the curse of visionary.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你看到了别人看不到的东西，在你看来，那只是一些技术障碍需要克服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Is you see things other people can't see and in your mind they're just some technical hurdles to overcome.

</details>

**主持人**: 你花了几年时间来建造那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You took a couple years to build that.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 花了几年时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It took took a couple years.

</details>

**主持人**: 你按时完成了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Were you on time?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Um

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们，我们大约提前或推迟了一年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We we were we were plus or minus a year.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。在交付一个前所未有的东西时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. In delivery of something that nobody had ever done.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Um,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 很难预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It's hard to predict.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这真的很难。我认为利用太空获取太阳能的想法显然是明智的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: It's it's it's really hard. I I think the idea of using space for to grab solar power is obviously a smart idea.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对。你离太阳更近几英里。大气层更薄，阻挡的光线更少，所以你可以收集到更多的能量。我认为还有很多技术工作要做。是的，那里很冷，但你也在真空中。所以实际的冷却并不是一个容易解决的问题。这是一个可以解决的问题。我认为卫星之间的通信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. You're you're you're you're miles closer to the sun. You have much thinner atmosphere blocking the rays, so you can gather up the power. I think there's a lot of technical work to be done. Yes, it's cold there, but you're also in a vacuum. So, the actual cooling isn't an easy problem. It's a solvable problem. I think the communication among satellites

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是一个真正的问题。而且要弄清楚你想用什么技术把数据传回地球，对吧？记住，当你收到有线电视时，当你试图通过那些卫星获取互联网时，它非常不稳定。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Is a real real issue. And figuring out which technology you want to do to get the data back to Earth, right? Remember, when you got your cable TV, when you tried to get internet from those satellites, it was really glitchy. Yeah,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 存在这些巨大的延迟。现在，那些是高轨道卫星。他正在考虑的那些是低轨道卫星。它们的延迟会更低，但还有一些实际工作要做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: There were these big delays. Now, those were higher orbit satellites. The ones he's thinking about are much lower orbit. They'd have lower latency, but there's some real work to be done.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为它属于8到10年范畴，而不是3到5年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I I think it's in the 8 to 10 year category, not in the 3 to five.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的，我认为也许可以取个中间值，但是的，所有这些都值得追求，如果你相信我们不会过度建设。所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah, I I think it maybe split the difference, but yeah, it's and it it's all of these are worth pursuing if you believe that we're not going to overbuild. So,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 了解你所知道的，并观察这种建设，我们现在是否可能过度建设，需要一个消化期？或者你认为，根据我们所看到的，将会有下一个工作负载，下一个工作负载，下一个工作负载？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Knowing what you know and watching this build out, is it possible that we're overbuilding right now and we'll need a digestion period or do you think, you know, based on what we're seeing there's just going to be the next workload, next workload, next workload.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为我们对**AI计算**的需求仍处于非常早期的阶段。而且我认为，如果你想想，有多少企业真正以有意义的方式采用了**AI**，从而改变了他们的工作流程，这个比例非常小。我认为即使是消费者层面最频繁的用户，每天也只使用六到八次。当他们每天使用100次时会发生什么？当他们所有的设备都在为他们工作时会发生什么？当GNA的每个人，对吧？当每个工程师都将其用作编码副驾驶时会发生什么？我们将看到巨大的推理需求。模型正在变得更好，更多的人正在使用，他们使用得更频繁，而且每次使用所消耗的计算量也在增加。所以，我认为我们才刚刚开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think we are still really early in in the demand for **AI compute**. And I I think if you think about, you know, what portion of enterprises have really adopted **AI** in a meaningful way that has changed their workflow, it's tiny. I think even the most frequent users at the consumer level are going six, eight times a day. What what when what happens when they go to 100 times a day? What happen when all their devices are going for them? What what happens when everybody in GNA, right? When every engineer is using it as a as a coding co-pilot, right? We're going to see enormous amounts of demand for inference. The models are getting better, more people are using, they're using more often, and the the amount of compute taken with each usage is increasing. So, I think we're just at the beginning.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 当你现在制造系统时，你如何分配精力，包括能源效率、原始马力以及传输层？这些似乎是你正在做的最重要的三个部分。嗯，如果我说错了请纠正我。然后你如何与工程师和你的整个团队分配资源来解决这三个主要问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: How do you portion off the effort when you're making systems right now in terms of energy efficiency, the raw horsepower, and then the transport layer? These seem to be the three most important parts of what you're doing. Um, correct me if I'm wrong. And and then how how do you allocate with engineers and your overall team tackling those three major issues?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 一种我听得不够多的思考方式是，你制造一台计算机时，会考虑三件事，对吧？你进行计算的速度有多快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: One way to think about it that that I don't hear often enough is the way you make a computer is you think about three things, right? How fast you can do a calculation.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你可以将结果存储在哪里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Where you can store the result.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。内存。以及你将结果传递给想要使用它的人的速度有多快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right. Memory. And how fast you can get the result to somebody who wants to use it.

</details>

**主持人**: 传输。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Transport,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 不，不是传输。这是构成一台计算机的三件事。如果你计算速度很快，但存储很慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Not transport. These are the three things that make a computer. And if you do really fast calculations, but your storage is is slow.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，瓶颈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: All right, bottleneck.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 你就会遇到瓶颈。如果你能快速计算，也能存储，但你的I/O很慢，那么你就无法将结果传递给用户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: You're bottlenecked. If you can do fast calculations, you can store it, but your IO is slow, then you can't get it to the user.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 作为一名计算机架构师，你一直在思考这三个维度的平衡，对吧？所以你在计算性能上取得了飞跃。你必须考虑存储。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: You are constantly thinking about as a computer architect the balance of these three dimensions, right? And so you make a a jump in your in the the performance of calculation. You got to think about storage.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。然后你必须思考，我的意思是，这是一个常数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right. Then you got to think I mean it is a constant.

</details>

**主持人**: 你是同时思考这三件事，还是有团队在磨练每个独立的垂直领域？你如何从架构上构建一个工程师团队来做这件事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Are you thinking about those three simultaneously or are there teams grinding out each one of those individual verticals? How do you architecturally build a group of engineers to do that?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 所以通常你的高级架构师，你的CTO和你的技术负责人，他们会把这作为设计的基础来思考，对吧？我的意思是，如果一辆车不能转弯，它的速度再快也无关紧要，对吧？除了直线加速赛车。所以设计师们一直在思考，我们应该在设计中如何使用电力？我们如何让内存更快？我们能否增加内存？增加内存的成本与使其更快相比如何？例如，**GPU**有很多内存容量，但它真的很慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: So you usually your most senior architects, your your CTO and your your technical leads are thinking about that as the the the basis of a design, right? I mean it it it doesn't matter how fast the car can go if it can't turn you, right? It's not a good car except maybe for drag racing, right? And so the the designers are constantly thinking about um where should we use power in the design? What can we make the memory faster? Can can we can we add memory? What is the cost of adding memory versus making it faster? The **GPU**, for example, has a lot of capacity of memory, but it's really slow.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的？那在推理中是一个巨大的瓶颈。这就是为什么它们不能快。这就是为什么他们刚刚花了200亿美元收购**Grock**，因为他们没有快速推理的解决方案。快速推理需要快速访问内存，而**GPU**没有。所以，这些都是我们一直在思考的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right? And that's a huge bottleneck in inference. It's why they can't be fast. It's why they just spent 2020 20 billion dollars buying **Grock** is because they didn't have an answer for fast inference. Fast inference needs fast access to memory and the **GPU** doesn't have it. So, these are things we're constantly thinking of

</details>

**主持人**: 我们现在正因为这个而面临大规模的内存短缺。这如何解决？这只是一个短期瓶颈，还是一个长期问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And we're having a massive memory shortage right now because of this. How does that get resolved? Is that like just a short-term bottleneck or is that going to be a long-term problem?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为这是一个疯狂的问题。我认为每个人都知道需求会增加。嗯，这在主要的内存制造商中也是如此。人们有点害怕，然后他们下了一整年的需求订单，但得到的却是错误的答案，那就是我们不确定你什么时候能拿到。所以他们的反应是，好吧，我们给你18个月的需求。所以突然之间，每个人都从给出六个月的需求变成了18个月的需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think what it's a a crazy problem. I think everybody knew that the demand would increase. Um, and this is true among the the major memory makers. Um people get a little scared and what happens is they place a full year's worth of demand and they get the wrong answer back which is we don't we don't exactly know h when you can have it. So then their response is all right we'll give you 18 months of demand. So suddenly everybody went from giving six months of demand to 18 months of demand.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。所有人都，整个供应链都混乱了。好的。我们现在生产的内存数量与四个月前完全相同。好的。而现在发生的是，发送给制造商的信号爆炸式增长，我们需要大约18个月来消化。价格将保持高位。嗯，这是内存市场的一个已知现象。这种情况每六到八年发生一次。嗯，现在不同的是，**GPU**正在使用大量的**HBM**，这是一种**DRAM**，它们正在大量消耗这种内存，这可能会导致其他设备和消费者可用的内存减少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right. Everybody all the supply chain is confused. All right. We were making the exact same amount of memory we are now as we were four months ago. All right. And what's happened is the signal into the the makers has exploded and it will take us about 18 months to digest. The prices will stay high. This is a known phenomenon in the memory market. This happens every six or eight years. What's different right now is the the **GPUs** are using a huge amount of **HBM** which is a flavor of **DRAM** and they're chewing through that and that's maybe leaving a little less for other devices consumers.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 中国在追赶你的公司、**英伟达**、**Grock**方面进展如何？你如何看待**AI竞赛**的地缘政治？比如，是否存在他们赢我们输，我们赢他们输的情况，或者在你看来这被夸大了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Far along are the Chinese in catching up to your company, **Nvidia**, **Grock**, and how do you think about the geopolitics of the **AI race**? Like if they is there a scenario where they win and we lose, we win, they lose, or is that overblown in your mind?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为地缘政治是一个真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think the geopolitics are a real issue.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们在芯片制造方面遥遥领先。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: We are in we are well ahead in chipm.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。在圣克拉拉几平方英里之内。你拥有**英特尔**（**Intel**）、**AMD**、**英伟达**、我们的团队、**ARM**，你拥有**ARM**最优秀的团队之一。你可能拥有人才，你拥有世界上最优秀的10个芯片团队中的6个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. Within a few square miles of Santa Clara. You you had **Intel**, you had **AMD**, you had **Nvidia**, you have our team, you have **ARM**, you have one of **ARM's** great teams. You you have maybe talent, you have six of the world's great 10 chip teams.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嗯，我认为擅长制造高速芯片的方法就是制造高速芯片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Um I think the the way you get good at building high-speed chips is to build high-speed chips.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 当你真正这样做的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And when that that's really how you do it and

</details>

**主持人**: 你玩游戏，你就会更擅长游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You play the game, you get better at the game.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。结果你确实更擅长游戏了。而这正是中国芯片生态系统的一个弱点。现在他们正在努力追赶，他们知道在这方面他们落后了。我认为另一方面，他们已经在**开放模型**类别中取得了进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's right. Turns out you get better at the game. And that that's been a a weakness in the Chinese chipm ecosystem. Now they're running hard and and they know they're behind on that. I think on the other side, I think they have pushed ahead in the open model category.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，开源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes, the open source.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: **开源模型**是他们取得进展的一个领域。我认为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: The open source model is an area where they've pushed ahead. I think

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 因为他们是自上而下的经济体，他们能够做出决定，比如我们要为电网带来大量的电力。我们要使我们的电网现代化。所以他们能够带来大量的电力，而这是我们落后的地方。我认为把他们视为对手是不愉快的，我们必须一起解决这个问题。嗯，我认为世界在不是对手的情况下会变得更好，但现在我们是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Because they're a top- down economy, they were able to make decisions like we're going to bring a huge amount of power onto our grid. We're going to modernize our grid. So they were able to bring on huge amounts of power and that's something that we're behind on. I think it's unpleasant to to think of them as as adversaries and we got to figure that out together. Um I think the world is a better place where we're not adversaries but right now we are

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为在工业背景下，我们肯定是对手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And I I think certainly in an in an industrial context we're we're adversaries.

</details>

**主持人**: 有工业背景，然后就像我们讨论的，这实际上有什么影响？我们赢了之后会发生什么？那就是每个开发者都成为100倍的开发者，然后每个知识工作者都成为100倍的知识工作者，以及每一个生物科技创新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's the industrial context and then there's as we discussed what impact does this actually have? What's downstream of us winning? And it's every developer being a 100x developer and then every knowledge worker being a 100x knowledge worker and every biotech innovation.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 递归系统，对吧？它们以快速的速度自我构建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Systems that are recursive, right? That build on themselves at rapid rates

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 有一种巨大的“赢者通吃”的感觉，对吧？对。通过领先，你会进一步领先。你的迭代速度会加快，即使是最初的小差异也会很快被放大。这就是为什么这场竞赛如此重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Have a huge winner take all feel, right? Right. By getting ahead, you get further ahead. Your iteration speed accelerates and even small differences at the beginning are magnified very quickly. That's why this race is so important.

### 特朗普政府的AI政策与盟友关系

**主持人**: 所以，我们在这里，在达沃斯。有很多政治家。我的朋友**David Sax**，播客的联合主持人。他是我们的AI专家。而**特朗普**，无论你是否投票给他，他都非常关注这个问题。**拜登**的团队并没有拉拢硅谷。事实上，他们有点把我们看作问题，在一定程度上妖魔化了我们。你如何客观地看待，你知道，独立于你可能对我们城市的ICE特工或格陵兰岛等问题的感受，你如何看待**特朗普政府**在**AI政策**以及他们对**AI行业**的支持方面的表现？

<details>

And **Trump**, whether you voted for him or not, is very focused on this issue. **Biden**, their team wasn't courting Silicon Valley. In fact, they kind of looked at us as the problem, demonized to a certain extent. How how do you think objectively, you know, independent of how you might feel about ICE agents in our cities or Greenland, etc. How do you think the **Trump administration** is doing on their **AI policy** and the support they're giving the **AI industry**?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为我们在前一届政府犯了一个错误，那就是不向我们的盟友提供芯片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I think we we had made a mistake in the previous administration keeping our chips from our allies.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 让我们暂时把中国分开，但**阿联酋**（**UAE**）显然是盟友。绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Let's keep China separate for a second, but the **UAE** is clearly an ally. Absolutely

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 作为盟友，对吧？现代阿拉伯国家，一直是和平的源泉，很早就与以色列建立了和平，受到巨大的西方影响。嗯，我们不向他们提供芯片，对吧？我们喜欢**沙特阿拉伯王国**（**KSA**）朝着同一个方向发展，不向他们提供芯片，对吧？我们当时做的毫无意义。我们当时建立了一个等级制度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: As an ally, right? Modern Arab nation, been a source of peace, made peace with Israel early on, huge Western influence. And we kept chips from them, right? We like **KSA**, we like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to move in the same direction, kept chips from them, right? We then made no sense. We we then made a hierarchy

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 那让丹麦人感到次等，对吧？我们说：“你是二等朋友。”嗯，坏主意。嗯，我们应该赋能我们的盟友，对吧？所以这是第一件事，我认为前一届政府做得不好。他们根本不理解这一点，而**特朗普**在这方面做得很好。我们不仅希望这些机构、这些国家及其机构使用我们的技术，我们还希望他们在美国投资。而在前一届政府下，财政部有一个令人难以合作的机构，所有这些都得到了很大的改善。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That that made the Danes feel second rate, right? We said, "You are a number two friend." Bad idea. We should be empowering our allies, right? So that's the first thing and and I don't think the previous administration did a good job. They didn't understand that at all and **Trump** did a good job of that. Not only do we want those institutions, those nations and their institutions using our technology, we want them investing in the US and we under the previous administration, we had a cifhious organization in Treasury that was was was difficult to work with and that's all of those much improved and

**Andrew Feldman**: And then all of that energy goes back into our standard now

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 进入我们的生态系统，在我们之上进行开发，进入我们刚刚描述的递归系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Into our ecosystem in a development on top of us into the recursive system we just described.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。如果你看看**华为**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Exactly. And if you look at **Huawei**, right,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 以及他们用5G所做的一切，他们的网络与**思科**（**Cisco**）以及我们的国家冠军竞争，他们在很多国家取得了全面胜利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And what they did with 5G, their networking up against **Cisco** and and you know, our national champions, they they ran the table in a lot of countries.

</details>

**主持人**: 能源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Energy.

**Andrew Feldman**: 能源。另一个领域。嗯，我认为对于像我们这样试图极速增长的公司来说，其中一个致命的问题是必须应对14个不同地区的不同法规，我们正在努力在那里建设数据中心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Uh energy. Another area. Um, I I think one of the things that kills a company like us is trying to grow extremely quickly is having to deal with different regulations in each of 14 localities we're trying to put data centers.

</details>

**主持人**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 对。那太残酷了。对。当你试图快速增长时，你最不希望看到的是有17位律师，每个人都在试图弄清楚当地的法规，对吧？所以他努力说，看，让我们制定一些合理的全国性法律。这显然是明智的，如果我们能得到一些资金来改善全国电网，那也会非常有帮助。所有这些都极其积极。他与能源部所做的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. That that is brutal. Right. What what you don't want when you're trying to grow really quickly is to have 17 lawyers, each of whom is trying to figure out the the local, right? And so his effort to try and say, look, let's get some reasonable laws across the board. That's obviously smart and if we could get some money to to to improve the grid across the nation that also be really helpful. All of those are extremely positive.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. Under uh I think it's called uh is it the **Genesis program**? I think it's sort of the equivalent of a **Manhattan project** for **AI**. Of course, we need this. Of course, we need to be thinking among our researchers, not how we can get a little bit faster, 10 or 20, but what can we use **AI** to to increase the rate of research by 5x, by 10x, and how can we get the the things that impede government out of the way?

**Andrew Feldman**: 对。所以那些都很好。中国是一个非常棘手的问题。嗯，我不太确定我是否同意目前允许向那里出售**H100**的推动，但不同意我的观点是合理的。我认为它根本不像其他一些问题那样明确。这是一个难题，我认为会有很多不同的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Right. So, those are good. China's a really sticky problem. Um, and I I'm not sure I agree with the the current push to to allow the selling of of **H100s** there, but it's reasonable to disagree with me there. I I think it it is not it is not clear-cut like some of the other ones at all. It's a hard problem, and I I think there going to be lots of different views there.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我不知道你有没有看新闻，但加拿大刚刚与中国建立了强大的联盟，我记得是在我们录制节目的昨天或今天宣布的。这就是**特朗普政府**可以改进的地方，你知道，我们需要维持与邻国的联盟，这样他们才能信任我们。这是我听说的，你知道，在日本待了一段时间，日本人觉得我们可能不是最可靠的伙伴。加拿大觉得我们不是最可靠的伙伴，因为关税问题、军事问题，也许只是政策的不断变化，你知道，一致性在政策制定中非常重要，他们必须知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And I don't know if you've been watching the news, but **Canada** just made a strong alliance with China, announced, I think yesterday or today when we're taping this. And this is where, you know, maybe the **Trump administration** can improve is, you know, we we do need to maintain this alliance with our neighbors so that they don't they feel like they can trust us. This is what I've heard, you know, spending time in **Japan** where the Japanese feel like maybe we are not the most reliable partner. **Canada** feels we're not the most reliable partner because of the tariff issues, military issues and maybe just the constant changing of uh you know consistency is really important in policym and and they have to know

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我认为对于像**加拿大**这样的国家，它拥有大量的原材料出口，对吧？他们有小麦，他们有木材，他们有大量的商品，这些商品要么我们进口，要么他们必须运到别处。我们必须意识到这种地缘政治的现实。他们必须出售他们的原材料，对吧？这是他们出口的很大一部分。他们必须把它卖到某个地方，而中国是一个大买家，对吧？所以我们必须理解，有些国家是自豪的，如果你不断攻击他们，对那里的人民说三道四，那么这就会让领导人有机会说，嘿，中国正在拉拢我们，他们会投资，所以我们为什么不和他们一起建设一些港口呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And I I think for a country like **Canada** that has a huge amount of raw material exports right they have wheat they have lumber they have a huge amount of stuff that that either we imported they got to take elsewhere we we have to be aware of of sort of the real politic of the situation they have to sell their raw material, right, which is a huge part of their export. They have to sell it somewhere and China is a big buyer, right? And and so it's we have to go in understanding that there are nations which are proud and if you're constantly attacking them and saying things to the populace there, well then it gives the leaders the ability to say, well, hey, China is courting us and they're going to invest and so why don't we build some ports with them?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，港口。如果你还没有做过，你应该做一整期节目，关于中国对主要港口和航运的所有权日益增长。当你看到时，这太疯狂了。我的意思是，基本上他们拥有世界上最大的航运线路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, ports. You should do a whole show if you haven't already on the rise of of Chinese ownership of major ports and shipping. It is crazy when you look I mean basically they own the world's large shipping routes.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: **一带一路**战略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: The belt and road strategy

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 而且这真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And it's really

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 如果你走出，我不知道，我不是经常来瑞士，但如果你去第三世界的许多地方，你就会开始看到**比亚迪**（**BYD**）汽车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And then if you get out of sort of I don't know I'm not here in in in Switzerland very often but if you go into many parts of the third world you begin to see **BYD** cars?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。他们现在要把它们运到加拿大了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. They're gonna be shipping them to **Canada** now,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 遍布世界各地。我们看不到，但这令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All over the rest of the world. We We don't see it, but it's unbelievable.

</details>

**主持人**: 我刚刚和妻子在墨西哥城待了几天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I was just in Mexico City with the wife for a couple of days.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 墨西哥城不好玩吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Isn't Mexico City fun?

</details>

**主持人**: 我是第一次去那里。我玩得很开心。食物很棒。我喜欢它。真的很有趣。真的很有趣，很时尚，很棒的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I It's my first time there. I had a delightful time. The food is spectacular. I love it. Really fun. Really fun, trendy, great place.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。氛围很好。而且每辆车都是**比亚迪**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah. Good vibes. And every guard of **BYD**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我们必须思考这个问题。他们谈论的是国家冠军。政府不可能不补贴这些公司30%、40%、50%。我认为他们的目标是让德国人，你知道，英国汽车制造商，他们已经做了很长时间了，但德国人仍然在制造非常棒的汽车。如果这些**比亚迪**，它们正在欧洲站稳脚跟，同样的事情也会发生。就像谁会买一辆4万、5万、6万美元的**宝马**（**Beamer**）、**沃尔沃**（**Volvo**）、**奥迪**（**Audi**），当你能买一辆2万、3万、4万美元的**比亚迪**时？是的，它们是好车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And we got to think about that. And they're talk about national champions. There's no way that the government isn't subsidizing those by 30, 40, 50%. And I think what their goal is to put the Germans, you know, the English car manufacturers, they've been at it for a while, but the Germans are still making pretty great cars. And if these **BYDs**, which they're starting to get footholds in Europe, the same thing will happen. Like who's going to buy a 40, 50, $60,000 **Beamer**, **Volvo**, **Audi** when you can buy a 20, 30, $40,000 **BYD**? Yeah, they're they're nice cars.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们正在倾销价格，而这正是关税旨在保护的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They're price dumping though, and that's what tariffs are meant to protect against.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 他们正在补贴成品，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: They're they're subsidizing at the top of the at the finished product,

</details>

**主持人**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right?

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这有利于整个供应链，对吧？这就是他们试图做的。他们认为电池制造商、变速器制造商，所有这些都在受益，而他们在最顶端进行补贴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: And that benefits the whole supply chain, right? That's what they're trying to do. They think about it as the battery maker, the transmission maker, all are benefiting while they subsidize at the very top.

</details>

### AI与就业：中层管理者的未来

**主持人**: 好的，我们以就业问题结束。让我们拿出水晶球。**微软**、**Uber**、**Coinbase**、**Meta**、**谷歌**。四年前、五年前，他们的员工比现在多，或者持平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: All right, let's end on employment. Let's put the crystal ball out there. **Microsoft**, **Uber**, **Coinbase**, **Meta**, **Google**. Four years ago, five years ago, more employees than they have now or they're flat.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 年轻人的失业率在一些大学年龄段的人群中开始达到10%、20%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Young people unemployment starting to hit 10, 20% among some college age demographics.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道，**David Sax**和我一直在争论这个问题。是**AI**吗？是那些没有职业道德的特权孩子吗？是过度融资和科技公司两年前招聘的消化不良吗？对我来说，看着那些最具创业精神的初创公司，他们用**AI**做了很多事情，他们是**AI优先**的。他们正在构建**AI代理**。他们用**AI**做所有事情，这非常清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know, **David Sax** and I have this debate all the time. Is it **AI**? Is it entitled kids who don't have a work ethic? Is it the overfunding and the digestion or indigestion of tech companies that hired two years out? It's pretty clear to me watching startups who are the most resourceful, they're doing so much with **AI**. They are **AI** first. They're building agents. They're doing everything with **AI**.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 在这个世界上，我们不可能没有**AI替代**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: There's no world in which we're not going to have **AI** displacement.

</details>

**主持人**: **工作岗位替代**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Job displacement.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 这不是它现在被替代的原因，但100%它会到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's not why it's displaced now, but 100% it's coming.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。所以，当你看到它时，你认为它会到来，但今天还不是问题。请定义它何时会到来。为什么它今天还不是问题，当我看到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. So, when you look at it, you're in the camp of it's coming, but it's not an issue today. Define when it's coming. What why it's not an issue today is when I look at the uh

</details>

**主持人**: 那些被解雇的人，特别是中层管理人员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The people who have been let go um in middle management in particular

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，坦率地说，你参与了所有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay be candid where you're on all in you

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 不，我的意思是，这是中层管理。我认为发生的事情是，这是优秀的**SaaS工具**的延迟影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: No I mean this is middle management what I think has happened is this is the delayed impact of good **SAS tools**

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 啊，发生的事情是，你作为领导者和管理者扩展你的影响力，了解正在发生的事情的能力。你的范围变得大得多。所以中层管理的角色，它经常是传递信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Ah that what's happened is your ability to extend your reach as a leader and as manager to stay a breast of what's happening. Your scope is much much bigger. And so the role of middle management, which was frequently to move information.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 管理小团队和传递信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: To manage small teams and move information,

</details>

**主持人**: 让人保持正轨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Keep people on track.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。那个工作的价值已经缩水了。我认为这还不是**AI**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's right. That job h has shrunk in value. I don't think it's yet **AI**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为已经完成了一半。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think halfway there.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。我认为**AI**会到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's right. I think **AI** is coming,

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 但我不认为这就是现在的情况。发生的情况是，这些工作岗位膨胀了，你知道，**Mark Zuckerberg**和**Satya Nadella**，他们有一天看到竞争越来越激烈。这些人群在做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: But I don't think that's what this is. And what happened was there was this ballooning of these jobs and you know **Mark Zuckerberg** and and and **Satcha** they look one day say competition is coming it is much more intense. What are these waves of people doing?

</details>

**主持人**: 老实说，他们正在拖慢我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They're slowing us down let's be honest.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 没错。所以他们也在扁平化他们的组织。所以不仅仅是他们把人调走，而是他们正在改变组织的形状，这就是为什么我认为这还不是**AI**的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: That's right. And so they they're flattening their organizations as well. So it's not just they're moving people out but they're changing the the shape of the organization which is why I don't think it's **AI** yet.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我认为我们将来会看到整个类别，它们效率大大提高，因此需要更少的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. I think what we're going to see down the road is whole categories that that are vastly more efficient and therefore need less people.

</details>

**主持人**: 这很清楚，而且几乎是安息吧，**Scott Adams**，**Dilbert**的创作者，但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's uh pretty clear and it's almost rest in peace **Scott Adams**, creator of **Dilbert**, but

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Huge fan.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，他这周刚刚去世。我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, he just passed away this week. I

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 我看到了。忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: I saw that. Huge fan.

</details>

**主持人**: 多么伟大的人物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What a giant.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 多么伟大的讽刺美国企业界的人物。那个精确的层级已经消失了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: What a giant of of ridiculing corporate America. That exact layer is gone.

</details>

**主持人**: 美国企业界。**Scott**能看到这一切发生，真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Corporate America. It's actually great that **Scott** got to see it.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 发生。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Happen. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 接近尾声了。嗯，我们之前一集没有提到，但安息吧，**Scott Adams**。我认为这是我们结束的好地方，**Andrew**。我知道你还有很多事情要做。祝你在达沃斯玩得愉快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Towards the tail end. And we didn't get to mention it on a previous episode, but rest in peace, **Scott Adams**. I think it's a good place for us to end there, **Andrew**. I know you got a lot to do here. Enjoy your time at Davos.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。如果你看到任何德国人，问他们为什么关闭了他们的核电站。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. If you see any of the Germans, ask them why they turned off their nukes.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: All right.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，这正是对他们的玩笑。**Greta Thunberg**怎么样？你的能源部长**Greta Thunberg**怎么样？你们在做什么？他们关闭了六个核反应堆中的三个。我知道。所以他们决定转而从俄罗斯进口天然气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah, that's right there to joke to them. How's **Greta Thurber**? How is your secretary of energy doing, **Greta Thurberg**? Like, what are you doing? They turned off three of their six nuclear reactors. I know. So they they decided instead to import natural gas from Russia.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 他们从哪里得到的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Where did they get it from?

</details>

**主持人**: 对。从俄罗斯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right. From Russia.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 哦，从俄罗斯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Oh, from Russia.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。糟糕。依赖俄罗斯。真的不聪明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Bad. Depended on Russia. Really not smart.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 是的。不聪明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Yeah. Not smart.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道吗？这一切都因为达沃斯。我责怪**世界经济论坛**和达沃斯。他们完全被关于环境的“美德信号”所迷惑。他们从未从第一性原理出发，审视核能与燃烧化石燃料相比有多安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you know what? All because of Davos. I blame the **WF** and Davos. They literally got so caught up in virtue signaling about the environment. They never just looked from first principles at how safe nuclear is compared to burning fossil fuels.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 核能是安全的，我们可以让它更安全。我们必须投入时间和精力。我上周刚在日本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Nuclear is is is safe and we can make it safer. We got to put the time and effort in. I was just in **Japan** last week.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 他们正在建设新的核反应堆，他们刚刚克服了**福岛**（**Fukushima**）事件，他们意识到：“哦，我们犯了一些错误，把它建在海平面以下。我们不会再犯这些错误了。核能显然是未来的方向。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: They're putting in new nuclear reactors and they just got over a **Fukushima** and they realized, "Oh, we made some mistakes putting it below sea level. We're not going to make those mistakes again. Nuclear is obviously the way to go."

</details>

**主持人**: 让我们做得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Let's get better at it.

</details>

**Andrew Feldman**: 嘿，让我们做得更好。那太棒了，伙计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andrew Feldman**: Hey, let's get better at it. That was awesome, dude.

</details>

**主持人**: 谢谢你的时间和精彩的讨论。你表现得很棒。好了，各位。欢迎回来。我们正在“行骗”。我的意思是，在达沃斯**世界经济论坛**采访顶尖CEO。这是我们第一次来这里，我们玩得很开心。大量的CEO。我们收到了数百份采访请求。我们打算做大概六次。我们的播客朋友**Jake Lucerarian**在这里。你以前上过播客，包括本周的**Startups**和**All-In**。你当然是**Gecko Robotics**的CEO兼联合创始人。你已经做了将近十年了。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Thanks for all the time and for a great discussion. You rocked it. All right, everybody. Welcome back. We're grifting. I mean, interviewing the top CEOs here at Davos, the **World Economic Forum**. This is our first time here and we're having a great time. Tons of CEOs. We've had hundreds of interview requests. We're going to try to do about a half dozen of them. A friend of the pod, **Jake Lucerarian**, is here. You've been on the pod before, both this week in **Startups** and **Allin**. You of course the CEO and co-founder of **Gecko Robotics**. You've been at it for almost a decade now. Yeah.

</details>

### Gecko Robotics：机器人与AI在工业领域的应用

**主持人**: 你制造机器人，就像以前看过播客的人知道的那样，用于检查。这些是专门建造的机器人，用于检查船只、桥梁，或其他任何东西。你在**ChatGPT**和最近的**AI革命**之前很久就开始做这个了。我很好奇，这些机器人是专门建造的，你知道，我认为非常直接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You build robots, as people who have seen the pod before know, inspect. These are purpose-built robots that will inspect ships, bridges, whatever it happens to be. And you started this long before **Chat GPT** and this recent **AI revolution**. I'm curious, these robots which are very purpose-built, you know, I think very straightforward.

</details>

**主持人**: 你开始在它们里面加入**AI**了吗？因为我很好奇，想想你之前的演示。那非常直接，对吧？比如我们知道桥梁，检查桥梁，但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you started to put **AI** into them yet? Because I I was just curious thinking about your previous presentations. It was pretty straightforward, right? Like we know the bridge, inspect the bridge, but

</details>

**主持人**: 现在它能做一些事情，开始自己思考，也许因为**AI**而更具适应性吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Now can it do things and start thinking on its own and maybe be more adaptable because of **AI**?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的，好问题。嗯，我现在改了头衔。现在是首席“行骗”官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah, good question. Well, I changed my title now. It's now chief uh grifting officer.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，首席“行骗”官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, chief drifting officer.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 谢谢。特别是在达沃斯的时候。这是我的头衔。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Thank you. Especially when I'm in Davos. This is my title.

</details>

**主持人**: 你来过几次了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You've been here a couple of times.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah, exactly.

</details>

**主持人**: 你赶上了**DEI**的尾声吗？还有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Did you catch the tail end of the DEI? And

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 我正赶上它的核心时期。是的。所以当时你必须学习一种不同的语言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: I came I came right at the like the heart of it. Yeah. And so it was it was you had to learn a different language actually.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？是的。他们检查了你对ESGDEI流行语的流利程度吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Really? Yes. Did they check your fluency in ESGdei buzzwords?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 他们检查了。他们检查了。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: They did. They did. Well,

</details>

**主持人**: 不，但一切都非常珍贵，现在我想既然**特朗普**在这里，它就有点像实实在在的交易，做生意谈判，而不是这些表演性的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No, but everything was super precious and now I guess since **Trump** is here, it's kind of brass tax like doing business negotiating and like less of this performative stuff.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 实际上今晚有很多表演。嗯，但现在更多地关注于，好吧，让我们言归正传。我们听到很多CEO谈论**AI**，但实际上我已经在国会进行的很多对话都只是关于，好吧，所有**AI**的投资回报率在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: It's a lot actually performance tonight. Um, but there's a lot there's a lot more focus on okay, let's get down to the to the brass tax. We hear a lot of CEOs talking about **AI** and but actually a lot of the conversations I'm having in the Congress already is just about okay, like where's the ROI from all the **AI**?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 商业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Business.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 实际上是商业。实际上是试图回到第一性原理，回到“好吧，你如何真正让**人工智能**兑现承诺并实现投资回报和生产力提升？”有趣的是，很多都归结为**AI**中存在的这个非常有趣的差距，那就是你需要的所有信息和数据集，才能真正将这一切转化为实际的投资回报和生产力提升，特别是对于这些大型基础设施、大型资产所有者，比如世界上的能源、采矿或制造公司。所以这是一个重要的焦点，这就是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: It's actually business. It's actually trying to get to the to the first principles to the roots of okay, how do you actually get artificial intelligence to to deliver on the promise and funny enough a lot of it comes down to this this really interesting gap that's exists in **AI** which is like all the information and data set that you need to actually turn all this into actual return on investment and productivity gains especially for these like large infrastructure large asset owners like the energy or mining or manufacturing companies of the world. So that's a big focus and that's what

</details>

**主持人**: 它真的似乎正在变成一个商业会议。我对我收到的所有纯粹的商业、资本主义、构建产品和服务以改善生活的请求感到震惊。此外，自从你创立公司以来，世界也发生了很大变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It really seems to be turning into a business conference. I was astounded by the amount of inbound I had that was just pure business capitalism building products and services to make life better. Also the world has changed a lot since you started the firm.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我们现在有一种新的“军事2.0”正在发生，我认为你的很多客户群已经从仅仅维护桥梁、隧道和基础设施转向了军事。给我们讲讲这方面的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um we've got a new sort of military 2.0 know thing happening and I think a lot of your customer base moved from just maintenance of bridges and tunnels and infrastructures to military. Tell us about that.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的，没错。是的，没错。我们大约30%的业务是国防。所以，我们，我们工作，或者我应该说战争部。所以很多都集中在如何实际使用技术来对抗中国等国家在制造速度方面的发展速度，其中很大一部分实际上是理解质量和焊缝，将实际的焊缝连接在一起。这实际上是美国的一个巨大瓶颈。我们有，你知道，这些制造和锻造厂已经有100年的历史了，它们今天仍然像100年前那样做事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah, that's exactly. Yeah, that's right. We we do about 30% of our business is defense. So, we we work or department of war, I guess I should say. So a lot of it's focused on how do you actually use technology to you know fight against the speeds of development of of countries like China for example in terms of manufacturing speeds and a big part of that is actually understanding the quality and the and the welds um the putting together the actual welds put pieces together. This is actually a huge bottleneck for the US. We have you know these manufacturing and forges that are 100 years old doing things 100 year old um you know today like they did you know back then.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 所以，我们正在部署的技术，用于帮助制造潜艇的某些部件，或者帮助加快驱逐舰的周转速度，使其能够更快地出海巡逻边境并威慑冲突。嗯，这些就是我们的机器人正在用来帮助加快决策过程并确保准确性的事情。嗯，在某些情况下，**休斯顿海军上将**（**Admiral Houston**）谈到使用**Gecko**构建的技术可以将制造速度提高90%。你知道，你现在看到像**Anduril**这样的公司正在与我们合作。**Palmer**很幸运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: So, the technology that we're using to deploy to help manufacture certain, you know, components of a submarine or or be able to help expedite how fast a destroyer is in turn around to get out and patrolling borders and deterring conflict. Um these are sort of the things that our robots are using to help to speed up decision-m process and make sure you're accurate. Um and so in some cases that **Admiral Houston** has talked about 90% improvements to speed up manufacturing using the technology that **Gecko** builds and you know, you're seeing companies like **Anduril** now you know, working with us. **Palmer** lucky.

</details>

**主持人**: **Palmer Luckey**。是的。当然。而且。

<details>

**主持人**: That's his helicopter up there. He might drop a bomb any minute.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的。我想他很快就要发表演讲了。嗯，所以，嗯，所以看到这种采用真是太棒了。但在能源方面，对吧？那一直是我们公司最大的增长领域。一直是这些大型能源公司和电力公司。他们正在努力弄清楚，好吧，所有这些超大规模运营商都在努力弄清楚如何获得基础设施。他们非常关注资本支出，对吧？那么，如果我们开始玩一个游戏，你知道，我们能够接触到这些问题，接触到这些真正，嗯，你知道，这些GDP驱动型公司。如果我们实际上采取**AI原生**，或者在我们的案例中，我们看到很多公司都是**机器人原生**优先。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah. I think he's doing a speech pretty soon. Um and so um so it's just amazing to see the adoption. But on the energy side, right? Like that's been the biggest the biggest growth areas for our company. It's just been these large energy companies and power companies. They're trying to figure out, okay, all of these um all these hyperscalers are trying to figure out how to get infrastructure. They're focusing on capex a lot, right? Well, what if we started to play a game where, you know, we have access to these problems to these really um, you know, these GDP driver companies. What if we actually took an **AI** native or in our case what we've seen a lot of companies be is like how to be robot native first

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 嗯，通过注入并采取非常积极的方法来实施和利用机器人技术，帮助建立数据基础设施，然后在其上分层**AI模型**，以支持**AI**计划。所以这正是**Gecko**的核心业务。这就是我13年前创办这家公司的原因，其前提是数据很重要，因为它与能够赢得所有游戏有关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Um to support the **AI** initiatives um by injecting and taking a very aggressive approach and how to implement and and put robotics to use to help build up the the data infrastructure to then layer on **AI models**. And so that's at the heart of what **Gecko** does. That's why I started this company 13 years ago with this premise of data matters as it relates to being able to uh to have all the games.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于不了解的人来说，这些机器人内部有传感器，不同的阵列可以检查金属，无论是什么制造品，并直接检查潜艇的焊缝，确保一切都完美无缺。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: For people who don't know, the robots have sensors in them, different arrays that can inspect metal, whatever the fabrication is, and go right to the seams of a submarine and make sure this is all been done perfectly

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 并完美测量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: And measure it perfectly.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 没错。我们制造机器人和传感器，它们四处检查，诊断建成世界的健康状况。这意味着要了解并获取关于建成结构、桥梁、水坝、潜艇等健康状况的最大库存和信息数据库。嗯，现在在这段旅程中，你能够发现，如果你将所有这些信息和数据集中起来，然后在上面分层操作数据，这些数据在这些公司中大部分都存在，形成一个不错的数据基础设施。那么，哇，你就能做出一些非常有趣的决策，因为你可以弄清楚如何延长资产的使用寿命。如果我更努力地推动资产，我能否生产更多？就像，哇，我的重点是如何帮助创造更清洁、更多日产量且成本更低的石油。我用了“更清洁”这个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: That's right. We build the robots and the sensors that go around and look at diagnosing the health of the built world. So that means just like understanding and getting the largest inventory and database of information about the health of build structures, bridge, dams, submarine, whatever it is. Um now in along that journey, you're able to figure out that if you centralize all that information and data and then layer on top of it operational data which exists, you know, for the most part is a decent like infrastructure of sensor data at these companies. Well, wow, you get to make some pretty interesting decisions because you can figure out how to extend the useful life of an asset. And if I push an asset harder, can I produce more? Like wow my focus is how do I help to create cleaner as well as um more barrels per day and at lower costs. I use the word cleaner.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以如果你有一个炼油厂或核电站，你会检查它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So if you have a refinery or you have a nuclear power plant, you inspect it.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 机器人应该致力于解决商业问题。什么是客户试图解决的根本商业问题？如果是生产一桶石油或一度电，或者更快地让一艘船出坞，那就是我们公司构建机器人解决方案的目标。现在，我还没有构建，我们还没有开始构建人形机器人，玩人形机器人的游戏。这实际上是我在你的播客上，实际上是峰会上，我谈到我们将成为**Optimus机器人**的最大采购商，因为真正的问题是如何实际部署机器人？如何让机器人产生投资回报率？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Robots should be dedicated to figuring out how to solve for the business problem. The b what is the fundamental business problem that the customer is trying to to solve for? If it's making a barrel or making a kilowatt or getting a ship out of dry dock faster, that is our initiative and our goal as a company to build robotic solutions towards that. Now, I haven't built we haven't gotten into building the humanoids of playing the humanoid game. And that's actually when I was on your podcast, actually the summit, I talked about we're going to be the biggest um purchasers of the **Optimus robot** is because the real question is how do you actually employ robots? How do you get robots to return ROI?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 因为，你知道，叠衣服和洗碗并不是一个高投资回报率的使用场景。那将是每小时20美元的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Because, you know, folding laundry and cleaning dishes is not a high ROI use case. It's going to be the $20 an hour.

</details>

**主持人**: 你不会支付4万，你知道，或者2万，随便多少。但是，你知道，美国必须成为世界上最擅长利用机器人来制造不公平优势的国家，你知道，与这些公司合作，无论是石油和天然气，无论是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're not going to pay 40,000, you know, for or 20,000 whatever it is. But, you know, US has to be the best in the world at figuring out how to use robots to make um unfair advantages, you know, with these companies, whether it's oil and gas, whether it's

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 电力。我们需要**特斯拉**（**Tesla**）或**Figure**或**波士顿动力**（**Boston Dynamics**）之间的人，那些机器人将会被出售。需要有一个应用层，现场的操作卓越性将会是，那正是我们所拥有的，一个神经系统来汇集所有这些来自机器人的信息，然后你可以在此基础上构建和使用**AI模型**，利用信息数据来开始在现实世界中采取行动。所以你实际上看到它不仅仅是现在发现问题或监控情况，并确认事物正在正确构建，这个核电站或这艘船没有潜在问题，但未来你是否会看到自己实际采取行动来构建和/或修复？是的，那正是我们的路线图，但首先你必须弄清楚，建成世界的状态是什么？健康状况如何？嗯，在修复方面我应该采取什么样的行动？例如，什么样的自动化焊接解决方案是正确的，哪些可以使用关于焊缝完成情况的信息作为反馈，以创建一个焊接的基础模型，成为世界上最擅长焊接的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Power need somebody between **Tesla** or **Figure** or **Boston Dynamics**, those robots are going to be sold. There's going to be need to be an application layer and operational excellence in the field will be that that's exactly what we are with a nervous system to pull all this information from robots together and then you can build and use **AI models** on top of that to use the information data to then also begin to take actions back into the real world. So you actually see it find not just right now you find problems or monitor situations and confirm things are being built properly that there's no potential problems with this nuclear power plant or this ship but down the road do you see yourself actually taking actions to build andor repair? Yeah that's exactly the road map for us but first you have to figure out like what what is the state of the built world? What is the state of the health? Um what sorts of actions should I take when it comes to repair? What sorts of automated welding solutions, for example, are the right ones and which ones could use information about the how well that weld was done is a feedback you to create a foundation model for welding, being the best in the world at welding.

**Jake Lucerarian**: 所以架构。

**Jake Lucerarian**: And so the archite

</details>

**主持人**: 我们会。是的，我们将成为那家制造机器人的公司，既能识别又能解决客户最重要、投资回报率最高的问题，无论是制造新资产，还是运营和维护现有资产。有趣的是，我一直在谈论如何减少人类的危险工作时间？如何延长基础设施资产的使用寿命？如何，你知道，提高容量和生产力，以及防止资产出现故障。有趣的是，这些都是非常容易承保的问题，而且机器人专家或**AI**创始人很少谈论这些，但这却是我的“面包和黄油”。那就是我生活的世界，我穿着钢头靴去理解这些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We're going to Yeah, we're going to be the the company that builds robots um to both identify and then solve for the most important and highest ROI problems for the customers, whether they're manufacturing new assets or they're or they're trying to operate and maintain existing ones. Funny enough, like I've been talking a lot about like how do I reduce hazardous work hours for humans? How do I extend the use life of assets for infrastructure? How do I, you know, increase the capacity and production and and prevent, you know, catch failures from assets. Funny enough, these are all very like easy to underwrite problems and it's something that you don't hear roboticists or **AI** founders talk a lot about, but like that's my bread and butter. That's the world I live in and I wear the steel toe boots to be able to understand the problems.

</details>

**主持人**: 在未来一段时间内，你仍然需要人类参与其中，而且会有大量工作留给焊工，但也可能会创造出新的增量工作岗位，因为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're going to need humans in the loop for some time to come and there are there's going to be plenty of work for welders, but there might also be incremental jobs created because

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah,

</details>

**主持人**: 而且你可能有一个焊工监督10个这样的机器人。你认为会发生这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you'll have one welder maybe supervising 10 of these robots. Is that what you think is going to happen?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 那就是将要发生的事情。你希望能够获得经验和专业知识，以确保机器人真正理解，如果我采取这个行动而不是那个行动，会有什么样的后果。能够，你知道，你还希望能够，我们不需要理解的是，将会有大量的远程操作，特别是对于移动机器人。所以你将会有**人类在环**，只是他们可能不会像以前那样经常在现场。他们可能会更多地，你知道，在一个有空调的建筑里，你知道，能够操作和构建信息和数据来训练基础模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: That's what's going to happen. You want to be able to get the experience and the subject under expertise to make sure the robot is actually understanding like what what are the sorts of ramifications if I do this action versus that action. Be able to, you know, you you want also be able to what we don't, you know, need to understand too is there going to be a lot of tele operations, you know, with mobile robots in particular. And so you're going to have humans in the loop just they might not be in the field as much. They might be more, you know, in a in an AC, you know, uh, building, you know, being able to operate and and build build information and data to train the foundation model.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 如果你认为其中一些工作的风险有多高，那么不让人类冒生命危险去维护桥梁的这一部分可能会很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: If you think how risky some of these jobs are, it might be nice to not have a human risking their life to maintain, you know, this part of the bridge,

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道，尽管他们做那份工作很勇敢很了不起。我们显然在几个世纪以来都对此表示赞赏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know, as brave and amazing it is they're doing that work. And we obviously appreciate appreciate that over the centuries.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 实际上把人类从深海焊接和桥梁攀爬业务中解放出来可能会很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It might be nice to actually take the human out of the deep sea welding and out of the bridge climbing business.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 没错。我的意思是，**Gecko**的故事一直是关于制造机器人，以帮助降低这些有时需要1万小时才能精通的工作的入门门槛，并实际上使其成为你可以在几个月内掌握的东西，你知道，在这些领域使用技术。所以，你知道，无论是制造不同的零件并检查这些零件的质量，还是实际收集信息、数据集，理解要做出什么样的决策。天哪，你面临焊工短缺，检查员短缺，所有这些行业都短缺，你必须能够增强，让一个**家得宝**（**Home Depot**）的员工在几个月内，你知道，能够创造，你知道，赚10万、15万美元，你知道，操作你的机器人，安全地完成工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: That's exactly right. Well, I mean, the story of **Gecko** has been a story of building robots to help to reduce the barrier to entry of these like jobs that sometimes take 10,000 hours to be great at and actually making it something, you know, you can attain within a few months of being able to, you know, use the technology in these fields. And so, you know, whether it's manufacturing different parts and inspecting the quality of those parts or it's actually gathering information, data set, understanding what kind of decisions to make. My goodness, like you have a shortage of welders, you have a shortage of inspectors, you have a shortage of all these trades and you have to be able to augment to take a **Home Depot** employee in a couple months, make them, you know, able to create a, you know, make 100,000, $150,000, you know, running your robot, doing it safely.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 所以，你知道，那是一个令人兴奋的，光明的未来。我认为对我们来说，你知道，在机器人社区中，关键的突破就是你必须让你的机器人进入现场。你必须，嗯，你必须快速失败，并且快速原型化。然后制造它们是一个大问题。所以，当我们专注于这些问题时，因为你知道，在未来5年的这段旅程中，你知道，要成为世界上最擅长利用机器人创造投资回报率的公司，你知道，我们，嗯，那就是我们专注于将自己打造成世界主导的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: And so, you know, that's an exciting, bright future. I think the the key unlock for us, you know, in the robotics community is just like you got to get your robotics into the field. Uh, you got to um you got to fail fast and and also rapidly prototype really quickly. And then manufacturing them is is the big is the big issue. And so you as we focus on these sorts of problems because you know in this journey in over the next 5 years you know to be that company that's the best in the world of taking robots and making ROI from them you know we uh that's that's what we're focused on in terms of setting ourselves up to be the world dominant there.

**主持人**: 你在这里写了一篇社论并发表了。你的社论观点是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you uh wrote an editorial on the way in here and dropped it. What was your take in the editorial?

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 它基本上是关于我们在这里讨论的概念，那就是，你知道，我住在**匹兹堡**。你知道，在某个时候，**匹兹堡**在1930年拥有比纽约更多的百万富翁。它生产了世界上70%的钢铁。嗯，而且，你知道，经济发生了很大变化，现在**匹兹堡**不再发生这种情况了。但是，但是，那里的洞察力和公司，它们仍然是我们经济的支柱。我只是受到启发，你知道，在那个时期，工业革命，钢铁是如何被发明，然后制造，然后分发，以帮助创建我们所依赖的所有基础设施，而且，你知道，那推动了能源或推动了制造业。你知道，那是你需要的基础设施，才能从工业革命中获得所有这些巨大的收益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jake Lucerarian**: It was basically on the concept that we're talking about here which is like you know I'm a I'm a I'm a I live in **Pittsburgh**. You know at some point **Pittsburgh** had like more millionaires in 1930 than New York. It made 70% of the world's steel. Um, and it's, you know, the economy changed a bunch and and that doesn't happen anymore in in **Pittsburgh** and and so but but like the insights and the the companies there like they're still the backbone of our of our economy and and I was just inspired by, you know, in that time frame, the industrial revolution, how steel, you know, was invented and then manufactured and then distributed to help create all the infrastructure that we rely on and, you know, that that that fuels the energy or fuels the manufacturing sectors. You know, it was the it was the infrastructure that you needed to be able to have all these big gains um that came from the industrial revolution.

</details>

**Jake Lucerarian**: 我在社论中谈论的也是同样的事情，那就是我们正在用机器人收集信息和数据集，以帮助支持并创建**AI模型**的基础设施，使其能够真正产生我们所有人都在押注的那种回报。所以，你知道，让人们理解机器人是，你知道，它几乎是，它几乎是获得这些巨大回报的基础，在这些主要存在于这里的行业中。

**Jake Lucerarian**: Same thing is is what I was talking about in the editorial about is what we're doing with robotics collecting information and data sets um to help support um and create uh the avenue uh create the infrastructure for **AI models** to actually be able to you know return the kinds of returns that we're all betting on. So, you know, you it's just important people to understand like that the the robotics is the is the you know, it's almost the it's almost the the foundation to be able to get the massive returns in the sectors that were that are mostly all here.

**主持人**: 通过一些自动化。好吧，那没问题。但是我们真的需要进入现实世界才能获得那些巨大的投资回报率，无论是**Robo Taxi**还是自动驾驶。而且我认为你面临的风险，就像我认为这个论坛一样，就像你说的，它正在改变，存在一个生态系统和一个泡沫，当你生活在某个地方，以某种方式说话，在硅谷，我们只存在于互联网的世界。我们不制造在硅谷开始的那种技术。所以这个能源、金属制造、采矿等所有这些行业，国防等，它们只是，而且当我创办公司时，它们是禁忌话题。所以你根本不会想到那种应用和事物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: With, you know, some automation. Okay, fine. Uh but we really need to get out there in the real world to get that serious ROI, whether it's a **robo taxi** or self. And and I think that the risk you have like with like I think this the forum is like it's like you're saying it's changing right there's like a there's a ecosystem in a bubble when you live in a certain place talking a certain way in Silicon Valley we we only exist in the world of of the internet. We we don't build the kind of technologies that started in Silicon Valley. And so this world of energy of metal manufacturing of of mining all these like sectors defense like they're they're just not and when I was starting the company they were like taboo to talk about. So you just don't think about the kind of you know applications and things you

**Jake Lucerarian**: 你说得完全正确，这就是为什么，你知道，你想到一个令人难以置信的发明，比如**人形机器人**，我和你第一次看到的演示就是叠衣服。天哪。就像，那是我回家后会做的事情。所以机器人就应该做这个。有很多其他重要的，真正重要的应用可以利用这项技术。我住在**匹兹堡**，对吧？所以我能看到一个完全不同的世界，一个完全不同的小泡沫。嗯，然后，你知道，显然去和能源公司的CEO们整天交谈，这改变了你的世界，所以它确实是一个优势，我鼓励你正在交谈的那些初创公司，你知道，专注于那些真正重要的问题，而不是那些对话，走出生态系统，找到真正重要的问题去解决。

There's so many other important like really important applications to use this technology for and I live in **Pittsburgh**, right? So I get to see a completely different world with a completely different little bubble. Um, and then you know going obviously and talking to to CEOs of energy companies all day like it changes your world and so like it really is an advantage and I encourage a bunch of the startups that you're talking to you know to to focus on like where the eyes are not where the conversations are not go out of the ecosystem and find the really important problem to solve.
