title: 人工智能时代人类价值的重塑与重定义
summary: 本演讲探讨人工智能（AI）对就业和人类身份认同带来的深刻挑战。演讲者指出，AI不仅引发就业危机，更可能导致‘目的危机’，即个体价值感和意义感的丧失。文章提出‘GAP圆环’（守护者、适应者、先驱者）框架，重塑人类在AI时代的角色定位，并强调未来价值将从收入转向贡献、传承和认可。为应对这一变革，需要重新设计薪酬体系、改革教育、构建情感基础设施，并进行根本性的文化重塑，以拥抱一个以连接、创造力和同情心为核心的新社会模式。

### AI的冲击：就业危机与目的危机

想象一下，明天醒来，你发现你的工作——你所受的一切训练，让你父母引以为傲的一切，让你觉得自己有价值的一切——都不再需要了。并非因为你做错了什么，仅仅是因为一个AI算法现在能做得更好。以迪拜的医生埃琳娜为例。多年来，她被赋予了生杀予夺的权力。但今天，AI系统能够诊断疾病、设计治疗方案，甚至进行咨询。事实上，她的医院已经在考虑裁减医生人数。埃琳娜不禁思考，如果AI机器能接管大部分医疗工作，那么只剩下人类医生才能做的事情还有什么？对全球数百万像埃琳娜一样的人来说，这已不再是科幻小说，而是正在 unfolding 的现实。而最让我担忧的是，我们可能正走向的，不仅是一场就业危机，更是一场**目的危机**（Purpose Crisis: AI's potential to lead to a profound loss of meaning and sense of self beyond employment）。但如果我们看待这个问题的方式是错误的呢？如果AI不是目的的终结，而是开启一种全新想象的开端呢？我与世界各地的国家领导人合作，塑造国家AI议程，构建数字经济，设计未来城市。无论我走到哪里，无论议程多么技术化，我几乎总会听到同样的问题。第一个是实际的：‘如果AI要接管我们的工作，我们该如何生存？我们如何支付账单？’这确实是房间里的大象。确实，政府和经济学家必须非常紧急地开始工作，重新设计支撑我们社区的系统。但这并不是我今天想聚焦的问题，因为第二个问题更深层：‘AI会让我们变得毫无用处吗？’‘如果我们不工作，我们是谁？’‘如果我不创造价值，我是否还有意义？’

Imagine waking up tomorrow
and realizing your job,
everything that you've trained for,
everything that made your parents proud,
everything that made you feel useful
is no longer needed.
Not because you've done anything wrong,
but simply because an AI algorithm
can now do it better.
Take the example of Elena,
a medical doctor in Dubai.
For years, she was trusted
with life and death decisions.
But today, AI systems
can diagnose diseases,
can design treatments,
can even conduct consultations.
In fact, her hospital is already
considering cutting the headcount
of human physicians.
Elena is wondering,
if AI machines can take over
most of medicine,
what is left that only
a human doctor can do?
For millions like Elena around the world,
this is not science fiction anymore.
This is an unfolding reality,
and the part that worries me the most
is that we might be heading
toward not just a job crisis,
but also a purpose crisis.
But what if we're looking
at this the wrong way?
What if AI isn't the end of purpose,
but rather the beginning
for a new way to imagine it?
I work with country leaders
around the world
to shape national AI agendas,
build digital economies,
and design cities of the future.
And no matter where I go
and how technical the agenda is,
I almost always end up
hearing the same questions.
The first one is practical.
If AI is going to take over our jobs,
how are we going to survive?
How will we pay our bills?
Now that is the elephant in the room, yes.
And indeed, governments and economists
must start working very urgently
to redesign the very systems
that have been sustaining our communities.
But that's not the question
I want to focus on today,
because the second question
runs even deeper.
Will AI make us useless?
If we don't work, then who are we?
If I don't produce,
do I even still matter?

### 身份认同的重塑：从工作到存在

几个世纪以来，我们将身份和价值与我们的所作所为紧密联系在一起。农民、工厂工人、程序员、顾问——工作和职业成了现代社会生活中的组织和定义原则。但这并非总是如此。在工业革命之前，我们的身份认同源于信仰、家庭、社群。工作是生活的一部分，但并非其本身的定义。然后，工业化来了，我们不仅工业化了生产，也工业化了身份认同。“你做什么？”成了“你是谁？”的代名词。而今天的AI，正在彻底瓦解这一模式。AI正在自动化各个领域的任务：在制造和物流、设计、客户服务，甚至创意工作中。AI如今可以作曲、设计代码、插画书籍，以及更多。事实上，**世界经济论坛**（World Economic Forum）预测，到2025年，AI将承担比人类更多的任务，数亿个工作岗位面临风险。但这不仅仅关乎工作。这关乎意义。这关乎尊严。这关乎当曾经赋予我们价值的事物变得过时时会发生什么。如果我们不小心，我们可能会陷入一场“大萧条”——但这次，不是收入的萧条，而是身份的萧条。

See, for centuries,
we've tied our identity
and our worth to what we do.
Farmers, factory workers,
coders, consultants,
work and jobs became the organizing
and defining principle
of our society in modern life.
But it wasn't always this way.
Before the Industrial Revolution,
our identity came from faith, from family,
from community.
Work was part of life.
But it wasn't the very definition of it.
Then came industrialization,
and we didn't just
industrialize production,
we also industrialized identity.
"What do you do"
became shorthand for "who are you?"
And AI today is dismantling,
fully, that model.
AI is automating tasks across the board.
In manufacturing and logistics,
in design, in customer services,
even in creative work.
AI today can compose a music,
can design codes,
can illustrate books, and way much more.
In fact, the World Economic Forum
predicts that by this year 2025,
AI will be doing more tasks than humans,
and hundreds of millions
of jobs are at risk.
But this isn't just about jobs.
This is about meaning.
This is about dignity.
This is about what happens
when the one thing that once gave us value
becomes obsolete.
And if we're not careful,
we might all be heading
toward a great depression.
But this time, not of income,
but of identity.

### GAP圆环：AI时代的人类角色新模型

为了应对这一挑战，我提出一个关于AI时代人类角色的框架，我称之为**GAP圆环**（GAP Circles: A framework categorizing human roles in the AI age into Guardians, Adapters, and Pioneers）。首先是‘守护者’（Guardians）。这些人将由我们人类作为一个物种的生存驱动。他们将工作在医学、生物学、药理学、气候科学等领域。但即使是他们的角色，也将被AI大量重新定义和重塑。以埃琳娜为例，这位医生，现在是一名AI主导的免疫学实验室的**人类验证者**（Human Validator）。她实验室的首席科学家不是人类，而是一个基于全球生物医学数据训练的AI。埃琳娜利用她的医学知识，确保输出在伦理上是合理的，并且与人类相关。接下来是‘先驱者’（Pioneers）。他们由好奇心驱动，而非生存需求。需要明确的是，这两者并不总是并行不悖。他们将是物理学家、科学家、探险家、宇航员、哲学家。一位工作被AI完全取代的物流经理，可能会重拾他对天文学、观星和行星系统的旧日热情，并利用AI驱动的增强工具，成为一名‘宇宙系统架构师’（Cosmic Systems Architect）。这真是一个冗长的职位名称。他与一个接受了数十年天体物理学数据训练的AI合作，共同模拟宇宙，探索我们理解之外的宇宙奥秘。也许有一天，谁知道呢，他们可能会发现外星生命。夹在两者之间的是‘适应者’（Adapters）。这是最大、也可能最被忽视的群体。他们的衡量标准不是产出或头衔，而是他们如何生活、如何连接、如何创造意义。一位平面设计师可能会发现自己需要重新思考她在世界上的位置，因为AI自动化了她的大部分工作，于是她转向社区为基础的创造力。她举办社区艺术工作坊，照顾她的父亲，并主持一个关于情商的播客。她并非传统意义上的雇员，但她深刻地为她的社区做出了贡献。有些人可能会觉得这听起来像一个新的阶级体系，在某种程度上确实如此。但它不会基于财富或地位。守护者和先驱者可能是未来的精英，但不是因为他们拥有什么，而是因为他们的贡献。因此，**传承**（Legacy），而非金钱，将成为未来抱负的货币。而这些圆环很可能是流动的。今天的守护者，未来可能成为适应者。适应者可能会努力成为先驱者，以此类推。随着AI继续重塑工作，这些角色的范围可能会缩小，但它们的意义或价值一定会扩大。并且，毫无疑问，适应者本身也不会被动。他们也会寻求认可，而非财富积累，因为在一个更多由贡献驱动而非金钱驱动的世界里，认可就成了新的身份象征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Let me introduce a framework
for human roles in the age of AI.
I call it the GAP circles.
The guardians,
the adapters,
and the pioneers.
Let's first start with the Guardians.
These are people that will be driven
by our survival as a humanity.
They'll be working
in medicine, in biology,
in pharmacology, in climate sciences.
But even their roles will be heavily
redefined and reshaped by AI.
Take the same person,
Elena, the medical doctor,
now a human validator
in an AI-led immunology lab.
The lead scientist
in her lab isn't a human,
but an AI trained
on global biomedical data.
Elena leverages her medical knowledge
to ensure that the output
is ethically sound
and human-relevant.
Next, we have the pioneers.
Those are driven by curiosity
rather than survival.
And to be clear, these two
don't always go hand in hand.
Will be the physicists,
the scientists, the explorers,
the astronauts, the philosophers.
A logistics manager
whose job has been fully replaced by AI
might find himself leaning
to an old passion for astronomy
and stargazing and the planetary systems.
And he uses AI-powered upscaling tools
to become a cosmic systems architect.
What a mouthful for a job title.
Anyway, he works with an AI
that is trained on decades
of astrophysics data.
Together, they simulate the cosmos.
And they explore together
what lies in the universe
behind our understanding.
And maybe one day, you never know,
they might discover aliens.
Sandwiched between
the two are the adapters.
The largest and probably
most overlooked circle or group.
Those won't be measured
by their output or their titles,
but rather by how they live,
how they connect,
and how they create meaning.
A graphic designer might find herself
rethinking her place in this world,
as AI automates most of her work,
so she pivots to community-
based creativity.
She runs community art workshops,
takes care of her father
and runs and hosts a podcast
on emotional intelligence.
Now, she's not
traditionally employed, yes,
but she deeply contributes
to her community.
Now, some of you might be thinking
this sounds like a new class system,
and in some ways it is.
But it's not going to be based
on wealth or status.
The guardians and the pioneers
might be the elites of the future,
but not for what they own,
but rather for what they contribute.
So legacy, not money,
becomes the currency
of aspiration in the future.
And these circles are likely to be fluid.
So a guardian today might
become an adapter in the future.
An adapter might push themselves
to become a pioneer, and so on.
And as AI continues to reshape work,
these roles might shrink in their scope,
but they will certainly expand
in their meaning or value.
And make no mistake,
the adapters themselves
will not be passive.
They will also seek recognition,
not wealth accumulation,
because in a world that is driven
less by money and more by contribution,
recognition becomes the new status symbol.

### 价值重估：贡献、认可与文化重塑

那么，我们如何才能让这个愿景成为现实呢？首先，我们需要重新思考如何补偿贡献。随着AI减少对传统工作的需求，我们需要设计新的系统，在薪资之外带来价值和安全感。确保每个人都能获得有尊严生活的最低资源保障。在此基础上，人们能获得的额外收入，应取决于他们如何通过为社会做出有意义的贡献来度过时光，例如照顾年迈的父母或种植公共花园，以及通过他们培养的连接和为社区增添的新意义。其次，我们需要重塑教育，不仅传授技能，更要培养品格。情商、伦理、韧性、创造力。教育必须让人们准备好‘归属’，而不仅仅是‘谋生’。第三，我们必须投资于我们的‘情感基础设施’（Emotional Infrastructure: Societal support systems, spaces, and communities designed to help individuals navigate identity shifts and rediscover purpose）。随着工作的消失，身份认同也将随之消失。我们需要空间和社群来帮助人们重新发现真实的自我。最后，我们需要一个生态系统来测试这些想法。城市和校园，我们可以试点新的贡献、认可和归属方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Now you might ask,
how can we make this real?
First,
we need to rethink
how we compensate contribution.
As AI reduces the need
for traditional work,
we need to design new systems
that can bring value
and security beyond the paychecks.
Ensuring that everyone
has guaranteed access
to the minimum level of resources
that would allow them
to live with dignity.
But beyond that foundation,
the additional earnings
people will be able to make
should depend on how they spend their time
through the small, meaningful
acts of contribution
that they can bring to their society,
like caring for an aging parent
or planting a public garden.
Through the connections they nurture
and the new meaning
they add in their communities.
Second, we need to rewire
education not only for skills,
but also for character.
Emotional intelligence,
ethics, resilience, creativity.
Education must prepare people
not only to earn, but also to belong.
Third, we must invest
in our emotional infrastructure.
As jobs disappear, so will identities.
And we need the spaces and the communities
that can help people
rediscover who they really are.
And finally,
we need the ecosystem
that would allow us to test
all of these ideas today.
Cities and campuses where we can pilot
new ways for contribution,
for recognition and for belonging.

### 想象未来：重塑人类本质与价值

想象一下，每天醒来，你的信息流里不是股票价格，而是你周围那些美好的、微小的贡献：谁今天帮助了一个孩子学会阅读，谁创作了振奋人心的音乐，谁在线上指导了某人，谁今天做了一个鼓舞人心的TED演讲。这些任务和行为，无论其性质多么微小，但它们共同构成了社会的脉搏。让我们诚实地说，这不仅仅是政策问题。这是关于我们社会的根本。我们的社群建立在一个简单的循环之上：人们工作、赚钱、积累和消费。政府对劳动征税来资助公共生活。但在传统工作消失的世界里，这个循环打破了‘生产力即目的’或‘收入即贡献’的假设。所有这些都必须被重新审视和重新想象。所以，未来的真正问题不是‘AI会让我们变得毫无用处吗？’而是‘当我们不再需要仅仅为了生存而工作时，我们选择成为什么？’如果这个未来听起来有些抽象，我想让你们每个人思考生命中最有意义、最特别的时刻——那些你在独处或与所爱之人在一起时会回想起的时刻。这些时刻发生在你的办公桌前吗？还是它们是连接、创造力和同情心的时刻？这就是我们可以并且应该构建的未来。但这不会偶然发生。它需要政策，是的，但更需要一场文化重塑。我们必须停止教导人们，他们的价值只由产出衡量。我们应该开始为工作不再是身份中心而做准备。因为AI时代不仅仅是检验我们的技术，也是检验我们的想象力。所以，让我们更好地想象。让我们把此刻看作一个机会，去重新发现目的，重新定义价值，并重新夺回在AI时代真正作为人类的本质。谢谢。

Imagine waking up
every morning to a daily feed
not filled with stock prices,
but these beautiful
small contributions around you.
Who helped a child,
how to read today,
who composed a new music
that lifted spirits,
who mentored someone online,
who gave an inspiring TED talk today.
Each of these tasks and acts
might be small in their nature,
but together they become
the heartbeat of the society.
And let's be honest,
this isn't just about policy.
This is about the very
foundation of our society.
Our communities have been built
on a simple loop.
People work, earn, accumulate and spend.
Government tax that labor
to fund public life.
But in a world where
that traditional work disappears,
that loop breaks the assumption
that productivity means purpose
or that income means contribution.
All of that has to be revisited
and reimagined.
So the real question in the future
isn't will AI make us useless?
But rather, what do we choose to become
when we no longer
have to work just to survive?
And if that future sounds a bit abstract,
I want each one of you
to think about the most meaningful
and special moments in your life,
the ones that you remember
when you are either alone
or surrounded by those who you love.
Did these moments happen at your desk,
or were they moments of connection,
of creativity and compassion?
That is the future
we can and we should build.
But it won't happen by accident.
It will take policies, yes,
but even more, a cultural reset.
We must stop teaching people
that their worth will only be measured
by their output.
And we should start preparing people
for a future and a world
where work is no longer
the center of identity.
Because the age of AI isn't
just about testing our technology.
It's also about testing our imagination.
So let's imagine better.
Let's take this moment not as an ending,
but as an invitation
to rediscover purpose,
to redefine value,
and to reclaim the very essence
of what it truly means to be a human
in the age of AI.
Thank you.
(Applause)
