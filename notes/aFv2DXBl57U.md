### 乙肝新药突破：治愈的希望与挑战

葛兰素史克（GlaxoSmithKline）公司于2026年1月7日宣布，其正在研发的新型乙肝药物在一项370名患者的试验中显示出显著疗效，患者在接受为期六个月的治疗后，有望实现**功能性治愈**（Functional Cure: 指乙肝病毒不再被检测到，且即使停药也不会复发）。这一消息对于全球数亿乙肝患者而言无疑是重大利好，因为长期以来，乙肝在中国乃至全球都被视为一种难以根治、需要终身服药的疾病。目前全球绝大多数乙肝治疗方案依赖于**核苷类似物**（Nucleoside Analogs: 一类抑制病毒复制的药物），其主要目标是抑制**病毒复制**（Viral Replication），而非彻底清除病毒，因此成功率不足4%。葛兰素史克的新药则展现了实现功能性治愈的可能性，这意味着病毒在体内将不再被检测到。

与现有疗法相比，新型药物的另一大优势在于规避了**耐药性**（Drug Resistance）的风险。乙肝病毒结构相对简单，现有药物通过有限的靶点进行抑制，病毒稍有变异就可能导致药物失效。若患者因工作繁忙等原因不规律服药，病毒变异的风险将大大增加，迫使患者频繁更换药物。近年来，虽然出现了如**干扰素疗法**（Interferon Therapy）等更积极的治疗手段，通过激活人体免疫细胞来对抗病毒，但其疗程长（通常超过一年），且副作用显著，如白细胞减少、甲状腺功能异常等。即便如此，干扰素疗法的治愈率也仅能提升至约10%，且仍存在复发的可能。

要理解葛兰素史克新药的原理，首先需要了解乙肝病毒的特性。乙肝病毒之所以难以治疗，主要在于其复制过程中会产生大量表面抗原，这些抗原在外观上与真实病毒无异，却不具备感染性，导致人体免疫系统难以识别并攻击真正的病毒。病毒需要借助人体细胞的物质进行复制，而现有抗病毒药物难以彻底清除病毒，只能通过“伪装”病毒所需的物质来抑制其复制。然而，这些药物无法有效靶向病毒本身。此前，中国在**丙肝**（Hepatitis C）的综合治疗中，曾采用核苷类似物联合干扰素的方案，旨在快速清除大部分病毒。葛兰素史克的新药则更为直接，它能摧毁病毒复制所需的RNA，一旦病毒复制过程被中断，表面抗原的产生将停止，人体免疫系统得以恢复正常功能，从而将病毒对身体的危害降至最低。

Hello everyone , welcome to experimental news episode 1011 1 on Tuesday January 27 , 202 6. Please stay tuned on January 7 , British pharmaceuticalut company Glaxossmith Klein announced that a new drug it is researching, has proven effective in a 370 patient trial patients with hepatitis B can achieve a functional cure after six months of using the new product. What are your thoughts on Gxosmlein's new drug? The conclusion Glaxoslein's new product is great news for all hepatitis B patients for the past few decades. , a common belief in China has been that hepatitis B is incurable and requires lifelong medication. I myself am a hepatitis B patient who takes medication every day globally. Almost all hepatitis B treatment involves taking nucleide analogs to inhibit viral replication, aiming to clear the virus. The current standard treatment method has a success rate of less than 4 Glaxosmithlein's new drug demonstrates a functional cura bility , meaning that even if patients stop taking the medication, the hepatitis B virus will no longer be detected . Furthermore existing treatment methods have a greater hidden danger drug resistance compared to bacteria. The structure of the hepatitis B virus is simpler for drugs to be effective . O nly ly suppress the virus through a few limited targets . If, the virus undergoes even a slight mutation , the drug will become ineffective . if a patient takes medication, ir regularly , for example, , because they are too busy with work , the virus in their body is likely to mutate . and at that point, they can only switch to a different medication to save their life. In recent years, there have been more aggressive hepatitis B treatment methods, such as interferon therapy. Simply put, this involves forcibly activating the body's immune cells. This therapy is lengthy with treatment course, is generally exceeding one year and is prone to serious side effects, such as a decrease in white blood cell count and thyroid dysfunction, even with such a huge price to pay. Interferon therapy can only increase the cure rate to about 10 %, and there is still a possibility of relapse after stopping the medication to understand the principle of blacksosmithleline's new drug. It is first necessary to understand how the hepatitis B virus works . Hepatitis B is more difficult to treat than other viruses, mainly because its self- replication process produces a large number of surface antigens . These antigens look exactly like real viruses, but they are not infectious. The human immune system cannot recognize them and therefore cannot fight the real hepatitis B virus, The virus needs some materials from human cells to replicated cells since it's impossible to eliminate the virus completely. With . E xis ting antiviral drugs . The next best thing is to camouflage the materials needed by the virus , preventing it from replicating properly . H owever , existing drugs cannot effectively target the virus itself. Issue 165 of sleepy news introduced China's comprehensive treatment plan for hepatitis C , which involves first using nucleide analog drugs to block hepatitis C virus replication, and then using interferon to stimulate the body's immunity. , aiming to quickly eliminate most of the virus Now Glaxossmithlinein's new drug is even more direct . it can destroy the RNA that the virus uses to replicate after the viral replication process is interrupted . the virus can no longer produce surface antigens , and the human immune system can resume normal function. , suppressing the harm caused by the hepatitis C virus to a minimum In addition ,. The cure rate of this new drug can reach up to 20 %, which is 10 % higher than the most ideal existing treatment method .

### 治愈的悖论：药企盈利与市场萎缩

葛兰素史克公司估计，其新型乙肝药物未来可能带来每年27亿美元的年收入。考虑到中国是全球肝癌死亡的主要地区，且超过40%的新诊断肝癌病例和死亡发生在中国，其中56%的患者源于乙肝感染，若新药能成功推广，预计将惠及近9000万中国民众，使其摆脱对肝癌的担忧。然而，从长远来看，一款高度有效的治愈性药物，其最终影响可能是自我消解市场。

以**吉利德科学**（Gilead Sciences）公司在丙肝治疗领域的经历为例。2013年，吉利德开发了高效丙肝药物**Sovaldi**，将治愈率提升至95%以上，患者仅需12周即可痊愈。Sovaldi上市第二年，全球销售额近103亿美元，公司总营收也大幅增长，股价飙升。然而，好景不长，由于丙肝患者群体迅速减少，到2016年，欧美丙肝患者几乎被“清零”，吉利德的股价随之暴跌，市值大幅缩水。

相较之下，葛兰素史克的乙肝新药或许能带来更持久的利润。首先，乙肝一旦治愈，病毒基本不再复发，但病毒仍可能潜伏，需长期监测。其次，乙肝市场远大于丙肝市场，全球有超过2.5亿乙肝病毒携带者，而吉利德Sovaldi上市时丙肝患者仅约500万。即使如此，乙肝新药也需要至少十多年才能显著减少患者数量。葛兰素史克年总收入300亿美元，乙肝新药的贡献上限约20亿美元（约占15%），其产品线更为多元化，不必过分依赖单一药物。

尽管如此，葛兰素史克更担忧的或许是来自中国本土的竞争。吉利德的乙肝药物在2013年上市后不到五年，中国就出现了仿制药。如今，中国新药研发能力显著提升，巨大的乙肝患者群体为本土企业提供了广阔的市场。若葛兰素史克新药成功，预计五年内将面临中国本土企业的激烈竞争。

De of economic development have significantly increased the purchasing power of hepatitis C patients in C hina ,. According to Glaxosm, clientline's estimates, the new hepatitis C drug could bring in 2. 7 billion in annual revenue in the future. liver cancer is a major cause of death in China and China accounts for over 40 % of newly diagnosed liver cancer cases and deaths globally. Analyzing the main causes of liver cancer in C hina . 56 % of patients first contracted hepatitis C . T. He new drug can be successfully promoted . It is optimistically, estimated that nearly 90 million people in China will no longer have to worry about liver cancer. If I still want to be an anchor when sleepy news reaches issue, 10000 , I'll probably have to scramble to buy Glaosmklein's shares . does this mean Glaxosmkleline can make money effortlessly by leveraging the purchasing power of Chinese hepatitis C patients, not necessarily because the longterm impact of introducing a more effective new drug is actually eliminating its own market. Let me give you an example of bacteria in the antiviral field . there is another leading company Gillead Sciences. The hepatitis C they dealt with was also a difficult to treat chronic disease. In 2013 Gilead developed a highly effective drug for hepatitis C . So phos pho ir , which directly increased the cure rate of hepatitis C to over 95 %. Patients can be completely cured after only 12 weeks of treatment in the second year after Giead developed its special drug Sovaldi. The global sales of the drug reached nearly 10 . 3 billion and Gilead's total revenue in the same year was 2 4. 4 billion. So all these . Y eah . S ales grew even better , quickly exceeding $ 20b illi on , and Gilead's stock price nearly tripled ,. However, , the good times didn't last long and Gilleaead's stock price began to plummet because its new drug was too effective by 201 6 hepatitis C patients in Europe, and the United States were almost completely cured. Therefore, from that year on , Gilead's stock price began to fall rapidly, and its market value shrank by nearly one -t as an aside while Gillead was synthesizing S oval di ,. It also synthesized a large number of other valuable molecules , one of which was called G s5 73 4 after the decline in Sovaldi sales ,. And Ebola virus outbreak occurred in A frica , and Gillead rediscovered G s5 73 4, believing it could be an effective treatment for E bola ,. This molecule G s5 73 4 later had another name R emd esi vir , which caused huge controversy in China during the C ovi I d- 19 pandemic ,. However, , compared to G ile ad , Blackosmlinein's hepatitis B drug should be able to generate profits for a longer time. First, regarding the cure of hepatitis B . Once hepatitis B is cured. The human body no longer carries the virus, and there is basically no recurrence Hepatitis B is considered functionally cured ,. However, the virus may also lurk in liver cells and can be activated at any time . If, the immune system has problems , hepatitis B patients may need regular testing for the rest of their lives and cannot be completely cleared of the virus . F urth. Erm ore ,. The hepatitis B market is much larger than the hepatitis C market when Gillead's drug was launched ,. There were only about 5 million hepatitis C patients worldwide ,. But now there are more than 250 million hepatitis B carriers worldwide, even if Blacksom Kin's new drug can clear the hepatitis B virus, it will take at least more than a decade. Half of Gilead's income depends on its hepatitis C drug, so its stock price fluctuated significantly after all patients were cured Blacksom Kline's product line is much healthier now. Blacksomlein's total revenue is 30 billion annually , but its hepatitis B drug contributing a maximum of 2 billion equivalent to about 15 % . I . T here fore , being able to cure hepatitis B is a huge breakthrough , and they don't have to worry about running out of a business if they eliminate hepatitis B compared to the risk of a decline in the number of hepatitis B. Patients. Blacklasosmithline is more worried about its Chinese competitors . Gilliad Sciences launched its hepatitis B drug in 2013 , and in less than five years , China launched its own generic drug decclose 10 years ago. , China's new drug research and development industry was just starting out still needing to imitate the technological routes of European and American companies, and developing new drugs wasn't so easy. Now the gap in R & D capabilities between China and other countries as narrowing , and China itself has an astronomical number of hepatitis B carriers, providing a huge market . If Blacksom Kleline proves its success . It's expected that within five years, , Blacklasom Kleline will face competition from local Chinese companies . There are 90 million hepatitis B virus carriers in C hina . One in every person carries the hepatitis B virus . Y eah . H ow did these hepatitis B patients come about , lee ping message episode 165 analyze this problem. , concluding that the hepatitis B virus already existed in the early stages of civilized society . H owever ,. The incubation period for hepatitis B is very long ,. And if the average life expectancy is low, , infected, people may die before the disease develops . Therefore. Before average, life expectancy increased, it was difficult to discover the impact of hepatitis B on health and thus difficult for large - scale transmission to occur ,. It wasn't until the 197 0s that the European and American medical communities finally confirmed that hepatitis B was a separate disease . however, , a generation before humanity understood the hepatitis B virus , China had already built a vast public health system ,. This health system could cope with more terrible epidemics, such as smallpox, , tuberculosis and polio ,. But due to the scarcity of medical equipment, , needles were often reused , only undergoing simple disinfection ,. The hepatitis B virus is very resistant and requires high temperatures and pressure above 120 degrees Celsius to be eliminated, wiping with alcohol and boiling water is basically ineffective for a time developed. Countries had already promoted the use of disposable syringes, which reduced the likelihood of widespread infections Count even less developed in China, simply couldn't afford vaccines, and their local populations lack the conditions for widespread . only in China, where the grassroots medical environment was neither advanced and nor completely backward, did the use of metal needles lead to the explosive spread of hepatitis B virus H by the 198 0s grassroots hospitals in China reduced the sharing of needles , but at the same time, , another problem emerged . the long-term sale of blood or more precisely blood trafficking. Long-term blood referred to here doesn't mean directly drawing blood and selling it, but rather using centrifuges to extract blood components with the other components being reinfuseed into the human body. If the centrifuge equipment was reused repeatedly, it could lead to entire villages in China being infected with hepatitis B and As from 197 0 to 1991 0 % of newborns in China were infected with the hepatitis B virus Furthermore. The rapid spread of hepatitis B in China coincided with the peak of its population growth in 198 120 million babies were born, and by 1987, this increased to 25 million annually. At that time, most Chinese people were unaware that hepatitis B could be transmitted from mother to child. So the number of HV carriers in China increased rapidly China has the highest number of hepatitis B patients globally So. Why wasn't an effective cure for hepatitis B developed earlier because Chinese society only began to understand the dangers of the hepatitis B virus in the 199 . My relatives and I discovered we were carriers of the hepatitis B virus because the entrance physical examination for middle school in 1992 began testing for hepatitis B . The harm of hepatitis B is often amplified by alcohol consumption under normal circumstances , the hepatitis B virus slowly attacks the DNA of liver cells, and the process of liver cancer is quite long, possibly taking decades to manifest. However, if a patient drinks alcohol , the liver's metabolism of alcohol produces ace aldehyde , causing physical damage to the liver . essentially opening the door for the hepatitis B virus to more easily enter the cells's DNA, coupled with long-term alcohol consumption , potentially leading to cirrhosis. These three attacks together significantly increase the risk of liver cancer before the 198 0s, China didn't have much surplus grain, and people didn't even have enough to eat. So it was impossible to drink alcohol freely . therefore, very few people suffered from alcoholic liver disease . However. As China underwent rapid urban , migrant workers had money to buy alcohol and rural areas also had enough grain to supply distilleries . Str liquor became the main past time for young people moving to cities, and for the rural population and alcoholic liver disease began to explode simultaneously against this backdrop of rampant alcohol consumption . the Chinese health authorities soon discovered that nearly 100 million people were infected with the hepatitis B virus. Which could lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer led . P reed attention to the prevention and control of hepatitis B in 198 9 . The Chinese government and Mer and Co signed an agreement purchasing the complete set of hepatitis B vaccine production technology for a low price of US $ 7m illi on. The Beijing Institute of Biological Products undertook the task of producing the domestic Hepatitis B vaccine . I . A fte r training by American company , China was able to mass produce the hepatitis B vaccine by 199 5 in parallel with the domestic vaccine production line. China included the hepatitis B vaccine in its immunization program, starting in 1992 . If. A pregnant woman was infected with the hepatitis B virus ,. Her child had to be vaccinated within 24 hours of . H owever ,. The vaccine is only for prevention . The first antiviral drugs to treat existing hepatitis B infections didn't become available until 199 8 Before that , patients with hepatitis B could only prolong their lives through conservative treatment to reduce transaminase levels and try to restore liver function in a society where traditional Chinese medicine as rampant If. There is a chronic disease with no effect cure various self-proclaimed miracle. Doctors will inevitably jump out to occupy the market . This pattern also applies to hepatitis B. Those born in the 198 0s should still remember the advertisements they saw on various telephone poles and public toilets when they were young beside treating various veneal diseases and skin diseases . the most common advertisements were for traditional Chinese medicine. Doctors claiming to cure hepatitis B even bought traditional Chinese medicine that claim to cure hepatitis B in a large hospital in Beijing for decades. , no herbal medicine has been proven effective against hepatitis B on the contrary, because traditional Chinese medicine often introduces various strange compounds that the liver has to metabolize. It is highly likely to increase the burden on the patient's liver . further increasing the . Of cirrhosis and liver cancer at the time , the lack of medical knowledge among Chinese people led to rampant misuse of traditional Chinese medicine TC, with most of the hepatitis treatment funds being spent on TC Chinese pharmaceutical companies seriously developing antiviral drugs could not make money in the market . Therefore. Most Chinese pharmaceutical factories chose to collude with so- cal traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to produce ineective TC in 199 9 Blacksomlinein's lemudine was launched in China and ineffective TCm for hepatitis treatment began to withdraw from the market . H owever ,. Even today, , many doctors treating hepatitis still strongly recommend, adding inexplicable TCm treatments when prescribing antiviral drugs to patients. Starting in 2011, China began providing free hepatitis B immunoglobulin in vaccines , achieving a 95 % blockage rate of the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B drugs became a niche market in C hina . therefore, for a long time, , China lacked the motivation to develop hepatitis B drugs only gradually catching up after European and American companies provided development directions. So. What are the potential competitors to Gxosm Kline's hepatitis B drugs behind Blackxosm K lei n , the aforementioned leading antiviral drug company. Gillead has the fastest progress . Gillead currently has two main hepatitis B line. O ne is to know if you're alla fh eno mide , originally a drug for treating hepatitis C , which can prevent the hepatitis B virus from entering liver cells and is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. ,. The other is an oral drug number GS 96 88 , whose mechanism of action is similar to interferon , activating the body's immune system to fight the virus, but with fewer side effects , GS 96 88 is currently in Ph 2 clinical trials if it can be approved for listing and used in combination with Glaxosm Klein's new drug , it can further suppress the hepatitis B virus . I . B esi des these two superpharmaceutical companies ,. There are over 50 companies worldwide, developing new drugs, targeting Blacksosmith Klinein's products with nine drugs, reaching phas e2 or three clinical trials. ,. 10 of these drugs are from China and 14 are from the United S tates ,. Although Chinese pharmaceutical companies are temporarily lagging behind Blacksosmith Klein, they may catch up with Gilead. For example, , the AhhB 13 7 developed by biotech , which targets the hepatitis B virus, reverse transcriptase and liver acid, and has now reached phase 3 clinical trials. Howbo medical was founded in 2009, headquartered in Hangzhou, with offices in the United S tates ,. It has operations in both China and the U based on clinical data habo medicals products have a cure rate of 30 % potentially outperforming Blacksosmith Klein's products. Many new drugs are expensive when they first entered the market, So can ordinaryd Chinese people afford these new drugs In. The past , the cost of innovative drugs for hepatitis C treatment in China was approximately 5000 0 to 10000 yu after insurance negotiations ,. The price could be reduced by a quarter to around 300 00 to 8000 u. Considering that domestic companies have already entered the hepatitis C field Blacksom Kline and Gilead's price reductions may be rapid and significant For example , Mars K eru da , which just entered the Chinese market in 2018, was priced at around 1800 0u . A fte r domestically produced products enter the market ,. The price quickly dropped and now Chinese people can use domestically produced monoclonal antibody drugs from only 300 0 to 4000 yuan in the hepatitis C field ,. Since a local company like Habo medical provides effective competition ,. It may only take 2t o3 years for new hepatitis C drugs to be included in the national medical insurance catalog. A simple calculation of the treatment cost for liver cancer and cirrhosis shows that new hepatitis C drugs can save a significant amount of medical insurance funds. , China has 4500 00 new cases of liver cancer every year. Treatment costs vary greatly depending on the stage of the disease for early stage liver cancer. ,. The surgical cost is generally around 8000 to 1200 0 yu for advanced liver cancer ,. The annual cost of targeted therapy and immunotherapy is approximately 1000 to 2000. Yu. If a patient undergoes a liver transplant , the cost can be even higher based on an average cost of 1500 0 for early and middle stageage liver cancer, the annual cost of liver cancer treatment in China is nearly 6 7.5 billion yu with almost 75 % covered by medical insurance If. The cost of new hepatitis C drugs is 30. The annual savings in medical insurance funds would be nearly 50 billionu, and this doesn't even include the increased productivity gains from patients recover from hepatitis C . Therefore. Even if new hepatitis C drugs are priced at 1000 . the Chinese society will still benefit significantly . Y eah . So. The sooner a new generation of hepatitis C drugs comes to market ,. The better letting British company Glaxsosmithklein earn a large sum of money would be like giving their R & D team. A bonus . Blacksosmithklein is not a charity , but a publicly traded capitalist company whose sole goal is to make money. However, , judging from the development of the hepatitis C cure and the previous development of the highly effective drug for hepatitis B . capitalism also has many advantages . First. As long as there are enough patients , there will definitely be companies that will step forward to research effective treatments . Secondly. Many people might imagine that the most rational choice for a company to make big profits is not to completely cure the disease , but to control the drug's efficacy or the release rate , so that patients keep paying while ensuring the virus continues to spread , thus ensuring sustainable profits ,. However, , the reality of international capitalism encourages competition and patent protection for pioneers is very limited for a company to apply for a drug patent. It must disclose its treatment principles, , and it can only receive protection for a limited time . Therefore. It is impossible for a company to use its technological advantage to prolong the global epidemic and slowly make money. If you don't adequately supply. The effective drug ,. Others will quickly develop similar products and compete for the market . even though companies know that others will compete for the market and follow their . path. They still try to be the leader, because being the leader always provides an opportunity to earn super profits for a few years . perhaps the money earned can be used to develop advanced products in another field, still guaranteeing highpros and high stock prices without being a leader. They don't even have this opportunity. These three characteristics may not be good news for specific companies, but they provide vitality to the entire capitalist system and allow me a patient with a chronic disease to see hope for a cure, even before it becomes widely available. If someone dislikes these multinational corporations profiting from other people's illnesses, criticizing them from a moral high ground is useless a more humane and dynamic research. And development system is needed to replace capitalism before that I want to express my gratitude to Gxosm, Klinein and other companies that are working hard to develop new drugs. Finally, as a hepatitis C patients, I want to remind viewers that including Blackossmith Klein's products, there are nearly 30 effective drugs for hepatitis C under development worldwide and all have entered clinical phase two and three trials. Curing hepatitis C is not a myth nor a distant future, but a realistic goal that can be achieved within a few years. If any, viewers or their family members have this condition, do not trust any traditional Chinese medicine practitioners . Annc remedies for back problems be patient and try to reduce your burden. , only focus on clinical trial data approved by regulatory agencies. This is the to emin, the for concludes . 1011 .

### 百年乙肝：中国传播史与公共卫生应对

乙肝病毒（HBV）的传播在中国有着深厚的历史根源。尽管HBV在人类文明早期就已存在，但由于其潜伏期长且在平均寿命较低的时代不易显现，大规模传播受到限制。直到20世纪70年代，国际医学界才最终确认乙肝是一种独立疾病。然而，在此之前，中国已建立了庞大的公共卫生体系，能够应对天花、肺结核等更严峻的流行病。但受限于医疗设备，针头常被重复使用，仅进行简单消毒。HBV对高温高压（120°C以上）才有效，酒精擦拭和沸水消毒效果甚微。当时发达国家已推广一次性注射器，而中国在医疗条件和经济能力上均无法负担，导致金属针头的重复使用成为乙肝病毒爆发式传播的温床。

到了20世纪80年代，尽管基层医院开始减少针头共用，但“血液贩卖”——更准确地说是血浆分离——成为新的传播途径。通过离心机分离血浆，若设备重复使用，可能导致整个村庄感染乙肝。从1970年至1991年，中国高达10%的新生儿感染了HBV。这一时期恰逢中国人口增长高峰，1981年出生婴儿1200万，1987年增至2500万。当时，大多数中国人对母婴传播的认知不足，乙肝病毒携带者数量迅速攀升，中国成为全球乙肝患者最多的国家。

乙肝危害的显现与酒精消费的增加密切相关。正常情况下，HBV缓慢攻击肝细胞DNA，肝癌的发生可能需数十年。但若患者饮酒，酒精代谢产生的乙醛会损伤肝脏，为HBV入侵DNA打开“方便之门”，长期饮酒更易导致肝硬化。这三者叠加显著增加了肝癌风险。20世纪80年代前，中国粮食短缺，人们难以自由饮酒，酒精性肝病少见。但随着经济发展和城市化进程，农民工有钱饮酒，农村也供应酒厂，酒精性肝病开始爆发。在此背景下，中国卫生部门发现近亿人感染HBV，极易发展为肝硬化和肝癌，遂高度重视乙肝的预防与控制。1989年，中国政府与默克公司（Merck & Co.）合作，以700万美元购得全套乙肝疫苗生产技术，北京生物制品研究所负责国产疫苗生产。1995年，中国实现乙肝疫苗的量产，并于1992年将其纳入免疫规划，对新生儿（尤其是乙肝母亲所生婴儿）进行及时接种。

然而，疫苗仅能预防。首批治疗乙肝感染的抗病毒药物直到1998年才问世。在此之前，患者只能通过保守治疗延缓生命。在**中医药**（Traditional Chinese Medicine: 传统中医药，常包含草药、针灸等疗法）盛行的社会，慢性病缺乏有效治愈手段时，各种“神医”便应运而生。乙肝治疗市场也不例外，许多声称能治愈乙肝的广告充斥街头巷尾。但数十年来，并无草药被证实对乙肝有效。相反，中药常引入肝脏需代谢的复杂化合物，可能加重肝脏负担，增加肝硬化和肝癌风险。当时民众医学知识匮乏，滥用中药导致大量治疗资金被浪费，真正研发抗病毒药物的中国药企难以盈利。因此，多数药厂选择与“伪中医”合作生产无效中药。1999年，葛兰素史克的拉米夫定（Lamivudine）在中国上市，无效中药才逐渐退出市场。但时至今日，仍有医生在处方抗病毒药物时推荐联合使用不明成分的中药。自2011年起，中国开始免费提供乙肝免疫球蛋白和疫苗，阻断率达95%，乙肝药物市场逐渐成为利基市场，中国长期缺乏自主研发乙肝药物的动力，直到欧美企业提供研发方向后才逐渐追赶。

### 资本驱动的创新：新药研发的机遇与未来

在探讨葛兰素史克乙肝新药的潜在竞争者时，吉利德科学公司依然是领跑者之一。吉利德目前有两个主要的乙肝研发管线：一是**来诺昔莫德**（Lenoximofend，原为丙肝药物），能阻止乙肝病毒进入肝细胞，目前处于III期临床试验；二是口服药物**GS-9688**，其作用机制类似于干扰素，通过激活免疫系统对抗病毒，但副作用更少，现处于II期临床试验。若GS-9688获批并与葛兰素史克新药联合使用，有望进一步抑制乙肝病毒。

除了这两家巨头，全球还有超过50家公司正研发针对葛兰素史克产品的药物，其中九款已进入II或III期临床试验，包括10款来自中国，14款来自美国。尽管中国药企目前落后于葛兰素史克，但有望追赶吉利德。例如，**博奥生物**（Bio-Thera Solutions）开发的**BAT137**，靶向乙肝病毒的逆转录酶和肝酸，已进入III期临床。**和铂医药**（Harbour BioMed）成立于2009年，总部位于杭州，在美国设有办公室，其产品基于临床数据显示，治愈率可达30%，潜力超越葛兰素史克。

新药上市初期价格往往高昂，中国普通民众能否负担？过去，中国丙肝创新药物价格约在5000-10000元，经医保谈判后降至3000-8000元。随着国内企业进入丙肝领域，葛兰素史克和吉利德的降价可能加速。例如，2018年进入中国市场的**吗替替诺**（Maviret）定价约18000元，国产产品上市后价格迅速下降，目前国内已能用3000-4000元获得单克隆抗体药物。鉴于**和铂医药**等本土企业提供的有效竞争，丙肝新药可能在2-3年内被纳入国家医保目录。

粗略计算，肝癌和肝硬化的治疗成本远高于新药费用，新药有望为中国医保节省巨额资金。中国每年新增肝癌病例45万，治疗费用差异巨大，早期手术约8000-12000元，晚期靶向/免疫治疗年费约1000-2000元，肝移植费用更高。按中早期肝癌平均15000元计算，年治疗费用近675亿元，其中约75%由医保承担。若新丙肝药物价格为3000元，每年医保基金将节省近500亿元，还不包括患者康复带来的生产力提升。因此，新一代丙肝药物越早上市，社会整体收益越大。

让葛兰素史克赚取巨额利润，如同给其研发团队发奖金。葛兰素史克作为上市公司，其目标是盈利。然而，从丙肝治愈和乙肝新药的开发来看，**资本主义**（Capitalism: 以私有制、市场经济和利润最大化为核心的经济体系）驱动的模式具有优势：只要有足够患者，就会有企业投入研发；其次，尽管有人认为药企会控制疗效以保证持续利润，但国际资本主义鼓励竞争和有限的专利保护。药企必须公开治疗原理，专利保护期有限。若不充分供应有效药物，竞争者将迅速开发类似产品。尽管知道会被竞争，企业仍争当领导者，以期在数年内获得超额利润，并将其用于开发新产品，维持高利润和股价。

这些特点对单一企业而言不一定是好消息，但为整个资本主义系统注入了活力，让慢性病患者看到了治愈的希望。若有人不满跨国药企从疾病中牟利，道德批判无济于事，需要更人道、更动态的研发体系取而代之。在此之前，应感谢葛兰素史克等致力于新药研发的公司。最后，作为一名丙肝患者，我想提醒观众，全球有近30种有效丙肝药物在研发中，均已进入II/III期临床。治愈丙肝并非神话，而是未来几年内可实现的目标。若您或家人患有此病，请勿轻信**中医药**（Traditional Chinese Medicine）偏方，耐心治疗，专注于监管机构批准的临床试验数据。

If the new drug can be successfully promoted . It is optimistically, estimated that nearly 90 million people in China will no longer have to worry about liver cancer. If I still want to be an anchor when sleepy news reaches issue, 10000 , I'll probably have to scramble to buy Glaosmklein's shares . does this mean Glaxosmkleline can make money effortlessly by leveraging the purchasing power of Chinese hepatitis C patients, not necessarily because the longterm impact of introducing a more effective new drug is actually eliminating its own market. Let me give you an example of bacteria in the antiviral field . there is another leading company Gillead Sciences. The hepatitis C they dealt with was also a difficult to treat chronic disease. In 2013 Gilead developed a highly effective drug for hepatitis C . So phos pho ir , which directly increased the cure rate of hepatitis C to over 95 %. Patients can be completely cured after only 12 weeks of treatment in the second year after Giead developed its special drug Sovaldi. The global sales of the drug reached nearly 10 . 3 billion and Gilead's total revenue in the same year was 2 4. 4 billion. So all these . Y eah . S ales grew even better , quickly exceeding $ 20b illi on , and Gilead's stock price nearly tripled ,. However, , the good times didn't last long and Gilleaead's stock price began to plummet because its new drug was too effective by 201 6 hepatitis C patients in Europe, and the United States were almost completely cured. Therefore, from that year on , Gilead's stock price began to fall rapidly, and its market value shrank by nearly one -t as an aside while Gillead was synthesizing S oval di ,. It also synthesized a large number of other valuable molecules , one of which was called G s5 73 4 after the decline in Sovaldi sales ,. And Ebola virus outbreak occurred in A frica , and Gillead rediscovered G s5 73 4, believing it could be an effective treatment for E bola ,. This molecule G s5 73 4 later had another name R emd esi vir , which caused huge controversy in China during the C ovi I d- 19 pandemic ,. However, , compared to G ile ad , Blackosmlinein's hepatitis B drug should be able to generate profits for a longer time. First, regarding the cure of hepatitis B . Once hepatitis B is cured. The human body no longer carries the virus, and there is basically no recurrence Hepatitis B is considered functionally cured ,. However, the virus may also lurk in liver cells and can be activated at any time . If, the immune system has problems , hepatitis B patients may need regular testing for the rest of their lives and cannot be completely cleared of the virus . F urth. Erm ore ,. The hepatitis B market is much larger than the hepatitis C market when Gillead's drug was launched ,. There were only about 5 million hepatitis C patients worldwide ,. But now there are more than 250 million hepatitis B carriers worldwide, even if Blacksom Kin's new drug can clear the hepatitis B virus, it will take at least more than a decade. Half of Gilead's income depends on its hepatitis C drug, so its stock price fluctuated significantly after all patients were cured Blacksom Kline's product line is much healthier now. Blacksomlein's total revenue is 30 billion annually , but its hepatitis B drug contributing a maximum of 2 billion equivalent to about 15 % . I . T here fore , being able to cure hepatitis B is a huge breakthrough , and they don't have to worry about running out of a business if they eliminate hepatitis B compared to the risk of a decline in the number of hepatitis B. Patients. Blacklasosmithline is more worried about its Chinese competitors . Gilliad Sciences launched its hepatitis B drug in 2013 , and in less than five years , China launched its own generic drug decclose 10 years ago. , China's new drug research and development industry was just starting out still needing to imitate the technological routes of European and American companies, and developing new drugs wasn't so easy. Now the gap in R & D capabilities between China and other countries as narrowing , and China itself has an astronomical number of hepatitis B carriers, providing a huge market . If Blacksom Kleline proves its success . It's expected that within five years, , Blacklasom Kleline will face competition from local Chinese companies . There are 90 million hepatitis B virus carriers in C hina . One in every person carries the hepatitis B virus . Y eah . H ow did these hepatitis B patients come about , lee ping message episode 165 analyze this problem. , concluding that the hepatitis B virus already existed in the early stages of civilized society . H owever ,. The incubation period for hepatitis B is very long ,. And if the average life expectancy is low, , infected, people may die before the disease develops . Therefore. Before average, life expectancy increased, it was difficult to discover the impact of hepatitis B on health and thus difficult for large - scale transmission to occur ,. It wasn't until the 197 0s that the European and American medical communities finally confirmed that hepatitis B was a separate disease . however, , a generation before humanity understood the hepatitis B virus , China had already built a vast public health system ,. This health system could cope with more terrible epidemics, such as smallpox, , tuberculosis and polio ,. But due to the scarcity of medical equipment, , needles were often reused , only undergoing simple disinfection ,. The hepatitis B virus is very resistant and requires high temperatures and pressure above 120 degrees Celsius to be eliminated, wiping with alcohol and boiling water is basically ineffective for a time developed. Countries had already promoted the use of disposable syringes, which reduced the likelihood of widespread infections Count even less developed in China, simply couldn't afford vaccines, and their local populations lack the conditions for widespread . only in China, where the grassroots medical environment was neither advanced and nor completely backward, did the use of metal needles lead to the explosive spread of hepatitis B virus H by the 198 0s grassroots hospitals in China reduced the sharing of needles , but at the same time, , another problem emerged . the long-term sale of blood or more precisely blood trafficking. Long-term blood referred to here doesn't mean directly drawing blood and selling it, but rather using centrifuges to extract blood components with the other components being reinfuseed into the human body. If the centrifuge equipment was reused repeatedly, it could lead to entire villages in China being infected with hepatitis B and As from 197 0 to 1991 0 % of newborns in China were infected with the hepatitis B virus Furthermore. The rapid spread of hepatitis B in China coincided with the peak of its population growth in 198 120 million babies were born, and by 1987, this increased to 25 million annually. At that time, most Chinese people were unaware that hepatitis B could be transmitted from mother to child. So the number of HV carriers in China increased rapidly China has the highest number of hepatitis B patients globally So. Why wasn't an effective cure for hepatitis B developed earlier because Chinese society only began to understand the dangers of the hepatitis B virus in the 199 . My relatives and I discovered we were carriers of the hepatitis B virus because the entrance physical examination for middle school in 1992 began testing for hepatitis B . The harm of hepatitis B is often amplified by alcohol consumption under normal circumstances , the hepatitis B virus slowly attacks the DNA of liver cells, and the process of liver cancer is quite long, possibly taking decades to manifest.

Starting in 2011, China began providing free hepatitis B immunoglobulin in vaccines , achieving a 95 % blockage rate of the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B drugs became a niche market in C hina . therefore, for a long time, , China lacked the motivation to develop hepatitis B drugs only gradually catching up after European and American companies provided development directions. So. What are the potential competitors to Gxosm Kline's hepatitis B drugs behind Blackxosm K lei n , the aforementioned leading antiviral drug company. Gillead has the fastest progress . Gillead currently has two main hepatitis B line. O ne is to know if you're alla fh eno mide , originally a drug for treating hepatitis C , which can prevent the hepatitis B virus from entering liver cells and is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. ,. The other is an oral drug number GS 96 88 , whose mechanism of action is similar to interferon , activating the body's immune system to fight the virus, but with fewer side effects , GS 96 88 is currently in Ph 2 clinical trials if it can be approved for listing and used in combination with Glaxosm Klein's new drug , it can further suppress the hepatitis B virus . I . B esi des these two superpharmaceutical companies ,. There are over 50 companies worldwide, developing new drugs, targeting Blacksosmith Klinein's products with nine drugs, reaching phas e2 or three clinical trials. ,. 10 of these drugs are from China and 14 are from the United S tates ,. Although Chinese pharmaceutical companies are temporarily lagging behind Blacksosmith Klein, they may catch up with Gilead. For example, , the AhhB 13 7 developed by biotech , which targets the hepatitis B virus, reverse transcriptase and liver acid, and has now reached phase 3 clinical trials. Howbo medical was founded in 2009, headquartered in Hangzhou, with offices in the United S tates ,. It has operations in both China and the U based on clinical data habo medicals products have a cure rate of 30 % potentially outperforming Blacksosmith Klein's products. Many new drugs are expensive when they first entered the market, So can ordinaryd Chinese people afford these new drugs In. The past , the cost of innovative drugs for hepatitis C treatment in China was approximately 5000 0 to 10000 yu after insurance negotiations ,. The price could be reduced by a quarter to around 300 00 to 8000 u. Considering that domestic companies have already entered the hepatitis C field Blacksom Kline and Gilead's price reductions may be rapid and significant For example , Mars K eru da , which just entered the Chinese market in 2018, was priced at around 1800 0u . A fte r domestically produced products enter the market ,. The price quickly dropped and now Chinese people can use domestically produced monoclonal antibody drugs from only 300 0 to 4000 yuan in the hepatitis C field ,. Since a local company like Habo medical provides effective competition ,. It may only take 2t o3 years for new hepatitis C drugs to be included in the national medical insurance catalog. A simple calculation of the treatment cost for liver cancer and cirrhosis shows that new hepatitis C drugs can save a significant amount of medical insurance funds. , China has 4500 00 new cases of liver cancer every year. Treatment costs vary greatly depending on the stage of the disease for early stage liver cancer. ,. The surgical cost is generally around 8000 to 1200 0 yu for advanced liver cancer ,. The annual cost of targeted therapy and immunotherapy is approximately 1000 to 2000. Yu. If a patient undergoes a liver transplant , the cost can be even higher based on an average cost of 1500 0 for early and middle stageage liver cancer, the annual cost of liver cancer treatment in China is nearly 6 7.5 billion yu with almost 75 % covered by medical insurance If. The cost of new hepatitis C drugs is 30. The annual savings in medical insurance funds would be nearly 50 billionu, and this doesn't even include the increased productivity gains from patients recover from hepatitis C . Therefore. Even if new hepatitis C drugs are priced at 1000 . the Chinese society will still benefit significantly . Y eah . So. The sooner a new generation of hepatitis C drugs comes to market ,. The better letting British company Glaxsosmithklein earn a large sum of money would be like giving their R & D team. A bonus . Blacksosmithklein is not a charity , but a publicly traded capitalist company whose sole goal is to make money. However, , judging from the development of the hepatitis C cure and the previous development of the highly effective drug for hepatitis B . capitalism also has many advantages . First. As long as there are enough patients , there will definitely be companies that will step forward to research effective treatments . Secondly. Many people might imagine that the most rational choice for a company to make big profits is not to completely cure the disease , but to control the drug's efficacy or the release rate , so that patients keep paying while ensuring the virus continues to spread , thus ensuring sustainable profits ,. However, , the reality of international capitalism encourages competition and patent protection for pioneers is very limited for a company to apply for a drug patent. It must disclose its treatment principles, , and it can only receive protection for a limited time . Therefore. It is impossible for a company to use its technological advantage to prolong the global epidemic and slowly make money. If you don't adequately supply. The effective drug ,. Others will quickly develop similar products and compete for the market . even though companies know that others will compete for the market and follow their . path. They still try to be the leader, because being the leader always provides an opportunity to earn super profits for a few years . perhaps the money earned can be used to develop advanced products in another field, still guaranteeing highpros and high stock prices without being a leader. They don't even have this opportunity. These three characteristics may not be good news for specific companies, but they provide vitality to the entire capitalist system and allow me a patient with a chronic disease to see hope for a cure, even before it becomes widely available. If someone dislikes these multinational corporations profiting from other people's illnesses, criticizing them from a moral high ground is useless a more humane and dynamic research. And development system is needed to replace capitalism before that I want to express my gratitude to Gxosm, Klinein and other companies that are working hard to develop new drugs. Finally, as a hepatitis C patients, I want to remind viewers that including Blackossmith Klein's products, there are nearly 30 effective drugs for hepatitis C under development worldwide and all have entered clinical phase two and three trials. Curing hepatitis C is not a myth nor a distant future, but a realistic goal that can be achieved within a few years. If any, viewers or their family members have this condition, do not trust any traditional Chinese medicine practitioners . Annc remedies for back problems be patient and try to reduce your burden. , only focus on clinical trial data approved by regulatory agencies. This is the to emin, the for concludes . 1011 .
