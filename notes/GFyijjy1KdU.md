title: 蒂姆·费里斯：从创伤与抑郁中重塑自我的四大突破性工具与学习心法
---
### 导言：在复杂中寻找简约

每一种心理健康问题或诊断都在增加。我与不同的科学家合作，并在自己身上做了大量实验，因为我从小每年都会经历多次抑郁发作，我想看看我们是否能找到并解决其根本原因。因此，我将分享一些对我非常有帮助的方法。首先是脑刺激，当我做了这个之后，我连续几个月都没有焦虑。还有一种叫做迷走神经刺激的方法，过去30年里被引用最多的科学家之一已经观察到了一系列惊人的益处。

蒂姆·费里斯（Tim Ferriss）在他的播客中与超过800位有影响力的人物对话后，已成为一位优化个人表现的专家。现在，他将最有价值的框架和技巧分享出来，帮助你优化生产力、健康和表现。

<p class="english-text">Every mental health complication or diagnosis is increasing and I've worked with different scientists and done a lot of experimentation on myself having grown up with multiple depressive episodes every year to see if there are root causes that we can address. And so I'll just throw out a few things that have been very, very helpful. First there's brain stimulation. When I did this I had months of no anxiety. Then there's something called Vagus nerve stimulation and one of the most heavily cited scientists of the last 30 years has seen a wild collection of benefits. So, let's talk about that.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tim Ferriss has become a performance hacking expert after speaking with over 800 influential voices on his podcast. Now, he's taking the most valuable frameworks and techniques to help you optimize productivity, health, and performance.</p>
</details>

人们最应该问我的问题是：你如何分解复杂的主题并加速你的学习能力？因为时间是我们最宝贵的不可再生资源之一。我有一个可以应用于任何主题的框架，它包含了**80/20原则**（Pareto's Law: 指大约80%的结果来自20%的原因），也就是选择那20%的重点，来获得你想要的80%的结果。例如，西班牙语有几十万个单词可以学，但只要掌握最常用的500个单词，你几乎可以在8到12周内达到任何语言的合理会话流利度。如果你能掌握这一点，你就领先于世界上99.9%的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you break down complicated subjects and accelerate your ability to learn? Because time is one of our most valuable non-renewable resources. And so I have a framework that you can apply to any subject matter which consists of the 80/20 principle which is picking the 20% to focus on that will give you 80% of what you want. For instance, there's hundreds of thousands of words you could learn in Spanish. But with the most frequently used 500, you can get to reasonable conversational fluency in almost any language in 8 to 12 weeks. And if you figure that out, you're ahead of 99.9% of the world.</p>
</details>

而人们最想问我的问题，则大多围绕心理健康。我觉得我有道义上的责任去帮助别人，因为我曾每周被保姆的儿子性侵。我曾一度濒临自杀。这些经历会产生很多影响，但你可以慢慢地去克服它们。与其感觉自己被它们囚禁，不如学会将痛苦化为良药。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a lot of questions around mental health and I feel like I have a moral obligation to help people because I was sexually abused by a babysitter's son on a weekly basis. I was this close to killing myself. And it can have a lot of effects, but these are things that you can slowly chip away at. And instead of feeling like you're held captive by them, feel like you can take the pain and make it part of your medicine.</p>
</details>

我把自己看作一个自我实验者、学生和老师，按这个顺序排列。但最终的目的，是试图通过复杂性或可能复杂的主题找到简约之处，然后提供某种配方或算法，让人们可以在低风险的情况下进行测试，并希望能有可观的收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think of myself as a self-experimenter, student and teacher in that order. The purpose though ultimately is to try to find simplicity through complexity or topics that can be complicated and then provide some type of recipe or algorithm that people can test with low risk and hopefully a decent amount of upside.</p>

### 元学习：如何更快地掌握任何技能

我们今天将讨论很多不同的事情，所以一个好的起点可能是学习如何学习，尤其是在一个变化如此之快的世界里。很多人被迫重新学习，无论是在专业上还是在其他领域。**元学习**（Meta-learning: 指学习如何学习的方法论）这个词我以前从未听说过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to talk about a lot of different things today. So it probably a good place to start which is learning how to learn and especially in a world that's changing at such speed. There's a lot of people that are being forced into relearning of some sort whether it's professionally or in other domains. So metalarning, I've never heard this term before. How do I learn how to learn better? I would love to because I spend so long as you do speaking to really interesting people and I sometimes worry that some of that information is being wasted.</p>
</details>

基本思想是，与其将不同的学科或领域视为需要独立攻克的孤岛，不如开发一个可以应用于任何主题的通用框架。我通常向大家推荐一个缩写词：**DSS**（Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes: 一种加速学习的框架，包括解构、筛选、排序和激励四个步骤）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The basic idea is this that rather than treat different subjects or fields as these silos that need to be figured out independently, how can you develop just a broad framework that you can apply to any subject matter? And the acronym that I generally recommend folks, DSS, deconstruction, selection, sequencing, stakes.</p>
</details>

首先是解构（Deconstruction），就是把一个相当模糊的目标，比如“学会游泳”或“学日语”，分解成具体的部分。这些目标本身描述性不强。以学游泳为例，解构就是把它分解成各个组成部分。你可以借助专家的帮助非常有效地做到这一点。比如，你想找一位两届奥运会前的银牌得主，你可能花50到100美元就能和他们进行一小时的Zoom通话。你完全可以接触到世界级的人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's deconstruction, which is taking a fairly ambiguous goal like learn to swim or learn Japanese. None of those are actually very descriptive, right? So deconstructing any one of those is taking let's just use the learn to swim as an example and breaking it down into constituent parts. And you can do that very effectively with the help of an expert. You can try to do it yourself but for instance I mean if you want to find a silver medalist from the Olympics two Olympics ago you can probably get on a Zoom call with them for $100 an hour maybe $50 an hour like you do have access to world class talent.</p>
</details>

然后他们会帮你弄清楚所有可能的组成部分。接下来是筛选（Selection），也就是挑选出那20%。这就是80/20原则，即帕累托法则。你挑选出能给你带来80%想要结果的20%的内容。以语言学习为例，你可以很容易地找到词频列表。对于任何一种语言，比如西班牙语或英语，可能有成千上万个单词可以学。但只要掌握最常用的1500个单词，如果你有条不紊地学习，毫无疑问可以在8到12周内达到合理的会话流利度。但你首先需要正确的材料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then they would help you figure out all right there all these different possible components. When you get to the next part which is selection, you're picking the 20%. This is the 80/20 principle, right? Pareto's law. So you're picking the 20% that will give you 80% of what you want. Let's just use language learning in that case. Well, you can very easily find word frequency lists. So for any given language like Spanish, sure, or in English, hundreds of thousands of words you could learn. But with the most frequently used 1500, you can get to reasonable conversational fluency in almost any language in 8 to 12 weeks without question if you approach it methodically. But you need the right material first.</p>
</details>

下一个S是排序（Sequencing），即把学习内容按正确的顺序排列。我觉得这是经常被忽略的神奇酱汁，即学习任何技能的逻辑顺序是什么？你先练习什么？以游泳为例，先别管呼吸。你需要先在泳池浅水区练习身体左右侧滑、蹬壁滑行，然后再考虑呼吸和适应把头埋入水下等问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the next S is sequencing. Putting it in the right order. And I feel like this is the magic sauce that gets lost a lot, which is what is a logical sequence for learning any given skill. What do you practice first? So in the case of swimming for instance, forget about breathing. Like you need to figure out like fuselage right, fuselage left, and gliding, kicking off a wall in the shallow end of a pool before you ever think about breathing and getting comfortable putting your head under water, etc., etc.</p>
</details>

最后一个S代表激励（Stakes），即奖惩措施。你如何确保自己会真正去做你承诺要做的事情？如果信息就是答案，我们早就都成了拥有六块腹肌的亿万富翁了。所以，信息显然是不够的。它必要，但不充分。激励措施驱动行为改变。光有好的意图是不够的，甚至一个系统也不够，你需要强大的激励。比如，你可以给朋友500美元，或者100美元，金额不重要。如果你没有做到你说的，他们就把这笔钱以你的名义捐给你最讨厌的政治候选人。我见过这个方法非常有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so there's the deconstruction, selection, sequencing, and then the last S stands for stakes, which means incentives. So, how do you ensure that you will do actually what it is you say you're committing to doing? If more information were the answer, we'd all be billionaires with six pack abs. So, information is clearly not sufficient. It's necessary, but not sufficient. Incentives drive behavior change. So, you need good intentions are not enough. Even a system is not enough. You need strong incentives. So, right, you could give uh 500 bucks to a friend or 100 bucks, whatever. Does the amount doesn't really matter. And if you don't do what you say you're going to do, they donate it to like your most hated political candidate in your name, right? That's another one that I've seen work really well.</p>
</details>

就是这样，DSS：解构、筛选、排序、激励。如果你按这个顺序完成这些步骤，你的学习能力将会以一种非常有意义的方式飞速提升。同样重要的是要意识到，当你尝试掌握任何新技能时，无论是什么，进步都不会是一条从左下到右上的线性攀升。但如果你事先知道这些困难会来，你就可以为此制定计划，安然度过风暴。所以这一点也非常重要。如果人们期望的是某种线性的、渐进的进步，那是不可能发生的。因此，大多数人在达到任何真正的拐点之前就放弃了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it. That DSS, deconstruction, selection, sequencing, stakes. And if you just check those boxes moving that order, uh, your ability to learn will hockey stick in a really meaningful way. And what's also important to realize when you're trying to tackle any new skill, doesn't matter what it is. There will, it will not be just a linear climb from, you know, bottom, left, upper, right. But if you know in advance that those are coming, then you can have a plan for it and weather the storm. So that's also very important. If people expect some kind of like linear incremental progress, it just ain't going to happen. And so most people quit before they hit any real inflection points.</p>
</details>

### 项目驱动的人生：选择做什么比如何做更重要

我确实经常思考这个问题，并且我已经使用这个框架很长时间了，我不认为它短期内会改变。我几乎做的所有事情都是一个6到12个月的项目，其中包含许多2到4周的实验。我没有，也从未有过5年或10年的长期职业规划。如果你有一个可靠的5到10年计划，那你很可能是在自己能力范围内安全地玩耍，我觉得这是在低估自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think about this a lot and I've used this for a very very long time and I don't see it changing anytime soon. I refined it here and there. Almost everything I do is a 6 to 12 month project. with lots of 2 to four week experiments within that 6 to 12 months. I do not have and I've never had a long-term career plan 5 years, 10 years. If you have a reliable 5 to 10 year plan, you're going to be playing so safely within the bounds of your capabilities that I feel like you're selling yourself short.</p>
</details>

对我来说，关键是项目，并全身心投入其中。但我如何选择项目呢？我根据人际关系和技能来选择项目。也就是建立新的人际关系或深化重要的关系，以及我的学习曲线，即我将要学习的技能。但有一个条件：这些人际关系和技能必须能够超越那个项目本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for me, it's projects and just going 100% into those projects. But how do you pick the project? I pick the projects based on relationships and skills. So new relationships or deepening important relationships and my learning curve skills I'm going to learn and there's a condition though those relationships and those skills have to be able to transcend that project.</p>
</details>

举个例子。我有一个项目是作为顾问为一家名为StumbleUpon的初创公司工作。很久以前，StumbleUpon非常火，它为各种网站带来了大量流量，有点像网站版的Pandora。一两年后，项目没什么进展。但是，我在StumbleUpon和谁一起度过了所有时间？是创始人Garrett Camp，我们成了非常亲密的朋友。我学到了大量关于网络流量的知识，并且能够用我自己的网站和博客作为实验目的地。所以即使项目对我来说归零了，我还是有收获的。几年后，我收到了Garrett的短信，我们见面讨论一个新想法，旨在解决旧金山的出租车问题。不久之后，它被称为Uber Cab LLC，我成了它的顾问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll give you an example. If I have a project which is working on a startup as an adviser that startup was stumble upon. Okay so I'm working on Stumble Upon. Way back in the day Stumble Upon was a huge deal. It delivered a lot of web traffic to various websites. It's kind of like a Pandora for websites. A year or two into that didn't go anywhere. But who was it? I spent all my time with it. Stumbled upon. It was the founder named Garrett Camp and I became really close friends. I learned a ton about web traffic. I was also able to use my own website and blog as a experimental destination. Right? So there was upside even if it went to zero for me. And few years later I get a text from Garrett. we meet up to talk about this new idea which is solving the taxi problem in San Francisco. And then shortly thereafter it was called Uber Cab LLC and I became advised to that.</p>
</details>

我还可以给你举12个这样的例子，第一个项目失败了，但我与某人成了朋友，学到了某些知识，这些都在两个项目之后应用于一个大获成功的项目上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I could give you 12 more examples like that where like the first project failed but I became friends with with person A or B learned C and D and those were applied two projects later to something that was a home run.</p>
</details>

无论你选择玩什么游戏，都需要一个能让你在一连串坏运气中幸存下来的系统。因为命运女神对结果有很大的发言权，有很多事情是你无法控制的。一切都会随着时间滚雪球般地复合增长，只要你不过度押注于任何一个项目（比如在财务上），长期来看是很难输的。你需要能够作为一个团队或个人承受一段非常糟糕的运气的时期，以便让大数定律和统计学在你拥有微弱优势的系统中为你服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lady Fortune has a lot to say about what happens. There are so many things outside of your control that whatever game you choose to play requires a system that allows you to survive a string of very bad luck. Everything snowballs over time and compounds and it's really hard to lose long term as long as you're not overindexing and betting too much on any one project say financially. It's like you need to be able to withstand as a team or as an individual a period of very bad luck in order for the law of big numbers and statistics to work in your favor with a system that gives you a slight edge.</p>
</details>

这就是我对世界的看法，至少在职业选择上是这样。像声誉之类的东西，我认为很多是二阶效应。如果你在优化人际关系和技能，它们会自动发生。这又回到了排序的问题。就像有12个多米诺骨牌，你必须决定按什么顺序排列它们，这样你推倒最小的骨牌，就能推倒更大的，然后是更大的，以此类推。随着时间的推移，如果你考虑每年做两个项目，假设每个项目6个月，这些积累会非常可观。你可以选择做长期贪婪者，而不是短期贪婪者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's just my lens on the world in general at least professional choices and I would say you mentioned a couple of other things right like reputation and so on. I feel like a lot of those are second order effects. They happen automatically if you are optimizing for the relationships and skills. So, this comes back to the sequencing, right? So, it's like which which is the lead domino. So, if you have 12 dominoes, you kind of have to decide in which order you're going to stack them so that you knock over the small domino, knock over the bigger domino, then the bigger, then the bigger, then the bigger. And over time, if you're thinking about doing two projects a year, let's just say if they're 6 months each, that's going to add up. It's going to add up. So, you can afford to be long-term greedy instead of short-term greedy.</p>
</details>

我更喜欢用“能量”而不是“热情”这个词，有几个原因。热情可能指床笫之欢，也可能指基督受难记，是不同类型的热情。我不喜欢不精确的术语。对我来说，“能量”很简单：你是更清醒还是更困倦？你觉得你可以再做5个小时，还是想在15分钟内停止？这些几乎是生物学问题，关于生物状态的问题。所以人们很容易直观地得到“是”或“否”的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like energy over passion for a couple of reasons. Because you could have passion between the bed sheets. You could have the passion of the Christ. You had a different type of passion. I don't like imprecise terms. Energy for me, very simple. It's like, are you more awake or are you sleepy? Right? Do you feel like you can do this for another 5 hours? Do you feel like you want to stop in 15 minutes? These are almost biological questions, like biological state questions. So, it's it's pretty intuitive for people to get to a yes or no.</p>
</details>

### 直面创伤：将痛苦转化为良药

我认为，人类需要确定性，需要有所信仰。如果你的信仰是“不信”才是正道，那么猜猜看？那本身就是一种信仰。我的经验是，如果你想体验自我超越——我认为这对心理健康至关重要——你不一定需要宗教。没有宗教，你也可以拥有非常美好的生活。但我认为，没有敬畏和惊奇，就不可能有美好的生活。而这些是可以被设计、安排和规划到你的生活中的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think that humans need certainty. They need something to believe. And if your belief is that non-belief is the way, well, guess what? I mean, that's a belief. My experience is if you want to experience self transcendence which I think is critical for mental health you don't need religion per se. What you you can have I think a very wonderful life without religion. I don't think it's possible to have a wonderful life without awe and wonder. And those are things you can architect. Those are things you can very much architect and engineer and schedule in your life.</p>
</details>

为什么素食主义和CrossFit（一种健身体系）如此成功？因为它们是宗教。它们可能没有神，但它们有思想领袖，有明确的规则，有社群，有自我强化的机制。这就像是换了个名字的宗教，很多行为和信条都与宗教相似，只是缺少了“宗教”这个词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why have veganism and CrossFit done so well? They're religions. I mean, effectively, they may not have a god, per se. But certainly they have thought leaders, they, you know, Glassman before his fall from grace and so on. Uh various athletes and so on. But it's like clear rules, community, self-inforcing and describing life sports. Yeah. I mean, it's like this is religion just goes by another name. It's a lot of the behaviors, collective behaviors and tenants of religion just lacking the r-word.</p>
</details>

对我来说，风险在于我感到有道义上的责任去帮助别人，这可能会演变成一种救世主情结，因为我过去遭受了很多痛苦。我觉得自己并非独一无二地适合做这件事，但我拥有的经历和视角，让我在与经历某些痛苦的人交谈时显得可信。但这可能会成为一个巨大的、无益的、自我施加的负担，让我觉得有道义责任去做一些事情，甚至不惜牺牲自己的身心健康。所以，我会说这是几年前我就非常清楚地意识到的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the risk for me is that I feel like I have a moral obligation to help people which can turn into a bit of a savior complex because of a lot of the pain that I've suffered in the past. Uh I feel like I am not necessarily uniquely suited, but I have the the experience and the perspective that allows me to be credible when talking to people who are experiencing certain types of pain. And that can become a huge unhelpful self-imposed burden where I feel a moral obligation to do things at the expense of my own mental health or physical health. So I would say that's something that I have very clearly on my radar as of a few years ago.</p>
</details>

我从两岁到四岁，每周都会被保姆的儿子性侵。我对这一切都有非常清晰的记忆。这会塑造你，绝对会。它会产生很多影响，会剥夺你的自主感，也肯定会让我变得过度警惕，我很难相信别人，等等。那是在一个成长关键时期的塑造性经历。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was sexually abused by a babysitter's son from 2 to four on a weekly basis, I would say. Very clear memories of all of it. And that will shape you. I mean, that will definitely shape you. And it can have a lot of effects. It can rob you of agency. it can certainly make you or contribute to me being hypervigilant. I'm very slow to trust and so on and so forth, right? like that is a formative experience at a formative time.</p>
</details>

后来，我认为首先是遗传因素，看看我的家族，我有重度抑郁症的遗传倾向。这表现为，从青春期早期开始，平均每年有三到四次持续数周或数月的抑郁发作。那几乎是你生命中一半的时间。对于可能经历过类似情况的人，我想说，是有工具可以应对的。现在，我从未想过这会成为可能，但现在我大概每两到三年才会经历一次最多几周的抑郁发作。这两个人之间的差异，怎么强调都不过分。这是两种截然不同的人生体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then later had I think number one a genetic predisposition if you just look at my family to major depressive disorder and that showed up as let's call it on average starting in early adolescence like three to four multi-week or multimonth depressive episodes per year. That is half of your lived time. And for people who may have experienced something like this, I will say that there are tools at work. So now, never thought it would be possible, but I would say now I have one depressive episode of a few weeks at most every 2 to 3 years. Now the juxtaposition between those two people is hard to overstate, right? Those are those are two fundamentally different experiences of being a human.</p>
</details>

很多都与我之前提到的一些杠杆有关，比如代谢精神病学、迷幻剂辅助疗法、生物电医学，包括加速经颅磁刺激。这些方法对某些人确实有效，而且效果持久。它们不是一劳永逸的，很少有事情是。但这些是你能够慢慢攻克和熟悉的东西。与其感觉被它们囚禁，不如感觉你可以将这段经历塑造成至少不会让你丧失能力的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um a lot of it ties back to some of the levers I was talking about, right? Metabolic psychiatry, psychedelic assisted therapy, bioelectric medicine, including accelerated TMS. Like these things for certain people really work and can be durable. They're not one and done. Very few things are, but uh these are things that you can slowly chip away at and become familiar with and instead of feeling like you're held captive by them, feel like you can mold the experience into something that is at least not disabling.</p>
</details>

有时候你甚至能让它成为你的助力。我记得大约五六年前，一位非常优秀的心理治疗师对我说：“把痛苦化为你的良药。” 他的意思是，所有那些事都很可怕，没有任何借口。但要把那份痛苦，变成你贡献给世界的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes you can make it enabling. I remember a very good psychotherapist said to me maybe five years ago, six years ago, "take the pain and make it part of your medicine." And it was basically like all that stuff is horrible. Nothing can excuse it. Take that pain and made it make it part of what you offer the world.</p>
</details>

我一直计划在父母去世后写一本关于我的疗愈之旅的书，因为我不想让他们自责。当时的女友在一次用餐时说了一句对我影响巨大的话：“你有没有想过，在你写这本书之前，有多少人会因为自然原因、新冠或其他原因去世？你可能要等10年、15年才会写那本书。想想那些你本可以帮助却没能帮助的人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had always planned on writing a book about it or like my healing journey after my parents passed away cuz I didn't want them to blame themselves. And my girlfriend at the time over a meal said something that had a huge impact, which was, "Have you ever thought about how many people are going to pass away from natural causes or from COVID or anything else before you ever have a chance to write this book?" Cuz you're probably not going to write that book for 10, 15 years. Think of all the people you could have helped that you didn't help.</p>
</details>

于是我想，“好吧，也许我应该在播客上试着谈谈。”但请记住，我的家人都不知道。我很幸运有一位在纽约的密友，黛比·米尔曼（Debbie Milman），她是《设计很重要》（Design Matters）播客的主持人。几年前，她第一次向我坦诚了她童年时期遭受的长期性侵。在那次与女友谈话后，我也向她坦白了，并问她是否愿意和我进行一次可以录音的对话，因为我知道我无法以独白的形式完成。我提前告诉她，我不知道是否会分享这段录音，但我感到有必要至少把它录下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was like, "Okay, maybe I should workshop it on a podcast." But keep in mind, none of my family knew. And so I was very fortunate to have a very close friend who's based here in New York City, Debbie Milman, Design Matters Podcast, one of the longest running podcasts in the world, wonderful human. And she disclosed to me a number of years back for the first time in full fidelity extended childhood sexual abuse. and we talked about it and I came clean with her after that conversation with my girlfriend and I asked her if she would be open to having a conversation with me that we could record but as a conversation because I knew I couldn't do it as a monologue. I just knew I couldn't do it and I told her in advance I said I have no idea if I'm ever going to share this but I feel I feel compelled to at least record it.</p>

我们录制了，并最终在2020年9月左右发布了。对我来说，最震惊的是，我大概有四分之一到三分之一的亲密朋友第一次联系我，向我坦白他们有过类似的经历。这个比例高得惊人。那段时期非常艰难。我愿意承受，我有很强的承受能力，但这很难，因为我会收到那些从未告诉过任何人的朋友们发来的含泪语音备忘录，向我讲述所有发生的细节。那真是撕心裂肺。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so we did and ended up publishing that I want to say in September 2020, something like that. And uh holy shit. I would say the most shocking thing about that to me. I probably had a quarter to a third of my close close friends reach out to me for the first time to talk to anyone and confess that they had had some type of similar experience. I I mean the percentages were staggering. Um that was really hard. Um I was willing to absorb it. I have a lot of capacity for absorbing that type of thing, but it was hard because I would get these tearful voice memos from guys who had never told anyone, giving me graphic details of everything that happened.

很长一段时间里，我把我的心理健康问题看作是需要独立解决的七个问题。但当我愿意重新打开那扇门，审视童年的虐待时，我发现所有问题都与此相关。有时候，你必须戴上防毒面具，走进地窖，去面对它。没有唯一正确的方法。精神病学仍处于黑暗时代，就像300年前的外科手术一样。但仍然有一些方法，虽然我们常常不知道其机制，但似乎对很多人有帮助。

<p class="english-text">For a long time I had let's just call it to pick a number out of thin air it's like okay I have seven mental health psycho emotional challenges I need to address and I was viewing them as independent problems to address. But when I was willing to reopen the door and look at the childhood abuse, everything was tied to that. And sometimes you just have to, you know, put on your gas mask and go into the cellar and contend with that. And there's no one right way to do it. Psychiatry is still in the dark ages. It's where surgery was 300 years ago. But still there are certain things that work often without knowing the mechanism seem to help a lot of people.</p>
</details>

我认为**内部家庭系统**（Internal Family Systems: 由迪克·施瓦茨（Dick Schwarz）创建的一种心理治疗方法）非常有趣。**MDMA辅助心理疗法**（MDMA-assisted psychotherapy: 在受控环境下使用MDMA药物辅助治疗创伤后应激障碍等心理疾病）对创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）非常有效，且通常耐受性良好，但并非适合所有人。还有我提到的其他一些方法，比如家庭系统排列疗法，对很多人也很有帮助。但这不是不可逾越的。

### 创伤的机制：为何童年经历影响深远

我不知道是否有人能很有把握地回答这个问题。但我可以说的是，我既幸运又不幸地拥有对某些事物的近乎影像般的记忆。所以，你有最初的伤害，最初的创伤。但如果你像我一样，能够画出几乎去过的任何建筑、任何餐厅的平面图，那情况就不同了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think anyone can really answer that particularly well with high conviction. But what what I'll say is that uh I am blessed and cursed with a near photographic memory for some things. So you have the original injury, you have the original insult, but if you have, as I do, which is weird, but like I can draw the floor plan of almost any building, any restaurant I've ever been in, even once, I don't know why that is, but I can do that.</p>
</details>

这有好处，但也有很多坏处，尤其是在虐待的情况下。随着你越来越有能力理解世界，意识到发生了什么、正在发生什么、以及可能发生什么，你就可以重新解读那些高保真的记忆。然后你就会意识到，当时那件非常奇怪的事情，远不止是奇怪那么简单，它就是赤裸裸的剥削和虐待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there are upsides to that. There are a lot of downsides, too, in the case of abuse. And as you have greater and greater ability to navigate the world and realize what has happened, what is happening, what might happen, and you can recontextualize high-fidelity memories. Well, then you realize that that thing that was very weird at the time was a lot more than just weird, right? It was just straight exploitation and abuse. So that's the best answer I think I can give to that question.</p>
</details>

我认为，遭受过虐待的人，那些幸存下来并在某种程度上过得很好的人，是出于必要，被迫变得非常善于**区隔化**（Compartmentalizing）。如果你看看一些顶级的特种部队，你会发现那些士兵中遭受过虐待的比例非常高。为什么这会成为一种优势？因为在战场上，在混乱的环境中，人们垂死或面临死亡威胁，你需要在最混乱、最不可预测的环境中冷静有效地行动。区隔化就是一种超能力，你可以基本上分离出来，进入一种观察者状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think people who have been abused are those who survive and do well afterwards in some way are become very good by force, by necessity at compartmentalizing. And uh if you look at some of the very very top tier military special forces units and so on, the percentages of those guys who have been abused very high. Now, why why would that be an asset? Well, if you're in battle, if you're in a chaotic environment where people are dying or at risk of dying and you need to act effectively and calmly in the most disruptive, unpredictable environment imaginable. Compartmentalizing is a superpower, right? where you can basically detach and take this observer status almost as if you're watching yourself doing, you know, kill and capture raids or whatever it might be.</p>
</details>

但当其中一些人回到平民生活时，区隔化就成了家庭生活中的严重障碍和破坏因素。那种超能力变成了一个超级弱点。我认为，在军队之外，对于虐待幸存者来说也是如此。他们可能会完全埋葬它，在潜意识里把它锁起来，直到某个触发因素把它带回水面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but when some of those folks come back to civilian life, the compartmentalization is a severe handicap and disruptor in family life, right? So that superpower becomes a super weakness. And I think that that is true outside of the military for people who survive abuse. They may bury it completely, put it under lock and key subconsciously. So they don't even have explicit recall of the event until perhaps there's some triggering catalyst that brings it back up.</p>
</details>

就我而言，区隔化在某些层面上非常有利。我可以在运动和工作中比很多人更能忍耐，我的疼痛耐受力非常高。但当你烧灼自己的某些方面，不允许某些类型的情感存在时，是需要付出代价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so I would say that in in my case that compartmentalization was uh on some levels very enabling, right? Like I could outlast out endure a lot of people in sports, in work. My pain tolerance was incredibly high. Uh but there's a there is a price to be paid when you cauterize certain aspects of yourself and disallow certain types of emotions. Like there are prices to be paid.</p>
</details>

我认为**迷幻剂**（Psychedelics: 指能改变人的知觉、情绪和思维的物质，在治疗辅助下用于心理治疗）的潜力和前景在很大程度上被夸大了。但就让情感重新上线而言，对我来说，这几乎完全归功于迷幻剂的体验。我大概有20年没哭过了，不记得上次哭是什么时候。然后我会在飞机上看一部非常感人、令人心碎的纪录片时，就开始哭泣。某些情感就这样重新上线了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um I will say that I think the potential and promises of psychedelics by and large are overstated. But in terms of bringing emotions back online, that was almost entirely due to psychedelic experiences for me. I hadn't cried in like 20 years. Couldn't remember the last time I cried. And then I'd be like on a plane watching a really compelling kind of heart-wrenching documentary and just start crying on the plane. What the fuck is going on here? And uh certain emotions just came back online.</p>
</details>

一旦这些情感上线，它们部分地也带回了对那些高保真记忆的重温。因此我经历了一段非常艰难的时期，并最终决定，这就是那块已经被推倒、影响了如此多事情的主导多米诺骨牌。我可以继续用创可贴式的解决方案来修补各种问题，但这只是在堵船身的洞，而不是问为什么船会进水。我决定，我要花6个月的时间，把解决这个问题作为首要任务。

<p class="english-text">And I think that once those were online, that is in part what then pulled along with it, this revisiting of these high-fidelity memories. And then um I had a very rough period because of that and ultimately decided, you know what, like this is the lead domino that has already been tipped over that has affected so many things. I can continue to do patchwork like remediation with band-aid solutions for various things, but I'm just I'm plugging holes in the side of the boat, not asking why it's filling with water in the first place. And I just decided, you know what? I'm just going to take 6 months. And I know psychiatry is pretty messy, but priority number one is to try to find some resolution with this.</p>

### 重塑大脑与心灵的四大突破性工具

在过去的10年里，我观察我的受众，我能想到的每一种心理健康并发症或诊断都在呈指数级增长。慢性焦虑、难治性抑郁症，你能想到的都有。当我看到这样一系列问题时，我试图找出根本原因，而不是仅仅处理症状，否则你最终会用创可贴去处理那些相互关联但被视为孤立的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Looking at my audience over the last 10 years, every mental health complication or diagnosis that I can think of is up and to the right. Just hockey stick. So, chronic anxiety, treatment resistant depression, you name it, right? When I see a constellation of issues like that, I try to identify if I can, not just the symptoms because then you end up putting band-aids on things that are interrelated but treating them as silos, but looking underneath it to see if there are root causes that we can address.</p>
</details>

对于那些正在受苦的人，我想说，社交互动，即真实的、人与人之间的互动，是那个一旦击中就能解决许多其他问题的唯一目标。否则，你将一直在玩“打地鼠”的游戏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To people who are suffering right now, the social interaction, analog human interaction, I would just say is the is the the one target when hit that solves a multitude of other problems that otherwise you'll be playing whack-a-mole with.</p>
</details>

但如果还有遗留问题，比如慢性焦虑、强迫症、精神分裂症、边缘性人格障碍等，有一些方法是我在与不同科学家合作以及在自己身上进行大量实验后发现非常有帮助的。这些方法包括：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if there are then remaining problems with say chronic anxiety, OCD when we get into some slightly trickier terrain, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc. There are a few things that I have found in the course of doing a lot of work with different scientists and also a lot of experimentation on myself having grown up with multiple long duration depressive episodes every year.</p>
</details>

#### 1. 加速经颅磁刺激 (Accelerated TMS)

这是一种特定类型的脑刺激。我所见过的治疗前后的对比效果简直超乎想象，其效果的强度和持久性在某些情况下甚至等同或超过了迷幻剂辅助疗法。**加速经颅磁刺激**（Accelerated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: 一种利用磁场刺激大脑特定区域以治疗抑郁症等精神疾病的非侵入性技术），简称TMS。斯坦福大学的诺兰·威廉姆斯博士（Dr. Nolan Williams）是这方面值得关注的专家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And those are a short list of different types of brain stimulation specifically something called accelerated TMS. The before and afters that I've seen with that are beyond incredible and equal or surpass in some cases the amplitude of effect and the durability of effect of psychedelic assisted therapies. Accelerated TMS, so transcranial magnetic stimulation. And Nolan Williams, Dr. Nolan Williams at Stanford is is a good person to look up for more on that.</p>
</details>

加速TMS指的是一种使用更好的硬件和软件的新协议，它基于一项已经存在了大约40年甚至更久的技术。你不再是每周进行两到三次、持续数月的治疗，而是在连续5天内每天进行10次治疗。你每小时接受一次约8分钟的刺激，连续10个小时，然后连续5天重复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Accelerated TMS refers to a new protocol with better hardware and software of a technology TMS that has existed probably for 40 years if not more on some level and you will instead of doing two or three sessions a week for many months you do 10 sessions a day for 5 days straight. So you are getting stimulated on the hour every hour for about 8 minutes and you do that for 10 hours straight and then you compound that over 5 days.</p>
</details>

举个例子，一个朋友的孩子，一个14岁的少年，有自残行为。父母们只是在等待那个宣告孩子自杀的电话。这种情况持续了两三年。然后在接受加速TMS治疗的三天内，他就像恢复了原来的自己。之后每三到六个月进行一次巩固治疗，效果一直很持久。这种前后的变化怎么强调都不过分，非常惊人。它使用的是磁铁，感觉就像有人在轻轻弹你的头侧。从安全性的角度来看，它非常有吸引力，副作用风险非常非常小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you see for instance uh to give one example a friend's child very terrifying story uh but uh he was a cutter this this 14-year-old self harming. And the parents were just waiting for the call that their child had committed suicide. And this went on for two or three years, I want to say. And then within 3 days of accelerated TMS treatment, it was like reversion back to old self. And then with boosters every say 3 to 6 months, that has been durable. It's the before and after is impossible to overstate. It's pretty wild. It's magnets. The what it feels like is is someone kind of like flicking the side of your head. It's sort of the sensation. It is from a safety profile perspective really compelling. Like the downside risk is very very minimal.</p>
</details>

在我自己最近接受的治疗中，我大概有四到五个月没有任何焦虑。所有那些东西都像被魔杖一挥消失了，我感觉就像每天冥想两次、持续了一年一样。这简直不可思议，非常了不起。而且这有很好的临床证据支持，不仅仅是个人轶事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And me with the most recent sessions that I've done myself, I had probably four to five months of no anxiety. Like all of that stuff vanished as if by magic wand and I felt like I'd been meditating twice a day for a year. I mean it was it was incomprehensible. Uh it was it was really really really uh remarkable. And there's there's good clinical evidence for this. It's not just end of one anecdote.</p>
</details>

#### 2. 代谢精神病学 (Metabolic Psychiatry)

这主要指饮食干预。哈佛大学的克里斯·帕尔默（Chris Palmer）在过去几年里推广了这一概念。**代谢精神病学**（Metabolic Psychiatry: 一个研究新陈代谢与精神健康之间联系的领域，常通过生酮饮食等方式进行干预）特别是指让人们采用**生酮饮食**（Ketogenic Diet: 一种高脂肪、极低碳水化合物的饮食模式，迫使身体燃烧脂肪产生酮体作为能量来源）。有些精神分裂症患者在接受了15种不同药物治疗十年后，通过这种饮食在3到6个月内停掉了所有药物，并保持稳定。这仅仅是通过稳定大脑中的一些物质，包括增加一种非常优质清洁的能源——酮体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you have metabolic psychiatry. Primarily that would be dietary intervention. Chris Palmer at Harvard is is someone who's popularized this in the last handful of years. metabolic psychiatry specifically putting people on a ketogenic diet. You have folks who have been treated with 15 different medications for schizophrenia for a decade who get off all of their medications within 3 to 6 months and stay off simply by stabilizing a handful of things in the brain including adding a very beautiful clean energy source which is ketones.</p>
</details>

生酮饮食或改良生酮饮食，以及外源性酮体（即补充性酮体），对于神经退行性疾病也有很多潜在应用。我现在有三位亲戚患有阿尔茨海默病，我的遗传倾向也很高。所以我从预防的角度也在思考这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are also a lot of possible applications of the ketogenic diet or modified ketogenic diets, exogenous ketones meaning supplemental ketones for neurodegenerative disease. So I have three relatives right now who have Alzheimer's and genetically I'm very predisposed. So I'm thinking a lot about this also from a preventative perspective.</p>
</details>

#### 3. 迷幻剂辅助疗法 (Psychedelic-assisted Therapies)

引用一位非常著名的心理治疗师斯坦尼斯拉夫·格罗夫（Stanislav Grof）的话：“望远镜之于天文学，显微镜之于生物学，迷幻剂将之于心灵。” 我认为这并非夸大其词。我们看到的许多临床结果，比如在难治性创伤后应激障碍患者身上，他们平均被诊断了14到17年，没有任何治疗成功。他们接受两到三次治疗后，我们看到超过50%的患者PTSD完全缓解。这到底是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The psychedelic assisted therapies for various conditions. I do think that psychedelics and this is to quote a very famous psychotherapist named Stanislav Grof. Stan Grof what the telescope did for astronomy what the microscope did for biology psychedelics will do for the mind. I don't think that's an overstatement because a lot of the the clinical outcomes that we're seeing with treatment resistant PTSD, people who've had an average diagnosis duration of like 14 to 17 years, nothing succeeded. They do two to three sessions and then you see like a 50 plus% complete remission of PTSD. I mean, what is going on there?</p>
</details>

我认为这正以一种非常有益的方式，引导我们去质疑精神病学领域的一些基本假设，特别是关于药物处方的假设，这让我非常兴奋。因为有理由认为，你可以解决某些根本原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think in a very productive way leading us to question some of the very fundamental assumptions that are made in the world of psychiatry particularly with pharmaceutical interactions or pharmaceutical prescriptions and that's really exciting to me because I think there is an argument to be made that you can address certain root causes.</p>
</details>

#### 4. 迷走神经刺激 (Vagus Nerve Stimulation)

这是我正在深入研究的另一个领域，我认为它最终可能会变得非常有趣。不过，这方面还有待观察。我个人正在进行实验。关于**迷走神经刺激**（Vagus Nerve Stimulation, VNS: 一种通过电脉冲刺激迷走神经来治疗多种疾病的医疗技术）有很多垃圾信息，你遇到的大部分都是伪科学的胡说八道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's one other that I'm digging into that I think could end up being very very interesting overall. This is one that is sort of TBD. Personally I am experimenting with it but Vegas nerve stimulation. There is a sea of shit floating around related to Vegas nerve stimulation. The vast majority of what you'll bump into is pseudoscientific nonsense.</p>
</details>

迷走神经这个名字有点用词不当，因为它实际上是两束神经，从脑干附近沿着颈部两侧向下延伸。你可以把它们想象成跨大西洋电缆。每束神经大约有10万根纤维，我们只知道其中一小部分的功能。它们向下延伸，触及你能想象到的一切，包括你的肠道。肠道微生物组和大脑之间通过迷走神经进行的交流非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Vegas nerve is a bit of a misnomer because they're actually two bundles of nerves that travel down from around your brain stem down either side of the neck, kind of where you would feel your pulse. It's right alongside the carotid artery. And you can think of them as almost transatlantic cables. So you don't have you have two primary vagus nerves, but there are about a 100,000 fibers in each of them. And we only know what a tiny fraction of those do. They then travel down and they innervate and touch pretty much everything you can imagine, including your gut. And there's some very interesting communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. visa v the Vegas nerve. It's wild.</p>
</details>

我在迷走神经刺激科学领域找到的最可信的声音是一位名叫布莱恩·特雷西博士（Dr. Brian Tracy）的人。他写了一本名为《伟大的神经》（The Great Nerve）的书，是了解这一切的很好的入门读物。他是一位非常可信的科学家，是过去30年里被引用最多的科学家之一。他参与了一家公司的植入物研发，该植入物大小如同一颗鱼油胶囊，通过一个相当小的外科手术植入颈部。几周前，《纽约时报》封面报道了它被批准用于治疗类风湿性关节炎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the most credible voice that I found in the world of Vegas nerve stimulation or VNS for short science is a guy named Dr. Brian Tracy, T R A C Y. He wrote a book called The Great Nerve, which is a very good introductory read on all of this. One of the most heavily cited scientists of the last 30 years. He's incredibly credible. and he co-founded a company I want to say at least 10 years ago or 11 years ago was involved at least as a as a primary scientific adviser for an implant. The implant is about the size of a omega-3 fish oil capsule gets implanted right in the neck. So surgical procedure but pretty minor and that has just been approved. It was the cover of the New York Times a few weeks ago for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
</details>

在某些病症中，你看到的治疗前后对比简直就像科幻小说。一个长期卧床、慢性疲劳的人，接受了这个手术，两周后就能跑上楼梯去赶火车。它似乎对自身免疫性疾病有广泛的潜在应用，比如克罗恩病或肠易激综合征。它似乎还能显著提高**HRV**（Heart Rate Variability: 指逐次心跳周期差异的变化情况，是衡量自主神经系统功能的重要指标）。我有个朋友，前特种部队成员，交感神经过度兴奋，睡眠困难。他尝试了各种方法，HRV只提高了10-15%。使用迷走神经刺激两到四周后，他的HRV增加了两倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the before and after that you see in some of these conditions again is something straight out of science fiction. You see someone who's been mostly bedridden, chronic fatigue, can't hold a job, struggling to interact with their kids, has this procedure, and then like two weeks later they're running up a flight of stairs to catch a train on a trip to Europe and have the problem of too much energy. It seems to have broad potential application to autoimmune conditions. So you might think of say a Crohn's disease or IBS. It seems to have applications to significantly enhancing HRV heart rate variability. So I have a friend who for the longest time he's former tier one operator military. He's got a lot of sympathetic overdrive. So he had trouble sleeping and he tried all sorts of sophisticated breathing programs which can help. He tried cold exposure which can help but those were all incremental gains on his HRV maybe improved 10 to 15% lots of meditation twice a day 10 to 15%. Used vagus nerve stimulation for somewhere between two and four weeks tripled his HRV.</p>
</details>

他使用的设备叫做Gamma Core，是处方设备，应用于颈部，提供每次2分钟的电刺激，每天两次。这似乎能带来一系列下游的益处。目前，迷走神经刺激是我最感兴趣的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The device he used is it is a device. It's called Gamma Core. It's by prescription. It is applied to the neck. It provides electrical stimulation for 2 minutes at a time. I believe it's very very minimal. It's 2 minutes twice a day. I want to say maybe it's 5 minutes twice a day. And that seems to have just a a downstream collection of benefits or potential benefits. I would say Vegas nerve stimulation has top of mind access right now for me in terms of interest.</p>
</details>

### 心理健康的未来：生物电医学的兴起

**生物电医学**（Bioelectric Medicine: 一个利用电信号而非药物来治疗疾病和损伤的医学领域）是一个巨大的类别。无论是加速TMS还是聚焦超声，我认为使用微芯片代替药丸将是一个巨大的增长领域。我们将越来越意识到，有多少东西依赖于免疫反射和由电介导的不同类型的通信，这些都可以通过外部或内部设备（如植入物）来影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bioelectric medicine is a big category. So whether it's accelerated TMS or focused ultrasound uh where you might take something that looks like a hockey puck and put it over your your liver for instance or spleen uh to affect various things. uh using microchips over pills I think is is is a is going to be a huge growth area and that we'll realize more and more how much is dependent on the immune reflex and different types of communication mediated by electricity uh that can be affected by external or internal devices like an implant.</p>
</details>

举个疯狂的事实：人们可能听说过一个基于真实科学的故事，将肥胖小鼠的微生物组移植到瘦小鼠体内，瘦小鼠就会变胖。但如果你在移植前切断迷走神经，这种情况就不会发生。这说明微生物组似乎是通过迷走神经与大脑交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for instance, I'll give you a wild factoid which is people may have heard the story which is based on real science where you transplant the microbiome from say obese mice into lean mice and those lean mice then become obese just by transplanting m the gut microbiome. If you sever the vagus nerve before you do the transplant that doesn't happen. They don't become obese. So what's happening there? It would seem that the microbiome is communicating with the brain viv the vagus nerve.</p>
</details>

我认为我们目前构成对精神疾病“理解”基石的许多假设，在10年内将被证明是完全错误的。其中很大一部分将由对“身体电学”的更好理解来驱动。它将由对大脑中燃料利用如何驱动许多不同精神疾病的更好理解来驱动，这些疾病可以通过提供替代燃料源（如酮体代替葡萄糖）来缓解或完全解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think many of the assumptions that we have currently which form the bedrock of our quote unquote understanding of mental illness and so on are just going to be completely false. They're going to be completely untenable within 10 years. A lot of that I think is going to be driven by a better understanding of the body electric. It will be driven by better understanding of how fuel utilization in the brain drives many different psychiatric conditions that can be mitigated or completely addressed by say providing an alternate fuel source instead of glucose ketones, right?</p>
</details>

但生酮饮食存在巨大的依从性问题。人们不想做，有很多好理由。那么，如何让人们坚持下去呢？也许有其他选择，比如用电来达到系统性抗炎的效果，而不是通过饮食。我认为这是可能的，并且我已经投资了几家旨在实现这一目标的公司。这非常令人兴奋，因为它意味着你可能有影响大脑功能的选择，而不需要服用直接进入大脑的分子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That would be just kind of a simple example. But there's a huge huge compliance issue with the ketogenic diet, right? People don't want to do it for a lot of good reasons. So, how do you get people to stick with it? Well, maybe there are other options for achieving ketogenic like effects such as systemic anti-inflammation with the use of electricity instead of diet. Right? I think that's possible and I've invested in a few companies that are aiming to do that. uh which is very exciting because it means that you might have options for affecting brain function that do not require you to take molecules that get into your brain directly. That's really exciting. So bioelectric medicine I think is going to be a very exciting space to watch.</p>

### 结语：构建可持续的高强度生活

如果这是我在地球上的最后一天，我会和我最亲密的朋友和家人在一起，毫无疑问。我会告诉那些我爱的人我爱他们，并和他们共度时光。不需要任何花哨的东西，可能只是坐在门廊的摇椅上。

<p class="english-text">With my closest friends and family? No doubt. It wouldn't be pizza. It wouldn't be I mean maybe it involves pizza, but it would be telling the people I love that I love them and spending time with them. Doesn't need to be anything fancy. Could be sitting on a porch on a rocking chair.</p>

这可能听起来像个陈词滥调的答案，但我每年都在实践它，我会专门留出时间来做这件事。所以我不是等到最后一天。在投资新的人际关系之前，我会审视我最重要的5到10段关系，问自己去年是否花了足够的时间和这些人在一起。如果答案是否定的，我总是会重新投资于这些人，只有多余的时间才会分配给新的关系。我真正关注的是那些经过时间考验、有着深厚信任的稳固关系。

<p class="english-text">And that might seem like a trite answer, but I am putting that into practice every year with periods of time that are blocked out for this. So, I'm not waiting until my last day. Before investing in new relationships. I look at my top say five to 10 relationships and ask myself did I spend the amount of time I would want to spend with these people last year? And if the answer is no, I always reinvest in those people and only the overflow gets allocated to new relationships. I really focus on the tried and true proven relationships with deep levels of trust over long periods of time.</p>

在生产力方面，我认为每个人都应该给自己一个挑战，每年进行一次为期四周的“迷你退休”，期间你完全不可用，离线。没有笔记本电脑，没有手机，除了可能用Uber、谷歌地图和OpenTable。我推荐这个有几个原因。第一，它能让你在高强度下玩长线游戏，有一个减负阶段。第二，它会迫使你改进所有关于员工自主决策的政策、规则和指导方针。当你回来时，所有这些系统改进都将持续下去。它也迫使你审视那些非商业性的兴趣爱好，看看你是否维持、培养了它们，还是让它们完全萎缩了。如果你因为不知道如何打发时间而感到轻微的恐慌，那是一个很好的警钟。

<p class="english-text">In terms of productivity, and we're talking about weekly architecture, I think everyone should put as a challenge for themselves, particularly if they're an entrepreneur, a 4-week mini retirement once a year where you are unavailable. you are off the grid. No laptop, no phone outside of maybe Uber and Google Maps and Open Table where you are literally completely unavailable. And the reason I recommend that there are a few. Number one, it's going to allow you to play the long game at high intensity having that deloading phase. The second is it will force you to improve all of your policies, rules, guidelines for autonomous decision-making by employees, etc., etc. It'll force you to clarify all of that on a regular basis. So, when you come back, all of those systems improvements will endure beyond the mini retirement, but it's a forcing function. Uh it also forces you to take a very close look at the non-business interests that you have either maintained or cultivated or let atrophy in complete disuse. And if you end up having a slight panic attack because you don't know what to do with your time, that's a great wakeup call.</p>
