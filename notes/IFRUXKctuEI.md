### 人口贩运概况

**旁白**: 如果你认为人口贩运在**加拿大**并不罕见，那你就错了。根据**加拿大统计局**的数据，在**2014年至2024年**之间，警方报告了超过5000起案件。专家表示，这仅仅是冰山一角。该国最高的人口贩运率就发生在这里的**安大略省**。绝大多数受害者是**女性和女孩**，其中大部分年龄在**25岁**以下。人口贩运虽然不构成警方报告犯罪的很大一部分，但它对**边缘化社区**有着重大影响。那么，安大略省究竟发生了什么？为什么它会持续发生？欢迎收听《The Rundown》。数据显示，安大略省的人口贩运率高于全国平均水平。为什么这在这里是一个如此严峻的问题？还能做些什么来阻止它？

**Narrator**: If you think human trafficking isn't rare in Canada, it's not. According to Statistics Canada, between 2014 and 2024, police reported more than 5000 cases. And experts say that's just the tip of the iceberg. And some of the highest rates in the country were right here in Ontario. The vast majority of victims were women and girls, most of them under the age of 25. Human trafficking doesn't make up a huge chunk of police reported crime, but it has a big impact on marginalised communities. So what is actually happening here in Ontario and why does it keep happening? Welcome to The Rundown. Data shows that Ontario's rates of human trafficking exceed the national average is experts. Why this is such a big problem here and now, and what else could be done to stop it?

### 专家介绍

**旁白**: **基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉 (Kiara Gharabaghi)**是**TMU**社区服务学院的院长，以及打击儿童性贩运和在线儿童性剥削中心的联合主任。**利兹·穆利根 (Liz Mulligan)**是**多伦多儿童援助协会 (Children's Aid Society, Toronto)**的接收主管。**梅兰妮·克拉克 (Melanie Clark)**是**圭尔夫警察局 (Guelph Police Service)**的警探。**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德 (Cassandra Diamond)**是反人口贩运专家，也是**BridgeNorth Advocacy**的创始人，该组织致力于终结加拿大的性剥削。感谢三位来到演播室。卡桑德拉，当然，感谢您在线参与这次重要的对话。卡桑德拉，我想先请教您。当我们谈论人口贩运时，您能给我们一个定义吗？它意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Kiara Gharabaghi is the dean of the Faculty of Community Services at TMU, and the co-director of the centre for Combating Child Sex Trafficking and Online Child Sexual Exploitation. Liz Mulligan is director of intake at Children's Aid Society, Toronto. Melanie Clark is a staff sergeant in Investigative services with the Guelph Police Service, and Cassandra Diamond is an anti-human trafficking specialist and founder of BridgeNorth Advocacy, an organisation dedicated to ending sexual exploitation in Canada. I want to thank all three of you for joining us in studio. Cassandra, of course, for joining us on the line for an important conversation. Cassandra, I want to come to you first. When we talk about human trafficking, can you give us a definition? What does it mean?

</details>

### 人口贩运的定义

**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德**: 人口贩运在**加拿大**是一项犯罪。这是一项非常严重的犯罪，包括使用**强迫、欺诈、胁迫或欺骗**，来让受害者做贩运者希望他们做的事情。很多时候，这项犯罪的受害者并没有同意。不像其他人可能同意的，那会被称为性工作者。它们是截然不同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cassandra Diamond**: Human trafficking is a crime here in Canada. It's a very serious crime that includes using force, fraud, coercion and or deception to really get a victim to do what a trafficker would like them to do, oftentimes, all the time, victims of this crime have not given consent. Like perhaps others would have given, which would be called a sex worker. They're very different.

</details>

### 与其他贩运类型对比

**旁白**: 好的，关于这一点，梅兰妮？当我们谈论人口贩运时，它与其他类型的贩运相比如何？当我们想到加拿大时，有时我们会想到毒品贩运。有时我们甚至会想到劳工贩运。它有何不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Okay with that, Melanie? How does it compare when we talk human trafficking? Compare with other types of trafficking? When we think in Canada, sometimes we'll think drug trafficking. Sometimes we'll even think labour as well. How does it differ?

</details>

**梅兰妮·克拉克**: 嗯，就我个人而言，在**圭尔夫**，我们看不到太多劳工贩运，但与毒品贩运相比，我喜欢将两者进行比较，就像**有形与无形**一样。对。所以，对于一个人，你是在谈论一个有形的物品，他们出售的毒品，他们通过一个人获得更多的毒品。这个人被反复地侵犯和虐待。所以这是最邪恶的犯罪，最邪恶的犯罪，因为那样，那种重复的创伤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Melanie Clark**: Well, I personally in Guelph we don't see a lot of labour trafficking, but with the drug trafficking, I like to compare the two as far as the tangible versus the intangible. Right. So with a person, you're talking about a tangible item with the drugs they sell, the drugs, they go get more drugs with a person. That person is being violated and abused over and over and over again. So it's the heinous crime, the most heinous crime because of that, that repeat trauma.

</details>

### 加拿大人口贩运的普遍性

**旁白**: 基亚拉斯，加拿大的人口贩运是什么样的？我们来看看**安大略省**的数据。但请给我们一个整体的图景。这里是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Kiara's, what does human trafficking look like in Canada? If we take a we'll get into sort of the data here in Ontario. But give us a broad picture. What does it look like here?

</details>

**基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉**: 嗯，它非常、非常普遍。这是一项影响不同社区的犯罪。它不成比例地影响着，尤其是**原住民社区**。还有**安大略省**和**新斯科舍省**的**黑人社区**，然后是非常有趣且常常被忽视的社区：**残障人士社区**，以及特别是**神经多样性社区**。它也是一项遍及**加拿大**乃至全世界的犯罪，有时是基于一个人通过他们与他人的关系来实施犯罪。有时它是一种**跨国犯罪**，并且同样影响着加拿大。所以它存在于许多不同的层面，具有许多不同的细微差别，但它以非常相似的方式影响着受害者。这无疑是改变人生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kiara Gharabaghi**: Well, it is very, very widespread. It is it is a crime that affects different communities differently. There is a disproportionate impact on especially Indigenous communities. Also in Ontario and Nova Scotia, black communities, and then very interestingly and often forgotten communities, disability communities, and especially neurodivergent communities. It's a it's also a crime across Canada and really around the world that sometimes is based on just one person committing a crime through through the relationships they have with individuals. And sometimes it's an organized crime that is transnational in nature and that impacts in Canada as well. So it exists at many different levels with many different nuances, but it affects the victims all in very similar ways. It's life altering, certainly.

</details>

### 数据统计

**旁白**: 好的。我想看一些数据。这是**2014年至2020年**加拿大警方报告的人口贩运事件。在十年期间，有**5070起**警方报告的人口贩运事件。**安大略省**是两个超过全国平均水平的省份之一。**85%**的事件发生在**大都会地区**，其中**雷湾 (Thunder Bay)**的年平均发生率最高。**93%**的受害者是**女性和女孩**，其中三分之二是**25岁**以下。利兹，我想听听您对这些信息的反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: All right. I want to look at some data. This is police reported human trafficking incidents in Canada from 2014 to 2020. For a ten year period, 5070 police reported human trafficking incidents. Ontario is one of two provinces that exceeded that national average rate. 85% of incidents were reported in metropolitan areas, with the highest average annual rate in Thunder Bay. 93% of identified victims were women and girls, two thirds were younger than 25. Liz, I want to get your reaction on some of that information there.

</details>

### 儿童福利视角下的数据反应

**利兹·穆利根**: 嗯，我认为，从儿童福利的角度来看，当我们想到我所认为的进入我们这里的人数，以及被转介给我们的儿童和青少年时，主要是女孩，而且肯定是很小的年龄。所以**13岁**是女性常见的年龄。我认为，从儿童福利的角度来看，这是一个非常普遍的担忧。我们可能会接触到一些家庭。当我们例行询问人口贩运时，它开始于家庭对警示信号有多么不了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: Well, I think that certainly from a child welfare perspective, when we think about the number of I think about the people that are coming in and the children and youth that are being referred to us, it's primarily girls, and certainly from a very young age. So 13 is the common age that we're for women. And I think that when we from a child welfare perspective, it's a very prevalent concern. And we have some families that we may get involved with. And when we routinely ask about human trafficking, it's starting how much the warning signs are that families are just not aware of.

</details>

### 幸存者对数据的回应

**旁白**: 好的，我们稍后会谈到那些警示信号。但卡桑德拉，我也想听听您对这些数据的反应。这些数据并不让您感到意外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Okay, we'll talk about those warning signs a little later. But Cassandra, I want to get your your reaction as well on that data. These aren't not surprising to you.

</details>

**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德**: 我是这场犯罪的幸存者。十年里，我一直生活在被剥削和贩运中。但我想今天和大家谈论的是，受害者比你想象的要多，而且他们比你想象的要年轻。**BridgeNorth**服务于**12至17岁**的青少年。在我们的项目中，我们运行一个名为**Savvy**的预防项目和一个名为**Life Edge**的干预项目。事实上，就在去年，我们在预防项目中服务了72人。60%的人年龄在16岁以下。去年，在我们基于干预的项目**Life Edge**中，我们服务了16人，总共就是去年。其中45%的人年龄在16岁以下，正如我同事之前所说的那样。我们有15%的组织内部转介率。这意味着人们认为他们有风险，并将参与者送到我们的预防项目中，但我们发现他们已经被贩运了很长时间，有时是很多年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cassandra Diamond**: I am a survivor of this crime. Ten years I was in the life being exploited and trafficked. But what I want to refer and talk to you about today is that there are more victims than you think there are, and they are younger than you think they are. BridgeNorth serves 12 to 17 year olds. In our program we operate a prevention program called Savvy and an intervention program called Life Edge. As a matter of fact, just last year we served 72 in our prevention program. 60% were under the age of 16. Last year in our intervention based program, Life Edge, we served 16 and total just last year. That's 45% under the age of 16, to the point that was made previously by my colleague. We have a 15% intra organizational referral rate. That means that people send participants to our prevention program thinking that they're at risk, but we discover they've already been being trafficked for sometimes many years.

### 安大略省为何成为贩运中心

**旁白**: 帮助我们理解。看看您提到的安大略省的数据，安大略省有什么特别之处，使其成为这里的中心？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Help us understand. Looking at the data you had mentioned Ontario, what is it about Ontario that that makes it a hub here?

</details>

**基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉**: 嗯，有很多原因。我认为，首先，需要说明的是，这是**严重漏报**的数据。所以加拿大统计局甚至指出，这是严重漏报的数据。我们估计，数据至少是实际情况的十倍，也就是说至少十倍。这意味着我们中的任何一个人，在城市里，尤其是在城市里，一天不出门，就会离这种犯罪近在咫尺，可能近在咫尺，无论是坐在TTC上还是在市中心走动，或者在人行道上。所以，这绝对是无处不在的。安大略省是。首先，我们有**多伦多**、**渥太华**等大城市，但我们也有北部城市，**原住民社区**在那里受到严重影响。**雷湾 (Thunder Bay)**、**肯诺拉 (Kenora)**等地，还有很多边境。因此，存在**跨国活动**的机会。安大略省是一个非常多元化的地方。有许多文化社区，在这些社区中，报告这种犯罪，甚至向成年人指出有些不寻常的事情正在发生，会带来后果，这些后果可能是文化性质的，或者与我们的社区有关，处理这些事情。所以它确实是该活动的温床。另一个需要理解的关键点是**加拿大**的规定，尤其是在线**性剥削**和**贩运**方面，对于精通技术的犯罪者来说更容易利用。他们会在其他国家。所以追踪起来要困难得多。在这个国家访问在线门户网站要容易得多，而法规和法律仍在努力控制和规范这些领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kiara Gharabaghi**: Well, there are a number of things. I think, first of all, it's really important to say that this is severely under-reported data. So it's even actually stated by Stats Canada that this is severely under-reported data. We we estimate that the data is at least tenfold, that so at least ten fold. That means that none of us would spend a day out and about in especially a city, without being within feet of this crime, either within feet of a victim sitting on the TTC or walking about downtown or over perpetrator. So, so definitely this is everywhere. Ontario is. First of all, we have big cities Toronto, Ottawa in particular, but we also have cities in the north where Indigenous communities are heavily impacted. Thunder Bay comes to mind, Kenora, other places, and we have lots of borders. And so there is opportunities for transnational activity as well. Ontario is a is a very diverse place. There are many cultural communities in which reporting this crime, or even indicating to an adult that something is happening that is unusual, is comes with consequences that perhaps are cultural in nature or that relate to our communities, deal with these kinds of things. So it really is a hotbed for for that activity. The other piece that's important to understand is Canada's rules, especially for in relation to online sexual exploitation and trafficking are easier to exploit for technology savvy perpetrators. And they would be in other countries. So there is it's it's much harder to trace. It is much easier to access sort of online portals in in this country and the regulations and the law is still catching up upon trying to control and sort of regulate these, these areas.

### 圭尔夫的特殊情况与应对

**旁白**: 好的。梅兰妮，我想和你谈谈社区。根据**加拿大统计局**的数据，**圭尔夫**在**2024年**警方报告的人口贩运率最高。告诉我们圭尔夫的情况。是什么让它在地理上如此独特？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about community as you talk, Melanie. According to StatsCan, Guelph had the highest rate of human trafficking reported by police services in 2024. Tell us about the situation in Guelph. What makes it sort of unique in sort of its geography as well?

</details>

**梅兰妮·克拉克**: 我认为，根据这些统计数据，需要一些背景来解释我们是如何走到这一步的。在**2023年**秋季，我们的市长和市议会宣布**伴侣暴力**为一种流行病。这引发了大量关于真正问题是什么、我们如何支持受害者的讨论。我们很幸运，因为我们有一位警察局长**戈登·科比 (Gord Cobey)**，他是根除人口贩运的坚定倡导者和巨大支持者。因此，他真正致力于收集或获取资源来妥善处理人口贩运问题，而我们之前没有这样做，因为我们没有资源。与此同时，我们只有一名人口贩运调查员，他当时在一个联合行动中与其他部门合作。他的经验带来了这样一个事实：人口贩运和**伴侣暴力**密切相关，因为许多人口贩运调查都包含**伴侣暴力**的元素。因此，在**2024年1月**，我们成立了一个全新的部门来处理这些调查。他们接受了**伴侣暴力**和人口贩运的交叉培训。因此，我们部门的每一起伴侣暴力事件都会由该部门进行审计。如果存在任何人口贩运的元素，我们都会进行跟进。所以，这并不是说圭尔夫的人口贩运比2023年更普遍。不是那样的。只是我们现在做出了回应。我们现在不仅能更好地做出反应，而且能主动做出反应。我们正在教育社区。我们最近与大约900名天主教学校董事会成员进行了交流，向他们普及人口贩运和互联网儿童剥削的知识。因此，这是您获得数据的原因，而且我预计这些数据将继续上升，因为我们正在积极调查人口贩运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Melanie Clark**: I think with those stats, needs a bit of a backstory to say how we got there. So in 2023, in the fall of 2023, our mayor and city council declared intimate partner violence an epidemic. So that created a lot of discussion around what are the real issues, how can we support our victims? We are very lucky in that we have a chief of police, Gord Cobey, who is a huge advocate of eradicating human trafficking and a huge support. So with that, he really worked on collecting or getting the resources to police it properly, which we were not doing because we didn't have the resources. At the same time, we had one human trafficking investigator that was working in a kind of a joint force operation with another service. And his experience, he brought back the fact that human trafficking and intimate partner violence are very interrelated in that many human trafficking investigations have that intimate partner violence element. So at the same time, in 2024 of January, we created a brand new unit that has that investigates. And they're cross trained in both intimate partner violence and human trafficking. So with that, every intimate partner violence incident that comes through our service, it's audited by this unit. So if there's any element of human trafficking, we follow up on that. So it's less about it's not more prevalent in Guelph than it was in 2023. It's not that. It's just that we are now responding. We're not we're now able to respond not only reactively better, but now proactively. We are educating the community. We just recently spoke to about 900 of our Catholic school board members, educating them on human trafficking and the internet child exploitation. So it's more of that piece that you're getting the numbers, and I expect them to continue to rise because we are really proactively investigating human trafficking.

</details>

### 青少年为何易受侵害

**旁白**: 克里斯，在我请教利兹之前，我想先请教您。当我们谈论年龄时，我们谈论的是，您说**13岁**。为什么青少年是如此大的问题群体？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Chris, I want to come to you before I come to Liz, when we're talking about the age, we're talking when we talk. You said 13. You know, why is it such a big problem amongst youth?

</details>

**基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉**: 嗯，有几个原因。青少年群体面临这个问题的原因以及其程度，也随着变化而变化，尤其是在技术和社交媒体使用方面。**疫情**是一个主要的放大器和加速器，因为青少年长时间地待在家里上网。但我认为，存在不断变化的规范，不断变化的同伴关系，青少年文化中关于性、关于关系、关于什么是健康关系等的不断变化的对话。在另一方面，我认为那些寻求利用时机的人也比以往任何时候都更加老练。他们非常擅长他们所做的事情。而且，讽刺的是，当然，犯罪者为了将受害者带入生活所做的工作，正如卡桑德拉所提到的，它反映了你所见过的最好的社会工作。哦，哇。当然，不包括与之相关的伦理规则。所以这非常容易。而且，我相信来自皇家骑警队的数据表明，通过社交媒体，只需要大约**四小时**就能让一名受害者上钩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kiara Gharabaghi**: Well, there are a number of reasons. And and the degree to which it has been a problem for young people has also shifted with shifts, especially in technology and in social media use and those kinds of things. The pandemic was a major amplifier and accelerator of that process because young people were sitting at home on on social media, essentially for extended periods of time. But I think the there are shifting norms, there are shifting peer relations, there are shifting conversations in youth culture about sex, about relationships, about what constitutes healthy relationships, and so on. And on the flip side of things, I think people seeking to exploit the moment also are much more sophisticated than they've ever been before. They are very good at what they do. And ironically, of course, the, you know, the work that a perpetrator does to really bring a victim into the life, as Cassandra referred to it, is, mirrors some of the best social work you have ever seen. Oh, wow. Without, of course, the rules of the ethics associated with it. So it is surprisingly easy. And there is some data coming from, I believe it was the RCMP that suggests that it takes only about four hours to to through social media to, to get a victim hooked.

</details>

### 青少年易受侵害的案例分析

**旁白**: 就是这样。就是这样。四个小时。四个小时。好的，利兹，请帮助我们理解。我们能举一个您所说的社会工作的例子吗？它是什么样的？在四个小时内它看起来像什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: That's it. That's it. Four hours. Four hours. Okay, Liz, help us understand. Can we actually can I get an example of sort of you talk about you make that comparison of social work. What is it? What does it look like in that four hours.

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 所以，你知道，在我们社区里有很多年轻人感到孤独，在学校里感到被排斥，在同伴群体中感到被排斥等等，他们在家里的家庭关系等方面也可能面临非常困难的局面。贫困因素常常同时发挥作用，等等。所以，所以，你知道，犯罪者会寻找那些年轻人，他们会试图弄清楚，好吧，谁处于这种情况。这使得年轻人异常脆弱，因为任何表明有人真正关心你存在的迹象都是开始。而且，你知道，有一个完整的模式，这通常也涉及某种形式的敲诈。所以，你知道，给我发一张小照片，我给你发一张小照片。然后在此之前，就无法回头了。这异常困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: So, you know, there are many young people in our communities who are quite lonely, who feel excluded from in school, who feel excluded in peer groups and so on, who may also have very difficult scenarios unfolding at home in terms of their familial relationships and so on. Factors of poverty often figure into that alone time and so on and so, so knowing that or, you know, perpetrators seek out those young people, they try and figure out, okay, who is in this situation. And that makes young people extraordinarily vulnerable, because any sort of indication that somebody actually cares that you exist is is the beginning. And, you know, there is a there is a whole pattern of that often involves some sextortion as well. So, you know, just send me a little picture, I'll send you a little picture. And then before that there is no going back. This is extraordinarily difficult.

</details>

**旁白**: 好的。我希望您能从福利的角度将这些点联系起来。我们听到的就是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: All right. I'm hoping you can connect the dots here from from a welfare perspective. Is that kind of what we're hearing?

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 绝对是。当我们想到我们合作的、被剥削的青少年的特征时，这很大程度上是我们在这里谈论的，他们过去可能有创伤，过去可能有心理健康问题，来自破碎的家庭环境，以及对他们在线活动和他们认为合法的浪漫关系的担忧，而实际上这只是一种招募形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: Absolutely. When we think about the, I guess, characteristics of the youth that we're working with that have been exploited, it's it's much of what we're talking about here in terms of may have trauma in their past, may have some mental health in their past, come from disrupted family environments as well as concerns around their online activity and getting involved with what they perceive to be a legitimate romantic relationship, when it really is just a form of recruitment.

</details>

### 儿童援助协会的干预措施

**旁白**: 好的。**多伦多儿童援助协会**会采取哪些措施来干预和支持家庭？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: All right. With that, what does Children's Aid Society of Toronto do to intervene and support families?

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 所以当我们介入家庭时，我们与我们的**多伦多警察局**合作伙伴密切合作，他们的重点当然是犯罪方面。而我们的视角则真正关注受害者和个人，并努力识别这些风险因素，无论它们是否存在，以及与个人合作，了解他们的情况，了解一些我们正在谈论的社会问题，以便能够做出回应并确保他们获得帮助并回应其中一些担忧，并围绕安全计划与他们合作，并确保他们不仅有短期安全计划，还有长期安全计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: So when we are involved with families, we work closely with our Toronto police partners in terms of their piece, of course, is focusing on the crime aspect. And our piece is perspective is really focusing on the victim and the individual, and it really is helping to identify whether those risk factors, whether or not they're present, as well as working with the individual to understand what what's going on for them in terms of some of the social issues that we're talking about, to be able to respond and make sure that they get the help and respond to some of those concerns, and really working with them around safety planning and ensuring that not only do they have short term safety plan, but a long term safety plan as well.

</details>

### 警方的首要目标

**旁白**: 只是为了补充一点，我只是想让公众知道，警方显然想抓住坏人。这就是我们想做的。但最终，关于人口贩运，我们的目标是协助我们的支持者，我们的合作伙伴，将那个人移走。这是我们的头号目标。不是逮捕。不是获取陈述。不是收集证据。而是协助将她或他从那种情况中解救出来，并将他们带到一个支持和安全的地方。如果时机成熟，他们愿意与我们交谈，我们当然会敞开心扉。但我认为这是非常重要的一点，警方不仅仅是为了好的，给我们一个陈述。我们想要证据，对吧？我们想保护他们，并将他们带出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Just to add to that, and I just wanted just the public to know that the police yeah, obviously we want to catch the bad guy. That's what we want to do. But ultimately, with regards to human trafficking, our goal is to assist our supports, our partners in removing that person. That's our number one goal. It's not to arrest. It's not to get a statement. It's not to collect that evidence. It's to assist in removing her or him from that situation and get them to a place of supports and safety. And if in time, they're ready to talk to us at that time, we will obviously be open to that. But I think that's really important piece that police aren't just there to okay, give us a statement. We want the evidence, right. We want to protect them and bring them out of that.

</details>

### 警示信号

**旁白**: 绝对是。是的。肯定。你想在谈论信号时，父母和社区成员可以留意哪些信号，当涉及到许多关于贩运的指标时？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Absolutely. Yeah. For sure. You want to stick with you when we talk about signs, what what are some of the signs that parents and community members can look out for when many when it comes to many of the indicators for trafficking?

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 是的。这非常重要。我确信我的同事们可以补充这一点。对。但在这里，谈论年轻人，所以你有一个年轻女孩，她现在出现了，你知道，她的头发做好了，她的指甲做好了。她的衣服比以前好多了，但没有真正的解释这是如何发生的。她们可能表现出**焦虑**的迹象。她们可能表现得更加孤僻。她们缺课，而以前从不这样。她们在手机上非常保密。她们有一个你永远不会见到的**控制欲强的男友**。所以这些是一些迹象，对吧？但我也想补充一点。这些也可能是青少年时期的一些迹象。对。所以其中一些迹象是，是的，你可能正在被人口贩运，但它可能只是打开对话，深入探讨为什么会出现这种行为。对。而且我确信再次有更多迹象，但这些是一些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: Yeah. And this is really important. And I'm sure my colleagues can add to this. Right. But there and speaking of young people, so you have a young girl who is now showing up with, you know, her hair is done, her nails are done. Her clothes are a lot nicer than they used to be, with no real explanation of how that's happening. They could be showing signs of anxiety. They can be showing more, a little more isolated. They're missing their classes where they never used to before. They're very secretive on their phone. They have a very controlling boyfriend who you're not going to meet. So those are some of the signs, right. But I also want to add to that. Like those are also maybe signs of just being a teenager. Right. So some of these signs are yeah, you might be being human trafficked, but it might just open up conversations just to dive a little deeper into why that behaviour is happening. Right. And I'm sure there's again, more signs, but those are some of the ones.

</details>

### 剥削的四个阶段与指标

**旁白**: 这让我可以请卡桑德拉也加入进来。也请您谈谈一些指标。但关于利兹和梅兰妮以及其他人一直在说的一些事情，如果您想补充的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: That let me get Cassandra in there as well. Get your thoughts on some indicators as well. But some of the stuff that Liz and Melanie and others have been saying, if you wanted to add on.

</details>

**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德**: 让我简要地说一下，剥削有**四个阶段**。即某人处于**风险阶段**，某人正在**过渡阶段**，某人**陷入阶段**，以及某人正在**退出阶段**，这些都会提供不同的指标。例如，如果某人有被贩运的风险。我们刚才提到的许多迹象，有时会非常开心、兴奋，下一刻却非常沮丧或失望，因为贩运者开始让他们坐过山车，你知道，上一分钟还爱着他们，下一分钟他们就做了可怕的错事。现在受害者正试图找回那种浪漫或归属感或爱的感觉。再次，其他迹象是它开始的。这是一系列事件。所以当一个孩子迟到上课，然后一周或两周后也早退，这些加起来就对了？我们不是在寻找一个迹象。通常不止一个迹象，而是一系列事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cassandra Diamond**: Let me say briefly, there are four stages of exploitation. That is when someone's at risk, when somebody is transitioning in, when somebody is entrenched in the life and when somebody is exiting, those are going to provide different indicators. So for example, if somebody is at risk of being trafficked. Many of the signs that were just mentioned also being very happy, elated one moment and very upset or disappointed the next, because the trafficker is starting to put them on the roller coaster, you know, love them one minute and then they've done something terribly wrong. And now the victim is trying to get this to get back to those feelings of romantic or belonging or love. Again, other signs are it starts. It's a series of events. So when a child starts coming late to class, then a week or two later starts also leaving early, these have to add up together, right? We're not looking for one sign. There's usually more than one and it's a series of events.

### 受害者为何不愿发声

**旁白**: 卡桑德拉，我想跟进一下。这可能是被**陷入阶段**的第三点。很多人可能会问，为什么受害者不站出来？是什么会阻止某人？因为这听起来像很多这方面是心理上的。不一定是某人被束缚住了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Cassandra, I do want to follow up. And possibly this is that third point of being entrenched. You know, a lot of people might be asking, why might a victim not come forward? What would deter someone? Because it sounds like a lot of this is psychological. This is not necessarily someone who is, you know, tied to something.

</details>

**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德**: 很多受害者认为他们不会被相信。贩运者告诉他们，是他们自己犯下了罪行。如果事情败露，他们会惹上麻烦。很多时候，贩运者告诉受害者不要相信警察，他们会伤害你。所以那些本应帮助你的人，现在却被认为或相信是不安全的。另外，受害者离开了家庭住所或学校，对吧？他们常常在学校环境中被贩运。因此，无助感开始滋生。羞耻感和对如果他们伸出援手可能会发生什么的恐惧，是人们不伸出援手的理由。这是一项犯罪。我们必须找到那些人，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cassandra Diamond**: A lot of victims think that they won't be believed. Traffickers are telling them that they are the ones who are committing the crime. They are the ones who would be in trouble if anything were to ever surface. Oftentimes, traffickers are telling victims don't trust the police, they're going to harm you. So the very people that are there to assist you are somehow now thought or believed to be unsafe. Also, victims that are out of their family homes or in schools, right? They're being trafficked oftentimes from from a school setting. And so feelings of hopelessness start to sink in. Feelings of shame and fear of what could possibly happen to them if they were to reach out, are reasons why people don't reach out. This is a crime. We have to reach in to find those people, right?

### 贩运者的策略：孤立与依赖

**旁白**: 基亚拉斯，请您补充一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Kiara get you to add on that.

</details>

**基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉**: 我只想补充一点，你知道，贩运者的一个核心策略是孤立他们的受害者。所以，所以，你知道，去真正提出一些问题，比如你母亲真的爱你吗？你真的和你哥哥那么亲近吗？那个朋友真的是你的朋友吗？不知不觉中，许多年轻人真的无处可去。还有一件事，我只是因为人们常常不考虑这一点，贩运者的另一个策略是制造依赖，包括**财务依赖**。这在卡桑德拉提到的第四阶段变得非常重要，因为贩运者有时会以受害者的名义贷款，然后制造信用依赖，因为受害者的信用评分会很糟糕。所以，有许多不同的方式，贩运者以非暴力的方式，顺带地。所以对于一个14或15岁的孩子来说，这并不明显，他们真的施加了一种很难摆脱、很难向别人解释的控制。你知道，这并不那么简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kiara Gharabaghi**: I just want to add to that that, you know, a core strategy of traffickers is to isolate their victims. And so, so, you know, going and really raising some questions about really does your mother really love you? Are you really that close to your brother? Is that friend really your friend? And before you know it, many of these young people really have nowhere to turn. There is one other thing I'll just because people often don't think about this, another strategy of traffickers is to create dependency, including financial dependency. And this becomes very relevant in stage four that Cassandra mentioned, because traffickers sometimes will take out loans in the name of their victims and then create a credit dependency, because the credit rating of the victim will be horrific. And so there are so many different ways in which traffickers, in non-violent ways, incidentally. So it's not obvious to a 14 or 15 year old really exert a level of control that is very, very hard to shake and hard to explain to somebody. You know, it's that's not so simple.

</details>

### 心理层面与孤立感

**旁白**: 好的。说到解释，利兹，我知道很多案例。这些都是敏感案例。当我们谈论人们使用的策略有多么广泛时，这听起来像是您正在处理的一些事情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Well, speaking of explaining, Liz, I know a lot of the cases. These are sensitive cases. Does this sound like some of the stuff that you're dealing with when we're talking about just how how wide ranging in terms of tactics people are using?

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 绝对是。而且我认为，当我们考虑到**心理**方面，当我们考虑到归属感和被信任感，并将这与破碎的家庭环境联系起来时，这些青少年中的一些人没有那个值得信任的成年人。他们没有可以依靠的个人。所以当你谈到孤立时，我认为这是非常关键的，而且我认为，在我们处理的大多数案例中，这是一个贯穿始终的线索。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: Absolutely. And I think that when we think about the psychological aspect and we think about the belonging and being trusted, and we link that to the disrupted family environments, some of these youth don't have that trusted adult. They don't have that individual that they could turn to. And so when you speak about the isolation, I think that that is very key and very much, I would say, a thread that we see in most of the cases that we that we're involved in.

</details>

### 摆脱困境的障碍：创伤纽带

**旁白**: 而且只是快速地谈到摆脱困境，他们中的许多人，对我们来说是黑白分明的，我可以告诉你，你正在被人口贩运。他们就像他们相信这个人是他们的男朋友。他们爱这个人。他们与这个人有**创伤纽带**。所以这也是一个巨大的部分，那就是这是他们的男朋友。你不能打断这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: And just quickly with regards to getting out, a lot of them as as it's black and white to us and I can say you are being human trafficked. They like they believe that this person is their boyfriend. They love this person. They have a trauma bond to this person. So that's also a huge piece is that this is their boyfriend. You are not disrupting that.

</details>

### 解决方案：压制需求与加强法律

**旁白**: 好的。在我们最后的几分钟里，我想集中讨论一些解决方案。有什么建议吗？如果我们让**公共安全部**部长坐在我们对面的桌子旁？卡桑德拉，您有什么认为可能没有被讨论，但可以推动和移动这个问题的建议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: All right. In the last couple of minutes that we have I want to focus on some solutions here. What is one recommendation? If we had the Minister of Public Safety sitting across from us on this table? Cassandra, what is something that you would that you think is perhaps not being discussed, but something that could push and move that needle?

</details>

**卡桑德拉·戴蒙德**: 我们必须**压制对有偿性行为的需求**。我们没有足够强有力的法律来阻止性交易，特别是那些购买**18岁以下**人群的人。所以我们必须制定更强的威慑性法律。而且我将非常直接。**公共安全部**是**国家战略**的归属部门。而且我们**幸存者**曾得到一些尚未实现的承诺。例如，在国家层面设立一个生活经验圆桌会议，像我这样的幸存者聚集在一起，帮助政府了解他们试图服务的人群，并帮助他们制定项目并提供财务解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cassandra Diamond**: We have to suppress the demand for paid sex. We do not have strong enough laws to deter bodies of sex, especially those who are who are purchasing those under the age of 18. And so we have to have stronger deterrence laws. And also I'll be very direct. Public safety is the house for the national strategy. And there have been some promises made to us as survivors that have not yet come true. One of those, for example, is a lived experience kind of round table at the national level, where survivors like myself gather together to help the government to understand the people that they are attempting to serve and to make help them to make programs and provide financial. Solutions.

</details>

### 解决方案：教育与行动

**旁白**: 而且正如我所说，让年轻人接受教育，因为那就是一切开始的地方。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: And like I said, it's getting the youth educated because that's that's where it starts. That's yeah.

</details>

**利兹·穆利根**: 我同意，我认为教育很重要，但我也认为行动很重要。所以，如果今天听众中的人们听到了警示信号，并且他们认为他们可能不确定是否应该伸出援手，请联系专门从事人口贩运的组织。当然，当涉及到18岁以下的儿童和青少年时，他们可以联系当地的儿童援助协会进行对话，以便我们确定下一步是什么，以及这是否是需要迅速响应的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Liz Mulligan**: I agree, I think education is important, but I also think action. And so if people who are listening today and they're hearing what the warning signs are and they think they might, they're not sure to reach out, to reach out to an Organisation that specializes in human trafficking. Certainly when it comes to children and youth under the age of 18, they can contact their local Children's Aid society to have a conversation so that we can determine what the next steps are and whether or not this is something that that needs a swift response.

</details>

### 解决方案：跨界合作

**旁白**: 我要问您这个问题，因为我认为当我们谈论这里的犯罪者时，他们非常先进。而且我认为我们只是忽视了它。我想知道是否有我们没有看到的、可以推动这个问题的“箱外”想法？当我们谈论打破这些孤岛时，是否有我们没有考虑到的“箱外”想法可以解决这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: I'm going to ask you this because I think when you talked about sort of the perpetrators here, they are quite advanced. And I think that we just sort of dismiss it. And I want to know if there's something out of the box that we are just not looking at that could push this needle that could, would require people to come together. When we talk about when we're talking about those sort of silos breaking those down, is there something out of the box that we are not thinking about that would sort of fix this?

</details>

**基亚拉斯·加拉巴吉**: 我不知道这有多么“箱外”，但我们必须兑现我们谈论的事情。所以首先，我想再次强调卡桑德拉关于幸存者，特别是幸存者领导者的观点。你知道，卡桑德拉就是我所说的幸存者领导者，她不仅有生活经验，而且有多年时间真正思考并联系其他部门并与人们交谈，并且在这方面有所贡献。当专业人士，你知道，通过学科方式工作并根据他们所学到的东西来解决不属于任何学科的问题时，总是非常尴尬。所以这是一个问题。我认为另一件事，它不是一个创新的东西，它只是一个，它只是一个没有发生的事情，那就是这是一个**公共卫生问题**。根本上，这是一个公共卫生问题。而且有很多，很多团体在做着惊人的工作。警方做得非常好。儿童保护做得非常好。学校也开始做得非常好。但我们在那个领域完全是碎片化的，有时是跨部门工作的。例如，在警务领域，有一种叫做法医访谈，即如何访谈某人以开始收集你所需要的，以对犯罪者提起诉讼。而在儿童福利领域，也有访谈，但它不一定是法医访谈。所以这些事情有时是跨部门的。然后案件就会崩溃，因为我们做得不一样。而且我们制造了有问题的证据。所以将人们聚集在一起，并理解，是的，这是警务，这是儿童保护，这是教育，但它也是**酒店**。它也是**交通运输业**，特别是卡车司机。它是一群人，人们不认为他们是解决方案的一部分，但他们必须成为解决方案的一部分？我认为这是至关重要的，才能在这个问题上取得进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kiara Gharabaghi**: I don't know how out of the box this is, but we just have to make real the things that we talk about. So first of all, I want to really reinforce Cassandra's point around survivors and notably, survivor leaders. You know, Cassandra is somebody who I would describe as a survivor leader who not only has the lived experience, but has had years to really think that through and connect to other sectors and talk with people and has something to offer in that regard. It is always very awkward when professionals, you know, who really are working through disciplinary ways and sort of what they've learned, try to address issues that don't fit within any discipline. It's so that's one problem. I, I do think the other piece and it's not an innovative piece, it's just a, it's just a piece that's not happening is that this is a public health issue. Fundamentally, this is a public health issue. And we are there are many, many groups doing amazing work. Policing does very good work. Child protection does very good work. Schools are starting to do really good work. But where we are completely fragmented in that context and sometimes working across purposes. For example, in policing there is something called forensic interviewing, which is how do you interview somebody in order to begin to sort of collect what you need to, to have a case against the perpetrator. And in child welfare, there is also interviewing going on, but it is not necessarily forensic interviewing. And sometimes these things are across purposes. And then the case collapses because we've done it differently. And we created sort of problematic evidence. So bringing people together and understanding that it's you know, yes, it's policing, it's child protection, it's education, but it's also hotels. It is also the transportation industry and truckers in particular. It is it is groups of people one doesn't think of as being part of the solution, but who must become part of that solution? That is what is essential, I think, to make a dent into into this.
