### 美联储利率目标的复杂性

我们一直对听众和观众说，美联储正在加息或降息，但这实际上是一个由多种利率构成的整体，我们从未真正明确指的是哪一种利率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We keep saying the Fed is raising or lowering interest rates. But actually, there's this whole constellation of rates and we never really specify which one.</p>
</details>

这与其说是一个谎言，不如说是一种遗漏。尤其是在短期层面，确实存在各种不同的利率，它们之所以被抽象化，是因为如果它们之间出现偏差，可以通过套利来消除。因此，美联储能够影响这些其他利率，并且通常会强烈地施加影响，但这并不能保证所有这些短期利率总是完全一致地趋同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's less of a lie and more of an omission etc. It is true, especially at the short-term level that they're all these different rates and they sort of get abstracted away because I guess they can be arbed one way if there's between the two if they ever deviate. So the Fed can influence these other rates and obviously generally strongly does but it's no guarantee that all these short-term rates always converge identically.</p>
</details>

我们确实看到过市场利率远远偏离美联储实际目标的情况。因此，我想说的是，当美联储加息或降息时，它是通过以**联邦基金利率**（Fed funds rate: 银行间隔夜拆借的基准利率）为目标来实现的。我想每个人都听说过这个，但它在操作上实现这一目标的方式随着时间发生了变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. And we have seen for instance instances where the market rates have gone far far outside what the Fed is actually targeting. So I should just say when the Fed raises or lowers interest rates it does it through well it targets the Fed funds rate. Okay? And I think everyone has heard of that. But the way it mechanically does it has changed over time.</p>
</details>

### 美联储操作框架的演变：从稀缺到充裕

事实上，在我们金融新闻职业生涯的早期，它就发生了很大的变化。所以，我们肯定应该谈谈它。当我们想谈论货币市场和利率机制时，我们会找谁呢？那就是乔·阿贝特（Joe Abate）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, it changed in a pretty big way early on in our financial journalistic careers. So, we should definitely talk about it. Who's the guy that we call when we want to talk money markets and mechanics of interest rates? It's Joe Abate.</p>
</details>

乔在巴克莱银行工作了28年多后，现在加入了SMBC Nico，担任宏观策略主管。所以我们期待听到他更多的见解。乔，请跟我们谈谈加息和降息的实际机制是如何随时间变化的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe has actually left Barclays after more than 28 years and he's now at SMBC Nico. He's head of macro strategy. So, we're looking forward to uh hearing even more from him. Uh Joe, talk to us about how the actual mechanics of raising changing rates has changed over time.</p>
</details>

最初，美联储采用的是**稀缺准备金制度**（scarce reserve regime: 银行系统中的准备金总量低于银行需求，美联储通过公开市场操作精准调控利率），其理念是系统中的流动性水平总是略低于银行实际希望持有的水平，这在银行间市场，即联邦基金市场，产生了一点“扭矩”。这使得美联储能够将联邦基金利率精确地调整到其设定的目标水平，并且目标利率被设定在一个精确的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So originally the Fed started with a scarce reserve regime and the idea was that the level of liquidity in the system was always kept a little bit short of what banks really wanted to hold and that created a little bit of torque in this interbank market, the Fed funds market. And that allowed the Fed to move the Fed funds rate to exactly where it wanted to set the target. and the target was set at a pinpoint level of interest rates.</p>
</details>

随着时间的推移，特别是从2008年左右开始，美联储转向了另一种模式。在这种模式下，美联储会提供**充裕准备金**（abundant reserve: 银行系统中的准备金总量远超银行需求），并让联邦基金利率在一个由其设定的上下限之间的某个区间内交易，或者至少在这种情况下不进行交易。最初，它设定了目标区间，因为它不确定这种新结构能否将联邦基金利率维持在精确的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Over time, and certainly beginning in about 2008, the Fed shifted to a different format. And in that format, the Fed would supply an ample or abundant level of reserves and let the Fed funds rate, you know, trade or at least in this case not trade at some spread or band between an upper and lower band where it set the target. And originally, it set the target range band because it wasn't confident that this new structure would keep the Fed funds rate close to a pinpoint level.</p>
</details>

但是，如果你向系统提供充裕的准备金，联邦基金市场就会发生根本性的变化，它会适应。随着它的适应，银行停止了在联邦基金市场上的交易，它们不再需要借入准备金，因为准备金已经足够充裕了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you supply an abundant level of reserves into the system, what happens is the Fed funds market changes fundamentally. It adapts. It adapts. And as it adapted, what happened was banks stopped trading in the Fed funds market. They didn't need to borrow reserves anymore because there were plenty there. Because there were plenty. Exactly.</p>
</details>

因此，市场基本上演变成了一种利率套利。你有一组借款人和一组贷款人。这个市场中的借款人通常是非美国银行，而贷款人是住房贷款银行。之所以有这种区别，是因为住房贷款银行无法从它们在美联储的现金余额中赚取利息。因此，它们有动机将现金直接卖给联邦基金市场中的非美国银行，这些银行只是在联邦基金利率和**准备金余额利息**（IRB: Interest on Reserve Balances: 美联储支付给银行在其储备账户中持有的超额准备金的利息）之间赚取利差。在充裕准备金制度下，这个利差在过去四年左右一直非常稳定，保持在负七个基点，因为美联储一直以充裕准备金制度运作。充裕准备金制度最初是由于**量化宽松**（QE: Quantitative Easing: 中央银行通过购买大量政府债券或其他金融资产来增加货币供应量的政策）而产生的，对吧？所以，你扩大了美联储的资产负债表，创造了所有这些准备金，因此银行的流动性过剩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the market kind of devolved into basically an interest rate arbitrage. You have one set of borrowers and one set of lenders. The borrowers in this market are generally non US banks and the lenders are the home loan banks. And the reason there's this distinction is because the home loan banks can't earn interest on their reserve on their cash balances at the Fed. So they have an incentive to sell their cash right into the Fed funds market to non US banks who are simply making the spread between Fed funds and IRB and in an ample reserve IRB oh interest on reserves okay reserve balances and that spread has been very very stable for the last probably four years or so at minus minus seven basis points because the Fed's been operating in an abundant reserve regime. The abundant reserve regime first came about because of QE, right? So, you expanded the Fed's balance sheet, created all these reserves, so banks were oversted with liquidity.</p>
</details>

### 货币政策“管道”的重要性

我将问一个听起来很负面的问题，但它并非如此。我实际上是字面意思，因为我认为这可能有助于我们理解为什么我们正在进行这场对话。谁在乎？谁在乎这些？我再说一遍，我绝不是以一种轻蔑的方式说这些。我的意思是，所有这些短期事物基本上都是等价的。它们可以通过套利消除。美联储似乎对这些市场有很大的控制权。最终，即使它不以其中一个为目标，短期利率基本上也通过这些措施达到了美联储希望的水平。所以，从字面上讲，谁在乎这个“管道”呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to ask a question that's going to sound very negative, but it's not. It's actually I mean it very literally because I think this might help us understand why we're having this conversation. Who cares? Who cares about the any of this? And I do and again I do not mean this in like a dismissive way. I mean all of these things like these short-term things that basically are equivalent. They could be armed away. The Fed seems to have a lot of control over these markets. In the end, even if it's not targeting one or the other, the short-term interest rate is basically where the Fed wants it by any of these measures. So literally, who cares about the plumbing?</p>
</details>

我认为你之所以关心这个“管道”，是因为美联储用它来传达其政策意图。因此，它需要某种晴雨表，某种衡量标准，让市场能够解读美联储的意图。所以，联邦基金市场有双重含义。一是美联储使用联邦基金利率来传达其政策意图。例如，加息、降息，它还使用**点阵图**（dot plot: 美联储官员对未来联邦基金利率走势的预测图）来提供前瞻性指引，告诉市场我们将走多远，或者我们认为利率的最终目标可能是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the reason you I think care about the plumbing is that the Fed uses it to communicate its policy intentions. So it needs some sort of barometer, some sort of measure for the market to be able to interpret what the Fed's intentions are. So there's a two-fold implication, if you will, for the Fed funds market. One is the Fed uses the Fed funds rate to communicate its policy intentions. So raising rates, lowering rates, and it uses the dot plot, for example, defined as the Fed funds rate to provide forward guidance to tell the market how far we're going or what we see as the endgame potentially for interest rates.</p>
</details>

第二个要素更具机械性，你称之为“管道”，它指的是美联储的意图如何转化为银行存款利率、抵押贷款利率等。对吧？思考这个问题的一种方式是，所有这些期限利率、期限收益率等，都反映了你对美联储未来路径的预期，对吧？它被定义为联邦基金利率加上一些溢价，以反映你所承担的期限风险或通胀风险等。因此，隔夜利率、政策沟通以及它如何传导到更广泛的金融市场系统之间存在联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the second element is kind of more of a mechanical one, which you're referring to as the plumbing. Yeah. which is how does the Fed's intentions get translated into bank deposit rates, mortgage rates, etc. Right? And one way to think about this is that all of these term interest rates, tenure yields, etc. are all a reflection of what your expected path of the Fed is, right? Defined as Fed funds plus some premium, right, to reflect the term risk that you're taking or inflation risk, etc. And therefore there's a linkage between the overnight rates, the communication of policy and how it's transmitted to the broader financial market system.</p>
</details>

### 改变美联储利率目标的讨论

我认为，就中央银行行动的信号而言，有趣的是，我们习惯于将美联储视为一个目标非常明确的机构，但当我们谈论准备金时，他们使用的语言却是“过剩”、“充裕”、“充足”。而且对于这些词语的实际含义，并没有严格的定义。但我想说的是，我们之所以讨论这个问题，是因为货币市场中的每个人现在都在讨论它，因为达拉斯联储的**洛里·洛根**（Lori Logan）上周发表了一篇演讲和一份报告，基本上说美国美联储应该放弃以联邦基金利率为目标，并寻找其他方式来设定利率目标。当你读到这篇演讲时，你感到惊讶吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think in terms of signaling the central bank's actions, it is kind of funny that you know we're so used to thinking of the Federal Reserve as a very targeted institution, but when we're talking about reserves, the language they use is like excess abundant apple. And there's no hardcore definitions of what those actually are. But I should just say the reason we are talking about this is because everyone in money markets is talking about this right now because Lori Logan at the Dallas Fed, she did a speech last week and a paper I think basically saying that the US, the Fed should move away from targeting Fed funds and look at some different ways of targeting rates basically. Was that a surprise to you when you read the speech?</p>
</details>

这有点令人惊讶，因为我们并没有真正认为美联储正在准备实际改变政策利率，但他们可能需要放弃联邦基金利率目标的原因是众所周知的。正如我之前描述的联邦基金市场，对吧，你有一组借款人，一组贷款人。它已经变成了一个“罗马湖”，对吧？地中海周围的省份都说拉丁语。所以实际上，联邦基金市场之间并没有太多的活动，也没有借款的理由。所以它只是变成了一个沟通工具。如果你转向不同的晴雨表，比如说**三方回购利率**（triparty repo rate: 一种由第三方托管机构促成的附息回购协议利率），我们可以详细讨论这到底意味着什么。所以，一个基于活跃市场的利率，对吧？你不仅会得到沟通要素，还会得到关于美联储在管理流动性方面做得如何的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was a little bit of a surprise since we didn't really think that the Fed was preparing to actually change policy rates, but the overall reasons for why they might have to move away from a Fed funds target are pretty well known. So again, as I described the Fed funds market earlier, right, you've got one set of borrowers, one set of lenders. It's become kind of a Roman lake, right? The provinces around the Mediterranean all spoke Latin. So in effect, right, there's not a lot of activity going on between the Fed funds market or the reason to borrow. So it just becomes a communications device. So if you move to a different barometer, let's say a triparty repo rate, and we can go into details about what exactly that means. So, one that would be based on an active market, correct? You would get not only the communications element, but you'd also get a feedback on how well the Fed is doing in managing liquidity.</p>
</details>

### 庞大资产负债表的成本与效率

现在，如果准备金总是充裕的，我并不真正需要这些信息，对吧？我知道准备金是充裕的，但如果我想为美联储运行一个高效的资产负债表，换句话说，一个不比控制利率所需的规模更大的资产负债表，那么我就必须降低系统中的准备金水平，并在降低准备金水平时监控整个系统中的流动性状况。正如你所说，它是否保持在区间内，或者是否超出了这些区间，并造成其他类型的扭曲，这就是为什么我需要一个市场交易工具，在这种情况下就是回购利率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if reserves are always abundant, I don't really need that information, right? I know that reserves are abundant, but if I want to run an efficient balance sheet for the Fed, in other words, one that's not any larger than it needs to be to control interest rates, then I have to kind of bring down the level of reserves in the system and monitor as I bring down the level of reserves, what's happening with liquidity in the overall system. Is it, as you said, is it staying within the bands or is it moving outside those bands? and creating other sorts of distortions and that's why I need hopefully a market traded instrument and that would be in this case the repo rate.</p>
</details>

运行一个低效的资产负债表，或者一个拥有比理论上必要更多准备金的资产负债表，其成本是什么？比如，那有什么不好呢？你对我来说太存在主义了。不，说真的，我以前听过这个。他们想把它做好。但是，如果从我们思考美联储目标（最终，正如你所描述的，是关于传导政策，这些双重使命等等）的角度来看，从美联储的目的来看，运行一个系统中多出几个这些代币的成本是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the cost of running an inefficient balance sheet or a balance sheet that has more reserves than are theoretically necessary? Like okay, what's so bad about that? You're very existential to me. No, for real. Like I've heard this before. They want to get it right. But like from an actual when we think about the Fed's goals, right, which is ultimately, and you described it, it's about transmitting policy, these dual mandates and all this stuff. What is the cost from the Fed's purpose? It's razone debt of running a having a few extra of these tokens in the system. Why are we here, Joe? Yeah, Joe one. Well, no, cuz like Yeah. No, because if we need to switch to X because we want to get a better read on the efficiency of our balance sheet, that implies that balance sheet efficiency is an important thing.</p>
</details>

我同意你的看法。我个人并不反对一个庞大的资产负债表。我会说，系统中拥有充足的准备金会增加银行的安全性，对吧？它们拥有更多的流动性。那种特定的流动性是立即可用的，对吧？因为银行准备金可以立即获取，而将国债货币化则需要回购它们、去贴现窗口或在市场上出售它们。所以，充足的准备金可能是你应该瞄准的目标。一个低效的资产负债表，你可以争辩说，是银行准备金过剩的资产负债表。由于它们准备金过剩，这些准备金的成本对它们来说很低。任何价格低廉的东西，你都有动机持有比你可能需要更多的量。所以从效率的角度来看，你可能会争辩说，银行由于获得了过多的银行准备金，它们对这些准备金的需求是过度的，它们应该持有更多国债和其他资产。另一个例子是，如果你有一个臃肿的美联储资产负债表，对吧，例如在量化宽松期间，你会在市场中造成其他类型的扭曲。所以在量化宽松期间，我们看到银行对贷款的需求疲软，对吧，美联储将所有这些准备金推入系统。银行最终拥有了大量的存款。这些存款没有保险，对吧，而且它们对利率非常敏感，所以当美联储开始加息时，这些现金很快就流失了，就像23年3月那样。与此同时，它们资产负债表上的现金挤占了它们固定数量的资本，对吧？所以，你基本上持有的现金比你想要的更多，而且你把它转入了证券，因为没有贷款需求。所以你的资产负债表变得更加偏向于国债，大量的现金和更易于流动的负债。所以当美联储开始加息时，一切都变得不稳定或更加波动。我想当时还有一种民粹主义的成分，人们曾经对外国银行从它们的准备金中赚取大量利息等感到不满。你还记得吗？我记得。我甚至记得更早的时候，当时有人研究在金融危机中谁从流动性计划中受益。事实上，当时有一些新闻机构提交了《信息自由法案》请求，以查明到底是谁使用了哪些工具以及使用了多少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I agree with you. I'm personally not opposed to a big balance sheet. I would argue that having plenty of reserves in the system increases the safety of banks, right? They have more liquidity. that particular type of liquidity is immediately available, right? Because bank reserves can be accessed a immediately whereas monetizing treasuries requires either repoing them, going to the discount window or selling them in the market. So ample is probably where you should be targeting. An inefficient balance sheet would be one where you could argue that banks are overstocked with reserves. And because they're overstocked with reserves, the cost of those reserves for them is low. And anything that's low in price, you have an incentive to hold more than you probably need. So from an efficiency argument, you might argue that banks because they've been over supplied with bank reserves, their demand for those reserves is excessive and they should be holding, you know, kind of more treasuries and other assets. The other example of this is if you have a bloated Federal Reserve balance sheet, right, during, for example, QE, right, you create other sorts of distortions in the market. So during QE what we saw was that bank demand for loans or loan demand was weak right and the Fed was pushing all these reserves into the system. Banks ended up with lots and lots of deposits. These deposits were uninsured right and they were very rate sensitive so that when the Fed began raising interest rates that cash left very quickly as in March of 23. Mhm. At the same time, the cash on their balance sheet was crowding out their fixed amount of capital, right? So, you were basically holding more cash than you wanted to and you were rolling it into securities because loan demand wasn't there. And so you had a balance sheet that became more heavily skewed toward this is the banks skewed toward treasuries, lots of cash and more flightprone liabilities. So when the Fed began raising interest rates, everything became unglued or became more volatile. There was also I think a populist component for a time where people used to get upset that like the foreign banks were earning lots of interest on their reserves and things like that. Do you remember? I I do. I actually remember even earlier than that where there was work done about who was benefiting from the liquidity programs in the financial crisis. And there were in fact some news agencies filing Freedom of Information Act requests to find out exactly who used what facility and how much.</p>
</details>

### 三方回购利率与SOFR的比较

好的，我必须问，为什么是三方回购利率而不是像**担保隔夜融资利率**（SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate: 衡量隔夜回购市场借贷成本的广泛基准利率）这样的利率呢？我以为SOFR应该是事实上的基准货币市场利率，是取代**伦敦银行同业拆借利率**（LIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate: 曾是全球银行间短期借贷的基准利率）的那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I have to ask why the trip party rate and not something like sofur, the secured overnight financing rate, which I thought, you know, that's supposed to be the de facto benchmark money market rate, the one that replaced Liebore.</p>
</details>

没错。我认为主要的区别在于三方回购利率或三方市场本身是一个纯粹的融资市场。这是交易商群体从货币市场基金等现金提供者那里筹集现金的市场。相比之下，SOFR的范围更广一些，因为它包括了双边回购市场。由于它包括双边回购市场，这更多是一个人们既寻求融资又寻求特定合格投资产品（QIPS）或特定国债证券的市场。所以他们可能有一只左鞋，但他们在寻找右鞋，对吧？正因为如此，市场上基本上存在两种不同的均衡。你有一个三方均衡，然后你有一个SOFR双边均衡。洛里·洛根（Lori Logan）的论点是，这会造成一种分叉的分布，其中在一个市场中交易的动机可能与在另一个较小的三方市场中的动机不同。结果是，你可能正在查看所有这些市场的平均值或按交易量加权的中间值，但这并不能真正反映市场中正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. I think the main distinction is because the triparty rate or the triparty market itself is a pure financing market. It's the market in which the dealer community is raising cash from cash providers like money market funds. By contrast, sofur is a little bit broader because it includes the bilateral repo market. And because it includes the bilateral repo market, that's more of a market where people are looking for financing as well as specific QIPS or specific treasury securities. So they may have the left shoe, but they're looking for the right shoe, right? And because of that, you basically have two different equilibria in the market. You have a triparty equilibrium and then you have a sofur bilateral equilibrium. And what Lori Logan was arguing is that that creates kind of a bifurcated distribution where the incentives to trade in one market may not be the same as in the other more smaller triparty market. The result is that you may be, you know, looking at a at an an average or a volume weighted median across all of these markets. that doesn't actually reflect what's going on in the market.</p>
</details>

### 改变美联储目标的前景与挑战

美联储的目标会发生根本性变化的可能前景是什么？洛里·洛根（Lori Logan）发表了演讲，但这只是一篇演讲。如果美联储要改变其目标工具或衡量标准，那么新的实施会面临哪些技术挑战？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what is the prospect of something fundamental changing and what the Fed targets? Okay, Lori Logan gives a speech, but that's just a speech. And then if there were going to be some change in what instrument or what measure the Fed targets, you know, what are the technical challenges with the new implementation?</p>
</details>

简短的回答是，我不知道。我想说的是，我的感觉是，这可能比人们想象的要早。洛里·洛根（Lori Logan）鉴于她过去在纽约联储和市场操作部门（SOM）的职业生涯，或者说美联储的执行部门，她在货币政策机制的运作方式方面可能具有很大的影响力。至于联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的其他成员，我不确定他们的看法，因为过去没有人真正讨论过这个问题。所以我认为，这可能会早于预期，但不会在未来两年内发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the short answer to that is I don't know. What I would say is that my sense is that it's probably sooner than people think. Lori Logan is given her past career at the New York Fed and the SOM or the, you know, kind of the implementation desk at the Fed probably has a lot of weight in terms of how the mechanics of monetary policy run. As far as the other members of the FOMC, I'm not sure what their opinions are because nobody's really discussed this in the past. So I would say that probably sooner rather than later, but something that's not going to happen, you know, let's say within the next two years.</p>
</details>

从机制上讲，在我的职业生涯中，美联储一直以联邦基金利率为目标，但它传达其目标的方式已经改变了。当我刚开始工作时，美联储每天都会进行操作，并且不同类型的日常流动性操作之间存在细微的区别，这些区别会表明美联储预期联邦基金利率会上涨或下跌多少。然后，在94年，他们基本上公开表示，我们将以利率本身为目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mechanically, you know, there have been certainly in my career, the Fed has, you know, targeted the Fed funds rate for the entire period of time, but the way it communicates what it's targeting has changed. So when I started the Fed used to do daily operations and what kind of daily liquidity operation there were fine distinctions between them that would indicate how much the Fed was expecting the Fed funds rate to move up or down. Then in 94 you know they basically came out and said that we're going to target the rate itself. Mhm.</p>
</details>

然后在那之后，我想是在95年，他们实际上开始在联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议纪要中公布目标利率。因为以前你必须凭直觉，它会达到那里，然后他们会弄清楚目标是什么。是的。他们过去常常使用诸如“预计会对准备金状况施加适度压力”之类的表达。因为美联储在成功设定利率目标方面有着如此良好的记录，这是否降低了市场实际交易的压力，因为它的信誉如此之好？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then after that in I think it was '95 they actually started publishing the target rate in the FOMC minutes because it used to just be you had to you would just intuitive right it would just it would arrive there and then they would figure out what the target was. Yeah. Yeah. They used to use expressions like expected to put modest pressure on reserve conditions or because the Fed has such a track record of successfully targeting a rate. Has that reduced the pressure to actually trade in the market because the word is so good?</p>
</details>

我会说不。我认为联邦基金市场没有交易的原因，部分正如我之前所说，是因为它是一种“罗马湖”。它是一种协商利率，而不是真正意义上的交易利率。但我的意思是，美联储是否不再需要像过去那样直接干预，因为每个人都知道它能够实现目标，所以市场会自行处理任何偏差。是的，我认为这部分是事实。我认为这最初是他们围绕目标设定一个区间的原因，因为他们在2008年不确定能否实现这一目标。在随后的几年里，是的，他们已经取消了为了使联邦基金利率达到目标所需的微调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I'm going to say no. I I think that the reason there's no trading in the Fed funds market partly, as I said earlier, is that you know because it's a Roman lake of sorts. It's kind of a negotiated interest rate. It's not really a traded rate. But I mean the what I meant is like does the Fed does it not need to intervene directly as much the way it did in the old days because everybody knows that it can achieve it and so the market will take care of any deviations. Yes, I think that's partly true. I think that you know that was originally the reason why they had a band around the target because they weren't sure in 2008 that they could achieve that. in the subsequent years. Yes, they've kind of eliminated the fine-tuning that they would need to do to get the Fed funds rate to the target.</p>
</details>

### 流动性状况：准备金下降与回购利率上升

不过，关于美联储那些模糊的词语，无论是“适度”还是“充足”，系统中的准备金仍然充足，但它们也在下降。与此同时，我们最近看到一些回购利率正在上升。我们经历了9月15日的报税日。我想9月30日是季度末。当时很多人担心我们可能会遇到某种“回购末日”，就像我们过去常说的那样。但这并没有真正发生。但你认为总体而言，流动性成本正在上升吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. On the topic of nebulous Fed words though, whether it's modest or something like ample, reserves in the system are still ample, but they are also falling. And meanwhile, we've seen some repo rates going up recently. Uh we had the September 15th tax day. I guess September 30th quarter end. There was a lot of concern that we might get, you know, some sort of repo apocalypse as we used to call it. That hasn't really materialized. But would you say overall the price of liquidity is going up?</p>

是的，我完全同意这一点。所以，目前准备金可能充足，但其价格正在上涨，因为这种充足的量正在变得越来越小，原因有很多。其中之一是**量化紧缩**（QT: Quantitative Tightening: 中央银行通过减少其资产负债表规模来收紧货币政策）。另一个原因是债务上限的解决，这促使财政部出于预防性原因，将现金余额目标定得更高。最近**亨特·麦克马斯特**（Hunter McMaster）发表了一篇演讲，谈到了财政部的现金余额目标或期望水平，即预期流出的5到7天。因此，他们希望在他们的支票账户中保持充足的余额，但财政部的支票账户存放在美联储，这构成了美联储的负债，所以随着余额的增加，它会消耗准备金。因此，所有这些因素都在变化，直到现在，美联储资产负债表的大部分下降都表现为从**逆回购协议**（RRP: Reverse Repo Program: 美联储通过向金融机构出售证券并同意在未来回购，以吸收市场过剩流动性的工具）计划和财政部账户中的转移。现在发生的情况是，RRP计划中已经没有什么剩余了，随着资产负债表进一步缩减，它会从准备金中流出。当它从准备金中流出时，其影响可以说是不成比例的。我们看到的大部分准备金损失都来自外国银行。外国银行是在联邦基金市场中进行交易的银行。因此，它们的流动性成本正在上升，对吧？它们在这种谈判中的议价能力已经下降，它们必须支付额外的基点，这就是我们最近几天看到的情况。

<p class="english-text">Yes, I totally agree with that. So reserves may be ample at the moment but their price is going up because the amount of that ampleness is getting smaller and smaller and there are variety of reasons why it's getting smaller and smaller. One of them is QT the other was the resolution of the debt ceiling which you know encouraged the Treasury to kind of target a higher cash balance for precautionary reasons. There was a speech recently by Hunter McMaster about what the Treasury's cash balance target or goal or desired level is, which is 5 to 7 days of expected outflows. And so they want to maintain an ample balance in their checking account, but the Treasury's checking account is held at the Federal Reserve, and that acts as a liability for the Fed, so it drains reserves as the balance goes up. So all of these factors have kind of been moving and up until now most of the decline in the Fed's balance sheet has shown up as a shift out of the reverse repo program which is meant to mop up excess reserves and the treasury's account. Now what's happening is that there's nothing left in the RRP program and as the balance sheet shrinks further it comes out of reserves. as it comes out of reserves, the effect is kind of disproportionate, if you will. Most of the reserve loss that we've seen has come from foreign banks. Foreign banks are the ones who are trading in the Fed funds market. So, their cost of liquidity is going up, right? Their bargaining power in this, you know, negotiation has deteriorated and they have to pay an extra basis point and that's what we've seen in recent days.</p>

### 稳定币与支付市场

我的最后一个问题。你最近对**稳定币**（stablecoins: 一种加密货币，其价值与法定货币或商品等稳定资产挂钩）或它们如何与其中一些市场互动有什么有趣的看法吗？稳定币背后的理念是作为一种支付机制，对吧？它们看起来类似于货币市场基金，由于它们在结构上与货币市场基金相似，所以它们的理念是它们必须购买短期资产，对吧？它们必须购买国债回购，它们必须购买国库券。所以目标或意图是，如果对稳定币的需求增加，对国库券的需求也会增加，因此财政部会为国库券找到新的买家，并且可以在不推高利率的情况下发行更多的国库券，对吧？如果你的目标是增加国库券供应，但减少长期债务的供应，以防止长期利率上升。那么你需要一个新的国库券大买家，对吧？理论上，这个买家可以是稳定币，或者至少是某种支付代币。

<p class="english-text">Last question for me. you seen any interesting have any interesting thoughts these days about stable coins or how that interacts with some of these markets? So the idea behind the stable coins is as a payment mechanism, right? That they look similar to a money market fund and because they're similar in structure to a money market fund, the idea is that they would have to buy short duration assets, right? They'd have to buy Treasury repo, they'd have to buy Treasury bills. So the goal or the intent is that if demand for stable coins goes up, the demand for bills will go up and therefore the treasury will find a new buyer for treasury bills and it could issue more treasury bills without pushing interest rates up, right? And if your goal hypothetically is to increase bill supply but reduce the supply of term debt in order to keep term interest rates from rising. Yeah. Then you need a new large buyer of treasury bills, right? That buyer theoretically could be stable coins or at least a payment token of some sort.</p>

当然，问题是当对支付代币的需求增加时，它会从人们用于支付的其他工具中分流需求。对吧？存款，对吧？信用卡和纸币。所以，我至少从观察和思考这个问题后认为，支付代币更像是货币的替代品，而不是银行存款。如果你普遍考虑货币，对吧，我想平均每人持有的货币量大约是60美元，但美国人均货币量大约是7000美元或更多。因此，有大量美元货币被离岸持有，对吧？一些估计显示，58%的美元货币被离岸持有。目前有190亿张100美元钞票流通。190亿张100美元钞票？是的。所以，我一张都没有。不，我有一些。哦，真的吗？是的。上次我玩扑克的时候。你把它们放在钱包里吗？我把它们放在床头柜里。所以，你是个例外，而不是普遍情况。但我的观点是，支付代币的需求在美国境外可能高于美国境内，因为你在美国有很多快速支付的方式。它可能更具吸引力的地方是在那些能够使用手机的银行服务不足的经济体。所以，在所有条件相同的情况下，你可以说它是一种替代100美元钞票的价值储存和记账单位。在这种情况下，你可能会看到对支付代币的强劲需求，但它们将位于美国境外。另一个领域是汇款方面。对吧。对。所以，向国外汇款。同样，使用支付代币会容易得多。理论上使用信用卡和非美元货币进行购买有时会很困难，部分原因是反欺诈和其他机制。如果你使用稳定币，那可能会更容易。但问题当然是，以这种方式使用的稳定币就像使用现金一样，对吧？或者纸币，对吧？一旦它用完，对吧？你不能打电话给你的信用卡公司说：“停止那笔支付。”

<p class="english-text">The problem of course is that when the demand for payment tokens goes up, it's taking away from the demand other other instruments that people use for making payments. Yeah. Right. Deposits, right? Credit cards and paper currency. So my sense at least from looking at this and having thought about it somewhat is I think of the payment tokens as a closer substitute for currency than a you know than a bank deposit. If you think about currency generally, right, there's I think the average onperson currency amount is about $60, but per capita currency in the US is something like $7,000 or more. So there's a significant volume of US currency that's held offshore, right? Some estimates between 58 58 of US currency is held offshore. There are 19 billion $100 bills out there. 19 billion $100 bills? Yes. So, I have none of them. No, I have a few. Oh, really? Yeah. From the last time I played poker. Do you keep them in your wallet? I have them in my bedside drawer. So, you're part of the exception rather than the rule. But my point being that a payment token probably the demand for it may be higher outside the US than inside the US because you have all lots of ways of making fast payments. Where it might be more attractive is in underbanked economies that are able to access mobile phones. And so all things being equal, you could say it is a substitute for the $100 bill as a store of value and a unit of account. And in that case then you could potentially see strong demand for payment tokens but they would be located outside the US. The other area would be with respect to remittances. Right. Right. So sending money abroad. Again much easier to do with a payment token. Making purchases theoretically using your credit card and a non US currency sometimes can get hard partly because of anti-fraud and other uh mechanisms. If you used a stable coin, that might be easier. But the problem, of course, is that a stable coin used in that way is just like using money, right? Or paper money, right? Once it's gone, right? You can't call your credit card company and say, "Stop that payment."</p>

### 互换利差与全球财政审慎

我再问一个关于**互换利差**（swap spreads: 固定利率互换与相同期限国债收益率之间的差额）的问题，这实际上是我最初联系你的原因，但后来洛里·洛根（Lori Logan）发表了演讲，我们被严重分散了注意力。但是互换利差，那里发生了一些事情，它们似乎正在扩大，不仅在美国，而且基本上在全世界都是如此。比如澳大利亚、日本、加拿大，我想。那里发生了什么？我们为什么要关心互换利差？

<p class="english-text">I'm going to squeeze in one more question on swap spreads, which was actually the original reason why I reached out to you, but then Lori Logan made her speech and we got very distracted. But swap spreads, there's something going on there, which is they seem to be widening, not just in the US, but basically all around the world. So, Australia, Japan, Canada, I think. What is going on there? And why should we care about swap spreads?</p>
</details>

我不是互换利差方面的专家，但我要说的是，有一个普遍的全球主题是关于**财政审慎**（fiscal prudence: 政府在支出和税收方面采取谨慎负责的态度，以维持财政健康和可持续性），如果你愿意这么说的话，那就是政府未偿债务的数量正在增加，而且似乎只会继续上升。结果是，人们要求持有这些政府债务的溢价。这就是我们在这里看到的，这种溢价已经开始上升。最初在美国，人们认为在今年4月之后，这种溢价预计会更高，但我认为在美国发生的情况是，人们认识到财政前景的恶化并非美国独有的现象，对吧，它在您提到的这些国家中普遍发生。所以我想，我不想称之为“债券义警主义”，因为我不认为正在发生的是那种情况，但人们确实认识到财政政策正在朝着一个可能不可持续的方向发展。尽管奇怪的是，英国的互换利差并没有太大变化。是的，我知道。他们在9月初的时候非常兴奋，然后就一直很平静。是的。好吧，我们拭目以待。

<p class="english-text">So, I'm not an expert on swap spreads, but I will say is that there's a general global theme about fiscal prudence, if you will, and that the amount of government debt outstanding is increasing and doesn't seem to be going anywhere but up. The result of that is that people demand a premium for holding that government debt. And that's what we're seeing here, which is that that premium has started to rise. Now initially in the US the sense was that after the certainly in April of this year that premium was expected to be higher but I think what happened in the US was that people recognized that the deterioration in the fiscal outlook was not a uni a unique US phenomena right it was occurring across the board certainly in the countries among the countries that you were mentioning. So I think there's a I don't want to call it bond vigilanteism because I don't think that's what's going on but there is a realization that fiscal policy is moving in presumably an unsustainable direction. Although weirdly the UK one hasn't moved that much. Yeah, I know. They got so much excitement at the beginning of September and then it's uh it's been kind of chill. Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens.</p>
