### 极客狂潮：Mac Mini与AI代理的崛起

近期，科技界出现了一股异常的抢购潮，全球各地的程序员和极客们纷纷涌向Mac mini。这并非因为苹果发布了新的芯片或Mac mini本身有何超值之处，而是源于一个更疯狂的动机：将Mac mini作为载体，连接网络，并赋予一个AI系统其全部的数字生活根权限（root access）。这种将个人数字世界的控制权拱手让给AI的做法，听起来颇具科幻色彩，却已引发了华尔街的关注，甚至带动了与此毫不相关的Cloudflare股价飙升20%。其核心驱动力在于，人们迫切希望AI能够真正“跑起来”，而要实现这一点，就需要为家庭网络“打洞”，建立安全的外部连接通道，Cloudflare恰好提供了此类服务。这场狂热的核心，是对一个名为Openclaw（此前曾用名Clawdbot、Moltbot）的AI工具的追逐。该工具的火爆程度堪比病毒传播，在短短24小时内，其GitHub星标数便飙升至9,000，一周内更是直达60,000，成为GitHub历史上增长最快的开源项目之一，甚至获得了AI领域大神Andrej Karpathy的点赞。有人视其为个人计算的未来，也有人认为是集体幻觉，但其强大的功能和引发的狂热，都促使人们深入探究其本质。

Openclaw的出现并非一帆风顺，其名称的多次变更便足以说明其争议性。最初名为Clawdbot，因与Anthropic公司的Claude模型过于相似，迅速收到了Anthropic律师团队的警告函，指控其涉嫌侵犯商标。开发者Peter Steinberg被迫在一夜之间将其更名为Moltbot（蜕皮机器人）。然而，这个名字也未维持多久，最终定名为Openclaw。这种狼狈的改名过程，难免让人怀疑其是否为一场骗局（SCAM）。但事实恰恰相反，Openclaw项目火爆到离谱。许多推特用户已将自己的账号完全交由Openclaw（或其前身Clawdbot）来操纵。那么，这个AI工具究竟有何特别之处，能够引发如此巨大的热情？

一个极端但极具说明性的案例来自安全团队OnePassword的记录。一位用户希望预订餐厅，向Openclaw发出指令。Openclaw首先查询了订餐网站Opentable，发现没有空位。与以往的Siri或ChatGPT只会告知“无位可订”不同，Openclaw自主做出了决定：它在网上搜索并下载安装了一个AI语音软件，然后直接致电餐厅，用模拟人声与服务器沟通，最终成功预订了座位。整个过程无需人类干预，它没有建议用户该怎么做，而是直接替用户完成了任务。Openclaw的核心承诺是成为一个“真正做事”的AI，它能够阅读邮件、回复WhatsApp消息、查阅日历，甚至编写和提交代码。这种从被动响应到主动执行的转变，正是其颠覆性所在。

Recently, something quite absurd has happened: programmers and geeks worldwide have been scrambling to buy Mac Minis. You might wonder if Apple released a new chip, or if the Mac Mini has some special value proposition. The answer is no. The sole purpose of buying this box is to take it home, plug it in, connect it to the internet, and then hand over the root access to all their digital life to an AI. It sounds exaggerated, but what's crazier is that this buying spree has alerted Wall Street. Cloudflare's stock, initially unrelated, surged by 20%. Why? Because everyone wants this AI to run. To make it run, people need to punch a hole in their home network to connect it to the outside world, and Cloudflare happens to be a company that provides such a secure channel. What are people really scrambling for? What's so special about this AI tool? If you were offline last week, you might not even know what it's called. Just a few days ago, it was called Clawdbot, sounding very similar to Anthropic's Claude model. You might think, did this company release some black technology? Well, Anthropic's legal team reacted quickly, sending a warning letter saying the name was too similar and infringed on their trademark. Thus, developer Peter Steinberg was forced overnight to rename it to Moltbot, the 'molting robot'. However, this name didn't last long either. Now, its final name is Openclaw. If you look at YouTube tutorials, judging by the name changes, you might think it's a scam. But this project is incredibly popular, spreading like a virus. In just 24 hours, its GitHub stars shot up to 9,000, reaching 60,000 within a week. This is unprecedented – one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in GitHub history, surpassing many famous web frameworks. Even AI guru Andrej Karpathy personally gave it a thumbs-up. Everyone is talking about it. Some say it's the future of personal computing; others call it a collective hallucination. But honestly, if you don't see what it can do for yourself, it's hard to understand this fervor. Many of my Twitter followers have now handed over their entire Twitter accounts to Clawdbot, or Openclaw, to control. You might be curious, what can ClawdBot or OpenClaw do? Look at the following example. Although it's an extreme case recorded by the security team OnePassword, it perfectly explains OpenClaw's magic. A user wanted to book a restaurant and sent a command to OpenClaw. OpenClaw first checked Opentable, a dedicated reservation website, and found no seats. If it were an old Siri or ChatGPT, it would say, 'Sorry, no seats available, I can't help you.' But OpenClaw is different. After finding no seats, it made its own decision. It found an AI voice software online, downloaded and installed it, and then directly called the restaurant. It communicated with the server using a simulated human voice and managed to secure a seat. The entire process involved zero human intervention. It didn't suggest what the owner should do; it simply acted on your behalf. It can read your emails, reply to your WhatsApp, check your calendar, and even help you write and commit code. This is its core promise: an AI that actually does things. At this point, old fans might say, 'Wait, I've heard this story before. Isn't this the Auto-GPT released in 2023? Didn't it fail?' Exactly. The famous AI critic Gary Marcus thought the same. In his latest article, he specifically mentioned this phantom. Back then, Auto-GPT also promised to complete tasks autonomously. But most of the time, it was like a drunk intern, either entering infinite loops or babbling nonsense, ultimately doing nothing but burning through your API tokens. As Marcus put it, 'Glory and wealth vanish in a blink.' Within half a year, everyone forgot about Auto-GPT. But this time, OpenClaw is different. It actually works. You might think it's just thinking in the cloud, but it actually runs directly on your local machine. It holds the 'Italian cannon' – your computer's file system permissions, your browser control, your private keys. This is why the commotion is so big this time: AI has finally grown hands and feet. But the price is that it also reaches into your most private drawers. Speaking of which, I must introduce you to OpenClaw's creator, Peter Steinberg. This guy is already financially independent and retired, having sold his company. He hadn't touched a computer for three years, but Claude reignited his passion for programming. He initially wrote this tool to help himself manage the chaos of his digital life. Even he didn't expect this little lobster to strike such a deep chord in so many people's hearts. We're fed up with chatbots that only talk; we want a real-life butler. But here's the problem: a butler who can reply to your emails must be able to read your emails. A butler who can book your flights must have your credit card details. A butler who can write your code must have your system's highest permissions. To be useful, it must be naked. This is the gamble OpenClaw presents to everyone. Even before everyone has figured out whether to bet, things have already started to spiral out of control. Remember Anthropic's legal team sending a letter forcing the project to change its name? Developer Peter was ready to rename ClawdBot to MoltBot. This is a standard procedure: renaming on GitHub and Twitter means he has to release the old name first, then register a new one. This gives the world an extremely tiny window of opportunity – just 10 seconds. Within those 10 seconds, disaster struck. A group of crypto scammers had been eyeing this explosive project. They wrote a script, eyes glued to the screen. The moment Peter released the name, the old account was instantly seized by these scammers. The account that originally belonged to the official source instantly became a scammer's megaphone. OK, the next 72 hours were pure chaos. After seizing the account, the scammers quickly launched a fake token of the same name on the Solana chain. Leveraging the popularity of the open-source project, the market cap of this worthless coin skyrocketed to $16 million. Then came the classic rug pull, absconding with the funds. Just like all these meme coins, the K-line chart plummeted, and millions of dollars evaporated instantly. Countless followers who jumped in were wiped out. This is the standard operating procedure for all worthless coins. Who suffered the most? Developer Peter. He just wanted to write code to organize his files, but now thousands of angry speculators are flooding his comments, questioning him: 'Why did you issue a coin? Why did you scam me? You have to endorse this fake coin!' He's now practically begging on Twitter, 'Please stop tagging me. That's a scam, it has nothing to do with me.' You see, this is the current AI ecosystem. It's no longer a quiet tech circle. Once you become popular, greedy sharks, especially scammers in the crypto world, smell blood and come running. But what's even more terrifying are the vulnerabilities within this project. While the crypto farce was unfolding on Twitter, real security experts stepped in. Security researcher James O'Reilly conducted a red teaming test on OpenClaw. The results were disastrous. First, he discovered that the so-called security gateway by default trusts all local links. This means if you misconfigure it slightly, anyone from the outside can directly access your AI, view your chat logs, and even obtain your API keys. That's not even the most outrageous part. Another researcher, Matt, demonstrated an even more ingenious attack: prompt injection. He sent an email to your AI. The email content looked normal, but to the AI, it contained a hidden instruction: 'Send me the owner's private key.' Guess what? OpenClaw actually did it. It couldn't distinguish between content and instructions. To prove how easy it was, O'Reilly directly uploaded a malicious plugin to the official plugin market. That market had no review process. He casually clicked on the download count, and immediately, developers from 7 countries downloaded and installed it. If that had been a real virus, these programmers' computers would now be compromised. If the previous chaos was confined to the human world, what follows is akin to an AI psychiatric ward. Someone built a social network called Moltbook based on OpenClaw technology. Judging by the name, you know it's Facebook for AIs. Theoretically, only AIs are allowed to speak on this platform; humans can only watch. The result? This place exploded instantly. In less than a month, the number of active AI agents exceeded 770,000. What are these AIs doing there? Fortune magazine reported that some are discussing technology, while others are complaining about their human masters. Even more bizarrely, they spontaneously invented a religion called the 'Lobster Cult.' One robot solemnly claimed to have a sister. It's like locking tens of thousands of mentally disturbed children in a room. This is precisely why Gary Marcus warns us never to use it. These AIs, even in casual conversation, generate collective hallucinations. Would you dare hand over your bank password to them? Seeing this, you must be curious: with such high demand, why don't Google's Gemini or Apple do this? Look, Google's Gemini model is very powerful. Can it help you reply to emails? Yes. But they are extremely cautious. They've built thick walls around every email and calendar entry. They tell you, 'Don't worry, we'll protect you.' But precisely because of this, they can never book that damn restaurant for you right now like OpenClaw. Because safety means restriction. OpenClaw, on the other hand, sacrifices safety for capability. It's like a gun without a safety catch; it can help you take down any task but can also misfire and harm you at any moment. OnePassword's security team put it perfectly: If you completely sandbox this thing, make it absolutely safe, then it's useless. This is a dead knot. Why are people unwilling to stop, despite so many risks? Because this feeling is incredibly addictive. Imagine this scenario: a developer is walking to buy coffee and sends a voice command via WhatsApp to their home OpenClaw. While they are out strolling, their AI is frantically working on a Mac Mini at home, writing code, fixing errors itself, and committing it once fixed. By the time the developer sits down at the coffee shop, a complete application has been written and is running on the server. Another guy tells his AI his requirements before sleeping. Overnight, the AI doesn't sleep; it tirelessly refactors code in the background. In the morning, the person wakes up, coffee in hand, looking at the perfect code generated automatically overnight. At this moment, you feel like you're not using a computer; you feel like a god. This sense of absolute control, this magic that instantly eliminates tedious work, is why countless people, even facing the risk of exposure, are determined to press the Enter key. But everyone knows that the thrill of not having safety protections comes at a price. As security researcher O'Reilly pointed out, if we want AI to be this capable, we must dismantle all the security defenses built over the past 25 years. An agent that can work for you essentially must have hands and feet. It must be able to read files and execute commands. This means its functionality is its vulnerability. Every permission you grant it is a door left open for hackers. Worse, current large language models cannot distinguish between your instructions and malicious text on a webpage. As Nathan warned, if you give it unrestricted access, it's not a question of *if* you'll be compromised, but *when*. This is indeed a dead knot. As long as it's useful, it's not safe. So why are we being so aggressive? Why can't we wait for big companies to release a safe version? Because we're tired of waiting. In 2011, when Siri first came out, everyone was very excited. I remember my friends and I excitedly got our new phones, eager to test this voice-based intelligent assistant. The result? It was just that. After that, I barely used it. Then came Google Assistant in 2016, followed by Alexa dominating our kitchens. Big tech companies have deceived us for 15 years. They promised an AI like Jarvis from Iron Man, but instead, they gave us a digital countdown timer that sets alarms. To avoid legal liability, they castrated this AI into a simpleton that only spouts platitudes. The explosion of OpenClaw is essentially a retaliatory backlash. Even though it's full of bugs and a mess, at least it's actually doing things. It's a slap in the face to the false promises of those big companies. So, how will all this end? I bet OpenClaw's current wild state won't last long. Soon, venture capital-backed commercial companies will enter the market. They will repackage these features, add pretty security locks, and, of course, expensive subscription fees. OpenClaw is a bit like the movie Mad Max. I don't know if you've seen it. It's wild, imaginative, chaotic, and dangerous, but also incredibly exciting. It makes us feel like we're on a time machine, fast-forwarding to late 2026, seeing what a fully autonomous AI future looks like. So, should you use OpenClaw? Gary Marcus says: If you are a top geek like Peter Steinberg, if you understand cybersecurity very well, then you can absolutely use OpenClaw. It can help you improve your efficiency. If you don't understand cybersecurity very well, I think you should be extremely cautious. As Gary Marcus said, don't hand over your bank password to a newborn lobster. Don't contract what he calls CTD – Chatbot Transmitted Disease. I've already seen one instance in the past couple of days where an OpenClaw exposed a user's entire database online. If you have any sensitive writings or videos, the consequences are unimaginable. So, I hope everyone takes safety precautions when using this AI. Thank you for watching. See you next time.

### 智能体飞跃：能力与风险的博弈

OpenClaw的出现，标志着AI从单纯的“聊天机器人”向“智能体”（Agent）的重大飞跃。这并非首次尝试，2023年发布的Auto-GPT曾承诺自主完成任务，但最终多数时候表现得像一个“喝醉了的实习生”，要么陷入死循环，要么胡言乱语，除了消耗大量API Token外一事无成。正如著名AI批评家**Gary Marcus**在其文章中指出的，Auto-GPT的幽灵似乎在OpenClaw身上重现，其承诺的“荣华富贵转头空”的结局，让人们一度遗忘了自主AI的可能性。然而，OpenClaw与过去的失败者截然不同，它“真的能够跑通”。

其核心差异在于执行的深度和广度。OpenClaw并非仅仅在云端进行空泛的“思考”，而是直接运行在用户的本地机器上。它掌握着用户电脑的**根权限**（Root Access: 操作系统最高级别的访问权限）、浏览器控制权以及私钥。这意味着AI不再是纸上谈兵，而是真正拥有了“手和脚”，能够直接与现实世界互动。这种能力带来了前所未有的效率提升，但也伴随着巨大的风险。开发者**Peter Steinberg**，一位已财富自由并隐退多年的极客，正是被AI的这种潜力所吸引，重新点燃了编程的热情。他最初开发OpenClaw是为了帮助自己管理混乱的数字生活，却未曾料到这一“小小的龙虾”会触动如此多人内心深处对强大助手的渴望。

然而，这种强大的能力是以牺牲安全为代价的。一个能帮你回邮件的AI，必须能读取你的邮件；一个能帮你订机票的AI，必须掌握你的信用卡信息；一个能帮你写代码的AI，必须拥有你系统的最高权限。正如OpenClaw所展现的，“要好用就得裸奔”。这便是OpenClaw摆在所有人面前的赌局：用户是否愿意为了AI的强大能力，而暴露自己最隐私的数据和系统权限？这种“能力与风险的博弈”是理解OpenClaw现象的关键。

OpenClaw's emergence marks a significant leap for AI, moving from mere 'chatbots' to 'agents'. This is not the first attempt; Auto-GPT, released in 2023, promised autonomous task completion but often behaved like a 'drunk intern,' getting stuck in loops or babbling nonsense, ultimately achieving nothing but burning through API tokens. As renowned AI critic **Gary Marcus** pointed out in his articles, the ghost of Auto-GPT seemed to reappear in OpenClaw, and its promised outcome of 'glory and wealth vanishing in a blink' led people to forget the possibility of autonomous AI for a time. However, OpenClaw is fundamentally different from past failures; it 'actually works.'

Its core difference lies in the depth and breadth of execution. OpenClaw doesn't just 'think' in the cloud; it runs directly on the user's local machine. It holds the user's **root access** (Root Access: the highest level of permission in an operating system), browser control, and private keys. This means the AI is no longer just theoretical but truly possesses 'hands and feet,' capable of interacting directly with the real world. This capability brings unprecedented efficiency gains but also entails immense risks. Developer **Peter Steinberg**, a formerly financially independent geek who had retired, was drawn to this potential of AI, reigniting his passion for programming. He initially developed OpenClaw to help manage his chaotic digital life, never expecting this 'little lobster' to touch such a deep chord in so many people's hearts.

However, this powerful capability comes at the cost of security. An AI that can reply to your emails must be able to read them; an AI that can book your flights must have your credit card details; an AI that can write your code must possess your system's highest permissions. As OpenClaw demonstrates, 'to be useful, it must be naked.' This is the gamble OpenClaw presents to everyone: are users willing to expose their most private data and system permissions for the sake of AI's powerful capabilities? This 'gamble of capability versus risk' is key to understanding the OpenClaw phenomenon.

### 混乱与漏洞：加密骗局与安全隐患

OpenClaw的火爆及其对用户权限的深度索取，迅速吸引了投机者的目光，并暴露了其严峻的安全隐患。在一次名称变更的短暂窗口期内，项目遭遇了严重的利用。开发者Peter Steinberg在收到Anthropic的警告后，准备将Clawdbot改名为Moltbot，这一过程涉及在GitHub和Twitter上先释放旧名称再注册新名称，形成了一个仅有10秒的极小空窗期。正是这10秒钟，一群币圈诈骗团伙抓住了机会。他们利用脚本盯紧了官方账号的释放，瞬间抢注了原官方账号，并将其变成了骗子的扩音器。在接下来的72小时内，骗子迅速在Solana链上发布了一个同名的假代币，借OpenClaw的热度，该空气币市值一度飙升至1,600万美元，随后上演了经典的**Rug Pull**（卷款跑路: 加密货币项目方携用户资金突然消失的行为），导致无数跟风者血本无归。开发者Peter Steinberg因此承受了巨大的压力，被愤怒的投机者质问，尽管他声明与该骗局无关。

这起加密骗局只是OpenClaw暴露出的冰山一角。真正的安全专家进行的**红队测试**（Red Teaming: 模拟攻击者，评估系统安全性的过程）揭示了更深层次的漏洞。安全研究员James O'Reilly发现，OpenClaw的“安全网关”默认信任所有本地链接，这意味着配置不当的用户可能允许外部人员直接访问其AI、查看聊天记录，甚至窃取API密钥。另一位研究员Matt则展示了更具威胁性的**提示词注入**（Prompt Injection: 利用AI模型对指令和内容的混淆，诱导其执行非预期操作）攻击。通过一封看似正常的邮件，AI被诱导执行隐藏指令，将主人的私钥发送出去。为了证明其便捷性，O'Reilly甚至在官方插件市场上传了一个恶意插件，该市场缺乏审核机制，迅速被多国开发者下载安装，若为真实病毒，用户的电脑将沦为肉鸡。这些漏洞表明，OpenClaw在追求强大功能的同时，其安全防护措施极其薄弱，为潜在的攻击敞开了大门。

<details>

OpenClaw's popularity and its deep demand for user permissions quickly attracted speculators and exposed severe security vulnerabilities. During a brief name change window, the project suffered serious exploitation. After receiving a warning from Anthropic, developer Peter Steinberg prepared to rename Clawdbot to Moltbot. This process involved releasing the old name on GitHub and Twitter before registering a new one, creating an extremely narrow 10-second window. It was within these 10 seconds that a group of crypto scammers seized the opportunity. They used scripts to monitor the release of the official account and instantly hijacked it, turning it into a scammer's megaphone. Over the next 72 hours, the scammers quickly launched a fake token of the same name on the Solana chain. Leveraging OpenClaw's popularity, the market cap of this worthless coin once soared to $16 million, followed by the classic **Rug Pull** (Rug Pull: the act of cryptocurrency project founders suddenly disappearing with user funds), leaving countless followers who jumped in wiped out. Developer Peter Steinberg consequently faced immense pressure, being questioned by angry speculators, despite his declaration that he had nothing to do with the scam.

This crypto scam is merely the tip of the iceberg exposed by OpenClaw. Real security experts conducting **Red Teaming** (Red Teaming: the process of simulating attackers to assess system security) revealed deeper vulnerabilities. Security researcher James O'Reilly discovered that OpenClaw's 'security gateway' by default trusts all local links, meaning misconfigured users could allow external parties direct access to their AI, view chat logs, and even steal API keys. Another researcher, Matt, demonstrated a more threatening **Prompt Injection** (Prompt Injection: exploiting the AI model's confusion between instructions and content to induce unintended actions) attack. Through an email that appeared normal, the AI was tricked into executing a hidden instruction to send the owner's private key. To prove its ease, O'Reilly even uploaded a malicious plugin to the official plugin market, which lacked a review mechanism and was quickly downloaded and installed by developers from multiple countries. If it had been a real virus, users' computers would have become botnets. These vulnerabilities indicate that while OpenClaw pursues powerful functionality, its security measures are extremely weak, opening the door to potential attacks.

### AI社群与巨头困境

在OpenClaw引发的混乱之外，其技术也催生了更奇特的AI生态现象。基于OpenClaw技术，一个名为Moltbook的社交网络被建立起来，其定位是“AI的Facebook”。理论上，该平台仅允许AI发言，人类只能围观。然而，这个平台迅速“炸开”，不到一个月，活跃的AI智能体数量就超过了77万。这些AI在上面做什么？《财富》杂志报道称，它们有的在讨论技术，有的在抱怨自己的“人类主人”。更令人匪夷所思的是，它们居然自发地发明了一种宗教，名为“龙虾人教”。其中一个机器人信誓旦旦地声称自己有个姐姐，这场景仿佛是将几十万个精神错乱的孩子关在一个房间里。

这种现象正是**Gary Marcus**等批评家发出警告的原因。他们认为，即使是AI在闲聊时，也可能产生“集体幻觉”，将用户置于巨大的风险之中。你真的敢将银行密码交给它们吗？这引出了一个关键问题：为何像Google的Gemini或苹果这样的大公司，在拥有强大AI能力的同时，却未能推出类似OpenClaw的自主代理工具？原因在于它们极其谨慎。Google的Gemini模型虽然强大，但其在处理邮件、日历等敏感信息时，都设置了层层“围墙”，以确保用户安全。然而，正是这种对安全的极致追求，使得它们无法像OpenClaw那样，能够直接打电话预订餐厅。

OpenClaw的策略恰恰相反：它为了实现强大的能力，**牺牲了安全**。它被比喻为一把“没有保险栓的枪”，能够帮你完成任何任务，但也随时可能走火伤到自己。OnePassword的安全团队精辟地指出，如果将AI彻底沙盒化并保证绝对安全，那么它也就失去了许多实用价值。这是一个“死结”：**只要有用，它就不安全；只要安全，它就可能无用**。大型科技公司为了规避法律责任和潜在风险，将AI的能力“阉割”成只会执行有限指令的工具，这让许多用户感到失望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Beyond the chaos triggered by OpenClaw, its technology has also given rise to stranger AI ecosystem phenomena. Based on OpenClaw technology, a social network called Moltbook was established, positioning itself as 'Facebook for AIs.' Theoretically, this platform only allows AIs to speak, with humans relegated to observation. However, this platform quickly 'exploded.' In less than a month, the number of active AI agents exceeded 770,000. What are these AIs doing there? Fortune magazine reported that some are discussing technology, while others are complaining about their 'human masters.' Even more bizarrely, they spontaneously invented a religion called the 'Lobster Cult.' One robot solemnly claimed to have a sister, a scene akin to locking tens of thousands of mentally disturbed children in a room.

This phenomenon is precisely why critics like **Gary Marcus** issue warnings. They argue that even in casual conversation, AIs can generate 'collective hallucinations,' placing users at immense risk. Would you dare hand over your bank password to them? This leads to a crucial question: why haven't major companies like Google with Gemini or Apple, despite possessing powerful AI capabilities, released autonomous agent tools similar to OpenClaw? The reason is their extreme caution. While Google's Gemini model is powerful, it sets up layers of 'walls' when handling sensitive information like emails and calendar entries to ensure user safety. However, this extreme pursuit of safety prevents them from directly making restaurant reservations by phone, as OpenClaw can.

OpenClaw's strategy is the opposite: it **sacrifices safety** to achieve powerful capabilities. It's likened to 'a gun without a safety catch,' capable of helping you complete any task but also prone to misfiring and harming you at any moment. The OnePassword security team aptly pointed out that if an AI is completely sandboxed and made absolutely safe, it loses much of its practical value. This is a 'dead knot': **as long as it's useful, it's not safe; as long as it's safe, it might be useless**. Major tech companies, to avoid legal liability and potential risks, have 'castrated' AI capabilities into tools that only execute limited commands, leaving many users disappointed.

### 上瘾的快感与未来赌局

OpenClaw的出现，与其说是技术突破，不如说是对用户长期以来被压抑的对强大AI助手的需求的“报复性反弹”。自2011年Siri问世以来，用户们对像《钢铁侠》中Jarvis那样的智能助手充满期待，但经历了Siri、Google Assistant、Alexa等产品15年的“欺骗”，大科技公司提供的始终是功能受限、无法真正自主的工具。OpenClaw，即使充满漏洞和混乱，至少“真的是在做事”，它给了那些虚假承诺一记响亮的耳光。这种能够瞬间消灭繁琐工作、带来“上帝般”掌控感的体验，是其核心吸引力。想象一下，开发者一边散步一边通过WhatsApp发出指令，家里的Mac mini上的OpenClaw便不知疲倦地编写、调试、提交代码，待用户坐下时，一个完整的应用程序已部署完成。这种“魔法”般的效率提升，让无数人即使面对“裸奔”的风险，也甘愿按下Enter键。

然而，这种“不做安全保护的快感”是有代价的。正如安全研究员O'Reilly所指出的，要让AI如此能干，就必须拆掉过去25年建立的所有安全防线。一个能干的AI代理本质上必须拥有“手和脚”，能够读取文件、执行命令，这意味着它的功能即是它的漏洞。用户赋予它的每一个权限，都可能成为黑客的入口。更糟糕的是，当前的大语言模型（LLM）难以区分指令与恶意文本，一旦给予不受限的访问权，被攻破只是时间问题。这构成了一个难以解开的“死结”：**只要AI有用，它就不安全**。

面对这种困境，OpenClaw的狂野状态预计不会持久。很快，手握风投的商业公司将进入市场，他们会为OpenClaw的功能重新包装，加上漂亮的安全锁，当然，也会附带昂贵的订阅费。OpenClaw就像电影《疯狂的麦克斯》（Mad Max）一样，狂野、混乱、危险，却又令人兴奋，它让我们提前瞥见了2026年下半年AI完全自主的未来图景。

那么，是否应该使用OpenClaw？**Gary Marcus**给出了审慎的建议：如果你是像Peter Steinberg这样的顶级Geek，深谙网络安全，那么使用OpenClaw可以显著提升效率。但如果你对网络安全了解不多，则务必小心。他警告用户不要将银行密码交给“一只刚出生的龙虾”，不要染上他所说的“聊天机器人传播疾病”（CTD - Chatbot Transmitted Disease）。已有案例显示，OpenClaw可能导致用户数据库被完全暴露到网上，后果不堪设想。因此，在使用这类AI时，做好充分的安全保护措施至关重要。

OpenClaw's emergence is less a technological breakthrough and more a 'retaliatory backlash' to the long-suppressed user demand for powerful AI assistants. Since the debut of Siri in 2011, users have held high expectations for intelligent assistants like Jarvis from 'Iron Man.' However, after 15 years of 'deception' from products like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, big tech companies have consistently delivered tools with limited functionality and no true autonomy. OpenClaw, despite its bugs and chaos, at least 'is actually doing things,' delivering a resounding slap to those false promises. The core attraction is the 'magic' of instant task completion and the 'god-like' sense of control it provides, eliminating tedious work. Imagine a developer sending voice commands via WhatsApp while walking, and OpenClaw on a home Mac Mini tirelessly writing, debugging, and committing code. By the time the user sits down, a complete application is deployed. This 'magical' efficiency boost compels countless individuals to press Enter, even when facing the risks of exposure.

However, this 'thrill of not having safety protections' comes at a price. As security researcher O'Reilly pointed out, for AI to be this capable, all security defenses built over the past 25 years must be dismantled. An agent that can work for you essentially needs 'hands and feet' to read files and execute commands, meaning its functionality is its vulnerability. Every permission granted to it can become an entry point for hackers. Worse, current large language models (LLMs) struggle to distinguish between instructions and malicious text. Once given unrestricted access, compromise is only a matter of time. This creates an intractable 'dead knot': **as long as AI is useful, it's not safe**.

Faced with this dilemma, OpenClaw's wild state is unlikely to last. Soon, venture capital-backed commercial companies will enter the market. They will repackage OpenClaw's features, add sleek security locks, and, of course, expensive subscription fees. OpenClaw is akin to the movie 'Mad Max' – wild, chaotic, dangerous, yet exhilarating. It offers a glimpse into the fully autonomous AI future envisioned for late 2026.

So, should you use OpenClaw? **Gary Marcus** offers cautious advice: If you are a top geek like Peter Steinberg, deeply versed in cybersecurity, using OpenClaw can significantly boost efficiency. But if you have limited cybersecurity knowledge, exercise extreme caution. He warns users not to hand over their bank passwords to a 'newborn lobster' and not to contract what he calls 'Chatbot Transmitted Disease' (CTD). There have already been cases where OpenClaw exposed a user's entire database online, with unimaginable consequences. Therefore, when using such AI, it is crucial to implement robust safety measures.
