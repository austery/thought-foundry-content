### 新闻播报

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 1 月 7 日，星期三。以下是今天的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, January 7th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

### 委内瑞拉石油与美国要求

**Tracy Mumford**: 从特朗普总统宣布美国已扣押委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗的那一刻起，他的政府就一直在吹嘘该国庞大石油储量的潜力。委内瑞拉拥有世界上最大的已探明石油储量。石油至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the moment President Trump announced that the US had seized Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro, his administration has been talking up the potential of the country's vast oil reserves. Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserve in the world. Look, oil is critical.

</details>

**引述**: 我们想做的是修复石油，修复这个国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: What we want to do is fix up the oil, fix up the country.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，特朗普声称委内瑞拉将开始向美国移交部分石油。他在昨天的社交媒体帖子中说，该国将运送价值约 20 亿至 30 亿美元的石油，尽管尚不清楚委内瑞拉将获得什么回报，如果有的话。特朗普表示，他将控制出售石油的利润，以“惠及委内瑞拉人民和美国”。特朗普还表示，他将为美国石油公司在委内瑞拉开始更多生产扫清道路。他将于本周晚些时候在华盛顿会见石油高管。与此同时，《泰晤士报》获悉，白宫正在向委内瑞拉提出其他要求。美国官员称，国务卿马尔科·卢比奥本周与该国临时总统德利·罗德里格斯举行了一次秘密会议，会上他要求驱逐中国的、俄罗斯的、古巴的和伊朗的顾问及军事人员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, Trump claims Venezuela will start handing over some of that oil to the US. In a social media post yesterday, he said the country will ship roughly 2 to 3 billion worth of oil, though it's not clear what, if anything, Venezuela will get in return. Trump said he would control the profits from selling it to quote benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States. Trump has also said he's going to clear the path for American oil companies to start more production in Venezuela. He's set to meet with oil executives in Washington later this week. Meanwhile, the Times has learned that the White House is making other demands on Venezuela. US officials say Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a classified meeting this week with Deli Rodriguez, the country's interim president, in which he demanded that she expel Chinese, Russian, Cuban, and Iranian advisers and military personnel.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 但面对政府持续声称美国说了算，委内瑞拉领导人公开表现出强硬姿态。在昨天的演讲中，罗德里格斯说：“委内瑞拉政府管理着我们的国家，没有别人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: But in the face of the administration's ongoing claims that the US is in charge, Venezuelan leaders are publicly striking a defiant tone. In a speech yesterday, Rodriguez said, quote, "The government of Venezuela runs our country, no one else."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 大批民众也走上首都加拉加斯的街头，要求释放马杜罗。人们说，委内瑞拉国内正努力根除任何支持美国袭击的人，武装政府部队在检查站拦下民众搜查手机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: A large crowd also marched through the streets of the capital, Caracus, demanding Maduro's release. And people say there's an effort on the ground in Venezuela to root out anyone who supported the US raid with armed government forces stopping people at checkpoints to search their cell phones.

</details>

### 格陵兰岛收购

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，再快速更新几条关于特朗普政府的消息。随着特朗普总统因马杜罗被捕而备受鼓舞，他和他的团队正在加倍威胁要收购格陵兰岛。《泰晤士报》获悉，本周特朗普告诉他的助手们提交一份将该地区置于美国控制之下的最新计划。在与议员们的一次简报会上，马尔科·卢比奥说总统计划尝试购买它，尽管他没有提供任何细节。特朗普自第一任期以来就一直在谈论接管格陵兰岛，称其为国家安全优先事项。它富含稀土矿产，位于北极圈内，美国、俄罗斯和中国正在那里争夺控制权。在昨天发布的一份联合声明中，法国、德国、英国和其他国家的领导人对特朗普政府进行了反击，写道：“格陵兰岛属于它的人民。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, a few more quick updates on the Trump administration. With President Trump emboldened by the capture of Maduro, he and his team are doubling down on their threats to acquire Greenland. The Times has learned that this week Trump told his aids to deliver an updated plan for bringing the territory under US control. And in a briefing with lawmakers, Marco Rubio said the president plans to try and purchase it, though he didn't give any details. Trump has talked about taking over Greenland since his first term, framing it as a national security priority. It's rich in rare earth minerals and located in the Arctic Circle, where the US, Russia, and China are fighting for control. In a joint statement released yesterday, the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, and other countries pushed back on the Trump administration, writing, quote, "greenland belongs to its people."

</details>

### 中期选举与弹劾

**Tracy Mumford**: 此外，在一次对众议院共和党人的演讲中，特朗普总统敲响了中期选举的警钟，他说他预计民主党将在秋季赢得席位，这可能为他的第三次弹劾铺平道路。截至昨天，共和党在众议院以微弱优势领先的多数席位变得更加微弱，因为玛乔丽·泰勒·格林辞职，加州的道格·拉马尔法在一次紧急手术中去世。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Also, in a speech to House Republicans, President Trump sounded the alarm about the midterm elections, saying he expects Democrats to pick up seats in the fall, potentially setting the stage for his third impeachment. As of yesterday, Republicans razor thin majority in the House got even slimmer after Marjorie Taylor Green resigned and Doug Lamalfa of California died during an emergency surgery.

</details>

**President Trump**: “你们必须赢得中期选举，因为如果我们不赢得中期选举，他们就会找到理由弹劾我。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: "You got to win the midterms, cuz if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me."

</details>

### 国会骚乱叙事

**Tracy Mumford**: 而在“挺特朗普暴徒袭击美国国会大厦”五周年之际，政府做出了迄今为止最厚颜无耻的努力，试图改写骚乱的历史。白宫昨天在其网站上发布了一个新页面，指责国会警察先动手袭击，并指责暴力事件的主要目标民主党未能阻止袭击。该网站还列出了几名在袭击中或与袭击有关而死亡的右翼人群成员的名字，但没有提及当天受伤的近 140 名警察或在事后死亡的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And on the fifth anniversary of a proTrump mob attacking the US capital, the administration made its most brazen effort yet to rewrite the history of the riot. The White House posted a new page on its website yesterday that blames Capitol police officers for starting the assault and blames Democrats, who were the main targets of the violence, for failing to prevent it. The site also lists out the names of several right-wing members of the crowd who died during or in connection with the assault, but it contains no references to the nearly 140 police officers who were injured that day or those who died in the aftermath.

### 洛杉矶野火与有毒家园

**Tracy Mumford**: 一年前的今天，洛杉矶爆发了野火，摧毁了阿尔塔迪纳和太平洋 Palisades 的大部分地区。至少有 31 人死亡，近 80 平方英里的居民区和商业区被夷为平地。现在，那些家园未被烧毁的人们正面临着另一种危险：烟雾中一切燃烧物的污染，包括轮胎、金属和塑料。《纽约时报》的一项调查追踪了一个家庭如何最终住回一栋有毒房屋，以及有多少其他人可能面临同样的现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: One year ago today, wildfires erupted in Los Angeles, destroying much of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades. At least 31 people were killed, and nearly 80 square miles of neighborhoods and businesses were obliterated. Now, people whose homes didn't burn are confronting a different danger. Contamination from the smoke of everything that went up in flames, tires and metals and plastics. A New York Times investigation traced how one family ended up back in a toxic house and how many others may be facing the same reality.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 大火过后，Jeff Vaness 和 Kathleen Pineda 与他们的两个孩子一起在一家酒店住了 7 个月，期间保险公司支付了房屋的专业清洁费用。之后，Farmers Insurance 公司表示，检测显示房屋是安全的。这个家庭并不确定。Kathleen 曾有癌症诊断史，他们的孩子还小。他们不想冒险，于是自己支付了检测费用，结果显示铅含量令人担忧。但 Farmers 公司驳回了这一说法，并停止支付酒店费用。到 8 月，这个家庭觉得别无选择，只能搬回去，并尽力不断地清洁、拖地和擦拭所有东西。为了了解这是否安全，《泰晤士报》于今年秋天征得该家庭的许可，对污染物进行了检测，并收集了头发样本以测量其潜在暴露情况。结果显示：搬回去后，每个人的头发都显示出重金属含量明显升高。他们的女儿头发中的砷含量是正常水平的 10 倍，冰箱附近的铅读数显示重金属含量是联邦限值的 27 倍。《泰晤士报》请 10 位健康专家审阅了结果。他们都表示，保险公司支付的修复费用并不充分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: After the fire, Jeff Vaness and Kathleen Pineda spent 7 months in a hotel with their two kids while insurance paid for a professional cleaning of their house. Afterwards, the company Farmers Insurance said tests showed it was safe. The family wasn't sure. Kathleen had a previous cancer diagnosis and their kids were little. They didn't want to take any risks, so they paid for their own test, which showed concerning levels of lead. But farmers dismissed that and stopped paying for the hotel. By August, the family felt like they had no choice but to move back and just try to keep cleaning, mopping, and wiping absolutely everything constantly. To understand whether that was safe, the Times asked the family this fall for permission to test for contaminants and to collect hair samples to measure their potential exposure. The results: Everyone's hair showed a measurable spike in heavy metals after they moved back in. Their daughter's hair had 10 times the normal levels of arsenic, and lead readings showed 27 times the federal limit of the heavy metal near the refrigerator. The Times asked 10 health experts to review the results. All of them said that the remediation that insurance had covered wasn't sufficient.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: Van Ness 一家的故事几乎肯定不是个例，因为没有州或联邦标准规定保险公司在发生烟雾损害后应如何清理房屋。而《泰晤士报》发现，保险行业使用的标准部分依赖于那些未经同行评审或由行业自身资助的研究论文。一位公共卫生专家称之为“雇佣科学”。毒理学家说，要真正净化一栋房屋，必须清除烟雾接触过的每一个表面，如硬木地板、瓷砖、石膏、灰泥，这个过程的成本远远高于 Farmers 公司为 Van Ness 一家支付的大约 25,000 美元的清洁费用。针对《泰晤士报》的提问，Farmers 公司表示，每起索赔都根据个体情况进行评估，并且无法评论个别案件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Van Ness's story is almost certainly not a one-off since there is no state or federal standard for how an insurance company should clean a house after smoke damage. And the Times found that the standard the insurance industry uses relies in part on research papers that either haven't been peer- reviewed or were funded by the industry itself. One public health expert described it as science for hire. Toxicologists say that to truly decontaminate a house, you'd have to remove every surface the smoke touched. the hardwood floors, the tiles, plaster, stucco, a process that would be far, far more expensive than the roughly $25,000 of cleaning that farmers covered for the Vaness family. In response to questions from the Times, farmers said every claim is evaluated on an individual basis and that it couldn't comment on individual cases.

### 南极科考

**Tracy Mumford**: 当然，我们仍在海上，但地貌已经完全改变了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: We're still on the ocean, of course, but the landscape has changed entirely.

</details>

**Raymond Jang**: 而且，我们开始看到野生动物了。已经看到几只企鹅和几只海豹了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raymond Jang**: And finally, we're starting to see wildlife. Seen a few penguins, few seals already.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 《泰晤士报》气候记者 Raymond Jang 和摄影师 Chang Lee 正在进行一项为期近两个月的南极航行考察。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Times climate reporter Raymond Jang and photographer Chang Lee are on a nearly twomonlong expedition sailing to Antarctica.

</details>

**Raymond Jang**: 所以，这对我们来说是个大早晨。我们刚刚进入南极洲周围的浮冰区，我将要……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raymond Jang**: So, it's a big morning for us on the ship. We have just entered the sea ice zone around Antarctica and I'm going to

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他们加入了一个由约 40 名来自世界各地的研究人员组成的团队，乘坐破冰船前往 Thwaites 冰川。这是一座面积相当于佛罗里达州的冰川，厚度超过一英里，并且正在迅速融化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: They've joined a team of about 40 researchers from around the world on an icebreaker headed towards Thuait. It's a glacier the size of Florida that's more than a mile thick and it is melting fast.

</details>

**Raymond Jang**: 仅仅因为 Thwaites 的地理位置，它就像瓶子里的软木塞一样。如果 Thwaites 真的开始崩解、破碎，并迅速流入大海，那么你可能会看到周围的更多冰川也发生同样的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raymond Jang**: Just because of the way Thuait is situated, it just sort of is like this cork in the bottle. If the thuates really starts to disintegrate, break up, flow really quickly out to sea, then you could start seeing a lot more glaciers around it doing the same.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: Ry 说，科学家们正计划从 Thwaites 收集数据，以更好地了解南极洲正在融化的冰川，这些冰川已经开始导致海平面上升。你可以在 nytimes.com/antarctarctica 上追踪 Rey 和 Chang 的旅程，那里有船只的实时位置、关于考察的问答以及研究开始时的视频更新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Ry says that the scientists are planning to gather data from Thuaits to better understand Antarctica's melting glaciers, which are already starting to push up sea levels. You can track Rey and Chang's journey at ny times.com/antarctarctica with a live location of the ship along with Q&As's about the expedition and video updates as the research begins.

**Tracy Mumford**: 这些是今天的头条新闻。

### 中期选举策略

**引述**: 我会说，民主党人普遍充满着一种焦虑的乐观情绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I would say that Democrats are broadly filled with an anxious optimism.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 看看民主党和共和党是如何制定策略并为中期选举做准备的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: A look at how Democrats and Republicans are strategizing and bracing for the midterm elections.

</details>

**引述**: 我认为“恐惧”是这里的正确词汇。共和党人在去年年底感到非常悲观，认为他们无法保住对众议院的控制权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I think that dreading is the correct word here. Republicans ended last year feeling very pessimistic about their chance of holding on to control of the House.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 你可以在《纽约时报》应用程序或任何你收听播客的地方收听。我是 Tracy Mumford。明天再见。
