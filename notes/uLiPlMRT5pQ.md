### CPG行业的挑战与竞争

**Alison Roman**: 我认为我的梦想一直是使用最高品质的食材。我喜欢用那些没人要的、又老又丑的青葱和坏掉的番茄，然后用这些废弃的食材做出美味的东西。这是我的愿望。这种商业模式会走向一条非常昂贵的道路，我认为它可以在大规模生产中实现，但我们还没有达到那个阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think it would be my dream to always use the highest quality ingredients. I'd love to use like old ugly shallots that nobody wants and the bad tomatoes and like make something beautiful from waste. And and that's my aspiration. And and that business model let down a very, very expensive path and I think is achievable at massive scale. But we're just not there yet.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 等等，多说一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wait. Say more about that.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 基本上，这就是消费品（**CPG**）行业普遍存在的问题。如果你想开一家小型的夫妻店，产品是本地采购、制作精美、员工工资优厚，那么一罐番茄酱可能要卖到38美元。这样一来，愿意为此买单的市场就会非常有限。你知道，我逛当地的杂货店时，做的第一件事就是去番茄酱货架。我就是想知道那里有什么。但你会看到**Rao’s**和**Carbone**摆在同一视线水平，后面还有额外的商品陈列。它们都以8.99美元的价格出售，而且是32盎司一罐。我们的罐子是16盎司，零售价是12.99美元或12美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Basically that is sort of the the issue with CPG in general. And if you want to make a small mom and pop like locally sourced, like beautifully made, responsibly pay your workers excellent wages and it's going to be like a $38 jar of tomato sauce. And it's going to be a very limited market of people that are willing to pay for that. And, you know, I look at my local grocery store and I the first thing I do is I go to the tomato sauce aisle. I'm just like, got to know what's going on over there. But you see **Rao’s** and **Carbone** on the same eye level and additional, merchandizing behind you. And they are both on sale for $8.99, and that's a 32 ounce jar. Our jars are 16oz. And you know, $12.99 or $12 retail.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是**Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Alloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，我们是在2月4日录制这期节目，最近很多科技股都遭受重创。但你知道什么表现得很好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, Tracy, we're recording this on February 4th, and, a lot of tech stocks have been getting clobbered lately. But you know what's doing really well?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 哪些公司？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What companies?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 生产消费必需品的公司，你厨房里所有的核心必需品，比如**百事可乐**之类的。生产罐装酱料之类的公司，人们又回到了股市中购买那些老式的基本必需品。谁会想到食物是“林迪效应”的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Companies that make, consumer staples, all of like, the core staples that you'd see in your pantry, etc., like your Pepsi Cola and all this stuff. Companies that might make, like, jarred sauces and stuff, people are returning to sort of, the old style basics that people buy in the stock market. Who would have thought that food is land?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 令人惊叹的食物经久不衰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Amazing food persist.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没人是认真的。你知道，这就像现在市场上唯一的避风港。我看着我的屏幕，一切都是鲜红色，而现在人们唯一敢下注的似乎就是食物。意大利面酱和人们一直以来都在吃的东西，而且只要地球上有人，可能就会一直吃下去，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Nobody's serious. You know, it's like the only place to hide right now on the market. Like, I look at my screen and everything is bright red, and the only thing that people feel comfortable betting on right now seems to basically be food. Pasta sauce and the stuff that, that people have eaten for all time and probably will be eating for as long as there are people on earth, right?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 总是这样。所以我发现这个行业真的很有趣，因为，你知道，我开玩笑说食物在很多方面都具有“林迪效应”，但是，食物是必需品，但它也在不断变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And this always. So I find this business really interesting because, you know, I joke that food is Lindy in many ways, but, you know, like food is right. Food is essential, but it's also constantly changing.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，感觉就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, it feels like.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以我总是很好奇消费品牌是如何做出定价决策和品牌决策的，尤其是在这个领域感觉非常拥挤。你知道，你走进超市，就有20种不同品牌的，我不知道，面粉之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And so I'm always very curious about how consumer brands actually make pricing decisions, branding decisions, especially because it also feels like an area that's very crowded. You know, you walk into the supermarket and there's like 20 different brands of, I don't know, flour or something.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，完全是这样。你知道，我们多年来做过各种**CPG**相关的节目，也做过关于**Celsius**能量饮料之类的节目。我们之前可能没有充分认识到的一点是，货架空间的竞争。是的，分销方面，上架，在运送饮料到杂货店或小卖部的卡车上获得一席之地，这其中很大一部分是关于品牌、产品，然后就是物流方面。我认为我们对这方面谈论得不够多，但作为一个主题，我喜欢了解这个领域，了解**CPG**业务是如何运作的，因为它正如你所说，尤其是在定价等方面，它非常能说明整个经济是如何运作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, totally. You know, one of the things, you know, we've done various CPG episodes over the years and we did some episodes about like Celsius energy drink and stuff. And one of the themes that we sort of maybe I hadn't appreciated prior is like that competition for shelf space. Yeah, the distribution aspect, getting on the shelf, getting a spot in the truck that delivers the beverages to the grocery store or to the bodega or whatever, like so much of the game is. Yes, the brand. Yes, the product. And then just the sort of logistical aspects of it. And I think like that, that sort of we don't talk about it enough, but as a theme, I love, like learning about this space, how the CPG business works, because it just to your point, especially with regards to pricing and so forth, it's so illuminating about how the whole economy works.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: “Illuminating”是个词吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Is that a word?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: “Illuminating”？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Illuminating? Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Very good.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，我们请到了完美的嘉宾。我非常高兴地说，我们今天请到了完美的嘉宾，她从事番茄酱业务，但她的名气远不止于此。她是当今美食界最有名的人之一，我们将与**Alison Roman**对话。她是一位厨师和作家。她有一家名为**First Bloom**的杂货店，我错过了他们在曼哈顿的快闪店。我错过了。希望它能在某个时候重新开业。她的番茄酱业务叫做**A Very Good Tomato Sauce**。所以，**Alison**，非常感谢你来到《Odd Lots》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, we do have the perfect guest. I'm very excited to say we do have the perfect guest today, someone who is, in the tomato sauce business but really known for, so much more. One of the, I would say, most famous people in the food world these days, we are going to be speaking with **Alison Roman**. She's a cook and the author. She has a grocery store called **First Bloom** that, I missed when they had a pop up Manhattan location. I missed it. Hopefully, you know, that'll get reopened at some point. And tomato sauce business called **A Very Good Tomato Sauce**. So **Alison**, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 哦，谢谢你们邀请我。这很荣幸。从何说起呢？你是美食界真正的名人。人们对你的食谱着迷，非常喜欢。就在两天前，我妻子在家做了你的，我想是西兰花切达奶酪汤的食谱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Oh, thank you for having me. This is a pleasure. Where to begin? You are this, a genuine celebrity of the food world. People are addicted, and they love your recipes. I just at home two nights ago, my wife made your, I think it was like a broccoli cheddar soup that you have a recipe for.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，那是一个“深层挖掘”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, that's a deep dish.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 那很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: That is is a deep cut. That's cool.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我吃过你著名的鹰嘴豆炖菜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I've had your famous, chickpeas do.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，那个火了。我们有很多食谱都火了。但是你为什么决定进入番茄酱这个行业呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, that went viral. We've had multiple recipes go viral. But how did you decide to get into why a tomato sauce.

</details>

### 从自制到规模化生产

**Alison Roman**: 我想，我是在专业厨房开始我的职业生涯的，然后我在编辑部工作，之后我开始自己写书，做各种各样的事情。我作为食谱作家、食谱书作者的整个职业生涯，一直在教大家如何烹饪，并告诉大家：“如果你能自己做，为什么要买呢？”你知道，作为一个厨房里堆满了食材而不是成品的人，我进入番茄酱行业很有趣，因为我写过番茄酱的食谱，我为我的食谱感到非常自豪，我认为它美味又容易做，任何人都可以做。后来我年纪大了，我嫁给了一个不做饭的男人。我生了一个孩子。不幸的是，孩子现在也不做饭。我需要吃更多的东西。我需要有人为我做饭，于是我开始思考：“为什么我对市面上的番茄酱如此排斥？为什么我不接受现有的产品？”我意识到这是因为我，首先，非常挑剔；其次，可能非常势利。我就是想自己做，想自己掌控。所以我就自己做了。当我开**First Bloom**杂货店时，我决定开始把它作为我们冷冻产品线的一部分，比如鸡汤、豆子、番茄酱，这些都是我们在店里制作并出售给市场上的顾客的产品。很快，需求超过了供应。而且，你知道，在我做的所有事情中，我不想全职做番茄酱。我没有设备，也没有时间。所以，一位从事番茄酱制作业务的人找到了我。她说：“你为什么不把它外包出去，让别人来做你的食谱呢？”我说：“那怎么行呢？人们不会发现区别吗？怎么可能规模化生产呢？”经过大量的试验和错误，我发现我们可以规模化生产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think I well, I got my start working in professional kitchens and I worked in editorial, and then I sort of went off on my own writing books and doing miscellaneous things and my whole career as sort of a recipe writer, cookbook author has been teaching you how to cook and being like, why would you buy anything when you can make it yourself? You know, as the person who their pantry is lined with like ingredients rather than, you know, things. So it's funny that I that got into the tomato sauce business because I've written recipes for tomato sauce, and I'm very proud of mine, and I think it's delicious and easy to make and anyone can do it. And then the older I got and I married a man who does not cook. I had a baby. The baby does not cook yet either, unfortunately. I needed to eat more. I needed someone to cook for me and it just became sort of this question I had of like, why am I so allergic to the tomato sauce is on the market? Why am I not embracing of the things that are currently available? And I realized it's because I'm, well, a very picky, b probably very snobby. See, I just was sort of, you know, like, I do want to make it myself. I do want to sort of control here. So I made it myself. And when I had opened the grocery store **First Bloom**, I decided to start including it as like a line of things that we would keep in the freezer a chicken broth, beans, tomato sauce, things that we would make in the store to sell to people at the market. And very soon the demand exceeded supply. And I, you know, for all the things that I do, I did not want to be full time making tomato sauce. There was just I didn't have the equipment, I didn't have the time. And so I was approached by somebody who is in the tomato sauce making business. And she was like, why don't you just outsource it and have somebody make your recipe? And I was like, well, how is that going to work? You know, like how? But won't people know the difference and how could it possibly scale? And through a lot of trial and error, I figured out we can scale it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我肯定想问问规模化生产的问题，但在那之前，你有没有因为专门做番茄酱而感到畏惧？因为这似乎是一个竞争非常激烈的领域，尤其是两大巨头，**Rao’s**和**Carbone**。对吧？那些便宜货是什么？我想它们不是竞争对手。是的，我买过一次**Carbone**的东西，这可能说明了一些问题。但无论如何，你如何将你的产品与那些拥有非常强大品牌和客户认可度的品牌区分开来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I definitely want to ask about scaling up, but before we do, were you daunted at all by doing tomato sauce specifically because this seems to be an area where there is a lot of competition, especially between I can think of two like big players, which will be **Rao’s** and **Carbone**. Right? What are those cheap stuff? And I guess those aren't the competitors. Yeah, I bought the **Carbone** things once, which probably maybe says something about it. But anyway, how do you differentiate your product from, you know, those names with very, very strong branding and customer recognition?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，我认为这很有趣，因为有时人们创业时会说市场上有什么空缺，我要去填补它。显然，番茄酱市场有很多品牌不断争夺销售价格和货架空间。但没有像我这样的番茄酱，也没有。我发现市面上大多数番茄酱，尤其是那些受欢迎的，比如**Rao’s**、**Carbone**等，更偏向意式番茄酱（marinara）风格。它们的质地更均匀，更甜。它们通常含有牛至。它们追求的是一种特定的感觉。对我来说，我的番茄酱有点像老式**Progresso**的模式，那是我妈妈从小给我吃的，也是我吃过的。我认为那曾是黄金标准。人们也沿着这条路走下去。有趣的是，我们把**Carbone**说成是前两名，但它们并不老。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, I think it's an interesting thing because sometimes, often people start a business saying what doesn't exist. There's a hole in the market, I'm going to fill it. And obviously tomato sauce. There are many brands constantly fighting for sale prices and shelf space. But there wasn't a tomato sauce like mine and there wasn't. I find that most tomato sauce is on the market, especially the popular ones. **Rose** **Carbone**, etc. are more marinara and style. They are, you know, more uniform in texture. They are sweeter. They tend to have oregano. There's just like a specific vibe that they're going for. And I think to me, sort of modeled after the like old school **Progresso**, which is what my mom growing up. And that's what I ate. And I think that that was sort of the gold standard. And people kind of went down that path. And it's interesting because we talk about **Carbone** as like the, you know, top two, they're not very old.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 所以在我们的意识中，它们是前两名。但它们成为前两名的时间，和它们存在的时间一样长，有人可以查证，但我相信只有几年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: And so we in our consciousness like, oh, well that's the top two. Well they've only been the top two for as long as they've been around which somebody can fact check. But I believe it's only a few years.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我想是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah I think that's right. Yeah.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 所以我竞争的不是一个历史悠久的品牌。它只是另一家拥有品牌知名度、大量资金支持和强大品牌的公司。我还注意到所有的番茄酱都偏向于“厨师主导”和“男性主导”的风格。它就像一个厨师，一个男人，一个兄弟，一个男人的名字。我不知道，我就是觉得我想做一些完全不同的事情，即使是番茄酱，我也不认为它们都是平等的。所以，我做的每一件事，我都会真诚地问自己，这东西已经存在了吗？如果没有，那我就想做它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: So it's not like this legacy brand that I'm competing with. It's just another company with name recognition, a lot of financial backing and strong branding. And I also noticed that all the tomato sauces were sort of like chef focused and, and male dominated energy. It was sort of like a chef, a guy, a bro, a person's name. That was a guy. And I don't know, I just was sort of like, I want to do something totally different, even if it's tomato sauce, I don't think they're all created equal. And so with everything I do, I genuinely try to ask myself, does this already exist? And if not, then I want to make it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我对“厨师兄弟”的风格有些想法，但我会在插播广告之后再说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I have some thoughts about Chef Bro energy, but I'm going to save them for after the plug.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我等不及了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I can't wait.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，我会在节目结束后再说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, I'm going. To save them for after the episode.

</details>

### 规模化生产的挑战与实践

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们谈谈，我想谈谈从你构思到最终消费者，整个供应链。所以我想真正地把它分解并理解。但我们先从如何规模化一个食谱开始。因为质量控制，你有一个你在厨房里做的食谱，你非常喜欢它等等，但是在大批量生产时，这完全是另一回事，而且你不能一直都在那里监督。请给我们讲讲这个过程，它是如何运作的，以至于你可以在家里做的食谱，可以在另一个工厂大规模生产，而且仍然是相同的食谱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's talk about I mean, I want to want to talk about the entire from your conception in your mind to, the end consumer, the whole supply chain. So I want to, like, really break it down and understand it. But let's start with, like, how do you scale up a recipe? Because quality control, you have some recipe that you make in your kitchen and you really like it, etc. but then there's, you know, but then making it in large batches, totally different game and then you're not there to supervise it all the time. Talk to us a little bit about that process, how just how that even works, such that a recipe that you make at home can be done by someone else at a different facility in volume, and it's still the same recipe.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，我认为你必须考虑到，这需要大量的知识，比如你对烹饪的知识以及食材如何反应，它们不是一比一的。你不能简单地乘以十，然后说：“这会是一样的东西。”此外，设备也不同。他们做事情的方式也不同。我们有三种口味：蒜味番茄酱，这是你的经典款；辣味茴香，顾名思义，是辣的，有茴香；还有焦糖青葱凤尾鱼酱，这是以**青葱意面**为原型制作的，它在疫情期间火了。我想我们都曾经做过它。如果我没有粉丝，**青葱意面**仍然会有上百万的拥趸，它肯定比我有名。那是最难搞定的一个，因为青葱的焦糖化，凤尾鱼的加入。是的。在第一批罐装后，我不得不回去三次调整食谱，而其他口味我最后没有这样做。但是因为青葱在大规模焦糖化时，它们会变得柔软、黏稠，而且非常甜，这会增加最终产品的甜度。我们最终改用了不同的青葱烹饪方法。我最终完全减少了用量，并进一步烹饪它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, I think that you have to consider, you know, there's a lot of knowledge that goes into it of like your knowledge of cooking and how ingredients, you know, they're not a one for one. You can't just multiply it by ten and be like, this is going to be the same thing. Also, the equipment is different. How they're doing things are different. We have three flavors. We have a garlicky tomato, which is sort of your classic, a spicy fennel, which is spicy and has fennel as advertised. And then a caramelized shallot anchovy, which is modeled after the **shallot pasta**, which. Is, which went viral during the I think we all at one point probably. Made it if I, if I have no fans, the **shallot pasta** will still have a million like it is. It is more famous than I am for sure. And that was the trickiest one to nail because the caramelizing of the shallots, the addition of anchovies. Yeah. I ended up having to go back three times after we had jarred the first batch and adjust the recipe, which I didn't have to do at the end with the others. But because shallots, when you caramelize at a large scale, they tend to get soft and jammy and very sweet, which increases the sweetness perception of the final product. We ended up switching to a different method of cooking the shallots. I ended to reducing the amount entirely, cooking them further.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 整个事情都必须改变，一旦我们开始进行批量生产。每个代工厂（co-packer）都不同。所以我想，你知道一个问题，我们会谈到。但是如果你谈论规模化，每个代工厂处理事情的方式都会不同。现在我们合作的是一个相当小的代工厂，我喜欢这样，因为我可以从我的公寓去拜访他们。他们在布鲁克林的**工业城**（Industry City），我去那里可以品尝批次。我可以提出，好吧，我们在这个食谱中把辣椒片的量乘以了，现在它太辣了。所以我们实际上要把它减半，这似乎是理所当然的，它就不会那么辣了，但是由于食材的特性，它就是这样。你知道，就是这样的事情，你就像在实验室里一样，边做边调整。我认为我越深入探索**CPG**世界，最大的挑战就是你不能只发一个食谱，然后就期待最好的结果。你真的必须在大规模生产中进行调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Like it? The whole thing had to change as soon as we started getting to the batch size. And each co-packer is different. So I think, you know an issue. We can we'll get there. But if you talk about scaling, it's each Co-packer is going to handle things differently. And right now we're with a pretty small co-packer, which I like because I can visit them in from my apartment. They're in **Industry City, Brooklyn**, and I go there and I can taste the batches. I can say, okay, we multiplied the chili flake in this recipe and now it's way too spicy. So we're actually going to cut it by half, which is it seems to stand the reason that that would be not nearly as spicy, but because of the way the ingredients behave. It is, you know, so stuff like that where you're sort of in the lab, as it were, tweaking as it goes. And I think that the more I explore the CPG world, that is the biggest challenge of you can't just send a recipe in and hope for the best. Like, you really have to be tweaking and adjusting at scale.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 现在番茄酱的生产规模有多大？就人数而言？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How big is the tomato sauce making operation right now? Like in people?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 两个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: It's two.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 两个人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: People. Two people?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。所以它相对较小。是的。他们有巨大的锅炉。我认为，当你想到为什么是番茄酱时。我就是知道，这样做可能是阻力最小的路径，而且我不是从零开始发明东西，也不是需要没人拥有的设备。这些锅炉可以制作很多不同的东西。所以代工厂更容易找到。这些特定的代工厂专门生产番茄酱。我遇到的大多数都是这样。这就是他们所做的。所以他们很了解情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. So it's like it's it's relatively small. Yes. They have big massive kettles. And I think that also when you think of like, why tomato sauce. Like I just, I kind of knew that getting there would maybe be the path of least resistance and, and that I'm not inventing something from scratch or not, you know, requiring equipment that nobody has. Like these are kettles that you can make many different things in. And so coat packers are a bit easier to find. These particular co packers specialize in tomato sauce. And most that I've encountered do. And that's like what they do. And so they are you know well informed.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 抱歉，我可能会问很多非常基础的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I'm sorry I might ask just a lot of like really remedial.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I love it.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那么，让我们深入探讨一下，那个两人厨房，他们制作番茄酱的地方，是一个独立的设施，还是和代工厂是同一个实体？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So let's go deep the the kitchen, the two person kitchen where they're making that is a separate facility than the Co-packer. Or is it the same entity.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是同一个实体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: It's the same entity.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的。所以我们有制作番茄酱的仓库。他们拿到罐子，对罐子进行消毒。他们制作酱料，批量生产酱料，然后装箱。然后这些箱子被运到一个第三方物流（**3PL**）仓库，这个仓库离番茄酱的生产地不远。所以我们节省了一些运输成本。当你在线订购时，番茄酱就是从那里发货的，因为现在我们在纽约州北部的杂货店里也有售。但是，由于一些原因，我们也可以深入探讨，我们现在只做**DTC**（直接面向消费者）模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay. So we have we have the the place the warehouse where the tomato sauce gets made. They get the jars and they sterilize the jars. They make the sauce, they batch the sauce, they put them in the boxes. The boxes then get shipped to a third party logistics warehouse, which is actually not far from where the tomato sauce is made. So we cut down on shipping a bit. And that is where the tomato sauce comes from when you order it online, because right now we are we do have it in store up in the upstate grocery store. But, for a few reasons, which we can also get into, we are just DDC.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 明白了。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Got it. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那么，再问一个可能很明显的问题，当你的业务发展到一定规模，比如有十个人等等，在食品行业中，有没有专门从事大规模烹饪的厨师？也就是说，如果有人像你一样有一个番茄酱的想法，你不可能每天都在那里。有没有人把大规模生产食谱的艺术专业化了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And then again, maybe very obvious question when it comes to, you know, maybe at some point you grow and it'll be ten people, etc. in the food industry, are there chefs whose job is more or less to specialize in cooking at scale, that basically it's like, okay, someone has an idea for a tomato sauce like you, you know, you're not you can't be there every day. Other people who, like, have professionalized the art of scaling up a. Recipe for volume.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我从来没有听说过专门有这种工作，但是，为我们制作番茄酱的那个人，他的主要工作就是这个。他以前是厨师，做过很多餐饮，私人厨师等等。然后我认为要理解如何大规模生产，你需要大量的试错。你必须从不同的角度去理解它。但即使在餐厅工作，我也经历过这种情况，因为你拿的是为家庭厨师制作的食谱，尤其是烘焙。你要为餐厅制作饼干。你从别人的食谱书中找一个你喜欢的食谱。什么？我不知道。然后你会想，好吧，我现在每天要制作200个饼干，而不是60个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I mean, I've never heard of that job specifically, but I mean, the guy, who makes the tomato sauce for us like that is his primary. I mean, he was a chef, you know, did a lot of catering, a private chef, etc.. And then I think to understand how to make things at scale you do have, it's a lot of trial and error. You have to, like, understand it from a different perspective. But even working in restaurants, I experience this because you take recipes built for a home cook, especially, say, baking. You're going to make biscuits for a restaurant. You take a recipe that you like from somebody's cookbook. What? I don't know. And you're like, okay, well, now I have to make these biscuits for I have to make 200 of them a day. I'm not making 60.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，你永远不能简单地把那个食谱乘以倍数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, and you cannot just multiply that recipe ever.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 所以我在烘焙领域有了一些大规模工作的经验，因为在糕点厨房里，你从来不会只做16个东西，你会做200个。所以你就能理解，反过来，在我刚开始在**Test Kitchen**工作时，我们做了更多厨师主导的食谱。当你在专业厨房工作时，你制作酱料，你会制作16夸脱的酱料，而不是两杯酱料。所以这种逆向工程，理解它是同一回事。即使你减少了，食材也会有起伏。所以这只是提前拥有这些知识。但我认为这就是那些人如何成为代工厂的。当我们寻找其他产品来制作时，就会想，好吧，这些人专门做烘焙食品。这些人专门做格兰诺拉麦片。这些人，你知道，这就是他们所做的。所以他们知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: And so I had a bit of experience in, in the baking world working at scale because you're never making 16 of something in a pastry kitchen. You're making 200. And so you kind of understand and and also conversely, working at the bottom of **Test Kitchen**, when I first started working there, we were doing a lot more chef driven recipes. And when you work in a professional kitchen, you're making sauce. You're making 16 quarts of sauce, you're not making two cups of sauce. So the sort of reverse engineering that understanding that it's the same thing. The ingredients ebb and flow even if you're decreasing. So it's just kind of having that knowledge ahead of time. But I think that's how those people find themselves as a co-packer. And as we look into other products to make, it's like, okay, well, these guys specialize in baked goods. These guys specialize in granola. These guys, you know, and they're that's what they do. So they they know.

</details>

### 供应链与成本考量

**Tracy Alloway**: 你是如何寻找供应商的？因为，我想你和你的杂货店可能与农民有些联系。但如果你要大规模生产，或者比以前更大的规模，你如何才能找到能稳定供应番茄或稳定供应青葱和凤尾鱼的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How did you go about finding suppliers because, you know, I imagine you have some connection with your grocery store to, you know, farmers maybe. But if you're doing it at scale or a larger scale than previously, how do you actually find someone who's going to provide you with a steady supply of tomatoes or a steady supply of shallots and anchovies, I guess?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，我们用的是罐装番茄。夏天我们会做限量版的产品，比如，你知道，碰伤的番茄、**SunGold**番茄，更多当季的新鲜食材。但因为番茄的季节性很强，而且我也相信最好的番茄酱确实来自罐装番茄，所以这部分不是问题。但实际上是，我曾与一位名叫**Isabel**的女士合作，她在**CPG**方面有更多经验，我们和我的幕僚长**Nani**一起摸索出了办法。我们三个人一起看数据，讨论谁在哪里，运输成本是多少，他们用什么番茄，他们能拿到什么番茄，他们的产能如何，我们能多快地在这里发展。所有这些因素都考虑在内，因为说实话，在这种规模下你使用的青葱类型并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, we use canned tomatoes. In the summer we will do limited edition, quantities of things like, you know, bruised tomatoes, SunGold tomatoes, like more in-season fresh stuff. But because tomatoes are so seasonal and I also believe the best tomato sauce does come from canned tomatoes, that is part isn't an issue, but it really is. I had, worked with this woman, **Isabel**, who had more experience in CPG, and we sort of figured it out together with, my chief of staff, **Nani**. And it was kind of the three of us looking at numbers and saying, like, who's located where? What is the shipping going to cost? What tomatoes are they using, what tomatoes can they get? What is their capacity like? How how quickly can we grow here? And so all of those things come into factor because honestly, the type of shallots you're using at that scale doesn't really matter.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我认为我的梦想一直是使用最高品质的食材。我喜欢用那些没人要的、又老又丑的青葱和坏掉的番茄，然后用这些废弃的食材做出美味的东西。这是我的愿望。这种商业模式会走向一条非常昂贵的道路，我认为它可以在大规模生产中实现，但我们还没有达到那个阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think it would be my dream to always use the highest quality ingredients. I'd love to use like old ugly shallots that nobody wants and the bad tomatoes and like make something beautiful from waste. And and that's my aspiration. And and that business model let down a very, very expensive path and I think is achievable at massive scale. But we're just not there yet.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 等等，多说一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wait. Say more about that.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 基本上，这就是消费品（**CPG**）行业普遍存在的问题。如果你想开一家小型的夫妻店，产品是本地采购、制作精美、员工工资优厚，那么一罐番茄酱可能要卖到38美元。这样一来，愿意为此买单的市场就会非常有限。你知道，我逛当地的杂货店时，做的第一件事就是去番茄酱货架。我就是想知道那里有什么。但你会看到**Rao’s**和**Carbone**摆在同一视线水平，后面还有额外的商品陈列。它们都以8.99美元的价格出售，而且是32盎司一罐。我们的罐子是16盎司，零售价是12.99美元或12美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Basically, that is sort of the the issue with CPG in general. And if you want to make a small mom and pop, like locally sourced like beautifully made, responsibly pay your workers excellent wages and it's going to be like a $38 jar of tomato sauce. And it's going to be a very limited market of people that are willing to pay for that. And, you know, I look at my local grocery store and I the first thing I do is I go to the tomato sauce aisle. I'm just like, got to know what's going on over there. But you see **Rao’s** and **Carbone** on the same eye level and additional, merchandizing behind you. And they are both on sale for $8.99, and that's a 32 ounce jar. Our jars are 16oz and, you know, $12.99 or $12 retail.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Joe**，我要暴露我“千禧一代”的身份了，但我想到《老友记》里**Monica**开始做果酱并出售，然后她意识到，为了收支平衡，每罐果酱必须卖17美元，那在当时是很多钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Joe, I'm going to betray my elder millennial status, but I'm thinking of that friends episode where **Monica** starts making jam and selling it, and then she realizes that, like, in order to break even, it has to be $17 per jar, which was a lot back then.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，那是很多钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: There was a lot.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 还有谁做果酱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Of people who else made jam?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: And me, I don't know.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。告诉我们你的果酱故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Tell us about your jam.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 呃，那是一百万年前的事了，我刚搬到纽约的时候，当时我在**Milk Bar**工作，用他们的中央厨房决定我要做果酱，然后在威廉斯堡的**Smorgasburg**出售。是的，当它刚推出时，我说：“哦，太棒了！”你知道，手写每个标签，买漂亮的罐子，每个要4美元，经济效益非常差，但我不在乎。我还是想做。只要我们能赚更多的钱买更多的罐子，然后做更多的果酱，显然那是不可能持续的。它没有持续很长时间，可能一年半。但概念是一样的，为了真正完成这件事并真正盈利，你会想：“好吧，这就是为什么人们会立即寻求投资，并说我们需要按计划启动，让我们进行商业规模化。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I mean, that was a million years ago when I first moved to New York, and I was working at **Milk Bar** at the time and used their commissary kitchen to sort of decide I was going to make jam and sell it at the **Williamsburg Smorgasburg**. And yeah, when it first launched and say, oh yeah, baby. And, you know, handwriting each label like getting beautiful jars, which cost $4 a piece, like the economics were so poor I didn't care. I wanted to do it anyway. And as long as we could make more money to buy more jars and then make more jam, obviously that was not sustainable. It didn't last for very long, maybe a year and a half. But same concept where, okay, in order to get this actually done and to actually turn a profit, you're like, okay, well that's why people go for the jugular immediately and seek out, you know, investment and say, we need to be on target to launch. Let's do a business scale.

</details>

### 融资与品牌策略

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。我读过我最喜欢的一本书是**Nike**创始人**Phil Knight**的自传，**《鞋狗》**（Shoe Dog）。他谈了很多关于他们从小做运动鞋开始，然后有一个飞跃，他有机会做大，但银行不太愿意给他贷款，因为看起来风险很大。这不是一个风险投资式的业务，但他显然需要资金才能将其提升到下一个水平，比如更大的工厂等等。请给我们讲讲财务规模化以及其中涉及的风险，比如有一天你不想只在厨房里有两个人，而是想有20人或200人。那需要大量的预付成本和新的仓库。也许可以告诉我们你是如何考虑这个问题的，或者你在选择方面看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. One of my favorite books I've read, is by is the autobiography of the **Nike** founder, **Phil Knight**. **Shoe Dog** shoe dog. And he talks a lot about, you know, they started small with sneakers. And then there was, you know, this sort of jump where it's like he had the opportunity to get a lot bigger banks didn't really want to give him loans because it seemed dicey. It wasn't like a VC style business, but he clearly needed capital to sort of take it to the next level, like bigger factories, etc.. Talk to us a little bit about like financial scaling and the risks that involved with like, okay, one day you don't want it to just be two people in a kitchen. You had to be 20 people or 200 people in the kitchen. Well, that requires a lot of upfront costs and new warehouses. Maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about that or what you've seen on the landscape in terms of your options.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，我的意思是，媒体对品牌的报道似乎总是这样：这个品牌一上市就获得了300万美元，那个品牌有六个月的资金。但这并不意味着品牌就能成功。这并不意味着那个品牌会陷入困境，因为它必须偿还这些钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, I mean, it seems like the what you're fed in terms of like the media coverage of brands and you're like, oh, this brand has $3 million out the gate and this brand has six months. And that doesn't mean that brands can succeed. That doesn't mean that that brand is.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 在创始人拿到一分钱之前，就要支付多倍的利息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Going in the hole because they have to pay that back. Yes. Multiple interest before the founder sees a penny of.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 没错。这也意味着有很大的压力要增加库存单位（**SKU**）和营销，对我来说，这是一个非常令人不知所措的局面，它并非植根于真实性或产品本身的优良。对我来说，这永远是我做的最重要的事情。我也想聪明地做，确保它不会变成一场疯狂的金融风暴。但我认为现在，就在今天，在这之后，我将去参加几个会议，我正处于摸索的阶段，试图找出那个问题的答案：我该雇佣谁？如何雇佣他们？在哪个层面？谁能真正帮助我？基本上，我的愿望是雇佣一两个人，三个人，他们非常擅长自己的工作。我不是一个商人。我是一个番茄酱人。我制作番茄酱，而且我制作的番茄酱非常好。我不知道如何做其他事情。我所知道的是，我不想以如此快的速度扩大规模，以至于牺牲了质量或完整性，或者让我不得不比我想要的更快地发展业务。你知道，我认为这很有趣，因为很多时候人们创业，尤其是在食品**CPG**领域，他们首先想到的不是产品本身，而是如何销售它？我的退出策略是什么？好吧，六年内，我们可以，你知道，这就像制作一个人们真正喜欢的好产品，这到底怎么了？我认为我有幸拥有42份其他工作。所以，你知道，我是一名作家，我制作视频，我写食谱书，我认为知道这并不是我的主要赌注，但我确实认为在产品开发中失去了一种可信度，我认为人们将开始渴望这种可信度。我认为他们会说，为什么我要买这个人的番茄？我会说，因为我到处都能看到它，或者这个，因为我信任它，它来自一个好的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Exactly. And it also means that there's a lot of pressure to increase SKUs and marketing and it's a, to me, a very overwhelming landscape that is not rooted in authenticity or something being good. And that, to me is always going to be the most important thing that I do. I also want to do it intelligently and make sure that it's not like a financial crazy firestorm. But I think that right now, literally today, after this, I'm going to a few meetings, but I am right in the thick of it, of figuring out that the answer to that question of like, who do I hire? How do I hire them? At what level? Who is going to actually help me? Who basically my desire is to hire somebody, two people, three people who are excellent at what they do. I am not a business person. I am a tomato sauce person. I make tomato sauce and I make really good tomato sauce. I don't know how to do these other things. And what I do know is that I'm not trying to scale up at such an intense rate that it sacrifices the quality or the integrity, or puts me in a position to grow the business faster than I want to. And, you know, I think it's interesting because a lot of times people start businesses, especially in the food CPG world, where the immediate thought is before they've even made the product. How do I sell it? Like how do I what's my exit? Okay. In six years, we could, you know, it's like what happened to just making a great product that people are really into. And I think I have the luxury of having 42 other jobs. And so, you know, I'm a writer, I do video, I make cookbooks, and I think that knowing that this isn't my primary, you know, the one thing that I'm betting on, but I do think that there's a sort of credibility that's been lost in developing products and I think that people are going to start to want that. And I think that they're going to be like, well, why would I buy this person's tomatoes? I was like, because I'm seeing it everywhere, or this one because I trust it, that it comes from a good place.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你会和什么样的贷款人或投资者谈论这类事情？是风险投资吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What kind of. Lenders or investors do you actually talk to for this sort of thing? Is it like VC?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我还没有，但理论上会是这样。我认为就我个人而言，我所有项目都是自筹资金的，而且我已经把它做到了极致，我没有亏太多钱，而且到今年年底我可能会收支平衡，这很棒。更重要的是，如果我要寻求资金，我想向那些理解我、不期望我成为别人、不期望我的商业模式效仿他们认为成功的其他模式的人寻求资金。我今天这么说。明年你再问我，我可能就会处于不同的境地了，但我认为这有点像“亲朋好友”式的融资，或者是一个主要投资者，他理解我，理解目标，并且说：“我想成为主导者，我想成为主要投资者。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I don't yet, but that would ostensibly be it. I think that for me personally, I've self-funded every project I've ever done and I've kind of taken this to its maximum, in that I'm not that in the red and it will I will be whole probably by the end of the year, which is great. It's more that I want to be sure if I'm going to ask for money. It's I want to ask for money from people that understand me and are not expecting me to be someone else, or model my business off after those other ones that they see as being successful. And I say that today. Ask me next year and I might be in a different position, but I think it's sort of, you know, a friends and family around style. Or one main investor who sort of sees me, sees the goal and is like, I want to be the lead and I want to be sort of the primary.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你在与投资者见面时，需要带上实际的酱料罐吗？我知道你还没做过，但我很好奇，如果你是一家食品公司，这是必需的吗？还是人们只看数字、品牌和分销网络？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Do you have to bring like actual jars of the sauce when you meet with investors? I know you haven't done it yet, but I'm really curious if you have a food company, is that a requirement or are people just looking at the numbers and the branding and the distribution network?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我认为这可能会有帮助。我认为如果你是一个不太知名的人，那可能就是必须的。我的意思是，我希望你知道我卖的是什么，以及你为什么要投资它。这就像《创智赢家》（Shark Tank）。是的。但对我来说，我很幸运，已经有人主动找上我，他们说：“我喜欢你做的事情。我喜欢你做的一切。你做的一切都很成功。”而且，我没有理由相信这会有什么不同，尽管我知道，考虑到市场的饱和度和拥挤程度，这有点像：“哦，你为什么要进入这个实际上最拥挤的市场？”但再说一次，我认为我的贡献是独一无二的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think it could hurt. I think that if you are a lesser known quantity, that's probably a must. I would I mean, I'd want you to know what I'm selling you and why you should invest in it. It's giving **Shark Tank**. Yeah. But I think for me, I've been very fortunate that I've already sort of been approached by people that are like, I like what you do. I like everything that you do. Everything you do works. And like, I have no reason to believe this would be any different, even though I do know, given the saturation of the market and how crowded it is, it is sort of, oh. Why would you enter into what was effectively the most crowded, you know, market? But again, I see my contribution as being unique.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这可能是一个比较敏感的问题。我认为你在某些人中拥有“邪教般的地位”。我们似乎正处在一个拥有某种“邪教般地位”的人，他们的粉丝真的非常喜欢你，他们渴望有机会与你做生意。是的，**Taylor Swift**的粉丝希望她为每张专辑制作五种不同颜色的黑胶版本，因为他们对此非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: This might be sort of a sensitive question. You know, there is a I think you have cult status within, certain among some people. We seem to be in an age where people with a certain level of cult status, they have these fans who like, really just like they want to buy something from you. They're excited to give that the opportunity to do business with you. Yes, **Taylor Swift's** fans want her to make five different color vinyl versions of each album because they're really excited about.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 他们会买每一张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: And they'll buy each one.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，**Donald Trump**的粉丝真的希望他能推出一个伏特加品牌之类的，因为他们对此很兴奋。购买**Trump**伏特加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, and **Donald Trump's** fans really, like, want him to like, you know, make a vodka brand and whatever because they're excited about that. Buying **Trump** vodka I know.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你觉得呢？你觉得你有一个基础，他们对支持你、成为你不断壮大的世界的一部分感到热情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Do you feel that like do you feel that you have like a base that is enthusiastic about the prospect of essentially supporting you and like being part of your, you know, growing your world?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。我认为我很幸运能在这个行业工作这么长时间。我认为随之而来的是声誉和信任。你无法购买这种信任，也无法在短时间内强迫它发生。我认为这是一种熟悉感。但最重要的是，人们会说：“我知道这有效，或者我知道她推荐的东西是好的。”所以，如果我要为某个产品背书，并投入自己的资金来创办一家这样的公司，这并不是为了赚钱，你知道，这不是我最赚钱的事情。它现在肯定是一个亏损的先行产品。但我认为这是一种希望。我想人们会认为，如果她要这样做，我知道它会是好的。我从销售人员那里得到了很多反馈，他们说：“我这辈子从没买过酱料，但我很好奇。”或者这些人就像十年前的我一样，从**《Dining In》**、从**《Nothing Fancy》**做饭。嗯，八年前。但你知道，他们曾想：“我永远不会买番茄酱，因为我自己做。”而现在他们的生活改变了，他们的看法也不同了。他们会说：“你知道吗？我可能会买一罐番茄酱。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. I think that I am very fortunate to have been in this industry for as long as I have. And I think that with that comes a reputation and trust. And you cannot buy that trust and you cannot force it to happen over a short period of time. And I think that it is familiarity. But above all, people are like, I know this works, or I know when she recommends something, it is good. And so it stands to reason if I'm going to make if I'm going to put my name behind something and like put my own money behind, starting a company like this isn't a money grab, you know, it's not the most lucrative thing I do. It's a definite loss leader. But it's sort of for now anyway. But I think that there is a hopeful. I would imagine people would think if she's going to do this, I know it's going to be good. And I get a lot of feedback on the sales people saying, I've never bought sauce in my life, but I am curious. Or it's people that were like me ten years ago cooking from dining in, cooking from, you know, **Nothing Fancy**. Well, eight years ago. But you know, and thought to themselves, well, I'll never make to I'll never buy tomato sauce because I make my own. And now their lives have changed and their perspectives are different. And they're like, you know what? I might buy a tomato sauce.

### 分销策略与“先有鸡还是先有蛋”的困境

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你是如何考虑分销的？因为正如**Joe**在开场白中提到的，我们从与不同食品、饮料和零食公司的对话中学到的一点是，你的生存取决于你获得的货架空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How are you thinking about distribution? Because as Joe mentioned in the intro, one thing we've learned from conversations with different food and drinks and snack companies is like, you kind of live and die by the shelf space that you get.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 哦，是的，也许还有我的视线水平。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Oh yeah, and my level maybe. Okay.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么，哪个是先来的呢？是分销协议，还是实际的运营规模化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And then also like, which comes first, is it a distribution agreement or the actual scaling of the operation?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 这正是我现在所处的状态。我正处于这些对话的白热化阶段，试图弄清楚这个问题，因为我是否应该寻找一个新的代工厂，能够满足可能进入**Whole Foods**的需求？那么，如果没有**Whole Foods**的合同，我就会积压价值数十万美元的产品。那么这些产品该怎么办呢？我还要为这些产品支付仓储费。所以，如何在没有达成协议的情况下销售这些产品呢？我想**Whole Foods**也不会给你合同，除非他们确定你能生产出来。我猜他们需要一些概念验证。但现在，我正处于“先有鸡还是先有蛋”的困境，我有点像：“好吧，什么必须先发生？”是那个能帮我建立与**Whole Foods**关系的人吗？还是那个我知道能达到我想要水平的代工厂？你知道，这些问题正在被迅速提出和回答。你知道，下周，如果我们下周开这个会，我可能会给你一个更好的答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: This is exactly where I'm at right now. I'm like in the thick of these conversations of trying to figure that out, because do I find a new co-packer that can meet the needs of potentially being and **Whole Foods**? Well, then, without a **Whole Foods** contract, I'm sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars of product. And where does that product go then? I'm paying for storage for that product. So how do you move that without having that deal in place? You also, I would imagine **Whole Foods** is not going to give you something unless they know for certain that you can produce it. And I'm assuming they want some proof of concept. But right now I'm, I'm it's very chicken or the egg and I'm sort of like, okay, what has to happen first? Is it the the person who's going to get me that relationship with **Whole Foods**? Is it the co-packer that I know can fulfill and execute at the level that I want? And, you know, these questions are being asked and answered very quickly. And, you know, next, if we had done this meeting next week, I probably would have a better answer for you to come back into it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我想我们只是快速跟进一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I guess. We just do a quick follow.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 呃，这太有趣了。我敢肯定，任何了解**CPG**的人听了都会觉得：“这个女人什么都不知道。”但我相信那是我的魅力之一，我做任何事情都充满好奇和兴奋。我实际上认为，不了解情况有很多好处，因为我认为，纠结于事情是如何完成的以及什么是常态，会限制你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Well, it's so funny. I'm sure anyone listening to this that does know a lot about CPGs is like, this woman has no idea, but I believe that's part of my charm and I kind of jump into everything that I do like really curious and excited. And I actually think that there's a lot of benefit to not knowing, because I think getting hung up on how things are done and what is the norm kind of limits you.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你现在是不是被那些食品行业高管包围着，他们承诺能把你的生意带到下一个层次？也许他们曾在**Whole Foods**工作过，然后说：“雇我吧，我们可以。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Are. You just like surrounded right now by like food industry execs that are promising they can take your business to the next level. Maybe they did a stint at **Whole Foods** or something like that and like, hire me. We can.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 还有一些。还有一些。是的，现在收件箱非常忙。我要说，主要是女性，这非常令人鼓舞。是的，我认为总有人会说：“我能帮你。”然后有些人会说：“我想要参与其中。”有些人会说：“我想帮你找到钱，这样我将来也能参与其中。”我认为这些公司变得非常热门，然后经常会停滞不前或崩溃，或者人们不再关心。蛋白质不再是热门话题。没人想喝这种东西。但对我来说，我是一个非常注重“传承品牌”的人，我坚信制作精良、经久不衰、永不过时的产品。对我来说，这就是。我宁愿长期成功，也不愿昙花一现，或者现在很火，然后明年就没人关心了，那我就完蛋了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: There's a few more. There's a few. There's yes, the inbox is very busy right now. And I will say primarily women, which is really encouraging. And yeah, I think there's always somebody that's like, I can help you. And then some people that are like, I want skin in the game. Some people are like, I want to help you find the money so that I can have skin in the game in the future. And I think that these companies become so hot and then often plateau or crash or people don't care anymore. Protein's no longer a thing. Nobody wants to drink this type of thing. But to me, I am such a legacy brand person and I believe so firmly in well-made products that are built to last that never go out of style. And to me, this is that. And I'd rather be successful over a really long term than like a flash in the pan or like hot right now. And then note next year nobody cares and then I'm f******.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。番茄酱绝对是“林迪效应”的，我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. Tomato sauce is definitely windy, I think.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。你知道，我“林迪”，我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. Do you know, I Lindy, I don't know.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，我听过不止四次。不，但这有点像一个非玩笑。是的。它只是意味着它已经持续了很长时间。因此可以推断它还会持续很长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, I've heard it not four times. No, but I, it's sort of a non joke. Yeah. It just means it means it's lasted a long time. And therefore one can infer that it will last a long time.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 好的。我喜欢这个词。我会在我的补丁中使用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Okay. I love it. I'm going to adopt that word and my patches.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这是一个好词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It's it's a good word to use.

### 创业中最具挑战的方面

**Joe Weisenthal**: 建立这项业务最具挑战性的是什么？因为，你知道，你同时谈论了很多不同的事情。有融资，有分销，有物流，有实际生产产品，品牌建设，所有这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What's been the most challenging aspect of building this business? Because, you know, you're talking about a bunch of different things all at once. There's the financing, there's distribution, there's logistics, there's actually making the product, branding, all of that.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我会说，我先做了所有最容易的事情，比如开发食谱，设计标签，那些我自认为有资格参与和执行的创意有趣的事情。现在我们到了最难的部分，就是：“好吧，我们已经做出了酱料，也卖出去了。人们喜欢它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I will say I sort of did everything that was easiest first, which was developing the recipe, figuring out the label, like the creative, fun stuff that I feel qualified to to weigh in on an execute. And now we're at the hard part where it's like, okay, we've made the sauce, we've sold it. People love it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，对很多人来说，那感觉就是最难的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay, that feels like the hard part for a lot of people.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 对我来说，那是容易的部分。现在，你知道，我前几天对一个人说，我真正渴望的是一个“房间里的成年人”，我需要一个这个项目的负责人，你明白我的意思吗？我就是这样，我有酱料。它看起来很棒。它尝起来很棒。人们想要它。我该怎么办？现在怎么办？我需要一个知道自己在做什么的人走进房间，说：“这是操作顺序，这是要花多少钱，这是谁来做。”当你开始这样的生意时，没有人会告诉你。所以你确实会觉得有点脆弱，面对那些说“我能帮你”的人。是的。所以这变成了一种性格审查，以及我们和谁合得来？你认为谁理解你，而不是只看到钱？这再次建立在信任之上，谁会真正和你一起，为你这个企业主和产品提供最好的建议，而不是把你当作一个能赚钱的传声筒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: For me, that was the easy part. And now, you know, I was saying to someone the other day, like, what I'm really craving as an adult in the room, and I need a boss in this venture, you know what I mean? Like, I I'm so okay, I have the sauce. It's it looks great. It tastes great. People want it. How do what? What now? And I need somebody who knows what they're doing to come into the room and say, here are the here's the order of operations, here's how much that's going to cost. Here's who's going to do that. Like when you're starting a business like this, there's nobody to tell you. And so you do sort of feel a little vulnerable to people that are like, I can help you. Yeah. And so it becomes sort of this personality vetting and, and who's who do we vibe with? Who do you think understands you that it doesn't just see dollar signs and it's again built on trust and like who's going to like really be in this with you to best advise what's best for you, the business owner and also the product, and not just sort of treat you like a mouthpiece for a thing that can make the money.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你提到你有这种奢侈，你没有把生命赌在这个品牌上。你拥有你蓬勃发展的媒体帝国等等。所以你能够自筹资金等等。我想到，你知道，新闻业正处于一个非常困难的时期，但回想十年前，所有这些消费品牌都试图建立媒体部门，他们会说：“哦，我们要雇佣**吉列**（Gillette）的主编，因为我们想建立一系列博客，它们隐含地是关于剃须刀的。”所以人们迫不及待地想读。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You know, you mentioned like you have the luxury of you're not betting your life on this brand. You have you have your thriving media empire, etc.. And so you're in the position to self-fund and so forth. It occurs to me like, you know, again, journalism is in such a difficult time, but like, you know, thinking back ten years ago, like all these consumer brands trying to build out a media side, we're like, oh, we're going to hire the editor in chief of **Gillette**, you know, because we want to like, build a whole series of blogs that are implicitly about razors. And so people can't wait to read.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这就像，对，因为他们认为这将是最好的营销，我们只需购买媒体品牌。所以，你已经隐含地解决了这部分问题，这一定很棒。从这个每个人都喜欢，很多人都喜欢的媒体开始，然后在此基础上增加各种产品，这似乎容易得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This is like, right, because they think this is going to be the best marketing is we'll just buy the media branded. So it must be really nice to not like you already have that part solved implicitly. It seems so much easier to start with this media thing that everybody loves, but a lot of people love and then like add on to these, yeah, various products that can be sold on top of that.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。我当然不会称自己为名人，但我认为这就是名人品牌的吸引力，以及为什么它对人们如此有吸引力，当他们看到流行歌星推出化妆品品牌，演员推出内衣品牌时。这是一种内在的兴奋感，一种内在的购买欲，你知道吗？所以我想对我来说，我再次非常认真地对待这份责任。但很高兴知道，除了招聘之外，大部分资金似乎都用于营销。因为如果你只是一个默默无闻的人，没有任何食品背景，但你说：“我要开一家——这里填空——食品公司。”那么，如果你来自科技界，如果你来自商界，你在很多方面都比我领先一步。但我也在很多方面领先你一步。但不幸的是，金钱至上。所以我觉得如果没有那个作为我的后备力量，我总是处于劣势，因为很多品牌都是从一个穿着马甲的男人开始的，你知道，我没有那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. And I would obviously never call myself a celebrity, but I think that's the appeal of the celebrity brand and why that is so appealing to people when they're like, you know, a pop star that launches a makeup brand and an actor who launches lingerie. It's like it's a built in excitement. It's built in by it, you know? And so I think for me, again, I take that very seriously, that responsibility very seriously. But I it is great to know that most of it seems like what the money goes towards, in addition to hiring is marketing. Because if you're just like a person that's like, no one knows who you are, you don't have any food background, but you're like, I'm going to start a insert blank here. You know, company that is food. Well, yeah. If you come from the tech world, if you come from the business world, you're already a leg up on me in a lot of ways. But I'm a leg up on you in a lot of ways. But one money unfortunately, trumps all. So I feel like always sort of at a disadvantage without that as my thing in the back pocket, because a lot of brands that begin, they begin from a guy in a vest and you know, and I don't have that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你有没有见过那些表情包或笑话，比如有些模仿，一个在**麦肯锡**（McKinsey）工作的家伙，然后他意识到他必须辞职，把一生奉献给制作终极玉米饼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Have you seen like I think there are some memes about it where or like jokes where it's like some parody. Some guys, you know, working at **McKinsey**. And I realized I had to quit my job and dedicate my life to making the ultimate tortilla.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。标签上有很多这样的故事，比如：“我们曾在纽约市朝九晚五地工作，然后我们想，为什么我们不能做一些干番茄呢？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. There's like all these tracks, like, you see these on the label is like, we were working 9 to 5 jobs in New York City, and then we're like, why can't we just make some dried tomatoes?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Exactly.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 比如，为什么没有适合我的奶油芝士？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Like, why isn't there a cream cheese for me?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。你就像，是的。我的意思是，如果你有一个梦想，你知道，我认为当你有一份能赚很多钱的工作，然后你觉得：“等等，这很空虚。”然后你实际上只想做格兰诺拉麦片，这非常鼓舞人心。当然，这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. You're like, yeah. I mean, if you have a dream, you know, and I think that that is very inspiring when you can have a job that makes you so much money and then you're like, wait, this is soulless. And actually I just want to, like, make granola. Sure. That's great.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我认为对我来说，我一直都是反过来的，我把我的生命献给了烹饪和食物，以及整个行为，而且我知道这些事情，比如没有人是为了赚钱才进入餐饮业的。我19岁时开始在餐馆工作，每小时赚7.5美元，我从来没有想过如何赚更多的钱。我只是觉得：“哇，这太棒了。我太开心了。我喜欢烹饪。”所以最终走到这一步，我能投入少量资金，但我们已经走到了这条路的尽头，我愿意投入的资金已经用完了，这对我来说风险很低。我当时想：“我相信这个产品，我知道它会卖出去。”我做到了，而且很棒。所以现在是时候考虑下一步了。你如何看待一个中产阶级的小企业？因为它看起来，感觉只有两种极端：要么是农贸市场的小夫妻店，除了当地人没人知道；要么是500万美元在**Target**首次亮相。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I, I think that for me, I've always sort of been the inverse where I've dedicated my life to cooking and food and like the whole act of it and knowing that those thing like no one gets into the restaurant business to make money. I started working in restaurants when I was 19, making 750 an hour, and I never once thought, how will I make more money? I just thought, wow, this is great. I'm so happy. I love cooking, and so to end up here and be like, okay, I can like put a small amount towards this, but we've sort of reached the end of that road, of the money that I was willing to bet on it, and it was sort of like I thought pretty low stakes. I was like, I believe in the product, I know it's going to sell. And I did, and it was great. And so now it's time to consider what's next. And how do you consider what is a middle class small business? Because it stands, it feels like it's only extreme farmer's market mom and pop, but nobody knows who you are except if you live in the town or $5 million debut at **Target**.

### 美食媒体的演变与未来

**Tracy Alloway**: 我有一个有点随意的问题，但既然我们谈到了美食媒体，我想这在播客中以前也出现过。但很久很久以前，为什么我必须阅读3000字的人们的生活故事，或者解释洋葱是什么，才能在网上找到食谱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I have a slightly random question, but since we were talking food media, I think this is actually come up on the podcast before. But like a long, long time ago, why do I have to read 3000 words of people's life story or like explaining what an onion is? Before I get to the recipe online?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 嗯，最初那些抱怨的来源，我认为是博客文化，它早于像**《纽约时报》烹饪**（New York Times Cooking）之类的食谱数据库。因为基本上，为了让那些博主获得广告收入，人们必须滚动一定的量。他们不能只是进入页面然后点击，因为他们看不到广告，所以广告收入无法支持他们。我认为那是90年代的某种原因。对我这个写这些东西的人来说，那是因为我认为人们关心，或者它能让你成为一个更好的厨师，它为食谱的故事提供了背景和丰富性。话虽如此，我经常把文字和食谱分开，所以我写作的方式通常是，比如我的时事通讯，有很多很多关于某件事的文字。它可能是一件毛衣，或者我的孩子，或者番茄酱，然后你跳到食谱，食谱可能只有六句话，解释你为什么需要做我让你做的事情，这样你就不会跳过它而搞砸食谱，然后是食谱本身，但你总是可以跳过去。所以话虽如此，我总是对这种抱怨感到非常防御，因为我是一个作家，写作是我工作的一部分。而且我也认为这是我成功的重要原因，因为人们在情感上投入到我让你做的事情中，而且我也在向你推销一些东西。我就是这样，好吧，你可能不想做扁豆汤，但我会写一些非常引人入胜的东西，让你觉得：“天哪，我必须做这个扁豆汤。”这是我工作的一部分。所以我确实尊重这一点。有趣的是，这也是我写实际食谱书时最喜欢做的事情之一，因为你受限于页面，而不是互联网。你可以在互联网上写一辈子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Well, originally the reason that I think that where those complaints originated from are is blog culture, which predates sort of recipe database like **New York Times**, cooking, etc. because basically, in order for those bloggers to get ad revenue, the person had to scroll a certain amount. They couldn't just go to the page and click because they wouldn't see the ad, so the ad revenue couldn't support them. That is, I think like 90s sort of reasoning for me as a person who writes those things, it's because I think people care or it makes you a better cook and I and it provides context and riches to the story of the recipe. That also said, I often separate the text from the recipe, so I write in such a way that often like for my newsletter, for example, there's many, many words about something. It could be a sweater or my baby, or a tomato sauce, and then you jump to the recipe, which has like maybe six sentences about like, why you need to do what I'm asking you to do so you don't skip it and mess up the recipe and then the recipe, but you can always jump to it. So that also said, I always felt very defensive of that complaint because I'm a writer and I part of what I do is writing. And I also think that's a huge part of my success because people are, like, emotionally invested in what I'm asking you to do and also selling you something. I'm like, okay, you might not want to make lentil soup, but I'm going to write something that is so compelling that you're going to be like, oh my God, I have to make this lentil soup and that as part of my job. And so I do respect that, though. And interestingly enough, it's one of my favorite things to do when I'm writing actual cookbooks, because you're limited to the page versus the internet. You could write forever.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 大多数人没有好的编辑，或者根本没有编辑。我不知道有没有编辑，我在杂志工作时学到的一件事是，你必须问自己：“谁会在乎？”所以如果我发现自己滔滔不绝地讲某件事，我就会想到那个人会想：“我为什么要关心这个？”我必须为它辩护。而且我经常会删掉很多东西，或者我会觉得：“那很无聊或很蠢，或者只有我觉得那很有趣，或者那太小众了，或者它不需要在这里。”我非常清楚，如果东西太长，人们就会眼神呆滞。他们不在乎。他们会失去兴趣。所以你真的要为每一个字而战。这在食谱书中尤其如此，因为你必须把它控制在一定的长度，否则它就无法印刷。你知道，对我来说，这其中有很多考量。我认为每个写食谱或美食界其他东西的人都会有不同的答案。这就是我的答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Most people don't have good editors or editors at all. I don't know an editor, and one thing that I learned while working in magazines is you have to ask yourself, who cares? And so if I find myself blabbing on about something, I think about that person being like, why do I care about this? And I have to justify it. And oftentimes I edit stuff out all the time, or I'm like, that's boring or stupid, or only I think that's funny or that's too niche or it doesn't need to be here. I'm very cognizant of the fact that if something is too long, people's eyes glaze over. They don't care. They are going to lose interest. So you really fight for every word. That's especially true in a cookbook because you have to keep it to a certain length, otherwise it doesn't get printed. And, you know, there's a lot that goes into that for me anyway. And I think each person that writes recipes or whatever in the food world will have a different answer. That's mine.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Joe**，科技实际上已经为我解决了这个问题，因为有一个非常棒的应用程序叫做**Paprika**。你只需粘贴食谱的URL。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Joe. Technology has actually solved this problem for me because there's there's a really great app called **Paprika**. And you just like paste in the URL of a recipe, people's.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我知道，我知道。你知道，那就像是实用型用户，我宁愿你那样做，也不愿你直接用人工智能来生成食谱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I know people, I know that. You know, that that is like the utility user and like that. I'd rather you do that than like just go on AI to like be like, right, right. What you know, recipe with that?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，我甚至没想过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, I. Didn't even think about.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 真的吗？你多久做一次饭？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Really. How often do you cook?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我周末一直在做饭。我在纽约不做饭，因为我的纽约厨房很小。我在康涅狄格州有一个大厨房，在那里我可以做任何我梦想的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I cook like, all the time on the weekends. And I don't cook in New York because I have a tiny New York kitchen. I have a big kitchen in Connecticut where I can do, like, whatever I dream.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。你有没有发现自己会为了乐趣而阅读食谱书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Do you find yourself reading cookbooks for pleasure ever?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，有时我会。我收藏了很多。我刚订了一本。那本美食书叫什么来着？好像是《如何吃狼》（How to Eat a Wolf）之类的。你听说过吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, sometimes I have an expansive collection. And I just ordered. What's that food book? It's like, **How to Eat a Wolf** or something. Have you ever heard of that?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 显然它是在二战时期写的，内容都是关于，我想是关于在物资匮乏时如何节俭饮食的。所以我很期待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Apparently it was written in World War two, and it's all about, like, I guess, how to eat frugally when there's, like, not so much. So when I'm looking forward to the. Rations.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **MFK Fisher**的**《如何烹饪狼》**（How to Cook a Wolf）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: **How to cook a wolf** by **MFK**. How to cook.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yes.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 当然。抱歉，我以为是更现代的。好的，所以我确实读一些美食方面的书，但当我实际做饭时，滚动屏幕真的很难，因为你的手会沾满面粉或酱料之类的东西，我只是觉得这很分散注意力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Of course. Sorry, I thought it was more contemporary. Okay, so like I do, I do read some food stuff, but it's when I'm actually cooking, having to scroll is really difficult because like your hands are covered in like flour or sauce or whatever, and I just find it distracting.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你会很高兴知道，我的网站开头有一个标签写着“跳到食谱”，你随时可以点击它，跳过所有文字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You'll be pleased to know that on my website, there's a tab at the beginning that says jump to recipe, and you can always just click on it and skip all the text.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我应该说，顺便提一下，我有你的书。那本花哨的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I should have said, I have your book, by the way. The fancy one.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: **《Nothing Fancy》**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: **Nothing fancy**. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈到人工智能和烹饪等等，你知道，所有媒体都是假的。也许甚至是你，但所有媒体都非常担心人工智能的存在，原因有很多，人们也在思考如何应对。比如传统的美食媒体。显然你有一个名字问题。人们真的很喜欢读你的东西。你对当今更广阔的格局有何看法？或者更广阔的格局中有什么有趣的地方？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Speaking of AI and cooking etc. you know, like all media is fake. I'm perhaps even you, but like all media, is very anxious about the presence of AI for various reasons and people were and how they're going to navigate it. Like traditional food media. Like obviously you have an issue of a name. People really like reading your stuff. Like, how are you feeling about the what's the broader landscape look like these days, or what's interesting in the broader landscape?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我认为更广阔的格局是，我们正在电视和新闻中注意到，我们的文化，无论是在时尚、美食、文化评论还是政治领域，我们都在回归我们曾经逃离的东西。所以就像流媒体平台正在捆绑，你可以观看所有这些。哦，等等，那是有限电视，对吧？然后，现在时事通讯的人们正在招聘员工，学习如何捆绑他们的情况，并说：“好吧，我曾经偏离了，现在我们正在建立一个合作社。”我心想：“好吧，那不就是杂志吗？”所以这对我来说非常引人入胜。我认为我们这些足够年长，经历过媒体的各种周期的人都看到了，一切都在回归自身。而且，你知道，我敢肯定他们会再次解散，然后会变得更注重个人。而现在，你知道，又回到了杂志。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think the broader landscape, and we're noticing this in TV and also in news that our culture, both in fashion, food, cultural criticism, politics, we're sort of going back to what we ran from. So it's like the streamers are bundling and you can watch all that. Oh, wait, that's cable, right? And then so now the newsletter people are sort of, gaining employees and learning how to bundle their situation and saying, well, I've deflected and now we're starting a co-op cooperative. I'm like, well, that's a magazine. And so it's so fascinating to me. And I think any of us that are old enough to have seen, you know, lived through the various cycles of media and, and everything is returning to itself. And, you know, I'm sure they'll disband again and it'll become more about the individual. And now it's, you know, coming back to magazines.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 所以，番茄酱的运动，也许有点像你过去的自己和现在之间的区别。或者你过去可能会看不起它，当你想到：“好吧，番茄酱。”就像，新闻中另一个非常热门的话题是几天前《纽约时报》的一篇病毒式文章，关于人们在**DoorDash**上花费了惊人的金额。然后人们喜欢嘲笑那些人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, you know, the movement, the tomato sauce, maybe it's like a little bit of a, a difference between your old self. Or maybe you would have looked down on that when you think, okay, tomato sauce. Like, another very hot button thing in the news was a big viral **New York Times** article, a couple of days ago about people spending crazy amounts of money on **DoorDash**. And then people love to sneer at people for.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 尽管很疯狂，因为有些人就是喜欢。世界上没有人像有些人一样，有人一周在**DoorDash**上花了700美元，而且一直如此，我相信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Crazy, though, because some people just love no one. The world like some, like someone was spending seven. Hundred dollars on a in a week for him and has has been, I believe.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 对。是的。那很多。是的。等等，你说多少钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. Wait, how much did you say?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我想是七百。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I think it was seven.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，他们是，你知道，一对夫妇，他们花了很多钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah they were, it was, you know, it was a couple and like they spent.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 等等，他们买了什么？你还记得他们买了什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wait what were they buying. Do you remember like what were they get it.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我只知道，如果我和我丈夫从我们最喜欢的餐厅点餐，就在街对面，有时我们也会去取餐，但这有点令人尴尬。但如果送货上门，是的，那可能要100多美元。很贵。所以假设你从一个更贵的地方点餐，而且你一周七天都点。是的，700多美元，我真的能理解你是怎么做到的。我认为另一件让人们不满的事情是，照片里的那个男人有非常漂亮的铜锅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: All I know is that if my husband and I order from our favorite restaurant, which is down the street, embarrassingly enough, sometimes we do pick up. But if we're getting it delivered, yeah, that can be upwards of 100 plus dollars. It is. Expensive. And so let's say you're ordering from a more expensive place and you're doing it seven nights a week. Yeah, $700 plus it really I could see how you got there. The thing that I think also set people off is the guy in the photo had these really nice copper pans.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我知道。就是那种东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I know. Stuff like that.

**Alison Roman**: 所以对他来说，几千美元就能检查你的厨房。但他显然是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: So for him, thousands of dollars to check out your kitchen. But apparently he was.

**Tracy Alloway**: 但是，十年后，会不会有**Alison Roman**的“幽灵厨房”？

**Tracy Alloway**: But would you ever, you know, ten years from now there's ever going to be an **Ellison Ramen** like Ghost Kitchen or.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 你知道，我已经被很多人找过很多次了。我真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: You know, that I've, I've been approached so many times for that. And I really.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 多说一点。当他们提出这个想法时，他们的推销是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Say more about. That. What's the pitch when they bring. It to.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 推销是人们想要高质量的厨师制作的食物。你有一个名字。人们会为吃到**Alison Roman**制作的意面而疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: The pitch is people want high quality chef made food. You have a name? People would go crazy to have **Alison Roman's** pasta made by **Allison**.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，但你实际上并没有为他们制作，或者其他人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, but I'm not actually making that for you or someone.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 番茄酱。但我并没有声称我在做。好的，好的。我认为对我来说，这贬低了我实际做的事情。拥有番茄酱，然后用番茄酱制作东西，对我来说感觉非常不同。我也理解在人们所处的阶段满足他们的需求，如果他们不从头开始制作番茄酱，至少他们在家里做饭。即使只是打开一罐，然后加入一些东西等等。对我来说，这并不遥远，但“幽灵厨房”、送货，它对我来说非常没有人情味。它让我感到不安。我不喜欢它。我认为这就像是对你名字的一种奇怪的授权，以一种对我来说非常不真实的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Tomato sauce. But that I'm not claiming to. Okay, okay. And and I think that there is to me that that devalues what I actually do. And having tomato sauce and then making something with that tomato sauce feels very different to me. I also understand meeting people where they're at, and if they're not going to make tomato sauce from scratch, at least they're cooking something at home. Even if it's opening a jar and adding something to it and blah blah blah. That to me is not a far cry, but the the ghost kitchen, the delivery, the the de. It's to me very impersonal. It freaks me out. I, I don't care for it. I think it's like a weird licensing of your name in a way that feels really inauthentic to me.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你见过那个东西吗？**Wonder**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You seen that, that thing **wonder**?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yes.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我觉得它真的很。我附近有一个。我觉得它很诡异。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I find it. Really. There's one near. Me. I find it very creepy.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What is it?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 所以它就像。它是一种。我想它是。我不太完全了解这个业务，但我想它基本上是试图同时整合**DoorDash**和餐厅，这样他们就有一个大型设施，可以制作30种不同类型的美食，他们有自己的应用程序，有自己的送货司机。所以基本上就是我看到垂直整合了整个供应链，但他们在下东区，不是休斯顿，而是那个以D开头的街道，**Delancey**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So it's like. It's a sort of. I think it's. I don't totally know the business, but I think it's basically trying to roll up the **DoorDash** and the restaurant at the same time, so that they have this big facility that can make 30 different kinds of cuisines, and they have their own app, and they have their own delivery drivers. So basically just I see vertically integrate the whole supply chain, but they have this space on, not Houston, the one that starts with D down on the Lower East Side, Lansing **Delancey**.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Thank you.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 外面写着“一种新型的美食广场”。我当时想：“哦，我喜欢美食广场。”所以我走了进去，那里只有这些自助点餐机绿屏。屏幕上，有墨西哥菜选项、意大利菜、中国菜和日本菜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And on the outside it says like a new kind of food hall. And I was like, oh, I like food hall. So I got walked in and there's just these, kiosk green screens. And on the screens there's, like a Mexican option, an Italian and a Chinese one at Japanese.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 就像你在机场一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: It's like you're at the airport.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，就像你在机场一样，然后有30种餐厅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, it's like you're at the airport and then so there's a theory, 30 kinds of restaurants.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 哦，现在你们真的在向我推销了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Oh, now you guys are really selling it to me.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我知道这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I know it's funny.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 对我来说，那简直是我的个人地狱。而且我认为他们抓住你的地方是，他们告诉小企业主，比如一个有餐厅的厨师：“我的租金上涨了，我付不起2万美元的租金，因为**DoorDash**等等。”好的。所以他们进来，说：“我们可以给你空间，但没有人能真正在你的餐厅里吃饭。”所以你基本上是切断了餐厅存在的全部理由。有很多餐厅的业务85%是外卖，你走进去，它们是空的，但它们能够生存下来是因为外卖。所以如果你取消了租金和人员配备的需求，那对小企业主来说是很有吸引力的。我认为这非常具有掠夺性。我认为这有点像：“我们可以帮你活下去。”这就像：“好吧，代价是什么？”因为你那样做，你知道，我不知道。有些企业从来没有实体店。它们只是一个想法。或者他们会找大牌厨师，说：“我们可以用你的名字做一个炸鸡概念。”当你在**DoorDash**或**Wonder**或其他地方看时，它看起来就像一家真正的餐厅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: To me, that is literally my personal hell. And I think also where they get you is they tell you a small business owner who's like a chef who has a restaurant, my rent's going up, I can't afford $20,000 in rent because blah, blah, blah, **DoorDash**. Okay. So they come in and say, we can give you the space, but no one can really eat in your restaurant. So you're basically cutting out the entire reason for a restaurant to exist. And there are so many restaurants whose business is like 85% delivery, and you walk in and they're empty, but they're able to stay alive because of delivery. So if you take away that rent and the need to staff and did it, that's pretty appealing to a small business owner. And I think it's very predatory. I think it's very sort of like we can help you stay alive. And it's like, well, at what cost? Because you're then sort of, you know, I don't know. And some, some of these businesses never start as a brick and mortar. They are only an idea. Or they do take big name chefs and say, we can do like a fried chicken concept with your name on it. And when you look on **DoorDash** or **wonder** or whatever, it looks like a real restaurant.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。所以你看起来就像你在从一家社区餐厅点餐，对吧？但它不是一家社区餐厅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. So you look like you think you're ordering from a neighborhood restaurant, right? But it's not a neighborhood restaurant.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我以前做过。然后我走过他们实际做饭的地方，我当时想：“等等。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I've done that before. And then I like walked past where they were actually making the food. And I was like, wait a second.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我从那里点过餐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I've ordered from there.

### 美食审美与产品本质

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈到地狱。美食媒体多年来发生的一件事是，我认为对美学的强调。对吧？所以，我想每个人可能做得都少了。我当然也有罪。但如果我做了一些让我自豪的东西，我就会拍照，发到社交媒体上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Speaking of hell. So one of the things that has changed in food media, over the years is I think the emphasis on esthetics. Right? So I, I think everyone probably does less. I certainly am guilty. But if I make something that I'm proud of, I take a photo of it, post it on social media.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 我没做饭。否则我没做饭。没有证据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I didn't cook it. Otherwise I didn't cook it. There's no proof.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当你构思食谱，或者决定如何经营你的美食帝国时，你是如何看待这方面的问题的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How do you think about that particular aspect when you're coming up with recipes or, you know, deciding what to do with your food empire?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。这很有趣，我最近刚为重新推出的**《Gourmet》杂志**写了一篇文章，我不知道你们有没有听说过，或者他们在做什么，但旧杂志**《Gourmet》**的商标过期了。他们让它失效了。然后这群人，其中一个是我朋友，接管了它，并将其重新推出为一个网站，一个时事通讯。所以他们做的事情非常有趣，是一种非常不同的基调，一种非常不同的氛围。他们有点像海盗接管了一艘船，你会觉得：“哦，这已经不是原来的**《Gourmet》**了。”但我认为这是一种非常有趣和聪明的方式。无论如何，我最近一直在思考这个问题，因为感觉现在大多数人，尤其是在互联网上，做饭是为了好看。他们逆向工程，思考什么会看起来漂亮，什么会看起来很棒。这要追溯到我大约15年前，或者10年前，我在**BuzzFeed Food**工作了大约八个月。多久以前了？我不知道，太久以前了。无论如何，我当时会观察他们如何考虑要发布什么食谱，以及他们会制作什么视频。他们总是会想：“嗯，什么有奶酪？什么有奶油？什么有这个？”他们总是从视觉角度进行逆向工程。我认为我们仍然处于这种状态，即使是一个在厨房里的女士，或者一个在厨房里的男士，拿着一个前置摄像头的iPhone。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. It's funny, I just wrote an article about this for the newly relaunched **gourmet, magazine**, which I don't know if you guys heard about that or what they're doing, but the containers trademark for **gourmet**, the old magazine, had last. That. They let it lapse. And so this group of people, one of whom was a friend of mine, took it over and relaunched it as a basically a website, a newsletter. So very interesting thing that they're doing is a very different tone of always very different vibe. They it's sort of like pirates that took over a ship and you're like, oh, this is not the same **gourmet**. But I think in a very fun and that's cool, smart way. Anyway, but I was thinking a lot about this recently because it feels like most people now, especially on the internet, are making food to look good. They're reverse engineering of what's going to look beautiful and what's going to look great. And this is going back to I worked at **BuzzFeed Food** for approximately eight months. 15 years ago, or ten years ago. How long ago? I don't know, I was too long ago, anyway, but it was sort of like I would watch them in the way that they considered what recipes to run and what they would make videos out of. And it was always like, well, what has cheese and what has cream and what has this? And it was always reverse engineered from a visual perspective. And I think that we're still sort of in that even if it's, you know, a lady in her kitchen or a guy in his kitchen with like a forward facing iPhone and.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 所以我作为对此的回应，我开发了一个牛奶烹饪食谱。抱歉，牛奶煮猪肉，这是一个非常古老的意大利餐厅食谱。它丑得要命。它简直是罪恶。它是米色的，牛奶凝块结块，看起来软塌塌的，真的很恶心。但哇，它尝起来真好吃。它简直是令人难以置信。有些最好吃的东西就像一碗泔水。它们看起来就是那样。是的。我认为这有点像：“这种食物呢？我们还会把这种食物放到互联网上吗？”因为我曾考虑过，我能为这本杂志开发什么，而不会为我自己开发？我告诉我的朋友，我当时想：“嗯，我永远不会把它放到我自己的网站上，因为它太丑了。”但我也明白，鼓励某人吃东西的一部分是它必须看起来好，也必须听起来好。所以文字必须到位，照片也必须到位，一切都协同作用。但这只是一个有趣的练习，我认为我当时说了一些类似的话：“我们不是在开发食谱，我们是在设计食谱。”我认为很多人都以美学为主导，思考什么会表现良好，而不是思考它是否是一个有灵魂的、真实创作的食谱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: I so I as a reaction to this, I developed this recipe for milk cooking. Sorry, **pork cooked in milk**, which is a very old Italian restaurant recipe. It's ugly as hell. It is just sinful. It is beige and clumpy with milk curds and soft looking and it's really disgusting. But wow, does it taste good. It's like truly incredible. Some of the best tasting things are just like a bowl of slop. Are they look like it. Yeah. And I think it was sort of, you know, what about this food? Like, are we going to make this food on the internet anymore? Like because I had considered what what could I develop for this magazine that I wouldn't develop for myself? And I told my friend I was like, well, I would never put this on my own, really, because it's too ugly. But also, I understand that part of encouraging someone to eat something is it has to look good, and it also has to sound good. So the writing has to be there in the photo, has to be there, and everything works in conjunction. But it was just an interesting exercise, and I think that I said something to the effect of like, we're we're not developing recipes, we're designing them. And I think that a lot of people lead with esthetics and what they think will perform well versus thinking about it is something like a soulful, authentically created recipe.

### 番茄酱业务的成本与包装

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们可以回到番茄酱的话题吗？但我很好奇，你知道，我们喜欢谈论这个话题的另一个原因是，你可以从中了解消费者和定价等等。你是什么时候构思这个想法的？你是什么时候推出番茄酱的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can we just, return a little bit to the, tomato sauce? But I'm curious, you know, one another reason, we like to talk about this topic is because you get a snapshot into the consumer and pricing and all that, etc.. When did you conceive of this? Like when when did this idea that you're in launch it? Tomato?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 在2023年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: In 2023.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以，好吧，两年半或三年后，当你看到罐子的成本，玻璃罐的成本，当你看到食材或租金时，与2023年相比，现在的成本是如何计算的？在原材料、罐子、运输等方面，价格波动有多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So like, okay, so two and a half or three years later when you look at cost of jars. The glass jars, when you look at ingredients or rent like how is the math working out relative to what it looked like in 2023. And how volatile is it still in terms of being able to, you know, get a good price on the raw ingredients, at a good price on jars, a good price on shipping and stuff like that.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，那没有太大波动。好的。再说一次，那真的是一个规模问题。所以**DTC**（直接面向消费者）模式在这种番茄酱业务中不太奏效的原因是，罐子很重，装满酱料的罐子更重。所以运费永远是你的痛点。所以，你知道，我们研究过，我们有一个在加利福尼亚的代工厂或第三方物流公司，我们当时想：“好吧，我们要把酱料从布鲁克林运到洛杉矶，然后再运到其他地方。”我们说：“不，那会增加每罐1.5美元的成本。”所以你要考虑所有因素，好吧，这里可能稍微贵一点，但我们在这里省钱了。所以那实际上是更好的选择。但再说一次，这是规模问题。所以罐子的价格可能会波动几美分。包装材料是我们真正考虑过的问题，因为罐子在运送途中不能爆炸。包装越好，包装就越贵。有人告诉我，他们说：“这感觉就像一个老式的选举箱。”我们当时想：“我怎么才能打开这个盒子？”她说：“但所有的罐子都完好无损地送到了。”这对我们来说非常重要。所以我们在包装上多花了一点钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, that hasn't fluctuated too much. Okay. Again, that's really a scale question. So the reason why DDC doesn't quite work for a business model in this way with something like tomato sauce is because jars are heavy, jars of sauce are even heavier. So you're shipping will always be the thing that gets you. And so there are you know, we looked into, you know, we had a Co-packer or a three PL in California and we're like, okay, so we're going to ship the sauce from Brooklyn to L.A. and then it's going to go out to the rest of the we're like, no, that's going to add $1.50 per jar or whatever. So you look at every consideration okay, this might be slightly more expensive here, but we're saving here. So that's actually the better choice. But again it's scale. So we could be jars could fluctuate within a few cents. The packing materials was something that we really considered because jars cannot explode on their way to you. The better the packaging, the more expensive the packaging. And so we someone told me it was like, they're like, it feels like an old school election box. We're like, how am I going to break into this box? She's like, but all the jars arrived intact and that was really important to us. So we spent a little bit more money on the packaging.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 等等，你实际上是如何评估这些罐子的？你是不是把它们扔来扔去？你把它们运出去？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wait, how do you actually evaluate the jars? Are you like tossing them around? Are you shipped them?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。你寄给你的父母，你寄给你自己。这里有一堆空罐子。享受吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. You send it to your parents, you send it to yourself. Here's a bunch of empty jars. Enjoy.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，你把酱料放进去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, you put the sauce.

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的。你，你有很多，像一些试错的情况，其中一些是选择的集合，比如：“哦，我不喜欢这样。”或者：“打开它感觉怎么样？它复杂吗？烦人吗？材料太多了吗？感觉浪费吗？”所有这些都经过了深入的考虑。更不用说，你是否放一张卡片进去？你是否放一张便条？它是否附带撕开的标签？像这些也会增加成本的美学选择。所以，你知道，当然，这就是为什么最明显的选择是在商店里销售，因为你不用处理任何这些问题。我认为很多品牌，对我来说，值得尊敬的是看到它们发展成为只做零售。但首先做**DTC**模式，是为了让人们了解它，让人们上钩，让人们对产品感到兴奋。然后你就可以向那些更大的零售商展示：“看，所有这些已经喜欢这个产品的人，他们会在你的商店里购买它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah. You, you there's like a lot of, like a few trial and error situations and some of them are a set of choices of like, oh, I don't like the way this is. Or how does it feel to open it? Is it complicated, is annoying. Is there too much material? Does it feel wasteful? All of those things were deeply, deeply considered. And then to say nothing of like, do you put a card in there? Do you put a note? Does it come with the rip it like the esthetic choices which also add cost? And so, you know, of course, that's why the obvious choice is to be sold in a store because you're not dealing with any of that. And I think a lot of, to me, respectable to see brands evolve into retail only. But at first doing the to see model, to like get people into it, to get people hook, to get people excited about a product, sort of. Then you can show those bigger retailers like, look at all the people who already love this product, who are going to buy it in your store.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么你现在产能是不是已经饱和了？你是不是在每周或每月能销售的番茄酱数量上已经达到极限了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So are you like maxed out capacity wise right now? Are you like busting at the seams in terms of how much you can move in a given week or month. With tomatoes on?

</details>

**Alison Roman**: 是的，是的。非常饱和。这很好。我认为对我来说，最大的缺点是我们在9月推出。而且之所以花了这么长时间，是因为我生了一个孩子。我当时正要推出它，然后推迟了。然后我离预产期太近了，这很好，因为我提前一个月分娩了，但我无法想象同时做这件事。所以感谢上帝我暂停了。我当时想，我们也重新设计了标签，这很好，就像一个重新开始。这几乎是一个假启动。但无论如何，我们在9月推出，我拍了这些漂亮的照片，我有很多关于宣传活动和营销的想法，我们立即售罄了。我当时想：“好吧，也许下周我们补货后我会再做。”我们以如此快的速度不断售罄，以至于我几乎无法谈论它。所以我觉得在某种程度上，我们甚至还没有充分发挥其潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: Yeah, yes. That's great. Very much so. And it's good. And I think that the to me the biggest drawback there is that we launched in September. And also the reason it took so long is because I had a baby. I was like about to we were going to launch it and push it. And then I became too close to the due date, which is good because I went into labor a month early, but it I can't imagine having done that at the same time. So thank God I put a pause on it. I was like and we also redesigned the labels like it was a good reset. It was almost like a false start. But anyway, we launched in September and I had these beautiful photos taken and like I had all these ideas for campaign and marketing and we sold out immediately and I was like, okay, well, maybe I'll do it the next week once we're back in stock. We kept selling out at such a clip that I couldn't really ever talk about it. So I feel like in a way we haven't, like, fully even launched with its full potential. Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这很有趣。**Alison Roman**，你能在六个月或一年后回来吗？你已经进行了所有这些对话，我们可以做一个后续，谈谈你学到了什么。当你拿到**Whole Foods**的合同时？我非常想知道那些讨论到底是什么样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's interesting. **Alison Roman**, can you come back in six months or a year and like, you've had all of these conversations that we could do a to on what you've learned when. You're, when you get the **Whole Foods** contract? I'd be super interested what those discussions are actually like.

**Alison Roman**: 这是一篇完美的日记，记录了一个小企业的发展。我真的很喜欢，非常非常喜欢这个开始。我认为如果情况发生变化，再回来会很有趣。这很棒。我喜欢谈论这些事情，这真是一种乐趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Alison Roman**: This is a perfect diary entry of following a small business. I really am love very, very start. And I think it would be really fun to come back if and when things change. And this has been great. I love talking about this stuff and what a pleasure.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **Tracy**。那很有趣。我不知道，你可能也注意到了。我们可能也谈论过。你知道，如果你看**Apple Podcasts**的商业版块，比如最佳播客榜单，它被“创业播客”、“企业家”之类的节目主导。也许我们应该转向。我喜欢这些对话。也许我们应该转向，你知道，企业家日记之类的节目。它们真的很有趣。你学到了很多。

**Tracy Alloway**: Tracy. That was a lot of fun. I don't know, you've probably noticed this too. We've probably talked about it. You know, if you look at the business section of the **Apple Podcasts** like best top podcast list, it's like dominated by like starting a business podcast, entrepreneurs. Maybe we should pivot into I love these conversations. Maybe we should pivot into, you know, diary of an entrepreneur type episodes. They're really fun. You learn a lot.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你知道我想做什么吗？是的。**Odd Lots**烹饪节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You know what I want to do? Yeah. The **Odd Lots** cooking show.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 应该做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What should.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们做一个烹饪视频。是的。那会很棒。我们会从**Alison**那里得到一个食谱，然后我们现场烹饪。还有**Butterworth’s**的**Bart**。是的。这些词和所有。还有**Zeno's**披萨的那些家伙。是的，我能做到。是的。这实际上是我们的书的想法，因为你我从未决定要一起写哪本书，但我们可以做一本美食书。每道食谱中，人们都能学到一些关于那个业务供应链的知识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's do a cooking video. Yeah. That would be great. Well, get, a recipe from **Allison**, and we'll cook it live. And, **Bart** from **Butterworth’s**. Yeah. These words and all the. And, the **Zeno's** pizza guys. Yeah, I could get on. Yeah. This is actually our book idea, because we never settled on a book that you and I want to write together, but we could just do a food. One where in each recipe, someone learn something about the supply chain for that business.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那是个好主意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: That's a great idea.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 如果你在听，如果你在出版界，你听到这个，你听到这个，联系我们。

**Joe Weisenthal**: If you're listening, if you're out there in publishing and you hear this up and you hear this, hit us up.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 没错。不，那真是一次引人入胜的对话。我之前没有太多考虑过的一件事是，在获得大型分销合同之前决定何时扩大规模的困难，因为，正如**Alison**所说，这确实感觉像一个“先有鸡还是先有蛋”的问题，因为你必须向杂货店或其他地方推销，证明你能够大规模生产这些东西。然后你必须决定是否要大规模投资，以便能够进行推销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: That's right. No, that was a fascinating conversation. One thing I hadn't really considered that much is the difficulty of deciding when to scale before you have that big distribution contract, because, as **Allison** said, like, it does feel like a chicken and egg problem because you have to pitch to the grocery store or whatever, that you can actually produce this stuff at scale. And then you have to decide whether you want to invest at scale in order to be able to make the pitch.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，技能在各个方面似乎都很残酷，对吧？如果你筹集了风险投资，那么在你看到一分钱利润之前，你就有大量的钱要偿还。贷款显然也是如此。这可能对这个行业来说尤其困难。然后，你知道，你必须进入一个新的设施，那个鸡。我保证我会说出来。当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No skill seems just sort of brutal in every respect, right? If you raise VC money, then you have a lot of money to pay back before you ever see a dime of profit yourself. Same obviously for lending. And that's probably particularly hard for this. And then just, you know, you have to get into a new facility that, chicken. I promise I'll say it. Definitely.

**Tracy Alloway**: 拥有名人身份显然没有坏处，对吧？她有点犹豫这个词，但显然是一位美食名人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It clearly doesn't hurt to have to be a celebrity, right? She sort of was hesitant about the word, but obviously a, a food celebrity.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 另一件事，对话中没有提到，但我事后想到的，在我们节目中也提到过一点，就是她不必支付“**Facebook**税”。对吧？大多数**CPG**公司，他们很大一部分资金立即用于**Instagram**广告营销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And the other thing, it didn't come up in the conversation, but something that I thought about right after it's come up a little bit on our show is she doesn't have to pay the **Facebook** tax.
