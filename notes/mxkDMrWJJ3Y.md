### 委内瑞拉经济困境与人才流失

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期 OddLots 播客。我是 **Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是 **Tracy Alloway**。Joe，我们最近发布了一期关于在**马杜罗 (Maduro)** 执政时期在**委内瑞拉 (Venezuela)** 经商的经历，是从粮食行业的角度来看的。我认为有一点非常明显，那就是委内瑞拉确实拥有丰富的自然资源，除了石油，还有其他资源。美国与委内瑞拉现任政府的关系可能比以前有所改善，但要真正振兴经济，实现稳定和繁荣，还有很长的路要走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and I'm Tracy Aloway. So Tracy, we recently published that episode about what it was like to have done business during the Maduro years in Venezuela. That was from a grain perspective. And I think one thing that's very obvious is that sure Venezuela may have plenty of natural resources, uh, oil obviously, but also other ones. and perhaps that the relationship between uh the US and the uh current government may be better than it was but there is going to be you know actually reviving the economy actually getting in a place of stability and thriving that's a that's a very long way off to say the least

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，如果你地下有石油，那很好，但它在地下，你需要实际开采才能赚钱，而且为了鼓励那些会开采它的人，你需要建立某种可靠性。必须对未来有某种稳定感，否则，正如我们之前讨论过的，人们根本不会想去那里做生意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: right so if you have oil in the ground yes that's great but it's in the ground and you need to actually extract it in order to make money and also in order to encourage the type of people who would extract it you need to have some sort of reliability in place, right? There has to be some sense of stability of the future otherwise as we heard from our previous discussion people just aren't going to want to go there and do business

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，他提出的一个观点，我认为对这个国家的未来和相关问题非常重要，那就是他提到如果有一位在某种加工厂工作的才华横溢的工程师，在他提到的案例中，他指的是**嘉吉 (Cargill)**。显然，如果有人在技术方面很有才能，他们就会在墨西哥或其他地方雇佣他们。很多人离开了。当你考虑到当地的安全局势，即使外国资金想回来，人才的问题，以及他们身在何处、是否愿意回来、需要什么条件才能让他们回来，从而能够盈利地生产自然资源等，这都是一个巨大的难题，而且没有一键就能解决的开关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: right so one of the points that he brought up which I think is very germanine to the future and the questions about the country's future is that you know he talked about if there was a talented engineer who worked in some sort of processing plant in his case he was talking about cargill obviously if there was someone who is like talented in the sort of technical ical side of them. They hired them in Mexico, you know, they hired them elsewhere. So many people left. And when you think about the security situation on the ground even again, let's say somehow the foreign money wants to come back in this question of talent and the question of like where are they and do they want to come back and what it would take to get them to come back such that you can actually sort of produce natural resources among other things profitably. That's a huge difficult element and there's no switch that you can flip.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我也对委内瑞拉的经济历史很感兴趣。首先，我觉得中南美洲对我们来说一直是个盲区，原因有很多。我去过委内瑞拉一次，但那是我九岁时唯一一次坐邮轮，我只记得下船待了几个小时，看到很多流浪狗，我觉得它们很可爱，想带回家。我就只记得这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I'm also just interested in Venezuela's economy from a historical perspective. Uh, one because I feel like Central and South America have been a blind spot for us for various reasons. I've been to Venezuela once, but I think it was on a cruise when I was the only cruise I ever went on when I was like 9 years old. And all I remember is getting off the boat and like being there for a few hours and seeing a lot of stray dogs that I thought were really cute and I wanted to take home with me. That's all I remember.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但除此之外，它并没有……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But other than that, it didn't

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我当时没在想经济。但我也觉得这很有趣，因为我们这里有一个经济体，它似乎围绕着一种特定资源而发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I wasn't thinking about the economy. But also, I find it really interesting because here we have an economy which seems to have coalesed around one specific resource.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yes.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但正如我们从那一集了解到的，他们确实生产其他一些东西。所以我很好奇，在鼓励石油产业与其他类型的就业和商业之间，有什么权衡。有很多值得讨论的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But as we learned from that episode, they do make some other things. And so I'm curious about the tradeoffs between, you know, encouraging the oil industry versus other types of jobs and businesses. There's a lot to discuss.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 在我们深入讨论之前，还有一点我认为非常重要，那就是你经常听到在**乌戈·查韦斯 (Hugo Chavez)** 上台之前，委内瑞拉是一个相当富裕的国家。但现在，这又回到了当前时刻。我们从国际上看，自然资源禀赋与公众财富之间并没有任何明显的联系。**资源诅咒 (resource curse)**，对吧？有很多地方拥有大量石油或其他商品，但普通民众却贫困潦倒，生活并不特别好。我认为这正是法治、熟练劳动力以及所有这些在世界各地分布不均且不一定与商品存在相关的因素发挥作用的地方。总之，我们之前播客上请过一位嘉宾，他谈论了很多这些事情，以及可持续增长的一些先决条件。我们多次和他讨论过这些。他恰好是完美的嘉宾，因为他曾在90年代参与过委内瑞拉的经济政策制定，担任过计划部长，也是中央银行董事会成员。他真是完美的嘉宾。所以我很高兴再次欢迎 **Ricardo Hausmann** 教授回到播客，他目前是**哈佛肯尼迪学院 (Harvard Kennedy School)** 的教授，**哈佛增长实验室 (Harvard Growth Lab)** 的主任。Ricardo，非常感谢你再次来到 OddLots。你真是完美的嘉宾，出现在完美的时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And one other element before we get into this that I think is very important is you hear a lot about how prior to Hugo Chavez coming to power that Venezuela was a fairly welloff country. But and again it speaks to maybe the current moment. We know just looking internationally that there is really not any sort of obvious connection between natural resource endowments and the wealth of the public. The resource curse the resource curse, right? And there are plenty of places that have a lot of oil or some other commodity where the general public is impoverished or does not live particularly well. I think this is where you get a lot of that element of the rule of law and skilled labor and all of these things that are certainly unevenly distributed throughout the world and are not correlated necessarily with the existence of commodities. Anyway, someone that we've had on the uh podcast before who has talked a lot about these things, some of the preconditions for sustainable growth. We've talked to him about all this multiple times. He happens to be the perfect guest because he was previously part of uh economic policym in Venezuela in the 90s. He was a minister of planning. He was also more a member of the board of the central bank. Truly the perfect guest. So I'm thrilled to welcome back on the podcast Ricardo Houseman who is currently professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, director of the Harvard Growth Lab. So Ricardo, thank you so much for uh coming back on OddLots. Truly the perfect guest in the perfect moment.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 谢谢，非常感谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me.

### 委内瑞拉经济历史概述

**Joe Weisenthal**: 为什么不……我在想从何说起。你已经在哈佛26年了，但正如我提到的，在查韦斯时代之前，你曾在委内瑞拉参与政策制定。你能不能给我们讲讲你那段历史？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Why don't you I'm trying to think where to start. Why don't you tell us about um you've been at Harvard for 26 years, but as I mentioned, you used to be in policym in uh Venezuela prior to the Chavez years. Why don't you tell us a little bit about your history there?

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 嗯，如果你想了解委内瑞拉，你必须真正理解它是一个非常成熟的石油国家。石油的重要性始于1917年，由**皇家荷兰壳牌 (Royal Dutch Shell)** 公司开始。然后在1920年代，**新泽西标准石油 (Standard Oil of New Jersey)** 公司（现在的**埃克森 (Exxon)**）进入。到1929年，委内瑞拉是世界上最大的石油出口国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Well, if you want to understand Venezuela, you have to really understand the fact that it's a very mature oil country. Oil became important starting in 1917 with Royal Dutch Shell. Then in the 1920s, Standard Oil of New Jersey came in, now Exxon. And by 1929, Venezuela was the largest oil exporter in the world

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 并一直保持世界最大石油出口国的地位，直到1965年被沙特阿拉伯超越。在1917年到1978年（大约60年）这段时期，委内瑞拉可能是世界上增长最快的国家，也是世界上通货膨胀率最低的国家。它与美元实行固定汇率，拥有非常发达的金融市场。它是一个移民非常非常多的国家。例如，在1960年的人口普查中，7%的委内瑞拉人出生在欧洲，主要来自西班牙、意大利、葡萄牙，但它也吸引了哥伦比亚人、多米尼加人、厄瓜多尔人等。所以，它是一个非常繁荣的国家。然后在1970年代，石油繁荣到来，石油繁荣让我们想得非常非常大。接着是伊朗-伊拉克战争引发的第二次石油危机，带来了更多的资金。然后突然在1980年代，油价暴跌。石油收入锐减，美国在80年代初疯狂提高利率，导致1983年爆发债务危机。从1983年到1989年左右，这就是拉丁美洲所谓的“失去的十年”，我们都陷入了巨大的国际收支危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: and remained the largest oil exporter in the world until 1965 when it was taken over by Saudi Arabia. And in that period going to say 1978 1980 between say 1917 and 1978 say you know 60 years Venezuela was probably the fastest growing country in the world and it was uh the country with the lowest inflation rate in the world and it um it had a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. It had you know a very developed financial market. It was a country of very very large immigration. So that say in the census of 1960 7% of Venezuelans were born in Europe in mostly Spain, Italy, Portugal but also it was a source of attraction of Colombians, Dominicans, Ecuadorians etc. So it was a very prosperous country. and then got in the 1970s the oil boom and the oil boom made us think very very big. Then came the second oil shock of the Iran Iraq war and that brought in even more money and then suddenly the in the 1980s the price of oil collapsed. oil revenues collapsed and the US jacked up interest rates like crazy in the early 80s and that led to a debt crisis by 1983 and from 1983 to [snorts] around 1989. It's what in Latin America was called the lost decade of the 80s and we were all in a big you know balance of payments crisis

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那是非常痛苦的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: that was very painful happened.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 委内瑞拉是世界上从**AAA (最高信用评级)** 级迅速跌至违约的国家。它确实如此。它在1981年还是AAA级，1983年就违约了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Venezuela is the country in the world that went from AAA to default more quickly. It did. So it was AAA like in 1981 and it defaulted in 1983.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wow.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Wow.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 所以，80年代非常复杂。然后在90年代初，是**卡洛斯·安德烈斯·佩雷斯 (Carlos Andres Perez)** 总统和他的部长**米格尔·罗德里格斯 (Miguel Rodriguez)** 以及**摩西·奈姆 (Moses Naim)** 等其他部长。我参与了那个政府。当时进行了一次非常重大的结构调整和债务重组，开放了经济。90年代是一个艰难复苏的时期。油价波动剧烈，时涨时跌。但到1998年，发生了**俄罗斯危机 (Russian crisis)**，油价急剧下跌。利率飙升，金融市场枯竭。正是在1998年，我们举行了选举，公众说：“搞什么鬼？你们告诉我们所有这些改革都会有回报。钱在哪里？”等等。没有钱，因为油价跌到了每桶8美元左右。但事实是，他们投票给了查韦斯。他们大规模地投票给了查韦斯。查韦斯一开始非常温和，但随着时间的推移，随着油价回升，我们在2004年至2014年之间经历了一次惊人的石油繁荣。查韦斯觉得他被赋予了权力。他有钱。石油资金源源不断地涌入。他认为，鉴于所有这些石油资金的涌入，他可以以此为抵押借款。他实施了所有这些限制私营部门的政策。他把所有会动的东西都国有化了。他左右创建了这些社会主义企业。它们最终都破产了。但他实施了外汇管制、进口管制、价格管制。只要它会动，你就控制它。到2012年，他身患重病，得了癌症。但他参加了选举。他可能在选举后不久就去世了。我们不知道他确切的死亡日期，因为他在12月初之后就没有公开露面，但他们在2013年3月宣布了他的死讯。2012年，政府的支出就像油价是每桶200美元一样，而当时油价只有每桶100美元。所以他们疯狂借贷。然后突然在2013年到2014年，油价跌到了30多美元。所以，并不是说他们必须从100美元跌到30美元，而是他们以200美元的价格支出和借贷，当油价暴跌时，没有人愿意借钱给委内瑞拉。所以他们突然没有美元了，没有美元进口原材料、备件、种子、化肥等等。生产急剧下降，这是人类历史上除了战争之外发生过的最大经济崩溃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: So So it was um and then the 80s were quite complicated. Then in the early 90s was President Carlos Andres Perez and his minister Miguel Rodriguez and others Moses Naim and and other ministers I participated on that government. A very major structural adjustment was done and debt restructuring opening the economy and the '9s were a period of a difficult recovery. Oil was very volatile going up and down. But by 1998, you had the the Russian crisis and the price of oil collapsed dramatically. Interest rates went through the roof. Financial markets dried up. And it is in that year 1998 that we had elections and the public said, "What the hell? you told us that all these reforms are going to pay off. You know, where's the money, etc. There was no money because the price of oil had gone down to something like $8 a barrel. But the truth is that they voted for Chavis. Massively voted for Chavis. [snorts] And Chavis started, you know, very moderately at the beginning, but as time went on and as the price of oil recovered and we had a spectacular boom between 2004 and 2014 in the price of oil. Well, Chavez felt that he was empowered. He had the money. The oil money was coming in. He thought given all the oil money that he was that was coming in, he could borrow against it. He put all these policies to restrict the private sector. He nationalized everything that moved. He created these socialist enterprises left and right. They all went broke eventually. But he imposed exchange controls, import controls, price controls. If it moved, you controlled it. And by 2012, he was very sick with cancer. But he ran for the election. He died probably immediately after the election. We don't know exactly the day when he died because um he didn't didn't appear publicly after early December, but they announced his death in in March of 2013. The year 2012, they the government spent as if the price of oil was at $200 a barrel when it was only at $100 a barrel. So they borrowed as if it was going out of fashion. And then suddenly in 2013 2014 the price of oil collapsed to something like in the 30s. So it's not that they had to go from 100 to 30 or no it's that they were spending at 200 and borrowing and when the price of oil collapsed nobody wanted to lend to Venezuela. So suddenly they had no dollars, no dollars to import raw materials, spare parts, seeds, fertilizers, whatever. And production came tumbling down and it was the biggest economic collapse that ever happened in human history outside of wars

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而且比大多数战争中发生的崩溃还要严重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: and bigger than the collapse that happened in most wars.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 所以，在没有资金流入的情况下，他们仍然需要支付他们所创造的庞大公共部门的开支。所以他们只是印钞票。马杜罗从货币中去掉了五个零，仅仅三年半后，他又从货币中去掉了六个零。这是一种前所未有的恶性通货膨胀，也许在1920年代的德国，以及二战后德国短暂的一段时间里出现过。这是从未发生过的事情。金融系统从800亿美元的资产变成了10亿美元的资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: So without money coming in, they still had to pay for a huge public sector that they had created. So it just printed money. Maduro took out five zeros out of the currency and barely three and a half years later he took six more zeros out of the currency. This is a hyperinflation never seen before maybe I don't know in Germany in the 1920s and for a brief period in Germany after the second world war. It's it's something that has never happened. The financial system went from being like $80 billion in assets to like $1 billion in assets.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Jeez.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 所以，这是一次彻底的经济崩溃。800万人离开了这个国家。现在你必须问自己一个问题：到底发生了什么？这并不是世界上唯一的石油国家。我的意思是，沙特阿拉伯发生了什么？科威特发生了什么？阿联酋、哈萨克斯坦或阿塞拜疆发生了什么？我们从未听说过仅仅因为油价下跌就发生如此大规模的崩溃。所以真正发生的是，油价在一个假定人们没有权利，所有资金都掌握在政府手中的体系中下跌了。而现在政府没有钱了，人们就没有权利，什么都无法运转。这才是委内瑞拉崩溃的根本原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: So it was a total collapse of the economy. 8 million people left the country. Now you have to ask yourself the question, what the hell? This is not the only oil country in the world. I mean what happened to Saudi Arabia? What happened to Kuwait? What happened to United Arab Emirates or Kazakhstan or Aerbatan? We never heard of a collapse of this magnitude just because the price of oil went down. So what really happened is that the price of oil went down in a system that presumed that people had no rights and all the money was in the government. And when now the government doesn't have the money, people are left with no rights and nothing moves. And that's the underlying reason for the Venezuelan collapse.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那是对委内瑞拉经济史的精彩总结。我喜欢和教授们交流，因为我甚至不需要提问，只需倾听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That was a fantastic summary of Venezuelan economic history. I like speaking to uh professors because I don't even have to ask questions. You just listen.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，因为那些都是我本来要问的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, because those were all the questions I was going to ask.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，那太棒了。好的。不过，实际上有一个严肃的问题。在整个20世纪，也就是上个世纪，有没有真正努力使委内瑞拉经济摆脱对石油的依赖，实现多元化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, that was great. Okay. Well, actually a serious question though. Were there any real efforts throughout, I guess, the 1900s, the last century, to diversify Venezuela's economy away from oil?

</details>

### 经济多元化与稳定基金

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 是的，那是委内瑞拉的口号。说起来容易做起来难，对吧？口号是我们要“播种石油”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Yes, that was the mantra in Venezuela. It's harder to do than to say, right? The the the mantra was that we were going to sew the oil.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 我们要“播种石油”。所以，我们在国家南部开发了水力发电潜力。我们拥有世界上最好的水力发电河流——**卡罗尼河 (Caron River)**。它应该能产生32吉瓦的电力。而且，如果你愿意，一年365天，每天24小时都能生产，它是一个水文奇迹，非常棒。但它现在只生产8吉瓦。所以，他们也把这个搞砸了。我们本打算用它来生产铝和钢铁。我们拥有巨大的农业潜力，特别是在过去20年巴西农业革命之后。但在查韦斯主义时期，它没有惠及委内瑞拉。所以，我们本可以生产超过1200万公顷的土地，而我们现在生产的还不到100万公顷。所以，多元化的潜力是巨大的，但委内瑞拉的故事一直是关于未来充满这种难以置信的不确定性的故事，因为我们没有以保护国内经济的方式管理石油收入的波动性。所以，这不仅仅是旧的“荷兰病”，即你赚了太多的美元，导致本币升值，其他产业失去竞争力。真正的问题是，自1980年代以来，石油收入一直上下波动，使得经济变得非常不可预测。解决这个问题的唯一方法是通过**稳定基金 (stabilization funds)** 保护经济免受油价波动的影响。我起草了稳定基金的法律，但查韦斯一上台，这是他第一个废除的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: We're going to sow the oil. And so, we developed our hydro potential in the south of the country. We have the best hydroelectric river in the world, the Caron River. It should be producing like 32 gigawatts of power. And by the way, 247 if you want, 365 days a year, it's it's fantastic from it's a it's a hydraological marvel. It's not producing 8 megawws, 8 gigawatt. So, so it's they they messed that up too. We were going to use that to produce aluminum, steel. We have enormous agricultural potential especially with the agricultural revolution that has happened in mostly in Brazil in the last 20 years. It didn't reach Venezuela during Chavismo. So, we could be producing over 12 million hectares and we are producing on less than a million. So, so the potential for diversification is huge, but the story of Venezuela has been the story of this incredible uncertainty over what the future brings because we have not managed the o the volatility in oil incomes in a way that protects the domestic economy. So more than you know just the old Dutch disease of being you know you're earning so many dollars that you're so appreciated that other things are not competitive. It's really that since the 1980s, it's been up and down, up and down in oil incomes that has made the economy quite unpredictable. And the only way to deal with that is to protect the economy from oil price volatilities through stabilization funds. And those I wrote the law for the stabilization fund, but the moment Chavez got in, that's the first thing he killed.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我刚才想问，既然你曾是中央银行的董事会成员，我们知道在许多资源丰富的国家，中央银行的做法可能是仅仅盯住美元，这很简单。你当时在中央银行时，它的总体理念是什么？它是如何考虑外汇冲销、防止通货膨胀的？中央银行使用的框架是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I was just going to ask since you were on the board of the central bank, you know, we know that in a lot of resourcerich countries the approach of the central bank, they might just peg to the dollar, you know, something very simple. What was the sort of general philosophy of the central bank when you were on it? How did it think about sterilizing foreign currencies, preventing inflation? What was what was the framework that the central bank used?

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 这是一个很好的问题，因为委内瑞拉直到1983年都将汇率盯住美元，除了60年代初我们遇到的一次小危机。然后当美国在1971-72年放弃**布雷顿森林协议 (Breton Woods agreement)** 并贬值货币时，美国贬值，我们对美元重估。但我们实行的是固定汇率，所以非常简单，固定汇率。市场相信汇率是固定和挂钩的，直到1983年危机之前，它运作得相当好。然后在1983年危机中，他们首先尝试了外汇管制和多种汇率。当我在中央银行时，我们决定统一汇率，浮动汇率，并采取更像**通胀目标制 (inflation targeting)** 的做法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: That's a that's a very good question because Venezuela until 1983 had pegged the exchange rate to the dollar except in one small crisis we had in the early 60s and then when the US devalued the currency in 197172 when it abandoned the Breton Woods agreement we the US devalued we revalued visav the US but we had fixed exchange rates so it was very simple fixed exchange rate. The market believed the exchange rate was fixed and pegged and it worked quite well until the 1983 crisis. And then in the 1983 crisis, first they tried exchange controls, multiple exchange rates. And when I was at the central bank, it we decided to unify the exchange rate to float and to adopt something more like inflation targeting.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Got it.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 但这并不容易做到，因为通胀目标制在通胀得到控制、情况更稳定时更容易实现。所以我们经历了一段相当坎坷的时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: But it it was it was not easy to do because uh you know inflation targeting is easier to achieve when when inflation is under control and things are more stable. So we had a pretty bumpy road.

</details>

### 查韦斯执政与权利侵蚀

**Tracy Alloway**: 你提到了稳定基金。作为一名政策制定者，亲眼目睹向查韦斯政府过渡，以及你早期的一些工作被废除，是怎样一种感受？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know you mentioned that stability fund as a policy maker. What was it like to witness, I guess, the the transition to the Chavez administration and I guess see some of your your work your earlier work dismantled.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 嗯，一开始是相当渐进的。查韦斯保留了前任政府的财政部长。她给市场带来了一些信心，他做的第一件事就是修改宪法，而宪法将权力集中在总统身上。国会从两院制变为一院制，然后制衡机制被侵蚀了。但真正改变他想法的是，当油价上涨的那一刻，他觉得他不再需要社会了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Well, it was initially quite gradual. Chavez left the the finance minister from the previous administration. She gave some confidence to markets and he first thing he did is he changed the constitution and the constitution concentrated power in the presidency. It went from two chambers of congress to a single chamber of congress and then and then the checks and balances were eroded. Uh and but what really changed his mind was uh the moment the price of oil went up he felt he no longer needed society

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 私营部门需要他，但他不需要私营部门。所以他开始，他有钱收买所有人，但他进行了征用，大部分都没有支付，并创造了一个人们认为自己没有任何权利的环境。你的财产可能被没收，你不能设定价格，未经许可你不能购买外汇。而要获得许可，你必须表现良好。所以它创造了一个非常压抑的环境。顺便说一句，我们曾经有新闻自由，但现在根本没有新闻自由了。所以，这是权利的侵蚀，财产权、信息权、投票权，以及政治权利。所以，这是所有权利的彻底侵蚀，一个长期存在的民主国家转变为独裁政权，这真是可怕的景象。

<details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: that the private sector needed him. He didn't need the private sector. So he started, he had the money to buy everybody off, but he expropriated, didn't pay for most of it, and created an environment in which people thought that they really had no rights. You had your property could be taken away, you could not set prices, you could not buy foreign exchange without permission. And if to buy to get that permission, you had to behave. And so it created an environment, a quite oppressive environment. By the way, we had a free press and and now there's no free press whatsoever. So, it's it's this erosion of rights, property rights, information rights, voting rights, just political rights. So, it was the complete erosion of all rights and the transformation of a long-standing democracy into a dictatorship was quite horrible to watch.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我认为最令人惊讶的方面之一，现在回想起来，从我们最近的谈话来看，就是这些企业在日益恶化的局势下坚持了多久。你会想，好吧，恶性通货膨胀来了，你听到这些故事，比如某个地方的仓库里堆满了糖，我们可以卖到国外，这样就能获得硬通货来购买备件等等。这种想法，你知道，它不是一个，它是一种慢煮，可以说，那些大型国际公司并没有马上离开，他们实际上一直在努力让它尽可能地运作下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I think one of the most surprising aspects and now that I think about it from our recent conversation was just how long have some of these businesses stuck it out under a deteriorating situation. You think okay you get this hyperinflation and you hear these stories about okay are there some warehouses full of sugar somewhere that we could sell abroad so that we could get the hard currency in in order to buy you know buy spare parts etc. this idea that like you know it was it was not a it was a sort of slow boil so to speak and the big international companies they didn't leave right away they actually they kept trying to make it work for as long as they possibly could.

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 绝对是。而且，**嘉吉**就是一个很好的例子，在你们之前的节目中。**嘉吉**，政府将国际贸易国有化了。所以，你必须通过一家国有公司来买卖所有东西，这家公司会代表你的客户进行购买。而他们就是那些从中套取官方汇率和市场汇率（或黑市汇率）之间差价的人，在某些阶段，这个差价可能是1比10，1比100。所以最好的生意是以平行汇率出售美元，然后以官方汇率将其兑换成美元。那将是一天10000%的回报率。所以，正是这种疯狂导致了我之前提到的经济崩溃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Absolutely. And and it was uh I mean Cargill is a good example in your in your previous show. Cargill you know the government nationalized international trade. So, uh, you had to buy you had to sell everything through a stateowned company that would buy on behalf of your customers. And they were the ones kind of siphoning the differential between the official exchange rate and the and the and the market exchange rate or the black market exchange rate which was at some stages, you know, 10 to one, 100 to one. So the best business was to sell a dollar at the parallel rate and convert that into dollars at the official rate. That would have been a rate of return of 10,000% in a day. So so it was it was that that craziness in in that led to uh to the economic collapse that I mentioned before.

### 制裁与经济崩溃的深层原因

**Joe Weisenthal**: 既然我们谈到美元，请跟我们谈谈制裁的影响。你不再是政策制定者了，但那些制裁生效时，我认为现在评估委内瑞拉的困难之一是，我们试图弄清楚那里的经济问题有多少是本土结构性问题造成的，有多少是像已经实施了二十年的制裁这样的外部因素造成的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Since we're talking about dollars, talk to us a little bit about the impact of sanctions. So, you know, you were no longer a policy maker when those sanctions came into effect, but I I think part of the difficulty when it comes to assessing Venezuela right now is we're trying to figure out how much of the economic issues there are the result of sort of homegrown structural issues versus external factors like the sanctions that have been in place for two decades now.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 不，制裁没有实施二十年。制裁实际上是从2017年下半年左右开始实施的，经济在那之前就崩溃了。最严重的崩溃发生在2016年。2016年，政府将进口削减了约85%。食品进口、药品进口，他们就是让进口崩溃了。我当时写了一篇文章，建议委内瑞拉应该向**国际货币基金组织 (IMF)** 求助并重组债务，因为他们借了太多钱，油价跌了这么多，又没有储蓄，无法继续偿还债务，需要重组债务，最好能得到IMF的一些支持。所以我在那篇文章的标题中提出了一个问题：“委内瑞拉应该违约吗？”这让我被禁止入境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: No, the sanctions haven't been in place for two decades. The sanctions the sanctions were actually imposed starting around second half of 2017 and the economy imploded. The the worst implosion was in the year 2016. In the year 2016, the government cut back on imports by something like 85%. Imports of food, imports of medicine. They they just collapsed imports. I wrote an article in those days suggesting that Venezuela should go to the IMF and restructure its debt because since it had borrowed so much money and the price of oil had declined so much and it had no savings, it could not keep on servicing the debt and it it would need to restructure its debt ideally with some support from the IMF. So I asked the question in in the title of that article was um should Venezuela default and um and that got me banned from the country.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 幸运的是我在国外发表了，但这让你了解了当时的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: So fortunately I published it abroad but it gives you an idea of how this

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那是2016年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: was the year 2016.

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的，在制裁之前，好的。

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay before sanctions okay

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 2015年、2016年，在制裁之前。所以预兆已经很明显了。石油产量已经崩溃，因为2003年，查韦斯解雇了石油公司的人，当时石油公司罢工，因为查韦斯干预了他们的精英管理制度，干预了他们关于公司内部结构中达到某个级别的等级规则，这是一种我们从**埃克森美孚 (Exxon Mobile)** 和**壳牌 (Shell)** 继承下来的文化，它们是70年代国有化之前委内瑞拉的两大生产商。所以那家公司有着深厚的文化。他们罢工了。查韦斯解雇了32000名员工中的20000名，从高层开始。所以他消灭了那家公司的所有人力资本，产量立即开始下降。我们曾经拥有每天提炼130万桶石油的能力。今天我们连10万桶都提炼不了。我们进口汽油。所以，这种破坏远远早于任何制裁。现在，制裁之所以实施，是因为马杜罗开始越来越偏离民主规范，这是一种试图迫使他回归民主规范的方式，但他反而变得更加激进。但仅仅告诉你人力资本在所有这些方面的重要性，你可能会说石油没那么重要。人力资本，它有点像一个基础产业。当他们把委内瑞拉的石油工程师赶走后，他们去了哥伦比亚。哥伦比亚有一个油田叫**Rialises**。它当时每天生产3万桶石油。委内瑞拉的石油工程师来了之后，很快就让它每天生产25万桶。所以，你真的需要知道你在做什么。他们赶走的人力资本，才是委内瑞拉石油产量真正崩溃的原因。然后显然他本可以围绕制裁进行谈判，但他宁愿贫穷并掌权，也不愿提供更多的权利和规范，也许冒着输掉选举的风险。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 2015 2016 before sanctions. So it was the writing was on the wall. the the the oil production had collapsed because in 2003 Chavez fired the the oil company had gone on strike because Chavez was messing with their meritocracy with their hierarchical rules of you know what you needed to do to reach a certain level in the in the structure of the company which was a culture that we inherited from Exon Mobile and from from shell that were sort of like the two large producers in Venezuela before we they were nationalized in the 70s. But so there was a deep culture in that in in that company. They went on strike. Chavez fired 20,000 out of 32,000 starting from the top. So he eliminated all the human capital of that company and immediately production started to decline. We had the capacity to refine 1.3 million barrels of oil a day. Today we can't refine a 100,000. We import gasoline. So, so they this destruction way precedes any sanctions. Now the sanctions were imposed because Maduro started to get farther and farther away from democratic norms and uh it was a way of trying to force him to to to move back to democratic norms and uh and instead he radi he became more radicalized in his uh in his thing. But just to tell you the importance of human capital in all you might say oil is not that important. You know human cap it's kind of like a basic industry. When they kicked out the Venezuelan oil engineers they went to Colombia. There was a field in Colombia called Rialises. It was producing 30,000 barrels of oil a day. The Venezuelan oil engineers came in and in no time they it was producing 250,000 barrels a day. So it's it's just you you need to know what it is that you're doing. Well, that human capital they kicked out, that's the real collapse of the Venezuelan oil production. And then obviously he could have negotiated around sanctions, but he would rather be poor and in power than, you know, provide some more rights and norms and and and and maybe risk losing an election.

**Tracy Alloway**: 那个关于哥伦比亚油田的统计数据真是惊人。

### 马杜罗政权的权力基础

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我想尽快谈谈当前的挑战，但也许为了帮助我们理解，在这些年来的恶化过程中，无论是查韦斯后期还是马杜罗早期，是什么样的支持群体让他们在这些动荡中得以掌权？因为即使是最绝对的独裁者，在某种程度上也必须在某个强大的群体中拥有一定的信誉，某种能维持下去的东西，等等。请告诉我们，这个始于查韦斯的新国家发展轨迹的支持群体在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I want to get to the present tense soon and talk about the challenges. now, but maybe to help us understand, you know, through these years of deterioration, whether we're talking about the latter years of uh Chavez or the earlier years of Maduro, what was the constituency that allowed them to stay in power despite these disruptions? Because even the most absolute dictator anywhere to some extent has to have some credibility with some pocket that's powerful something that preserves I would I would think etc. Talk to us about where was the constituency for this new trajectory of the country that sort that started under Chavis.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 所以最初的支持群体非常庞大，但随着经济开始恶化，随着人们认为那个政权内部的机会越来越少，马杜罗不得不变得更加残暴。查韦斯非常受欢迎，他确实能够赢得选举。马杜罗无法真正赢得选举，所以他不得不变得越来越残暴。所以今天，你所看到的是极端的镇压。不仅是对公民社会的极端镇压，也是对军队的极端镇压。他们对军队极度不信任。他们有一个针对平民的秘密警察，叫做**Seavine**，还有一个针对军队的秘密警察，叫做**DGCIM**。DGCIM 关押了数百名军官。他们是委内瑞拉待遇最差的政治犯。他们被饿死，被折磨。他们深入渗透了军队中任何人的所有通讯。古巴人也深入参与其中。他们正在使用俄罗斯技术。所以他们试图阻止军队组织起来反对政府。所以军队并不是真正为了保卫国家而存在。这就是为什么1月3日的袭击如此轻而易举。军队在那里是为了被控制，这样它就不会脱离政府。所以这就是为什么在2024年7月28日的选举中，尽管他们不允许800万海外委内瑞拉人投票，尽管他们不允许300万年轻的委内瑞拉人首次登记选举，尽管他们不允许赢得初选的候选人**马丽亚·科丽娜·马查多 (Maria Corina Machado)** 参选，她任命了一个无人知晓的人。她举起了他的手，他以70%对30%的票数获胜。如果允许其他人投票，他会以85%对15%的票数获胜。现在，这是一个巨大的差距。即使是70%对30%，这也是你从未见过**特朗普 (Trump)** 赢得的差距。没有人能以这样的差距获胜。所以委内瑞拉存在着一个巨大的政治多数，渴望变革，并且有一个明确的政治领导层支持。所以委内瑞拉不是**伊拉克 (Iraq)**。委内瑞拉不是一个两极分化的国家。委内瑞拉是一个统一的国家。在那些选举中，反对派在所有24个州都赢了。他们在335个市中赢得了90%。这意味着委内瑞拉存在一个全国性的政治多数，希望走向不同的方向，但有一个小集团正在试图阻止它。这就是目前的局势。这也是我担心的地方，特朗普政府已经宣布他们希望通过间接控制那个小集团来统治，而委内瑞拉存在一个希望走向不同方向的巨大政治多数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: So initially the constituency was very large but as the economy started to deteriorate and as people thought that there was less and less opportunities within that regime Maluda had to get nastier. So Chavez was very you know liked if you want he was popular in in he could actually win elections. Maduro couldn't really win elections and so he had to get nastier and nastier. So today what you have is essentially extreme repression. Extreme repression not only on civil society but extreme repression on the military. They distrust the military to death. They have a secret police for civilians called Seavine and then there's a secret police for the military called theim. And the deim has hundreds of officers in jail. They are the worst treated political prisoners in Venezuela. They are starved. They are tortured. They have deeply penetrated all the communications of anybody in the army. The Cubans are deeply into it. They're using Russian technology. So that they're trying to prevent the army from organizing against the government. So the army is not really there to defend the country. That's why the attack on January 3rd was such a cakewalk. it's that uh you know the army was there to to be kind of controlled so that it it wouldn't um break from the government. So that's the it's it's really a that's why in the election of July 28th, 2024, in spite of the fact that they didn't let 8 million Venezuelans abroad vote, in spite of the fact that they did not let 3 million young Venezuelans register for the first time in the electoral roles, in spite of the fact that they did not let the candidate that won the primaries to run, Maria Corina Machado, she appointed somebody who nobody knew. She raised his hand and he won 7030. He would have won 8515 if if other people had been allowed to vote. Now that's a margin. Even 7030, that's a margin that you haven't seen Trump win. You know, chain bound nobody wins by those margins. So there is a huge political majority in Venezuela for change that has that is behind one clear political leadership. So Venezuela is not Iraq. Venezuela is not a polarized country. Venezuela is a unified country. In those elections, the opposition won in all 24 states. They won in 90% of the 335 municipalities. That means it's a national there's a political majority in Venezuela that wants to go in a different direction, but there's a small click that's trying to prevent it. And so that is the current situation. And that's my concern that the Trump administration has announced that they want to rule by indirectly by controlling that click when when there is a big political majority that wants to go in a different direction.

### 未来展望与政治转型

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这实际上是我的下一个问题。所以，现在我们来到了2026年1月。马杜罗已经下台。美国表示希望在委内瑞拉进行更多私人投资。所以，也许一些制裁问题会消失。但另一方面，代理总统直接来自马杜罗政权，而且似乎没有任何重大的政治或结构性变化。是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This was actually going to be my next question. So, we're now up to January 2026. Majuro is gone. The US says it wants more private investment in Venezuela. So, maybe, you know, some of the sanctions issues go away. But on the other hand, the acting president is straight out of the Maduro regime and it doesn't seem that you're having any significant political or structural change. Is that right?

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 嗯，很难确切解读特朗普对委内瑞拉的计划是什么。**马可·卢比奥 (Marco Rubio)** 曾谈到过三个阶段：首先是稳定，然后是复苏，最后是政治转型。我认为，我也一直主张，这种分阶段是错误的，因为如果不知道游戏规则是什么，不知道人们现在拥有什么权利，就很难实现真正的复苏。现在委内瑞拉的人们不敢说话，不敢做任何事情，因为他们仍然受到严重的骚扰，仅仅因为发了一条推文或发表了意见，或者为了向那些违抗命令的军官施压，他们甚至把年轻女孩关进监狱，要求他们自首。所以这是一个非常压迫的政权，而他们的想法是，是的，我们要对这个政权发号施令，尽管从根本上说，正是他们把经济带到了现在的境地。他们的想法是，我们现在要取消制裁，但摧毁委内瑞拉石油工业的不是制裁。而是2007年和2009年进行的征用。是2003年解雇所有石油工人。是他们为石油工业制定的规则。根据法律，石油工业的生产只能通过国家石油公司进行，或者与国家石油公司合资，且国家石油公司拥有51%的股份。国家石油公司已经破产了。它拖欠了所有债权人的债务。所以，如果它在美国的某个银行账户收到一些美元，美国的法院就会有判决冻结这些资产以支付债权人。所以没有人愿意与它合作。正是在这种背景下，特朗普说：“哦，我希望美国公司回来。”但是，法律不允许这些公司回来。如果你想修改法律，谁来修改法律？去年我们举行了被窃取的国民议会选举，美国不承认，拉丁美洲不承认，欧洲也不承认。现在没有合法的权力来修改碳氢化合物法。现在，官方汇率是300多，黑市汇率是400、500、600，甚至达到1000。所以，如果你要投资，你以什么汇率进入？你以什么汇率将利润转出？这就是埃克森总裁所说的，委内瑞拉是“不可投资的”。这只是对现实的描述。这个系统并非为独立于制裁的私人投资而设计。这才是需要改变的。但它需要通过一个拥有合法性来改变事物的政府来改变，一个被认为是反映人民意愿的政府，一个由人民决定采取何种行动的政府。我不认为任何认真的投资者会进入这样一个混乱的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: Well, it's very hard to read exactly what the Trump plan is for Venezuela. Marco Rubio had talked has talked about three phases. First stabilization, then recovery, and then eventually a political transition. I think and I have argued that it's the wrong phasing because there's going to be very little recovery unless you know what is the those rules of the game. What is what is the what are the rights that people have right now? People in Venezuela are afraid to speak, are afraid to to do anything because they're still being deeply harassed and put in jail for just, you know, tweeting something or for having an opinion or for, you know, they have put in jail young girls in order to pressure military officers that have say broke rank and they want them to to uh to turn themselves in. So it's a very oppressive regime and and the idea is that yes, we are going to give this regime orders of what to do even though at the heart they are the ones that brought the economy to where it is. And the idea is we're now going to eliminate sanctions, but it's not sanctions that destroyed the Venezuelan oil industry. It was the the expropriations that were done in 2007 and 2009. It was the firing of all the oil workers in 2003. It was the rules that they created for the oil industry. In the oil industry, according to the law, production can only happen through the national oil company or in joint ventures with the national where the national oil company has 51% of its shares. The national oil company is broke. It's in default with all its creditors. So if if it were to receive some dollars in some bank account in the US, you know, there are judgments in US courts that would freeze those assets to pay creditors. So nobody wants that as a partner. So it is in this context that you know Trump says, "Oh, I want US companies to go back." Well, the law doesn't allow for those companies to go back. And if you want to change the law, who's going to change the law? Well, we had stolen elections last year for the National Assembly that the US does not recognize, Latin America does not recognize, Europe does not recognize. There is no legitimate power to change the hydrocarbons law. Right now, you have a dollar the official rate of 300 and something and the black market rate is at 400, 500, 600, it reached a,000. So, if you are going to invest, at what exchange rate do you come in? At what exchange rate do you convert your profits back out? It's it's the what the president of Exxon said that Venezuela is uninvestable. It's just a description of reality. It's it's the in the the system was not designed for private investment independent of sanctions. And that's that's what needs to change. But it needs to change through a government that has legitimacy to change things that you know is perceived as being you know the the reflection of the will of the people that you know they are the ones who decided that you know what course of action to take. I don't think any serious investor is going to go in into such a messy situation.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我当然明白你的观点，你所说的听起来非常合乎逻辑，即在没有某种政治稳定之前，在没有某种信心认为这是新事物之前，你永远不会获得真正的资本投资，也肯定不会有那些离开的人才回流等等。但你如何才能做到这一点呢？我的意思是，显然制裁没有奏效，对吧？制裁对推翻马杜罗政权没有任何影响。没有派遣地面部队、美军等等的冲动。似乎没有人有这种意愿。那么，是否存在某种机制，即使特朗普政府想采纳你的建议，将政治稳定置于经济复苏之前，这种工具在实践中是否存在，以建立这种顺序？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I certainly take your point and it certainly sounds very logical what you say that you're never going to get real investment of capital. You're certainly not going to get the sort of uh perhaps remigration of talent that left and so forth until there's some sort of political stability, until there's some sort of confidence this is the new thing. But how do you do that functionally? I mean, clearly sanctions didn't work, right? Sanctions didn't have any effect on removing uh the Maduro regime. there's not an impulse to put boots on the ground, American troops and so forth. It doesn't seem like there's any appetite. So, is there some mechanism in which the Trump administration even if it wanted to take your advice and put political stability before economic revival? Does does the tool exist practically to establish that sequence?

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 我认为它确实存在，而且我认为你可能会在未来几天和几周内看到他们朝着这个方向发展。我认为重要的是他们要听取这样一个事实：他们并没有痴迷于不犯美国在**伊拉克**犯下的错误。

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 但伊拉克与委内瑞拉毫无关系。伊拉克是一个可以追溯到美索不达米亚的5000年历史的国家，在这5000年里，直到**萨达姆·侯赛因 (Saddam Hussein)** 之前，从未有过选举。从未有过政党。而委内瑞拉是民主国家。我们有政党。我们不是在100年前举行选举的。在2024年，我们能够确保那些选举的结果，因为我们有全国60万人监督和保护反对派的选票。那里有一个政治组织，一个多数政治组织。所以你现在需要做的是告诉军队，我们不会像他们在伊拉克解雇所有军队那样解雇你们。你告诉官僚机构，我们不会像你们在伊拉克解雇所有官僚机构那样解雇你们。每个人都会有他们的工资。每个人都会有他们的养老金，对吧？但他们将受到文官控制。如果你告诉他们，他们已经看到了马杜罗的下场，他们非常清楚，**苏莱曼尼待遇 (Suleimani treatment)** 要便宜得多，对吧？你不需要派遣特种部队到地面去抓捕某人，苏莱曼尼待遇，你只需要发射一些导弹，不需要地面部队。所以你可以施加压力，说：“听着，伙计们，让我们为选举制定一个时间表。让我们定义一个可信的选举委员会，在国际监督下监督这些选举。让我们确定这些选举的日期。让我们开放选民登记，让年轻人和海外侨民能够登记，我们在某个日期举行选举。顺便说一句，你们必须释放所有政治犯。你们必须允许海外侨民回来，你们必须允许新闻自由。否则，你们就会得到苏莱曼尼待遇。”我告诉你，如果你做了这些事情，社会会怎么做？他们会想参与这些选举，为这些选举组织起来，开始思考未来，并相信未来是可能的，因为将有一个致力于市场经济的民主政府，而不是一个受到美国袭击威胁并被美国权力控制现金流的社会主义政府。所以，这将是一个更好的局面，可以恢复经济，实现社会和平，并让委内瑞拉再次繁荣起来。

**Ricardo Hausmann**: but Iraq has nothing to do with Venezuela Iraq is you know a country that goes back to Mesopotamia was 5,000 years old in those 5,000 years until Saddam Hussein, there had never been an election. There had never been political parties. In Venezuela was democracy. We have political parties. We ran an election not a 100red years ago. In 2024, we were able to secure the results of those elections because we had 600,000 people across the whole country supervising and protecting the votes for for the opposition. You have a political organization, a majority political organization there. So what you need to do right now is to say is to tell the army, we're not going to fire you the way they fired all the army in Iraq. You tell the bureaucracy, we're not going to fire the way you fired all the the bureaucracy in Iraq. Everybody's going to have their their their salaries. Everybody's going to have their pensions, right? But they are going to be be under civilian control. And if you know you you tell them you know you you they they have already seen what happened to Maluro they are very clear that it's much cheaper a treatment alas moneyi right you don't have to put the special forces on the ground to extract somebody you know alasle money you just send some missiles and no boots on the ground so there pressure you can put to say listen guys let's define uh uh a timetable for elections. Let's define a credible electoral council to supervise those elections with international supervision. Let's have a date for those elections. Let's open up the roles so that young people can register and diaspora can register and we [snorts] have an election on a certain date. And by the way, you have to free all the political prisoners. You have to allow the diaspora to go back and you have to allow a free press. Otherwise, you get the sullemani treatment. And I tell you that if you do those things, what is society going to do? They're going to want to participate in those elections, to organize for those elections, to start thinking about the future, and to have the credibility that the future is going to be possible because there will be a democratic government committed to a market economy, not a not a socialist government under threat of American attack and with a cash flow control by the American power. So that is a much better situation in which to recover the economy, to achieve social peace and to have uh Venezuela become prosperous again.

**Tracy Alloway**: 你能在这里建立某种混合结构吗？委内瑞拉保留社会主义的一些方面，但也尝试重新引入你一直在谈论的市场信号？

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 首先，我不太明白“混合”的逻辑。你的意思是，当特朗普赢得选举时，你会说为什么不搞一个混合体？为什么需要一个混合体？委内瑞拉存在一个支持一个方向的多数政治意见，如果因为某种原因必须逐步进行，那就让他们自己解决。这不是一个失败了，而且是灾难性失败的东西。没有其他灾难性的失败可以与委内瑞拉经济的崩溃相提并论。人们渴望改变。有一个不起作用的国家。顺便说一句，委内瑞拉将拥有免费教育、免费医疗和许多免费的东西，因为这就像是它的DNA。它一直是共识，按照美国的标准，相对自由。

**Ricardo Hausmann**: First of all, I don't understand exactly the logic of a hybrid.

People want change. There's a state that is not working. By the way, Venezuela is going to have a free education, free healthcare, free many things because that's kind of like in the DNA.

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，没错。所以问题不是社会主义，不是社会主义。问题是个人权利、自由、财产权、新闻自由。这些是基本的东西，因为这些东西将个人转变为自己命运的主宰者。这就是你获得投资的方式。这就是你让经济运转起来的方式。如果海外的委内瑞拉人不觉得这是一个他们可以自由安全生活的地方，那么这个国家的人力资本已经离开了，它不会想回来。但如果你告诉他们，看，在一个自由的地方，在一个希望恢复权利的政府下，复苏正在到来。委内瑞拉一直是一个移民国家，而不是一个移民流出国家。它一直是一个吸引各地人民的国家。所以我告诉你，这种转型可以迅速完成，而且没有冲突，如果对那个控制政府的小集团施加足够的压力。这就是为什么他们得不到选票。这就是为什么即使在军事基地的投票中心，政府也以70%对30%的票数输了，尽管它进行了镇压。所以，让委内瑞拉的多数人，这是伊拉克和其他地方都不存在的。这是一个经历了灾难并从灾难中吸取教训的社会。它已经弄清楚了什么不起作用，以及它希望继续采取什么行动方针。

Those are the basic things because those things convert individuals into agents of their own destiny. And that's how you get investment. That's how you get the economy going. If if if the Venezuelans abroad don't feel that it's a it's a place where they can live in freedom safely, the human capital of the country has left. It won't want to come back. But if you tell them, look, recovery is coming in a free place with a government that that wants a restitution of rights. Venezuelans have has always been a country of immigration, not out migration. It's a country that that has been a a source of attraction of people everywhere. So that transition I tell you that transition can be done quickly and without conflict if enough pressure is put on the click that has sequester the government. That's why they can't get votes. That's why they look even in the voting centers in military bases the government lost 70 to30 is in spite of it its repression. So let let the majority of Venezuela something that did not exist in Iraq it did not exist elsewhere. It's a society that has undergone a catastrophe and has [clears throat] learned from that catastrophe. it has figured out what doesn't work and what course of action it wants to continue.

### 关于干预与主权的讨论

**Joe Weisenthal**: 所以我想说我完全同意你的观点，正如你所说，在你看来，委内瑞拉不是一个两极分化的社会。存在共识。国内外委内瑞拉人都认为需要进行重大的政治变革。我当然也高度直观地认同你的观点，即在政治变革发生之前，你不会获得资本或人才的涌入。另一方面，你知道，当美国绑架国家元首时，这是一个令人震惊的事件转折，我想我们都在1月3日醒来时感到震惊。你谈到，你知道，你说的**苏莱曼尼待遇**，所以那就是暗杀，你认为这应该是对那个小集团的威胁。你是否认为这本质上会引发某种，我不知道是否一定是现有政权的防御，但会引发对主权的防御，即这个其他国家在做什么，绑架我们的国家元首？这个其他国家在做什么，威胁要暗杀我们政府的领导人？这是我们的政府等等。你难道没有看到，或者我是否完全错了，谈论那里的反弹风险以及当另一个国家如此积极地控制一个政府时，人们会团结在国旗和主权周围的冲动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So I want to say I take your point absolutely that there that as you put it very well Venezuela in your view is not a polarized society. There is a consensus. There is a view both domestically and Venezuelans abroad that there needs to be major political change. And I certainly take your point uh highly intuitive that you're not going to get the influx of capital or talent until that political change takes place. On the other hand, you [snorts] know, when you when the US just kidnapped the head of state, which is a shocking turn of events, I think we're all shocked the day that we woke up on January 3rd. And you're talking about, you know, you say the Sulammani treatment, so that is assassination that you're saying should be would be the threat against the click. Do you see possibility that you essentially engender a sort of I don't know about a necessarily defense of the existing regime but a defense of sovereignty that what is this other country doing kidnapping our head of state? What is this other country doing threatening to assassinate the people who run our government? This is our government etc. Do you not see or am I is it completely off the mark to talk about risk of backlash there and the impulse to rally around the flag and sovereignty when another country is being this aggressive about controlling a government?

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 我认为这就是叙事的重要性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: I think that's why narratives matter.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay.

</details>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: 我个人不太喜欢特朗普有时使用的叙事。关于美国在二战中进入欧洲的叙事是“我们来解放，而不是征服”。好的，这就是这个想法。我们来解放，而不是征服。今天在委内瑞拉，特朗普非常受欢迎。摆脱马杜罗非常受欢迎。为什么？因为人们认为我们已经被**古巴 (Cuba)** 人接管了。你在1月3日的袭击中看到了，古巴宣布其32名成员被杀，因为那是马杜罗身边的安全机构。马杜罗不依靠委内瑞拉人来保障他的安全。他依靠古巴人来保障他的安全，因为他不信任委内瑞拉人。所以人们认为我们是古巴的殖民地，如果你愿意的话。我们是外国利益的殖民地，现在我们想夺回我们的自由。所以，我希望美国坚持的叙事是“我们来解放，而不是征服”。我们来重建你们的自由。如果自由得到重建，委内瑞拉人自然会成为美国的好伙伴，就像他们历史上一直以来那样。特朗普在委内瑞拉受欢迎的事实是对查韦斯主义的谴责。这些家伙是多么灾难性的，他们与那些与我们无关的外国势力结盟。你知道，他们与古巴结盟，他们与**俄罗斯 (Russia)** 结盟，他们与**伊朗 (Iran)** 结盟，他们与**白俄罗斯 (Belarus)** 结盟。所以，正是这种没有国内政治基础的政府被威胁要被赶走。这就是为什么我认为这使得转型变得如此容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ricardo Hausmann**: And I don't particularly like the narrative that sometimes Trump uses. The narrative about the US getting into Europe in the Second World War was we came to liberate not to conquer. Okay, that's the idea. We came to liberate not to conquer. Today in Venezuela, Trump is very popular. Getting rid of Maduro is super popular. Why? Because the perception is that we had been taken over by Cubans. You saw that in the attack on January 3rd, Cuba announced that 32 of its members were killed because that was the security apparatus around Maduro. Maduro didn't rely on Venezuelans for his security. He relied on Cubans for his security because he doesn't trust Venezuelans. So the perception was that we were a colony of Cuba if you want. We were a colony of foreign interests and now we want to get back to our freedom. So the the narrative I would want the US to stick to [snorts] is we came to liberate not to conquer. We came to reestablish your freedom. And if freedom gets reestablished, Venezuelans will naturally be good partners of the US as they had historically been. The fact that Trump is popular in Venezuela is an ind is is a condemnation of Chavismo. It's how disastrous these guys have been, how aligned with foreign powers that have nothing to do with with us. You know, they're aligned with Cuba, they're aligned with Russia, they're aligned with [music] Iran, they're aligned with Bellarus. So, it's it's that kind of government that has taken over with no domestic political base that is being threatened to be kicked out. And that's why I think it it makes the transition so much easier.

### 总结与反思

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy，这是一次引人入胜的对话，来自一位我认为拥有无与伦比视角的嘉宾。这是一个绝佳的视角，来自一位既在政府任职过，又将经济学家作为职业的人，他本质上谈论了这些人力资本问题，这些问题肯定会在很长一段时间内困扰委内瑞拉，无论政治局势如何发展。你知道，我想到 Ricardo 就会想到猴子在树上荡来荡去，以及他描述国家如何发展新产业，以及一个领域如何能引领到一个新的、技术更先进的领域。但无论如何，这次对话中有一件事让我印象深刻，那就是对制度和结构性衰退的强调，而不是像制裁这样的外部因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy, that was a fascinating conversation from someone who I guess I would say has an unmatched perspective right there. That is a uh an excellent view to get from someone who has both served in government but also has made it his career as an economist to talk essentially about some of these human capital problems that will certainly beset Venezuela for a very long time regardless of how the political situation unfolds. You know, I can't think of Ricardo without thinking about monkeys swinging from trees um and his description of how countries actually develop new industries and how one area can lead into a new more technologically advanced area. But anyway, one thing stuck out from that conversation for me, which is, you know, the emphasis on institutional and structural decline versus the external factors like the sanctions.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。在我看来，这使得当前环境下的问题更加困难，对吧？因为，美国对委内瑞拉的介入，我甚至不知道现在该如何形容，这可能意味着美元短缺不会像过去那样严重，制裁可能会取消，诸如此类。但如果主要问题是制度衰退，而代理总统仍然来自马杜罗政权，那似乎是一个更难解决的问题。顺便说一句，你最后一个问题是关于美国介入是否可能让委内瑞拉人团结在一个民族主义政权周围。现在有一条新闻标题说：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. And it seems to me that that makes it more difficult in in the current environment, right? Because again, US involvement in Venezuela, I don't even know how to describe it nowadays, would suggest that maybe dollar shortages aren't going to be as much of a thing as they were in the past, maybe sanctions go away, stuff like that. But if the major problem is that institutional decay and the uh acting president is still in still from the Maduro regime, that seems a much harder problem to solve. By the way, your last question about whether or not US involvement maybe like coaleses Venezuelans um around a sort of nationalist regime. Uh there's a headline out right now saying that

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 委内瑞拉代理总统表示她受够了美国的命令。所以，你知道，你会看到一些这样的迹象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Venezuela's acting president says she's had enough of US orders. So, you know, you get kind of like a a glimmer of it.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这看起来非常艰难。谈到苏莱曼尼待遇，那是暗杀的委婉说法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It seems very tough. And to talk about the Sulammani treatment, there's a euphemism for assassination of

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我甚至不确定那是不是委婉说法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I'm not even sure it's a euphemism.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 它甚至不是，它根本不是委婉说法。听着，我当然同意这个观点，即先实现经济稳定，然后再实现政治稳定的想法可能根本不可能。我认为 **Hausmann** 教授在阐述人力资本的现实方面做得非常出色，以及这种想法，你知道，这不仅仅是一些模糊的东西，哦，我们想要有才华的人回来，以及关于哥伦比亚油田的那个统计数据，非常了不起，但也有一些法律方面的原因，说明为什么目前的系统不是为跨国石油公司重返该国而设计的。但另一方面，我的意思是，制裁多年来未能赶走马杜罗。我们对古巴实施制裁多久了？它们不起作用。即使你比另一个国家强大得多，想要获得你想要的政府也绝非易事，在我们能想到的几乎所有例子中都是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It's not even It's not even a euphemism at all. Look, I certainly take the point though that this idea of let's get the economic stabilization done first and then the political stabilization that might simply be impossible. And I thought Professor Houseman did a great job of laying out the sort of the reality of human capital and the idea that, you know, this is not just some vague thing, oh, we want talented people back and that stat about the Colombian oil field, very remarkable, but then also some of the legal aspects of why the system is not designed as it currently is for multinational oil companies to come back into the country. But on the other hand, I mean, again, sanctions didn't work for years to get Maduro out. We've had sanctions against Cuba for how long? They don't work. Like getting the government you want, even if you're much more powerful than the other country, is far from a trivial exercise in almost every example that we can think of.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Absolutely.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，我也在回想我们和嘉吉员工做的那一集，以及这个想法，也许如果有足够的私人投资者，跨国公司联合起来说，你知道，我们对委内瑞拉感兴趣，但我们需要看到以下变化。也许这可以作为某种催化剂来加强法治，但这是一种先有鸡还是先有蛋的情况，对吧？因为这些公司需要被激励。他们需要想进入委内瑞拉，才能倡导那些能让他们进入委内瑞拉的条件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, I'm also thinking back to again that episode that we did um with the Cargill employee and this idea that well maybe maybe if you have enough private investors, multinationals that come together and say, you know, we are interested in Venezuela, but we need to see the following changes. Maybe that acts as some sort of catalyst to strengthen up the rule of law, but it's a sort of chicken and egg situation, right? because those companies need to be incentivized. They need to want to come in to Venezuela. In order to advocate for like the conditions that would make it possible for them to enter Venezuela.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我想知道**阿萨德 (Assad)** 在莫斯科住的公寓楼里有多少空房。问题是，有多少人需要被承诺在莫斯科一个漂亮的封闭式高层公寓里享受非常舒适的退休生活，他们才会说：“好吧，我们就简单点来吧。”我很好奇这个数字会是多少，以及这种转变有多少容量。这听起来可能是一个解决方案，但我不知道这是否真的在考虑之列。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I wonder how much vacancy there is at the uh apartment complex where Assad is living in Moscow. Like the question is like how many people need to be promised a very cushy retirement in a nice gated Moscow high-rise for them to say, "Okay, we're just we'll just do this the easy way." I'm curious like what the what the number would be and how much uh capacity there is for that movement. That would be the sounds like it could be a solution, but I don't know if that's really on the table.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那会是一个有趣的统计数据。我认为你短期内不会得到它，但无论如何，我们就到此为止吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That would be an interesting statistic. I don't think you're going to get it anytime soon, but anyway, shall we leave it there?
