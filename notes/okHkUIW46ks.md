### 学习的两个阶段：摄入与消化

在本视频中，我将教你一套用于记住你所阅读、学习或钻研的一切内容的系统。这套系统我已经使用了七年，从医学院学习疾病病理生理学开始，一直到阅读研究论文、学习科学知识，或是阅读关于生产力和商业的书籍。这套系统之所以能如此持续且有效地发挥作用，是因为它将阅读过程分解为两个截然不同的阶段：第一阶段是**摄入期**（Consumption Period），第二阶段是**消化期**（Digestion Period）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

in this video I'll teach you a system for remembering everything you read study or learn I've been using the system for the last 7 years starting from learning disease pathophysiology in medical school through to reading research articles and learning science or reading books on productivity or business and the reason the system works so consistently and so well is because it breaks down that process of reading into two distinct stages the first stage is the consumption period and the second stage is the digestion period

</details>

大多数人认为，通过专注于第一阶段并摄入更多信息，他们就能记住并应用更多信息。所以他们专注于尝试读得更快，或者以三倍速观看讲座，或者疯狂收听有声读物，或者观看数小时的 YouTube 教程。但这并不是学习的运作方式。一旦我们理解了学习是如何运作的，你就会明白为什么我的系统如此有效。你看，当涉及到记忆和应用信息时，关键不在于有多少信息进入你的大脑，而在于有多少信息**留在了你的大脑中**。这就是第二阶段——消化期——的核心所在，而这正是经常被忽视的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

most people think that by focusing on the first stage and consuming more information they'll be able to therefore remember and apply more information so they focus on trying to read faster or watching lectures at triple speed or binge listening to audio books or watching hours of YouTube tutorials but that is not how learning works and once we understand how learning does work you'll see why my system is so effective you see when it comes to remembering and applying information it's much less about what comes in to your brain and it's much more about how much stays in your brain and that is what the second stage the digestion period is all about and it's the part that is often neglected

</details>

### 记忆的目标：应用而非单纯存储

所以，我要教你一套掌握这两个阶段的系统，这反过来会提高你的记忆留存率，以及你以所需方式实际使用知识的能力。但首先我们需要问自己：记住你读过的所有东西甚至可能吗？简短的回答是：不可能。但这里的秘密在于：试图记住我们读过的所有东西，从一开始就不应该是我们的目标。我们知道这一点是因为有一个人实际上能记住所有东西，这个人的名字叫 **Kim Peek**，他的故事如此疯狂，以至于好莱坞专门为他拍了一部电影（注：电影《雨人》的原型）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so teach you a system for mastering both of these stages which in turn increases your Aurora retention as well as your ability to actually use the knowledge in the way that you need to but first we need to ask ourselves is it even possible to remember everything you read and the short answer is no but here's the secret trying to remember everything we read should not be the goal in the first place and we know this because of a man who actually could remember everything this man's name is Kim Peak and his story is so crazy that Hollywood made an entire movie about him

</details>

Kim Peek 是一位超级天才，他的记忆力简直荒谬。他能以如此完美的召回率背诵一本书，以至于读过一遍后，他就能逐字逐句地写出来，包括每一个逗号和句号，甚至能倒背如流。他记住了如此多的地图和地图集，以至于他能给你提供世界上任意两个城市之间的驾驶路线，而且他给出的路径是经过心理计算的最短距离。Kim 拥有这种超自然能力的原因是他患有一种非常罕见的疾病，叫做 **FG 综合征**（FG syndrome）。他出生时患有巨脑畸形（Macrocephaly），这意味着他的大脑比常人更大，而且他没有**胼胝体**（Corpus Callosum: 连接大脑左右半球的神经纤维束）。科学家认为，因为他没有正常的神经元模式，他的大脑进行了适应并发展出了新的连接来补偿，我想这赋予了他超人的记忆力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Kim Peak was a mega genius and his memory was ridiculous he was able to memorize a book with such perfect recall that after reading a book one time he would be able to write it out word for word with every comma and full stop back to front he memorized so many maps and atlases that he could give you driving directions between any two cities in the world and the path that he gave you was mentally calculated to be the shortest distance now the reason K had such supernatural abilities is because of a very rare medical condition he had called FG syndrome he was born with macroy which means he had a larger brain and he had no Corpus colossum which is basically the bundle of neurons that connect both hemispheres of the brain together in scientists believe that because he didn't have the normal pattern of neurons his brain adapted and developed Ved new connections to compensate which I guess gave him like superhuman memory

</details>

现在我想让你想象一下，如果你和 Kim Peek 都要参加同一场考试，你认为谁会考得更好？答案是，这实际上取决于考试的内容。你看，尽管 Kim Peek 拥有超人的记忆力，但他难以进行推理和解决问题。这意味着，如果考试是处于学校教育的初级阶段，通常测试的是较低层次的学习，涉及大量的死记硬背和回忆，那么 Kim Peek 肯定会赢。但如果考试是在更高层次，比如大学或研究生阶段，推理和解决问题——即更高阶的学习——被作为更高的优先级来考察，那么你实际上可能更有优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

now I want you to imagine that both you and Kim Peak were about to sit the same exam who do you think would do better and the answer is that it actually depends on the exam you see despite his superhuman memory Kim Peak struggled with reasoning and problem solving which means that if the exam was at the junior levels of schooling which often tests on the lower levels of of learning which involve a lot of memorization and recall then Kim Peak would definitely win but if the exam was at a higher level like University or postgraduate where the reasoning and problem solving the higher orders of learning are examined as a higher priority then you may actually have the edge

</details>

对于大多数听众来说，利用你所摄入的知识进行推理和解决问题，这本身就是你试图阅读和记忆的全部意义所在。这基本上意味着，仅仅记住一切是不够的——这很好，因为对大多数人来说这本来就不可能。但是，记住你需要记住的一切，并以一种能让我们按需使用这些知识的方式来记忆，这是可能的。这就是我将教你的系统能帮助你实现的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

now for most of you listening probably using the knowledge you have consumed to reason and problem solve is kind of the whole point of why you're trying to read and remember in the first place which basically means that it is not enough to remember everything which is good because for most people that's not possible anyway but it is possible to remember everything you need to remember in such a way that we can use that knowledge in the way we need to and that is what the system that I'll teach you helps you to achieve

</details>

### PACER 系统：信息分类法

要开始使用这个系统，我们必须明白并非所有信息都是平等的。事实上，我使用首字母缩略词 **PACER** 将我阅读的信息分为五个不同的类别。能够识别你正在阅读的信息属于哪个类别非常重要，因为对于每个类别，都有特定的针对性流程来帮助你更有效地处理和管理这些信息。当我们对特定类别的信息使用了错误的流程时，记忆和理解你所读的内容就会变得更难、更耗时且效果更差，你也更有可能忘记你读过的内容。这也会增加你进入被动阅读模式的几率，即你读到页面底部却甚至不记得刚刚读了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so to start using the system we have to understand that not all information is equal in fact I break down the information that I read into five different categories using the acronym Pacer and it's important to be able to identify which category the information you're reading to belongs to because for each category there are specific targeted processes that then help you to deal with and manage that information more effectively and when we use the wrong process for the specific category of information it makes remembering and understanding what you read much harder much more timec consuming and much less effective and that you're more likely to forget what you read it also increases the chance of you entering the passive mode of reading which is where you get to the bottom of a page and you can't even remember what you just read

</details>

这个系统的运作方式是这样的：在第一阶段，即我们在摄入信息时，我们要使用 PACER 这个缩略词来识别我们正在摄入的内容属于哪个类别。然后，在第二阶段，我们使用针对该类别的特定流程来消化我们所读的内容，通过称为**编码**（Encoding）的过程将信息存储在我们的长期记忆中。那么让我们一起过一遍 PACER，这样你就能准确识别你试图记忆的信息类别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so the system goes like this in the first part where we are consuming information we want to identify which category what we are consuming belongs to using the Pacer acronym then during stage two we digest what we have read using the targeted process for that category which takes the information and stores it in our long-term memory through the process called encoding so let's go through Pacer together so that you can accurately identify the category of information you're trying to remember

</details>

### P - 程序性信息 (Procedural)

PACER 中的 P 代表 **程序性**（Procedural）。程序性信息是任何告诉你某事应该如何执行的信息。例如，这是我在医学院使用的一本书，它教我如何进行临床检查，比如听心跳或测量某人的血压。这本书中的很多信息都是关于执行检查的正确技术的。有些学科和领域包含大量的程序性信息，这方面很好的例子是编程和语言学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the p and Pacer stands for procedural and procedural information is any information that tells you how something should be executed for example this is a book that I used during medical school that taught me about how to do a clinical examination like listen to a heartbeat or take someone's blood pressure and a lot of the information in this book is about the correct technique to perform the examination and some subjects and domains have a lot of procedural information some great examples of this would be coding and languages

</details>

处理和掌握这种程序性信息的针对性流程是**实践**（Practice）。关键在于你要尽可能早地在现实生活中应用程序性信息。很多人会花时间阅读它、背诵它、写很多关于它的笔记，然后一两周后他们才尝试去练习它。但到那时已经太晚了，我们已经忘记了很多，那些时间大部分都被浪费了。相反，一旦你将那些程序性信息摄入大脑，就要尽可能早地尝试应用和练习它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the targeted process for working with with and mastering this type of procedural information is practice the key is that you want to apply procedural information in real life as early as possible a lot of people will spend time to read it and memorize it and write lots of notes about it and then a week or two later they'll try to practice it but by then it's too late we've already forgotten a lot of it and a lot of that time is just wasted instead as soon as you take that procedural information into your brain try to apply it and practice it as early as you can

</details>

### 学习的平衡：避免“精神暴食”

现在我们立刻遇到了使用这种方法的一个问题：如果我们正在阅读某些东西，但现在没有时间去练习它怎么办？答案是，你要么转到其他内容，要么停止摄入任何东西，等到你有时间练习它为止。但你不要浪费时间试图当场死记硬背，因为这是每个人都忽视的学习的关键部分：摄入和消化这两个阶段必须始终保持**平衡**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

now straight away we run into a problem with using this approach what if we're reading something and we don't have time to practice it right now the answer is you either move on to something else or you stop consuming anything and you wait until you have time to practice it but you do not waste your time trying to just memor memorize it on the spot because here is the crucial part about learning that everyone overlooks the two stages of consuming and digesting must always be balanced

</details>

你摄入的一切都必须经过消化，以便你能保留和使用它。只有当第一阶段之后紧跟着第二阶段时，学习才会真正发生。如果我们正在阅读某些东西，而我们没有时间使用正确的流程（比如实践），那么大多数人会说：“哦，好吧，我现在没时间，我就尽量多读一点。”于是他们花更多时间阅读再阅读，本质上只是摄入得越来越多。但这在学习上等同于暴饮暴食。他们没有机会消化它，所以他们最终会通过我们称为“遗忘”的精神呕吐过程将其全部吐出来。这就是为什么对大多数人来说，阅读后的遗忘量极高，一些研究表明，尽管花费数小时摄入，高达 **90%** 的摄入内容会被遗忘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

everything you consume must be digested in order for you to retain and use it only when stage one is followed by stage two does learning actually occur if we're reading something and we don't have time time to use the right process like practice then most people will say oh well I don't have time right now I'm just going to get through as much of it as I can and they spend more time reading and reading and essentially just consuming more and more but this is the learning equivalent of overeating they haven't had a chance to digest it so they're just going to end up vomiting it all up again through the mental vomiting process we call forgetting which is why for most people the amount that they forget after reading is extremely high with some studies suggesting that up to 90% of what is consumed is forgotten despite hours of consuming

</details>

如果我们忘记了 90% 的阅读内容，那么与其摄入更多并占用消化的时间，实际上花更少的时间摄入、更多的时间消化和处理更有意义。这会提高你的记忆留存率，从而增加你能建立的工作知识量。所以早些时候我说过，进入你大脑的内容不如留在你大脑中的内容重要。平衡第一阶段（摄入）与第二阶段（消化）的原则不仅对程序性信息重要，对 PACER 的每一个其他类别都很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

and if we're forgetting 90% of what we read rather than consuming more and taking time away from the digesting it actually makes more sense to spend less time consuming and more time on the digesting and processing this increases your retention with which therefore increases the amount of working knowledge you're able to build so earlier I said what goes into your brain is less important than what stays in your brain and this principle of balancing stage one consuming with stage two digesting is important not just for procedural information but for every other category of PESA

</details>

### A - 类比性信息 (Analogous)

不幸的是，对于 PACER 中的第二个类别，第二阶段的消化几乎完全被忽视了。PACER 中的 A 代表 **类比性**（Analogous）。类比性信息实际上是最容易处理、记忆和应用的信息类型之一，因为类比性信息是与你已经拥有先验知识的事物相关的信息。即使我们没有直接的先验知识，它也可能间接地让我们想起我们确实了解的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

unfortunately stage two digesting is almost completely neglected for the second category of in the a of Pacer which stands for analogous analogous information is actually one of the easiest types of information to work with and remember and apply because analogous information is the information that is related to something you already have prior knowledge about and even if we don't have direct prior knowledge about it it may remind us indirectly of something that we do have knowledge about

</details>

例如，假设我们是一个狂热的游泳者，我们正在学习肌肉收缩的生理学。当我们看到那个肌肉收缩循环时，我们可能会想：“嘿，这让我想起了很多我使用的游泳技巧。”通过将关于肌肉收缩生理学的新信息与我们已经知道的（我们的游泳技巧）联系起来，我们就创造了一个**类比**。这就是类比性信息。类比可以与任何先验知识形成，包括主题内部的知识。在大多数研究领域中，有些概念或概念模式和关系往往会在该领域中重复出现。你可能上学期学过如何解决某种特定类型的问题，而现在这学期你第一次学习的这种新解题方法让你想起了很多那个旧的解题过程。将这两种方法联系起来也是一种类比。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

for example let's say that we are an avid swimmer and we're learning about the physiology of a muscle contraction when we look at that muscle contraction cycle we might think hey that reminds me a lot about the swimming technique I use and by connecting the new information about muscle contraction physiology with what we already know our swimming technique we have created an analogy and so that is analogous information and analogies can form with any prior knowledge including knowledge within a topic itself in most fields of study there are Concepts or patterns of Concepts and relationships that tend to repeat and recur throughout that field you might have learned about how to solve a particular type of problem last semester and now this semester this new problem solving approach that you're learning for the first time reminds you a lot of that old problem solving process and relating those two approaches is also an analogy

</details>

所以当我们进行第一阶段（阅读的摄入期）时，我们要积极思考我们正在阅读的内容是否与我们已经掌握知识的某些东西相关。一旦我们将其识别为潜在的类比性信息，我们要使用的针对性流程是**批判**（Critique）。这就是我说每个人都错过的部分。一旦我们创建了一个类比，批判它意味着我们要批判性地检查那个类比实际上有多好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so when we're engaging in stage one the consumption period of reading we want to actively be thinking about whether what we are reading is related to something that we already have knowledge about and once we identify it as potentially analogous information the targeted process we want to use here is critique this is the part I said everyone misses once we create an analogy critiquing it means we examine critically how good that analogy actually is

</details>

例如，对于肌肉收缩和游泳技巧的类比，批判那个类比意味着问我们自己：这两件事具体在哪些方面彼此相似或相关？它们在哪些方面不同？在什么情况下这个类比不再有意义？如果有很多差异，或者有很多条件和情况下类比会破裂，那么有没有更好的类比？或者我们能否扩展或修改那个类比，使其更全面、更准确？这个批判过程极大地提高了我们对新信息的关注度和理解深度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

for example with the analogy of muscle contraction and swimming technique critiquing that analogy means asking ourselves in what way specifically are these two things similar or related to each other in what ways are they different in what situation does this analogy not make sense anymore and if there are a lot of differences or a lot of conditions and situations where the analogy breaks apart then is there a better analogy or can we extend or modify that analogy to make it more comprehensive and more accurate this critiquing process massively drives up our attention and depth of understanding of this new information

</details>

这之所以有效，是因为新信息不再只是你大脑不知道该如何处理的新信息，我们实际上是在从我们已知的基础上扩展它。我们将现有的网络直接连接到新信息上，这就是为什么在研究中反复显示创造类比对我们的记忆留存和理解如此强大的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

and the reason this works is because instead of new information just being new information that your brain doesn't know what to do with we're actually extending it from what we already know we're taking our existing Network and connecting it to the new information straight away which is the reason why creating analogies has been shown in studies repeatedly to be so powerful for our retention and understanding

</details>

### C - 概念性信息 (Conceptual)

PACER 中的 C 代表 **概念性**（Conceptual）。如果程序性信息是“如何做某事”，那么概念性信息就是“是什么”。对于大多数科学学科来说，你需要学习的大部分内容都是概念性的。概念性信息包括事实和解释、理论和原则、概念之间的关系以及该概念的应用方式。在大多数情况下，我们需要程序性和概念性知识来解决问题并正确应用我们的知识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the C of Paca and this stands for conceptual if procedural information is the how to do something then conceptual information is the what and for most science subjects the majority of what you need to learn is conceptual conceptual information includes facts and explanations theories and principles relationships between Concepts and ways that that concept can be applied and in most cases we need both the procedural and the conceptual knowledge to solve a problem and apply our knowledge properly

</details>

当我们识别出我们正在阅读的一段文本是概念性信息时，我们要立即使用的流程是**映射**（Mapping）。非线性、基于网络的笔记方法，如**思维导图**（Mind Mapping），是提高你对概念性知识的关注度和掌握程度的有效方法，因为概念性知识本质上是以网络形式存在的。虽然教科书或讲座可能是以线性格式逐字逐句地传达的，但如果我们看看写那本教科书的人的头脑和知识，它并不存在于线性的逐句结构中。他们的知识和专业技能存在于一个高度连接的信息网络中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so when we identify that a piece of text we're reading is conceptual type information the process we want to use straight away is mapping nonlinear network based note taking such as mind mapping is an efficient way of increasing your attention and Mastery of conceptual knowledge because conceptual knowledge inherently exists in a network although a textbook or a lecture might be delivered word after word in a linear format if we look at the mind and knowledge of the person that wrote that textbook it doesn't exist in a linear sentence by sentence structure their knowledge and expertise exists in a highly connected network of information

</details>

不存在天生的信息序列。专家可以从任何一点开始并导航到任何其他点。这使得专家能够进行复杂的问题解决，因为他们可以审视一个问题，理解哪些概念是相关的，并看到这些概念如何连接在一起以解决问题。而只在表面水平学习的初学者只看到孤立的、分离的概念，他们不理解它们是如何链接在一起的。作为学习者，我们的工作不是逐字逐句地记住序列，我们的工作是尝试重建专家拥有的那个知识网络。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

there is no innate sequence of information an expert can start at any point and navigate to any other point this is what allows an expert to do complex problem solving because they can look at a problem understand what concepts are related and see how those Concepts connect together to solve the problem whereas a beginner who's only learned it at a surface level just sees individual separated Concepts and they don't understand how they link together as a learner our job is not to remember the sequence word for word our job is to try to recreate that network of knowledge that the expert had

</details>

映射是一种极好的技术，因为它迫使我们不仅思考每个事实和概念，还要思考它们如何相互连接以形成更大的图景。所以当你阅读和摄入时，花点时间拿出一张纸或平板电脑，为你正在学习的东西画一张图。随着你读得更多，你向你的图中添加更多内容，你移动东西，你重新组织东西。随着你读得更多，你也消化得更多，你的图也在增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

and mapping is such a great technique because it forces us to not only think about each fact and concept but also how they connect to each other to form a bigger picture so when you are reading and consuming take some time to get out a piece of paper or a tablet and make a map of the things that you're learning and as you read more you add more to your map you move things around you reorganize things as you read more you also digest more and your map grows

</details>

### E - 证据性信息 (Evidence)

PACER 中的 E 代表 **证据**（Evidence）。证据类信息是帮助使概念性信息更具体的信息。它们通常是非常详细、有时是非常技术性的信息片段，但它们很有用，因为我们可以使用这些事实、统计数据或案例作为例子来证明一个概念性观点。例如，我们可以从概念上理解第一次世界大战是如何开始的，但我们也需要知道具体的日期、特定事件发生在哪些特定的人之间、在哪个特定地点，以使该概念更具体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the E and Pacer stands for evidence evidence type information is the information that helps make conceptual information more concrete they're often very detailed sometimes very technical pieces of information but they're useful because we can use these facts or statistics or cases as examples to prove a conceptual point for example we could understand conceptually how World War I started but we also need to know the evidence information of date certain specific events occurred between which specific people at which specific location to make that concept more concrete

</details>

对于证据类信息，关键流程是**存储和排练**（Store and Rehearse）。存储意味着你只需收集该信息并将其记录在某处。你可以将其添加到你的概念图中，你可以使用像 **Notion**、**Roam** 或 **Obsidian** 这样的工具将其添加到第二大脑系统中，或者你可以将其放入闪示卡（Flashcards）中。这应该在你识别它的那一刻发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

and the key process for evidence type information is to store and rehearse store means that you just colle collect that information and note it down somewhere you could add it to your conceptual map you could add it to a second brain system using something like notion or Rome or obsidian or you can put it onto flashcards you could even just write them down on a document somewhere with all the other things that you are storing this should happen as soon as you identify it

</details>

排练部分稍后进行。我们留出时间进行排练，而排练信息是提高我们对证据类信息记忆留存的关键。排练意味着我们思考我们将如何需要使用这条信息。我们将如何应用它？这是哪种概念性信息的例子？然后我们通过以我们需要使用的方式使用和应用该信息来挑战自己。这意味着解决问题，或详细回答问题，或创建解释，教给其他人，或者写文章，使用该证据作为更广泛概念的支持例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

the rehearsing part of it comes a little later we put aside time to do the rehearsal and rehearsing the information is the key to improving our retention of evidence type information rehearsing means that we think about how we will need to use this piece of information how are we going to apply it what type of conceptual information is this an example of we then challenge ourselves by using an applying that information in the way that we will need to use it this means solving problems or writing detailed answers to questions or creating explanations teaching it to other people or maybe writing essays that use that piece of evidence as a supporting example for a wider concept

</details>

### R - 参考性信息 (Reference)

最后一种类型是 PACER 中的 R，代表 **参考性**（Reference）信息。参考信息是最容易处理的。它是所有那些细枝末节、非常具体详细的信息片段，它们并不会真正改变你的概念理解，它们不是特别重要，不是类比性的，也不是程序性的，但出于某种原因我们以后可能需要知道。这可能是像数学常数的精确值、涉及特定突变的特定基因、某种疾病的非常特定的分子名称，或者用于定义编码变量的属性列表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

evidence type information is very similar to the final type which is the r of PESA and this stands for reference type information reference information is the easiest to deal with it is all of the Nitty Gritty very specific detailed bits of information that don't really change your conceptual understanding they're not particularly that important they're not analogous and they're not procedural but for whatever reason we might need to know this later this might be something like the exact value of a mathematical con Conant or a specific Gene involved in a particular mutation or the name of a very specific molecule of a disease or maybe a list of attributes used to define a variable for coding

</details>

我们处理这类信息的流程与证据类几乎相同：**存储和排练**。存储部分完全一样，你把它扔进第二大脑或你的闪示卡里。但如果你需要能够凭记忆记录这些信息，并且在使用时不能查阅笔记，那么你可能想使用像闪示卡这样的东西。因为参考类信息根据定义在概念上并不十分重要，很难将其用于解决问题或作为扩展讨论的一部分。我们使用这些信息的方式可能只是直接的事实回忆，这就是为什么像 **Anki** 这样的应用程序，使用**间隔重复**（Spaced Repetition）和**主动回忆**（Active Recall）策略，将是处理参考类信息的最佳方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

and the process we use to deal with this type of information is the same as for evidence almost it's store and rehearse the same things the storing part exactly the same you Chuck it in a second brand and your flash cards wherever makes sense for you but if you need to be able to record this information from memory and you can't like refer back to your notes when you need to use it then you probably want to use something like flash cards because the rehearse part is a little different because reference type information is by definition not very conceptually important anyway it's quite hard to use this for problem solving or as part of like an extended discussion or answer the way we're probably going to use this information is just Direct fact recoil which is why something like flash cards using a space repetition active recoil strategy like an app like ankey is going to be the best way to handle reference type information

</details>

所以当你阅读时，如果你认为“嘿，这可能是参考类信息”，你就把它扔进你的闪示卡里，然后每天留出大约30分钟来过一遍你的闪示卡进行排练。但请再次注意，绝对不要在阅读时浪费时间试图反复阅读、写笔记并试图当场记住这些信息。你需要将那个时间用于前三种类型（程序性、类比性、概念性），它们构成了证据类信息首先需要依附的知识基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so as you're reading and you're thinking hey this might be a reference type information you dump it into your flashcards and you put aside like 30 minutes every day or whatever to just go through your flash cards to do your rehearsal but please again absolutely do not waste time while you're reading trying to just read and reread and write notes and just memorize this information at the time you need to use that time for the first three which forms the bulk of your knowledge as I said earlier there are a lot of things that need to go right to be able to learn a lot of information in a short period of time and wasting time on trying to memorize reference information while you are reading it instead of spending that time on the first three types is one of the worst offenders
