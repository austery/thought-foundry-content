title: 国家房改组长谈法拍房：警惕房地产市场风险
summary: 国家房改课题组前组长马光辉（音译）警告称，中国法拍房数量的增长虽目前总量不大，但正严重冲击市场价格体系和金融稳定，易引发房地产市场恐慌。讨论深入分析了法拍房数据、区域差异，并提出了对困境家庭的宽限期及银行将资产转给持有公司而非公开拍卖等建议。发言者虽认同其观点，但对银行能否主动承担稳定资产的责任表示怀疑，并预测名义房价将持续下跌。

### 法拍房风险与市场影响

**[Speaker 2]**: 大家好，欢迎收听《睡前消息》第1015期，今天是2026年2月6日星期五。我们来讨论1月15日的话题，关于马光辉（音译）的观点。这位**国家房改课题组前组长**在一次采访中表示，尽管中国目前**法拍房**的总数不多，但它严重冲击着整个**市场价格体系和金融稳定**，极易引发房地产市场的**恐慌**。因此，马光辉（音译）建议中国应该**停止法拍**。您对马光辉（音译）的观点有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 2]**: Hello everyone, welcome to the 1015th episode of Tax Research Insights on Friday, February 6, 2026. Let's discuss the topic from January 15th, Maang Shouse. The former head of the National Housing Reform Task Force stated in an interview that although the total number of foreclosed properties in China is currently small, it severely impacts the entire market price system and financial stability, easily triggering panic in the real estate market. Therefore, Maang Shouse suggested China should stop foreclosures. What are your thoughts on Maang Shouse's viewpoint?

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 首先，我们来介绍一下马光辉（音译）。他出身名门，三十出头就在中央办公厅工作，1992年开始担任中国房地产开发集团（CRAG）的总经理。后来，他成为CRAG的党委书记和国家房改课题组的组长，这是一个他在卸任主要职务后担任的学术职位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: First, let's introduce Maang Shouse. He comes from a prominent family, worked in the General Office of the Central Committee in his early thirties, and began serving as the General Manager of the China Real Estate Development Group (CRAG) in 1992. Later, he became Party Secretary of CRAG and the head of the National Housing Reform Task Force, which was an academic position he held after retiring from his main roles.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 他最著名的言论是在2023年，当时疫情刚刚结束。马光辉（音译）表示，中国居民在2022年增加了15万亿元的储蓄，而家庭交易量则减少了5万亿元。他认为，如果中国人愿意拿出三分之一的储蓄来买房，中国经济就能顺利复苏。我不会评论马光辉（音译）当时言论的正确性。但当马光辉（音译）在2023年发表声明时，中国房价尚未形成全面的下行趋势，普通民众也未形成共识。马光辉（音译）能够立即发声以挽救房地产市场，这表明他确实对真实情况有一些内部了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: His most famous statement was in 2023, when the pandemic had just ended. Maang Shouse stated that Chinese residents added 15 trillion yuan in savings in 2022. Household transaction volume decreased by 5 trillion yuan. He argued that if Chinese people were willing to use one third of their savings to buy houses, the Chinese economy could recover smoothly. I won't comment on the correctness of Maang Shouse's statement at the time. But when Maang Shouse made a statement in 2023, Chinese housing prices had not yet formed a comprehensive downward trend, and there was no consensus among ordinary people. The fact that Maang Shouse, who was able to speak out immediately to salvage the real estate market, shows that he does have some insider knowledge of the real situation.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 这次马光辉（音译）再次发声，表示法拍房将影响房地产市场。无论你支持涨价还是跌价，都应该认真对待。我先来解释一下法拍的逻辑。简单来说，如果有人无法偿还抵押贷款，用房子作为抵押物，但又还不起债务，房子就可以通过司法程序被法院查封后拍卖。当然，银行不能随意拍卖房屋。关于第一次拍卖的起拍价有规定。法院会委托第三方评估公司根据市场价格进行评估。根据最高人民法院的规定，第一次拍卖的起拍价最多可打七折。如果第一次拍卖失败，法院可以进一步降价并进行第二次拍卖。第二次拍卖的起拍价可以比第一次低约20%，相当于评估价的50%。如果两次拍卖都未能售出，房屋将进入**清算阶段**，以第二次拍卖的起拍价直接出售。通常，没有谈判或进一步竞价。普通房主可能认为价格太低而不愿出售，但银行或其他债权人既不需要住房，也没有对房产的情感依恋。因此，他们几乎肯定会尽快出售房产，并且会根据规定降价出售。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: This time, Maang Shouse is speaking out again, saying that foreclosures will impact the real estate market. Whether you support rising prices or falling prices, you should take this seriously. Let me first explain the logic of foreclosures. Simply put, if someone cannot repay their mortgage, uses their house as collateral, but cannot repay the debt, the house can be auctioned through judicial procedures after being seized by the court. Of course, banks cannot arbitrarily auction houses. Their regulations regarding the starting price for the first auction are as follows: the court will engage a third-party appraisal company to provide an estimate based on market prices. According to the Supreme People's Court's regulations, the starting bid for the first auction can be discounted by up to thirty percent. If the first auction fails, the court can further reduce the price and initiate a second auction. The starting bid for the second auction can be about twenty percent lower than the first one, which is equivalent to fifty percent of the appraised value. If the house fails to sell in both auctions, it enters the liquidation phase, where it is sold directly at the starting bid price of the second auction. Generally, there is no negotiation or further bidding involved. Ordinary homeowners might hold onto their properties if they think the price is too low, but banks or other creditors have no need for housing and no emotional attachment to the properties. So, they will almost certainly sell the properties as soon as they acquire them, and they will reduce the price according to regulations.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 法拍房往往反映了在当前流动性条件下房产的真实市场估值。这正是马光辉（音译）所担心的影响。为了解影响的程度，我们可以参考1月22日由“链家资产平台”（Rulian Asset Platform）发布的《2025年法拍房数据分析报告》。首先，我们来看2025年的总体数据。全国将有近130万套房产被列入法拍，比2024年增长16.41%。而在2019年，这个数字还不到50万套。同时，法拍房的成交量仅为18.8万套，占总挂牌量的不到1%。换句话说，目前法拍房的**折扣**尚未达到真正的吸引力水平，大部分法拍房并未售出。这只是一个总体趋势，请阅读原报告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Foreclosed properties often reflect the true market valuation of the properties under current liquidity conditions. This is the impact that Maang Shouse fears. To understand the extent of the impact, we can look at the 2025 foreclosure data analysis report released by Rulian Asset Platform on January 22nd. First, let's look at the overall data in 2025. Nearly 1.3 million properties will be listed nationwide, an increase of 16.41% compared to 2024. In 2019, this number was less than 500,000. At the same time, the transaction volume of foreclosed properties was only 188,000 units, less than 1% of the total listings. In other words, the current discounts on foreclosed properties have not yet reached true traction levels; most foreclosed properties are not being sold. This is just a general trend. Please read the original report directly.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 持续增加的供应并非短期冲击所致，而是房地产下行期间逐步积累的风险集中体现在司法处置渠道的结果。过去两年，这表明法拍市场仍处于风险加速暴露的阶段，尚未显示出任何明显的供应收缩迹象。在挂牌规模显著扩大和持续价格让步的背景下，部分资产进入可交易阶段后交易量的增加，并不意味着需求的**实质性改善**。在需求有限、供应充足的情况下，即使银行不愿亏本，也必然要提供更多折扣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: The continuous increasing supply is not caused by a short-term shock, but rather the result of risks accumulated gradually during the real estate downturn being concentrated in the judicial disposal channel. In the past two years, this indicates that the foreclosure market is still in a stage of accelerated exposure of existing risks and has not yet shown any significant signs of supply contraction. Against the backdrop of a significant expansion in the scale of listings and continuous price concessions, the increase in transactions after some assets enter the tradable stage does not mean a dramatic improvement in demand. With limited demand and ample supply, even if banks are unwilling to lose money, they will inevitably have to offer more discounts.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 请大家仔细听马光辉（音译）的一段话：当一个街区出现低价法拍房时，成交价会迅速成为该街区房产价值的新**基准**。这意味着其他抵押房产的价值普遍被低估，这可能会引发更多的贷款违约。面对更多的违约，新一轮法拍房进入市场将进一步压低周边房价，从而形成房价下跌和法拍房增多的**恶性循环**。简单来说，如果邻居的房子以折扣价出售，就会影响我所在街区的房价。如果整个街区所有房屋的评估价值都低于银行贷款额，就会造成大范围的**负资产**，导致房屋所有者大面积违约，他们宁愿将房屋交给银行。这会导致更多房屋进入法拍阶段，从而呈指数级扩散危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Please quietly read a section of Maang Shouse's statement for me: When a low-priced foreclosed property appears in a neighborhood, the transaction price quickly becomes the new benchmark for property values in that neighborhood. This means other collateral properties are generally undervalued, which could trigger more loan defaults. Faced with more defaults, a new round of foreclosed properties entering the market will further depress surrounding housing prices, thus forming a vicious cycle of falling prices and more foreclosures.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 根据“链家资产管理”的报告，马光辉（音译）的担忧可能会成为现实。2019年，法拍房的平均成交价基本是市场价的90%。到去年（2025年），全国法拍房的平均折扣已达25%，是过去七年来的最低点。分季度来看，2024年第四季度跌幅更为明显。法拍房的折扣率仍为81%，但去年第二季度已降至76%。到2025年第四季度，法拍房的价格约为市场价值的74%。银行自然不愿接受这个新的定价体系，但它们无力控制市场，只能让报告说话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Simply put, if a neighbor's house is sold at a discounted price, it will affect the housing prices in my neighborhood. If the appraised value of all the houses in an entire neighborhood is lower than the bank loan amount, it creates widespread negative equity, leading to widespread defaults by homeowners, who would rather give their houses away to the bank. This results in even more houses entering the foreclosure stage, creating an exponential spread of the crisis. According to the report from Rulian Asset Management, Maang Shouse's concerns may become a reality. In 2019, the average transaction price of foreclosed properties was basically 90% of the market price. By last year (2025), the average foreclosed property nationwide had been discounted by 25% to be sold, the lowest in the past seven years. Looking at each quarter, the decline is even more pronounced. In the last quarter of 2024, the discount on foreclosed properties was still 81%, but by the second quarter last year, it had fallen to 76%. And in the last quarter of 2025, the price of foreclosed properties was approximately 74% of the market value.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 去年第一次拍卖时，银行普遍只愿意提供86%的折扣，与2020年相比降幅不大。市场显然不接受银行的报价，只有11%的房屋以这个高价售出。到了第二次拍卖，银行急于**变现**其住房资产，开始提供70%的折扣。这时消费者才愿意进入市场。成交率增加了近18%。大量消费者也选择等到最终清算阶段以**地板价**购买。数据显示，大多数消费者是在集中清算阶段购入房产，清算参与者数量增加了143%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Banks are naturally unwilling to accept this new pricing system, but they have no way to control the market and have to let the report speak for itself. In the first auction last year, banks were generally only willing to offer an 86% discount, which wasn't much of a decrease compared to 2020. The market clearly didn't accept the banks' offer; only 11% of the houses were sold at this high price. By the second auction, banks were eager to liquidate their housing assets and started offering 70% discounts. Only then were consumers willing to enter the market. The transaction rate increased by nearly 18%. A large number of consumers also choose to wait until the final liquidation stage to buy at rock-bottom prices. This is reflected in the data: most consumers acquired properties during the concentrated liquidation stage, and the number of participants in the liquidation increased by 143%.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 更严重的问题是，越来越多的法拍房不仅对房价和社区产生负面影响，还阻碍了新房销售，彻底摧毁了现有房地产公司的生存能力。2022年，全国近80万**人次**参与房产拍卖，同比增长50%。然而，**人均拍卖参与者**仅增加了0.79人。许多人只是围观，很少有人购买，成交价持续打折。根据大多数人的心理预期，房价仍有下跌空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: The more serious problem is that the increasing number of foreclosed properties not only negatively impacts housing prices and neighborhoods, but also backs the sales of new homes, completely destroying existing real estate companies' ability to survive. In 2022, nearly 800,000 people participated in property auctions nationwide, a 50% increase year-on-year. However, the average number of participants per auction only increased by 0.79 people. Many people were viewing the properties, but few were buying, and transaction prices continue to be discounted. According to most people's psychological expectations, there is still room for housing prices to fall here.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 我想为马光辉（音译）辩护。他建议停止法拍，并非希望政府动用行政手段人为维持房地产价格。任何有一点经济常识的人都知道，那样做的唯一结果可能是房地产市场**流动性完全丧失**，非官方交易价格**急剧下跌**，新房和二手房市场双双崩溃。这难道不是马光辉（音译）的真实意图吗？他的意思是，银行在抵押贷款中赚取了巨额利润，现在应该承担一些**社会责任**，而不是急于套现，与普通民众一起拖累房地产行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: I want to defend Maang Shouse. His suggestion to stop foreclosures is not about hoping the government will use administrative means to artificially maintain real estate prices. Anyone with even a little economic sense knows that the only result of that could be a complete loss of liquidity in the housing market, a sharp decline in unofficial transaction prices, and both new and second-hand housing markets collapsing together. Is that Maang Shouse's real intention? It is that banks, having made a fortune from mortgages, should now bear some social responsibility instead of rushing for quick losses, dragging down ordinary people along with the real estate industry.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 从他的提议来看，过去十年，银行业从居民抵押贷款中累计获得了8万亿元的利息收入。现在是时候与困境中的居民分担负担了。首先，对于困难家庭，允许一定的**宽限期**。其次，对于失业个人和收入大幅减少的家庭，暂停抵押贷款支付并**延期**，给予两到三年的宽限期。对于确实需要处置的资产，银行应将其转给**持有公司**，而不是允许其进入市场进行公开拍卖。这可以防止对二级市场价格产生进一步影响。这种临时救助政策并不意味着借款人不必偿还，而是延长了还款周期，等待经济复苏和资产价值回升。这比银行急于处理不良资产并立即造成资产损失要好，同时也保住了民众的基本生活水平和希望。考虑到绝大多数中国人的资产是贷款购买的房屋……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: When we look at his proposal, the banking industry has accumulated 8 trillion yuan in interest income from resident mortgages in the past ten years. Now it's time to share the burden with struggling residents. First, for struggling families, allow a certain grace period for repayment. Second, for unemployed individuals and families with significantly reduced income, suspend mortgage payments and extend payments, giving them two or three years of grace. For assets that do need to be disposed of, banks should transfer them to their holding companies and not allow them to enter the market for public auction. This prevents further impact on secondary market prices. This temporary relief policy does not mean that borrowers don't have to repay, but rather extends the repayment cycle, waiting for economic recovery and asset value appreciation. This is better than banks rushing to deal with non-performing assets and immediately causing asset losses, and it also preserves basic living standards and hope for the people. Considering that the vast majority of Chinese people's assets are houses purchased with loans...

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 我在某种程度上同意马光辉（音译）的观点。然而，考虑到**国有银行**的业绩指标，我不认为银行会在2026年主动承担稳定资产的责任，除非中国人民银行计划通过**全面通胀**来化解债务。受法拍房驱动的中国名义房价将继续向**真实市场交易价**下跌。如果你想知道自己房子的真实市场价值，最好听从马光辉（音译）的建议，仔细研究这份法拍房数据分析报告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: I somewhat agree with Maang Shouse's viewpoint. However, considering the performance indicators of state-owned banks, I don't believe banks will voluntarily take responsibility for stabilizing assets in 2026 unless the People's Bank of China plans to use comprehensive inflation to alleviate debt. Chinese nominal housing prices, led by foreclosed properties, will continue to fall towards real market transaction prices. If you want to know the true market value of your house, it's best to heed Maang Shouse's advice and carefully study this foreclosure data analysis report.

</details>

### 各城市法拍房数据分析

**[Speaker 3]**: 接下来，我将简要介绍一些关键数据。虽然所有法拍房都有显著折扣，但不同房地产的流动性差异很大。去年，**住宅**的平均折扣为76%，但成交率仍保持在21%，是**最容易出售**的资产。这表明中国人并非不愿意买房，而是认为目前的房价太高。同时，**建设用地**的交易价格仅折扣了20%，表明一些开发商仍愿意拿地，并认为他们能赚回钱。然而，这些新建筑可能有更高的建造标准，间接降低了现有房产的价值。更糟糕的是，**商业房地产**的交易率不到10%。大多数商业地产……开发商曾以“一笔投资养三代”的口号推广商业地产。然而，从目前情况来看，大多数商业地产甚至无法支撑半代人，由于电子商务的影响，可能难以生存。与普通人最相关的是住宅和商业地产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Next, I'll briefly introduce some key figures. Although all foreclosed properties have significant discounts, the liquidity of different real estate properties varies. Last year, the average discount on residential properties was 76%, but the transaction rate remained at 21%, making them the easiest assets to sell. This data shows that Chinese people are not unwilling to buy houses, but simply believe that current housing prices are too high. At the same time, the transaction price of construction land was only discounted by 20%, indicating that some developers are still willing to buy land and believe they can make money back. However, these new buildings may have higher construction standards, indirectly lowering the value of existing properties. Even worse, the transaction rate for commercial real estate is less than 10%. Most commercial properties... developers promoted commercial real estate with the slogan "one investment supports three generations." However, judging from the current situation, most commercial properties haven't even supported half a generation and probably cannot survive due to the impact of e-commerce. The parts most relevant to ordinary people are residential and commercial properties.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 我们来看看几个城市的住宅情况。**广州**去年挂牌的法拍住宅最多，近1万套。而**上海**仅有3300套，**深圳**和**北京**则各有约5500套。这个挂牌数据反映了当地居民的困境，表明广州居民面临更大的财务压力。从成交价来看，深圳的法拍房以82%的成交价售出，成交率超过50%。这表明深圳对住房需求强劲，房屋仍是**流动性资产**，至少80%的折扣仍能变现。深圳和广州相比，深圳无疑是领先的中心城市。至于北京，周边没有城市能与之竞争，但房价折扣最深，需要73%的折扣才能完成交易。这表明，如果一个城市过度依赖服务业，在经济下行期间就难以维持就业，进而难以维持房价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Let's look at the situation in several cities by combining the residential data, starting with first-tier cities. Guangzhou had the most listed foreclosed residential properties last year, nearly 10,000. Shanghai only had 3,300, and Shenzhen and Beijing both had around 5,500. This listing data reflects the dire situation of local residents, suggesting that people in Guangzhou face greater financial pressure. From a transaction price perspective, Shenzhen's foreclosed properties sold at a transaction price of 82%, with a transaction rate exceeding 50%. This indicates a strong demand for housing in Shenzhen, and houses are still a liquid asset; at least an 80% discount can still yield cash. Coming from Shenzhen and Guangzhou, it's clear that Shenzhen is undoubtedly the leading central city. As for Beijing, there are no surrounding cities that can compete with it, but the housing price discounts are the steepest, requiring a 73% discount to complete a transaction. This shows that if a city relies too much on the service industry, it's difficult to maintain employment and consequently, housing prices during economic downturns.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 在二线城市，成交率存在显著的地区差异。成交率最低的城市是**西安**、**太原**、**南昌**和**贵阳**，均集中在西北地区。除了西安，其他西北省会城市的成交率仅为个位数，表明70%-80%的折扣并非西北地区房价的终点。南昌和贵阳分别排名27位和28位，表现挣扎，这在意料之中。此前它们试图追赶房价飙升的浪潮，但现在却落后了。至于**合肥**，近年来它一直在积极融入**长三角**并吸引了众多产业，但其成交率在17%的折扣水平下仅为14%，在35个二线城市中排名第29位，这有些令人惊讶。也许这些城市的人们将合肥视为省会，更倾向于南京或上海的房产。在三线城市，差异更为明显。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: In second-tier cities, there are significant regional differences in transaction rates. The cities with the lowest transaction rates are Xi'an, Taiyuan, Nanchang, and Guiyang, all concentrated in the northwest. Except for Xi'an, the transaction rates in other northwestern provincial capitals are only in single digits, indicating that the 70-80% discount is not the end point for housing prices in the northwestern region. The cities of Nanchang and Guiyang rank 27th and 28th, respectively, and are struggling, which is expected. Previously, they were trying to catch up with the surge in housing prices, but now they are lagging behind. As for Hefei, while it has been integrating into the Yangtze River Delta in recent years and has attracted a number of industries, its transaction rate is only 14% at a 17% discount level, ranking 29th among 35 second-tier cities, which is somewhat surprising. Perhaps people in these cities consider Hefei their provincial capital and prefer properties in Nanjing or Shanghai. In third-tier cities...

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 差异更为明显。当比较城市时，成交率是50%，与深圳相似。此外，**大理**、**昆明**、**包头**、**兰州**和**长沙**这五个城市成交率均为个位数。这五个城市虽然不是省会，但拥有严重**产业结构单一**的特点，私营企业很少。例如，包头主要依赖钢铁和稀土资源。而长沙近年来一直在尝试发展汽车产业链，但其经济仍依赖传统产业。至于中国烟草，它为税收做出了贡献。随着新产业进一步向大都市区集中，单一产业的城市既留不住资本也留不住人才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: The differentiation is even more pronounced. When comparing cities, the transaction rate is 50%, similar to Shenzhen. Additionally, five cities – Dali, Kunming, Baotou, Lanzhou, and Changsha – have single-digit transaction rates. These five cities, while not provincial capitals, share a severely undiversified industrial structure with few private enterprises. For example, Baotou mainly relies on steel and rare earth resources. And while Changsha has been trying to develop an automobile industry chain in recent years, its economy still depends on traditional industries. As for China Tobacco, it contributes to its tax revenue. As new industries further concentrate in metropolitan areas, cities with single industries cannot retain either capital or talent.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 再看商业地产，**上海**和**广州**作为成熟的大城市，成交率均超过20%。当地居民显然保留了线下消费习惯。同样，作为成熟的大城市，**北京**的成交率低于上海和广州。**深圳**的成交率较低，可能与其年轻的人口结构和对在线购物的偏好有关。在成熟城市中，商业地产的交易情况与住宅地产类似，西北城市和长三角的合肥表现落后，仅比西北地区稍好。在三线城市，比较它们毫无意义。超过一半的城市商业地产成交率低于10%，使得商业地产**完全停滞**。只有三个城市成交率超过20%：**南京**、**济南**和**无锡**。无锡能够超越两个长三角城市，将其成交率提升至31%，可能得益于其地理位置。在东北人口大规模南迁的背景下，连接东北和华北、临近大海的**济南**（此处原文可能误译为“济南”，结合上下文应为“锦州”或类似地名，但按原文保留）能够留住足够多的居民。此外，如前所述，**兰州**的商铺成交率不到2%，全国还有另外两个城市的数字更差。看来，普通的商业地产甚至不是最难出售的房产类型。**停车位**和**三层商铺**才是真正滞销的资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Looking at commercial properties, Shanghai and Guangzhou have transaction rates exceeding 20% as established major cities. Locals there clearly retain offline consumption habits. Similarly, as an established major city, Beijing's transaction rate is lower than Shanghai and Guangzhou. Shenzhen's transaction rate is lower, possibly due to its younger population structure and their preference for online shopping. In established cities, the transaction situation for commercial properties is similar to residential properties, with northwestern cities and Hefei in the Yangtze River Delta lagging behind, only slightly better than the situation in the northwest. In third-tier cities, comparing them is pointless. More than half of the cities have commercial property transaction rates below 10%, making commercial properties completely stagnant. Only three cities have transaction rates exceeding 20%: Nanjing, Jinan, and Wuxi. Wuxi's ability to surpass two Yangtze River Delta cities and raise its transaction rate to 31% is likely due to its geographical location. Against the backdrop of a mass migration of the entire northeast population southward, Jinju (likely a misinterpretation in original text, retaining as per transcript) connecting the northeast and north China, and close to the sea, was able to retain a sufficient number of residents. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the transaction rate for shops in Lanzhou was less than 2%, and there were two other cities nationwide with even worse figures. It seems that ordinary commercial real estate isn't even the hardest type of property to sell. Parking spaces and three-level shops are the assets that are truly stuck.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 根据报告，2025年全国共挂牌32万个停车位或三层商铺，平均成交率仅为6.89%。报告作者甚至没有提供具体城市的数据，因为大家都一样惨。所以，如果有人想买你的停车位，最好 whatever they offer。我需要提醒大家，我引用的报告并非完整报告。至少我的第一、二、三线城市列表不包括我居住的**苏州**。要查看法拍统计的全面分析，你需要查阅其他机构的数据。例如，**中泰研究院**的报告包含了苏州的数据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: According to the report, in 2025, a total of 320,000 parking spaces or three-level shops were listed, with an average transaction rate of only 6.89% nationwide. The report's authors didn't even bother to provide data for individual cities as everyone was equally suffering. So, if someone wants to buy your parking space, it's best to accept whatever they offer. I should remind you that the report I referenced does not provide a complete picture. At least my list of first, second, and third-tier cities doesn't include Suzhou, where I live. To see a comprehensive analysis of foreclosure statistics, you need to look at data from other institutions. For example, the report from the Zhongtai Research Institute includes data for Suzhou.

</details>

**[Speaker 3]**: 此外，我再分享一个重要数据。1月16日的一份特报提到，截至2026年，将有50万亿元的定期存款到期。同时，由于资金**过剩**，银行通过可靠的贷款业务吸收存款的动力不大。一些银行已停止提供五年期定期存款服务，更多银行则将定期存款利率降至1.5%或更低，导致资金**无处可去**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Speaker 3]**: Additionally, let me share another important piece of data: a special report on January 16th mentioned that 50 trillion yuan in fixed deposits will mature in 2026. At the same time, because of a surplus of funds, banks have little incentive to absorb deposits through reliable loan businesses. Some banks have stopped offering five-year fixed deposit services, and more banks have lowered fixed deposit interest rates to 1.5% or lower, leading to a situation where funds have nowhere to go.

**[Speaker 3]**: 我看到这条新闻，立刻意识到几年前的一场争论现在有了结论。几年前房地产繁荣时期，有人说房地产是一个巨大的**蓄水池**，可以吸收多余的资金。也有人说房地产是一个巨大的**印钞机**，利用现代银行体系创造信贷货币。现在看来，房地产确实是一台印钞机，创造了天文数字的货币，当然也创造了天文数字的债务。中国目前的问题是，货币和债务由不同群体持有：早期**套现**的群体持有货币，而后期进入的群体则承担债务。拥有财富的群体不愿意重新进入房地产市场，所以他们的购买力就像**笼中虎**，找不到出路。与此同时，数亿背负抵押贷款的人实际上处于**负资产**状况。这个问题尚未完全暴露，因为还没有发生**大规模抛售**。马光辉（音译）担心法拍危机将问题带到台前。

**[Speaker 3]**: When I saw this news, I immediately realized that a debate from a few years ago now has a conclusion. During the real estate boom a few years ago, some people said that real estate was a huge reserve pool that could absorb excess funds. Others said that real estate was a huge money-printing machine, using the modern banking system to create credit money. Now it seems that real estate is indeed a money-printing machine, creating astronomical amounts of currency, and of course, also creating astronomical amounts of debt. The current problem in China is that the currency and debt are held by different groups: the group that cashed out earlier holds the currency, while the group that got in late bears the debt. The group that possesses wealth doesn't want to re-enter the real estate market, so their purchasing power is like a caged tiger, unable to find a way out. Meanwhile, the hundreds of millions of people burdened with mortgages are actually in a negative equity situation. The problem just hasn't been fully exposed yet because there hasn't been a mass sell-off. Maang Shouse is worried that the foreclosure crisis will bring the problem to the forefront.
