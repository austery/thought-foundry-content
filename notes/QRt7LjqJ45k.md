### 减缓衰老研究的意义与顾虑

本视频的一部分由LastPass赞助，更多信息将在节目末尾介绍。这是一个关于减缓衰老速度和延长人类寿命研究的视频。在拍摄之前，我想了解大家对这类研究的普遍看法。我做了一个Twitter投票，结果发现大多数人支持并认为应该有更多的此类研究，但也有一些重要的顾虑，我想在开头就解决这些问题。最主要的顾虑是：如果我们要延长人类寿命，那是否意味着我们将有更多“生病”的岁月，躺在床上患上阿尔茨海默症？没有人希望这样，这一点对我来说很清楚。

<p class="english-text">Part of this video is sponsored by LastPass. More about LastPass at the end of the show. This is a video about research into slowing the rate of aging and extending the human lifespan. So, before I filmed this I wanted to know: What do you guys generally think about such research? And I made a Twitter poll where I found that the majority of people were supportive and thought there should be more of it but there were some important concerns and I want to address those here at the beginning. I mean the most significant concern was: if we're looking to extend human lifespan, does that just mean we'll have more sick years where we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's? Nobody wants that, and that was clear to me.</p>
</details>

然而，我为本视频采访的David Sinclair教授指出，随着年龄增长，患上可怕疾病的风险，例如糖尿病、癌症和关节炎等，都会呈指数级增长。因此，如果这项研究成功，其核心目的将是预防这些疾病。也就是说，如果你真的在解决衰老问题，那么你也应该看到那些与年龄相关的疾病不会那么快地出现。所以，减缓衰老和延长人类寿命的目的是延长健康的寿命，这也被称为**健康跨度**（Health Span: 指一个人在生命中保持健康和活力的时间长度）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the professor that I was interviewing for this video, professor David Sinclair, points out that as you get older the risk of horrible diseases, things like diabetes and cancer, and arthritis, all those sorts of things... it increases exponentially. And so, if this research is successful the whole point of it will be to forestall those sorts of diseases. I mean, if you really are tackling aging, then you should also see that those age-related diseases do not set in so quickly. So, the point of slowing aging and extending human lifespan is to extend the healthy lifespan, also called the health span.</p>
</details>

我看到的其他顾虑是人们说：“这可能只对富人有利，会加剧不平等”，或者“这可能会增加地球人口，导致更多的垃圾、更多的二氧化碳。养活这么多人需要哪些资源？”我认为这些都是合理的顾虑，但它们不属于本视频的讨论范围。所以，如果你想在评论中讨论它们，请随意，但本视频的重点是探讨：我们能否减缓人类衰老？我们能否延长寿命和健康跨度？这会是什么样子？我们该如何实现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other concerns I saw were that people were saying: "Well, this could be used only for the wealthy and increase inequality" or "It could increase the population of the Earth causing..." "...more garbage, more CO2. Where are the resources to feed all these people?". I think these are valid concerns, but they're not part of the scope of this video. So if you want to discuss them in the comments, feel free, but the point of this video is to address: can we slow aging in humans? Can we extend the lifespan and the health span? And what does that look like? How do we do it?</p>

### 衰老的奥秘：从水母到表观遗传学

为了制作这个视频，我去了旧金山北部的**博德加海洋实验室**（Bodega Marine Lab: 位于加利福尼亚州的一个海洋研究机构），在那里我看到了一些**月亮水母**（Moon Jellyfish: 一种半透明的水母，因其独特的生命周期而备受关注）。这些月亮水母的迷人之处在于，有些人认为它们是不朽的。这怎么可能呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So for this video I traveled up to the 'Bodega Marine Lab', which is north of San Francisco and there I got to see some 'moon jellyfish'. Now what's fascinating about these 'moon jellyfishes' is that some people consider them immortal. How can that be?</p>
</details>

所有这些水母都有一个复杂的生命周期，它们从**水螅体**（Polyp: 水母生命周期中的固定阶段，形似小型海葵）开始，这基本上就像一个小型的海葵，然后它们会经历变态，变成**水母体**（Medusa: 水母生命周期中的自由游动阶段，即我们通常所说的水母）。在大多数这些物种中，水螅体通常能够进行无性繁殖，如果它们的组织被切除或受损，它们可以再生，并且没有明显的**衰老**（Senescence: 生物学衰老的术语）证据。所以它们似乎具有一定程度的不朽性。直到2015年左右，才有人报告了它们这种能力。那么，月亮水母是否掌握着减缓衰老和延长我们寿命的关键？它们能帮助我们永生吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all these jellyfish have this complex life cycle where they start off as a polyp, which is basically like a small sea anemone and then they'll go through a metamorphosis and become a medusa. And the medusa stage is what we generally think of when we think about a jellyfish. And in most of these species the polyps are generally able to asexually reproduce, and they can regenerate if tissue is cut off of them or if they're damaged, and they don't have any clear evidence of senescence, which is the term for biological aging. So they appear to have some degree of immortality. No one had reported their ability to do this until... I think this was 2015. So do 'moon jellyfish' hold the key to slowing aging and extending our lifespan? Could they help us live forever?</p>
</details>

在我开始制作这个视频之前，我会把这类研究归入与将你的大脑、你的意识下载到计算机中同一类别。比如，我能理解这也许可行，但我不认为我们离那一步还很近。因为我们甚至不了解大脑是如何工作的，或者记忆是如何存储的，所以那看起来像是严肃的科幻小说。因此，我原本会把将人类寿命延长到120岁、150岁甚至更长也归入同一类别。但在阅读了Sinclair教授的书并采访了他之后，我认为我们在一生中控制衰老方面取得一些进展似乎更有可能，事实上也更合理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before I got into making this video, I would have put this sort of research in the same category as downloading your brain, your consciousness into a computer. Like, I can see how maybe that would work but I don't think we're anywhere near that. Because we don't even understand how the brain works or how memories are stored, so that seems like serious science fiction, so I would have put, say, extending the human lifespan to 120, 150, and beyond in the same category, but after reading professor Sinclair's book and doing an interview with him, I think it seems much more possible and in fact plausible that we'll make some progress over controlling aging in our lifetimes.</p>
</details>

现在，如果你想减缓衰老，你需要回答的第一个问题是：我们为什么会衰老？衰老到底是什么？我以前做过一个关于**端粒**（Telomeres: 染色体末端的保护帽，每次细胞分裂都会缩短）的视频。它们是你染色体末端的帽子。每次细胞分裂时，端粒都会缩短一点。所以人们认为这些端粒就像你鞋带的尖端，它们防止染色体散开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you want to slow aging, the first question you need to answer is: Why do we age in the first place? I mean, what really is aging? I've made a video in the past about telomeres. These are the end caps on your chromosomes. And every time a cell divides the telomere gets a bit shorter. So it was thought that these telomeres are kind of like the tips of your shoelaces and they prevent the chromosome from fraying.</p>
</details>

但老年人的身体还有其他迹象表明存在衰老细胞。这些被称为**衰老细胞**（Senescent cells: 停止分裂但仍存活并释放炎症信号的细胞）的东西会积累起来。它们本质上是像僵尸一样的细胞，只是在你的身体里继续存活并使周围的细胞发炎。细胞间沟通不良，线粒体功能障碍，而线粒体是细胞的“发电站”。老年细胞有8或9种不同的特征，它们是衰老的标志。但问题是：它们是衰老的原因，还是更深层根本原因的结果？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there are other signs in older bodies that you have old cells. There are an accumulation of things, they're called senescent cells. They're essentially these zombie-like cells that just go on living in your body and inflaming the cells around them. There's poor intercellular communication, there's mitochondrial dysfunction, those are the powerhouses of the cell. There are these 8 or 9 different features of older cells and they are the hallmarks of aging. But the question is: are they the cause of aging, or are they kind of the result of a deeper root cause?</p>
</details>

上世纪中叶的假设是，衰老是由于我们一生中DNA受损、DNA发生突变所致。但此后的证据表明情况并非如此。你可以取一个成年细胞，并将其克隆成一个新生物体。那个生物体的寿命似乎与同物种的非克隆生物体差不多长。第一只克隆羊多莉的寿命很短，她很早就去世了。但现在你可以克隆猴子，可以克隆狗，事实上，女演员芭芭拉·史翠珊就克隆了她的狗，它们预计将拥有正常的寿命。所以从这个角度看，DNA中的所有信息似乎都还在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the middle of the last century, the hypothesis was that it was damage to our DNA, mutations to our DNA that happened over the course of our lives that led us to be older But, evidence since then has suggested that that is not really the case. I mean, you can take an adult cell, and you can clone it into a new organism. And that organism appears to live about as long as non-cloned organisms of the same species. Now, the first sheep, Dolly the sheep, had a short lifespan. She died early. But cloned animals; you can now clone a monkey, you can clone dogs, in fact Barbra Streisand, the actress, she cloned her dogs, and they are expected to live a normal lifespan. So in that way it seems like all the information is still there in the DNA.</p>
</details>

### 表观遗传信息理论：衰老的真正原因

如果我们的DNA没有丢失信息，那么衰老的原因是什么？Sinclair教授怀疑是信息丢失，但不是我们DNA基因组中的信息。不，Sinclair教授怀疑信息丢失发生在我们**表观基因组**（Epigenome: 控制基因表达的化学修饰和蛋白质包装模式）中。那么，什么是表观基因组呢？你身体里的每个细胞都有相同的DNA，但不同的细胞类型有不同的表观基因组。它们有不同的方式来包装DNA，将其大量卷曲起来，使其不被读取，并让DNA的某些部分展开，以便更容易转录并转化为蛋白质，从而运行该细胞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if we're not losing information in our DNA then what is the reason for aging? Well, professor Sinclair suspects that it's a loss of information, but not the information in our DNA, in our genome. No, professor Sinclair suspects that the loss of information is in our epigenome. So what is the epigenome? Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but, different cell types have different epigenomes. They have different ways of packaging that DNA, coiling up, you know, a lot of it so that it's not read, and leaving some parts of the DNA spooled out, so it's easier to transcribe and turn into proteins and run that cell.</p>
</details>

所以表观基因组负责开启或关闭DNA的不同部分。它通过**组蛋白**（Histones: DNA缠绕的蛋白质）和**甲基化**（Methylation: DNA上的化学标记，影响基因表达）等方式来实现。DNA上某些位置会放置这些化学信号标记。所以这个想法是：当你的身体刚开始形成时，表观基因组会告诉你的细胞应该成为哪种类型的细胞。但随着你年龄的增长，Sinclair教授的假设是，我们正在丢失表观基因组中的信息。这很重要，因为如果一个皮肤细胞需要保持为皮肤细胞，那是表观基因组的作用。如果你没有表观基因组，皮肤细胞就会忘记它是什么类型的细胞，它可能会变成一个脑细胞，这可能没那么糟糕，但如果你的大脑变成了皮肤细胞，你就有麻烦了，我认为这在很大程度上就是衰老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the epigenome is responsible for turning on or turning off different parts of the DNA. The way it does that is with proteins called 'histones' that, essentially, the DNA is wrapped on, and also things like methylation. So there's these chemical signaling markers which are placed on the DNA in certain positions. So the idea is: when your body is first forming, the epigenome is what tells your cells what type of cell to be. But as you get older, professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that we are losing information in the epigenome. And that's important because if a skin cell needs to remain a skin cell, that's the epigenome. And if you don't have the epigenome the skin cell will forget what type of cell it is and it might turn into a brain cell, which may not be that bad but if your brain turns into a skin cell you've got a problem and I think that's largely what aging is.</p>
</details>

我不得不说，随着年龄增长，我的肩膀上出现了一些奇怪的毛发斑块。那是不是细胞……做错了事？那些是皮肤细胞吗？它们是不是搞砸了，还是这只是……我不知道。不，不，年龄大了确实会发生奇怪的事情，对吧？你开始在不该长毛的地方长毛：耳朵、鼻子、背部。那是细胞失去了它们的身份，细胞会说：“我不记得我该做什么了，我不再读取正确的基因了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've gotta say, there's some weird, hair patches, on my shoulder, that have happened as I've gotten older. Is that a cell... doing the wrong thing? Are those meant to be skin cells? Are they're screwing up or is this just some... I don't know. No, no, weird stuff happens when you get older, right? You start to get hair growing where it shouldn't: ears, nose, back. That's cells losing their identity, the cells go: "I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, I'm not reading the right genes anymore."</p>
</details>

那么，表观基因组这种崩溃的关键是DNA损伤吗？是的，所以当你晒太阳时，不是像今天这样，而是在阳光充足的日子里，你的染色体会被破坏。在细胞努力将染色体重新连接起来的过程中，请注意：DNA不是随意散乱的，它实际上是捆绑在一起的。细胞必须将其解开，招募蛋白质来帮助连接，然后它们必须回去重置结构。而表观基因组的这种重置大约有99%是成功的。那1%就是衰老过程。所以随着时间的推移，组蛋白没有回到正确的位置，DNA甲基化被添加到了不应该存在的地方。我们可以读取这种甲基化模式，我可以准确地告诉你你多大年纪，甚至你什么时候会去世。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the key to this sort of breakdown in the epigenome is DNA damage? Yeah, so when you go out in the sun, not like today, but on a day where there's a lot of sun, you'll break your chromosomes. And in the effort that the cells go to to stick the chromosome back together, note: the DNA isn't just flailing around, it's actually bundled up. The cell has to unwrap it, recruit proteins to help, join it together, and then they have to go back and reset the structures. And that resetting of the epigenome happens about 99%. That 1% is the aging process. So overtime, histones are not returned to the right places and DNA methylation is added in places where it shouldn't be. We can read that methylation pattern and I could tell you how old you are, exactly, and when you're even gonna die.</p>
</details>

你怎么能知道呢？嗯，这是一个时钟，我们称之为**Horvath时钟**（Horvath clock: 以其发现者Steve Horvath命名的，基于DNA甲基化模式的生物年龄测量工具），这些像牙齿上的牙菌斑一样积累在DNA上的小化学物质，我们可以读取它们，你积累得越多，你的生物年龄就越大。所以你可能只有40岁，你当然比40岁年轻，但你知道，我现在50岁了，但我生物年龄可能是60岁，实际上我曾经是。我改变了我的生活，然后测试显示我的生物年龄是31岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How could you tell that? Well, it's a clock, we call it the Horvath clock named after my good friend Steve Horvath, and so these little chemicals that accumulate on the DNA like a plaque on the teeth, we can read that and the more you have, the older you are; biologically. So you might only be 40, you're younger than 40, of course but, you know, I'm 50 now, but I might be biologically 60, actually I was. And I changed my life and then the test said I was biologically 31.</p>
</details>

### 加速与测量衰老：小鼠实验的启示

我发现其中一件非常有趣的事情是：你找到了一种让小鼠更快衰老的方法。你是怎么做到的？嗯，衰老时钟是由于细胞中信息丢失造成的，加速这一过程的一种方法是破坏染色体。我们没有让小鼠晒太阳，而是设计了一种可以破坏其染色体的小鼠。破坏程度不足以引起突变，细胞会将DNA重新连接起来，所以我们没有丢失任何遗传信息。但如果我们的“表观遗传信息衰老理论”是正确的，那么这些小鼠应该会变老，而这正是发生的情况。它毛发灰白，驼背，患有痴呆症，所有器官看起来都很老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, one of the things I found really interesting was: you found a way to make mice age faster. So, how did you do that? Well, the clock of aging is due to the loss of the information in the cell, and one way to accelerate that is to go break a chromosome. Instead of going in the sun we engineered a mouse where we could break its chromosomes. Not enough to cause mutations, the cells put the DNA back together, so we didn't lose any genetic information. But if we're right about the 'epigenetic information theory of aging', those mice should get old and that's exactly what happened. It's gray, it's got a hunchback, it's got dementia, all its organs look old,</p>
</details>

但真正的测试是：“如果我们测量那个DNA时钟呢？”我们称之为“DNA甲基化时钟”。我们测量了它，这些小鼠实际上比我们未处理的小鼠老了50%。所以那不仅仅是一只看起来老的小鼠，那只小鼠实际上就是更老了。这个假设的有趣之处在于，如果它是真的，如果表观基因组中积累的“噪音”确实是导致衰老的原因，那么我们现在就可以采取措施，通过更好地维护我们的表观基因组来减缓我们身体的衰老速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the real test was: "what if we measured that DNA clock?" what we call the 'DNA methylation clock'. And we measured it and those mice were actually 50% older than mice that we didn't treat. So that isn't just a mouse that looks old, that mouse literally is older. What's interesting about this hypothesis is that, if it's true, if the noise accumulating the epigenome is really what's causing aging, well then there are steps we can take right now to slow the rate of aging in our bodies, by trying to better maintain our epigenomes.</p>
</details>

### 减缓衰老：长寿基因与生活方式干预

那么我们该怎么做呢？有一个理论认为，数十亿年前，早期细菌迈出了重要的一步进化。它们实际上发展出了两种不同的生存模式。当情况良好时，它们利用能量生长和繁殖。但当条件艰苦时，它们利用能量保护和修复细胞。它们进化出了Sinclair教授所称的“**长寿基因**”（Longevity genes: 响应逆境并促进细胞保护和修复的基因）。这些由逆境触发的基因会产生酶，这些酶除了其他作用外，还能维护表观基因组。今天，同样的**长寿基因**可以在细菌和我们体内找到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do we do that? There's this theory, that billions of years ago early bacteria took an important evolutionary step. They actually developed two different modes of living. When times were good they used their energy to grow and reproduce. But when conditions were tough, they used their energy to protect and repair their cells. They evolved, what professor Sinclair calls: 'longevity genes'. These genes triggered by adversity create enzymes which among other things, maintain the epigenome. And today, those same longevity genes can be found in bacteria, and us.</p>
</details>

我们所有的细胞中都有这些**应激反应基因**（Hormetic response genes: 生物体对低剂量有害刺激产生的适应性有益反应）或长寿基因，它们能感知我们何时大量运动、呼吸急促、饥饿、有点热或有点冷。这些基因正在开启我们对抗衰老的普遍防御机制。那么，那是什么呢？所以，我们细胞的一部分会散架：它们可以把它们重新组合起来。蛋白质错误折叠：它们可以清除它们或把它们重新组合起来。染色体末端变短：它们可以加长它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have these 'hormetic response' genes or 'longevity genes' that are in all of our cells, and they sense when we've run a lot, we've lost our breath or we're hungry, we are a little bit hot, or a little bit cold. These genes are turning on our general defenses against aging. So, what is that? So, parts of our cells fall apart: they can put them back together. Proteins misfold: they can get rid of them or put them back together. The ends of the chromosomes get shorter: they can lengthen them.</p>
</details>

有很多过程在进行，但我认为其中最重要的一点是维护细胞中的信息，即表观遗传信息，这样我们的细胞就不会忘记该做什么。长寿基因有三种类型。我们研究的一种叫做**Sirtuins**（Sirtuins: 沉默信息调节因子，控制细胞信息），它们控制细胞中的信息。事实上，Sirtuin中的“Sir”代表“沉默信息调节因子”二号（SIR2）。还有其他类型。另一组叫做**AMP-激酶**（AMP-kinase, AMPK: 感受能量摄入，特别是糖）。这组基因感知我们摄入了多少能量……主要是糖的形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of processes that go on but one of the most important, I think, is maintaining the information, the epigenetic information in the cell, so that our cells don't forget what to do. There are three types of longevity gene. There are the ones we work on called 'sirtuins' and they control the information in the cell. In fact, 'sir' in sirtuin stands for 'silent information regulator' number two (SIR2). There are other ones. The other group is called AMP-kinase or AMPK. This group of genes senses how much energy we're taking in... mostly in the form of sugar.</p>
</details>

第三组叫做**mTOR**（mTOR: 感受氨基酸摄入，调控细胞生长和代谢）。这些基因控制并响应我们摄入了多少氨基酸。所以如果你吃一大块牛排，你的身体会摄入大量氨基酸。这实际上会阻止mTOR“蛰伏”并让你活得更久。小鼠实验也证实了这一点。让小鼠活得更久最好的方法是减少它们的进食时间，所以**周期性禁食**（Periodic fasting: 定期限制进食时间）或**间歇性禁食**（Intermittent fasting: 在特定时间段内禁食），让它们保持微凉，并限制它们的氨基酸摄入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third group is called mTOR. And these genes control and respond to how much amino acids we're taking in. So if you eat a giant steak, you've got a lot of amino acids coming into your body. That'll actually prevent mTOR from hunkering down and keeping you being longer lived. So the mouse experiments actually bear this out. The best way to make a mouse live longer is to reduce the amount of time it eats, so periodic fasting, intermittent fasting, to keep it a little bit cool, and to restrict its amino acids.</p>
</details>

这是小鼠长寿的秘诀，对猴子也同样适用，在**卡路里限制**（Calorie restricted: 限制总热量摄入）的研究中，这些猴子在15年里没有像那些想吃多少就吃多少的猴子那样吃那么多食物。它们得到了保护。它们不仅衰老得更慢。它们患糖尿病和心脏病的几率也更低，它们实际上健康而有活力，而对照组，随意进食的猴子，衰老得更快，也更容易生病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the recipe for long life for a mouse, and it's true for monkeys as well, that have been calorie restricted studies where these monkeys for 15 years didn't eat as much food as the ones that gorged themselves whenever they wanted. And they were protected. They didn't just age slower. They didn't get as much diabetes and heart disease, they were actually fit and healthy, when the control group, eating whatever they wanted, aged and became sick quicker.</p>
</details>

当有些人想到少吃，比如通过限制卡路里来延长寿命时。那似乎不是一种非常愉快的延长寿命的方式。我的意思是，要更长时间地忍受饥饿……那么有没有其他方法可以……你知道，模仿这种效果？或者模拟这种效果？有一些分子可以激活Sirtuin通路，从而“欺骗”身体。例如，在实验室里，如果我给一些小鼠一种叫做**NMN**（Nicotinamide Mononucleotide: 烟酰胺单核苷酸，一种NAD前体，可激活Sirtuins）的分子，它会提高一种叫做**NAD**（Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide: 烟酰胺腺嘌呤二核苷酸，细胞代谢中的关键辅酶）的化学物质的水平，你的身体就会产生超强的防御能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When some people think about eating less, like, calorie restriction as a way to extend their life. That doesn't seem like a very pleasant way to extend life. I mean, to be hungry for longer... So are there other ways to... you know, mimic that effect? Or to simulate that? There are these molecules that turn on the sirtuin pathway, and trick the body. And so, for example, in the lab if I give some of our mice a molecule called 'NMN', which raises the level of a chemical called 'NAD', you get hyperactive defenses in the body.</p>
</details>

你给这些衰老小鼠服用NMN后看到了什么？嗯，我们发生了一点意外。我们给服用NMN的小鼠跑了50%的距离，但实际上其中一些跑得太远了，以至于机器，那个小跑步机，都停止工作了。我们不得不重新编程软件，因为这个程序从未见过跑超过三公里的小鼠。三公里对一只小鼠来说？对一只老鼠来说。它们跑赢了年轻的小鼠。那对我们来说就像一场超级马拉松吗？那可能就像让一个70岁的人跑得比20岁的人更快；更远。是的，所以这些是超级马拉松选手，如果我们对人类也这样做，我想90岁的人也能赢得奥运奖牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what did you see in these... 'senescent mice' that you gave NMN to? Well, we had a bit of an incident. These mice that we gave NMN to ran 50% further, but actually some of them ran so far that the machine, the little treadmill, stopped working. And we had to reprogram the software because this program had never seen a mouse that ran more than three kilometers. Three kilometers for a mouse? For an old mouse. They outran the young mice. And that's like an ultramarathon for us? That would be probably like taking a 70 year-old and making them run faster than a 20 year-old; further. Yes, so these are ultra marathoners, and if we did that to humans I imagine you could have 90 year-olds winning Olympic medals.</p>

### 减缓衰老的六个实践方法

总而言之，你现在可以做六件事来减缓衰老的速度。从零开始：避免DNA损伤。涂防晒霜，避免X射线等等。第一：少吃。**限制卡路里**（Caloric restriction: 限制总热量摄入）。第二：少吃蛋白质，因为你的身体有办法检测你摄入了多少蛋白质。第三：做一些运动。**高强度间歇训练**（High-intensity interval training, HIIT: 一种短时间高强度运动与短暂休息交替进行的训练方式）。让你的心率达到85%，让你的身体感觉就像你在逃离狮子一样。第四：感到不舒服的冷，或者第五：感到不舒服的热。所有这些都会触发你身体的“长寿基因”来维护你的表观基因组。进入“修复和保护模式”而不是“生长和繁殖模式”，如果你想想这些事情，它们通常都是我们不做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to sum up, there are six things that you can do right now to slow the rate of your aging. Starting with zero: avoid DNA damage. Wear sunscreen, avoid x-rays and all that sort of stuff. Number one: eat less. Caloric restriction. Number two: eat less protein, because your body has ways of detecting how much of that you're taking in. Number three: do some exercise. 'High-intensity interval training' (HIIT). Get your heart rate up to 85%, make your body feel like you're running from a lion or something. Number four: be uncomfortably cold, or number five: be uncomfortably hot. All of these things will trigger your body's 'longevity genes' into maintaining your epigenome. Going into 'repair and protect mode' rather than 'grow and reproduce', and if you think about those things, those are generally all the things that we don't do.</p>

### 逆转衰老：山中因子与小鼠实验的突破

但是如果减缓衰老对你来说还不够呢？嗯，这就是我采访Sinclair教授时一个有趣转折的地方，因为他实际上做了一些关于逆转衰老的研究。那么你该怎么做呢？嗯，实际上，你需要将表观基因组重置回更早的时间。但这怎么可能呢？早在2012年，一位名叫**山中伸弥**（Yamanaka: 日本干细胞研究者，因发现诱导多能干细胞而获得诺贝尔奖）的科学家因发现四种因子而获得了诺贝尔奖，这些因子在基因疗法中应用于成年细胞时，可以将整个表观基因组重置回该细胞在胚胎时期的状态。所以它被称为**多能干细胞**（Pluripotent stem cell: 能够分化成体内所有细胞类型的干细胞）。

<p class="english-text">But what if slowing aging isn't enough for you? Well, this is where my interview with professor Sinclair took an interesting turn, because he's actually done some research on reversing aging. So how would you do that? Well, effectively, you would need to take the epigenome and reset it back to an earlier time. But how is that possible? Back in 2012, a scientist named Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize for discovering four factors, which when applied in a gene therapy to an adult cell, would reset the whole epigenome back to how that cell was when it was an embryo. So it is what is called a 'pluripotent stem cell'.</p>
</details>

你不会想把这些因子应用于你的整个身体，因为那样你就会变成一个巨大的肿瘤，因为你的细胞将不知道如何分化。但这确实表明存在重置表观基因组的方法，它们可能是逆转衰老的关键。我们实验室大约在一年前刚刚取得的重大突破是重编程了小鼠的眼睛。我们选择眼睛是因为它是一个非常难以修复的器官，对吧？如果你年老失明，我们认为那是一条单行道，你永远无法恢复视力，但我们决定：无论如何都要尝试一下，放手一搏。

<p class="english-text">Now, you wouldn't want to apply that to your entire body because, well, then you would turn into a giant tumor because your cells wouldn't know how to differentiate. But it does suggest that there are ways of resetting your epigenome, and they could be the key to reversing aging. The big breakthrough that we just had in my lab, finally, you know, about a year or so ago, was to reprogram the eye of a mouse. And the eye, we chose the eye because that's a very hard thing to fix, right? If you go blind when you're older, we think that's a one-way thing, you're never going to recover your vision, but we decided: let's try it anyway, let's go for broke.</p>
</details>

所以我们把基因疗法注射到老年小鼠的眼睛里，让它们的视网膜恢复年轻，逆转了它们视网膜的衰老。那些一岁的小鼠回到了大约两个月大的状态，你猜怎么着？那些小鼠又能看见了，就像它们又年轻了一样。你如何在不将这些眼细胞重置为干细胞的情况下重置它们？嗯，我们必须非常小心，不要将这些细胞重置为干细胞，否则，我们就不会有能看见的小鼠，而会有眼睛后面长着巨大肿瘤的小鼠。

<p class="english-text">So we put our gene therapy in the eye of old mice, turn their retinas to be young again, reversed aging in their retinas. So those one-year old mice went back to about two months, And guess what? Those mice could see again, just like they were young again. How do you reset one of these eye cells without resetting it to just a stem cell? Well, we have to be very careful not to reset these cells to be basically a stem cell, otherwise, we wouldn't have mice that can see, we'd have mice with a giant tumor in the back of their eyes.</p>
</details>

所以我们做了几件事：我们没有使用赢得诺贝尔奖的全部四种重编程因子，我们只使用了三种，我们去掉了其中一种叫做**cMyc**（cMyc: 一种致癌基因）的因子，因为它会导致癌症，而这三种因子似乎是让眼睛年龄倒退但又不过度倒退的正确配方。然后，我们做的第二件事是：我们将其关闭。我们实际上可以在需要时“开启”这个系统，然后再次“关闭”，这样我们就不会让它们在年龄上倒退得太远。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So what we do is a couple of things: we didn't use all of the four reprogramming factors that won the Nobel Prize, we use just three, we leave off one called 'cMyc', which causes cancer, and those three seem to be just the right recipe for taking the age of the eye backwards, but not too far. Then, the second thing we do is: we turn it off. We can actually turn this system 'on' when we want, and 'off' again, so that we don't take them too far back in age.</p>
</details>

你能在任何细胞上做到这一点吗？我们认为我们可以在任何组织中做到这一点。我们现在已经将其应用于整个小鼠，这些小鼠都很好。没有癌症的证据。它们看起来非常健康。所以最大的问题是：你能让一只小鼠的整个身体大幅度倒退，变得完全年轻吗？也许从两岁倒退到两个月。这正是我们现在正在做的。这太令人兴奋了！这实际上是令人惊奇的兴奋！我以为我们只会减缓衰老，现在我们谈论的是衰老重置。你知道吗？我们只重置了眼睛的年龄一次，但我们能做多少次呢？也许是两次。也许是一百次。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Can you do that with any cell? We think we can do this in any tissue. We've now given it to the whole mouse and those mice are fine. No evidence of cancer. They seem to be really quite healthy. So the big question is: can you take a mouse way back, the whole body, and be totally younger? Maybe back from two years, back to two months. And that's what we're doing right now. That's pretty exciting! It's freakishly exciting, actually! I thought we'd just slow down aging, now we're talking about an aging reset. You know what? We've only reset the age of the eye once, But how many times can we do this? Maybe it's twice. Maybe it's a hundred times.</p>

### 总结与展望：水母的启示

Sinclair教授声称他的基因疗法逆转了小鼠眼睛的衰老，并使其恢复了视力。但是将基因疗法应用于你万亿个细胞中的每一个几乎是不可能的。所以为了让这真正奏效并重置整个身体，你需要另一种方法，这就是水母的作用，因为月亮水母——成年水母的任何细胞实际上都可以重置到其生命周期的早期阶段。它可以再次变成一个水螅体。

<p class="english-text">So, professor Sinclair claims that his gene therapy reversed aging in the mouse's eye and allowed it to see again. But applying a gene therapy to every one of your trillion cells is pretty impossible. So in order for this to actually work and reset an entire body, you would need another way, and this is where the jellyfish come in, because 'moon jellyfish'—any cell in an adult jellyfish can actually be reset into an earlier stage of its life cycle. It can become a polyp again.</p>
</details>

所以水母似乎能够激活类似**山中因子**（Yamanaka factors: 四种能将成体细胞重编程为诱导多能干细胞的转录因子）的东西，并将它们的表观基因组重置到它们生命中的早期时间。如果我们能够弄清楚它们是如何做到的，那么也许我们也能对我们自己的细胞做同样的事情。我们确实有能力重置我们的表观基因组，但这通常只在我们处于胚胎阶段时使用，那时我们需要将所有细胞保持为干细胞。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So it seems like the jellyfish are actually capable of activating something like the Yamanaka factors and resetting their epigenomes to an earlier time in their lives. If we were able to figure out how they do that, well, then maybe we could do the same with our own cells. We do have the ability to reset our epigenomes, but that is typically only used when we're in the embryonic stage, when we need to maintain all our cells as stem cells.</p>
</details>

随着我们年龄的增长，包括人类在内的大多数哺乳动物，我们体内的干细胞会随着时间流逝而减少。我们拥有的干细胞也随着时间变得越来越受限于它们可以制造的细胞类型。所以如果我们能理解月亮水母如何能够获取，大概是许多不同种类的细胞，并将其逆向工程为再生过程中所需的细胞，那可能会给我们提供如何在我们自己体内实现这一想法。

<p class="english-text">As we age, most mammals including humans, we lose stem cells over time. And the stem cells we do have become more and more restricted over time to the types of cells they can make. So if we can understand how the 'moon jellyfish' can take, presumably, many different kinds of cells, and reverse-engineer them into the cells it needs during regeneration, that might give us an idea of how to do it in ourselves, as well.</p>
</details>

所以，我仍然认为我们离在整个人体中逆转衰老还有相当长的路要走。但我从与Sinclair教授的谈话中发现有趣的是，至少有一条路线图。至少有一条前进的道路，你可以看到减缓甚至逆转衰老是可能实现的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I still think we're a fair ways off from reversing aging in the entire human body. But what I found interesting from talking to professor Sinclair was that there's at least a roadmap. At least a path ahead where you can see that it could be possible to slow and even reverse aging.</p>
