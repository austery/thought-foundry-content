### 边境枪击事件

**Tracy Mumford**: 接下来是今日头条。我是特蕾西·曼福德。
今天是 1 月 9 日，星期五。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, January 9th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**>>**: 你们的谈话小组将由 Engine 7 和 Medic 314 负责。他们接诊了一名男性，手臂中了两枪，他的妻子则胸部中枪。警方正在赶往现场。昨天在**俄勒冈州波特兰**，**边境巡逻队**特工在一次**交通拦截**中向两人开枪，而就在一天前，一名**ICE**（移民与海关执法局）官员在**明尼阿波利斯**枪杀了一名女子。美国**国土安全部**的一位女发言人表示，波特兰的特工开枪是因为司机试图开车撞他们。该部门在明尼阿波利斯也提出了同样的说法，尽管《纽约时报》的**视频分析**似乎与之相悖。在波特兰，发言人说，边境巡逻队的目标是一名属于**Trend Ara帮派**的**无证移民**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Your talk group is going to be off one engine 7 with medic 314. They have a male who was shot twice in the arm and his wife who was shot in the chest. Police are in route. In Portland, Oregon yesterday, Border Patrol agents fired on two people during a traffic stop just a day after an ICE officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis. A Homeland Security spokeswoman said the agent in Portland fired after the driver tried to run them over. The department made the same claim in Minneapolis, though video analysis by the Times appeared to contradict that. In Portland, the spokeswoman said border patrol was targeting an undocumented immigrant who was a member of the Trend Ara gang.

</details>

**>>**: 波特兰市长呼吁进行**独立调查**，并表示此次枪击事件表明**联邦移民执法**已失控。波特兰不是**军事化特工**的训练场。我们支持明尼阿波利斯。我们支持芝加哥。我们支持洛杉矶。
**>>**: 波特兰警察局长表示，他的警官是在受伤男子拨打 911 电话后才得知枪击事件的。他已经开车离开，急救人员在距离交通拦截地点两英里多远的地方才找到受害者。在紧急广播中，一名急救员说车里的女子胸部受了伤。警察局长说，当他的警官赶到现场时，涉事联邦特工已不在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Portland's mayor called for an independent investigation and said the shooting was a sign that federal immigration efforts are out of control.
**>>**: Portland is not a training ground for militarized agents. We stand with Minneapolis. We stand with Chicago. We stand with LA.
**>>**: The Portland police chief said his officers only learned about the shooting when the injured man called 911. He had driven off and paramedics reached the victims more than 2 miles from where the traffic stop happened. On emergency radio broadcasts, an EMT said that the woman in the car had a chest wound. The police chief said when his officers did get to the scene, the federal agents involved in the shooting were no longer there.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，《纽约时报》获悉，几周前，**ICE** 总部官员向全国各地的特工发出了**严厉警告**。在一封电子邮件中，他们被告知针对特工的**抗议和威胁**有所增加。邮件称，他们应“准备好在面临**迫在眉睫的威胁**时采取**适当且果断的行动**”。这封邮件由**执法与遣返行动部门**主管签署，他写道：“我对你们每个人都拥有采取适当应对措施的培训和知识，充满信心。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, the Times has learned that several weeks ago, officials at ICE headquarters sent out a stark warning to its agents across the country. In an email, they were told about an increase in protests and threats against officers. And the email said that they should be quote prepared to take appropriate and decisive action should you be faced with an imminent threat. It was signed by the head of enforcement and removal operations who wrote, "I have full faith and confidence that each of you possess the training and knowledge to exercise the appropriate response.

</details>

### 特朗普的权力观

**>>**: 你认为在世界舞台上，你的权力有任何制约吗？如果你想做什么，有什么能阻止你吗？
**>>**: 是的，有一件事。我自己的道德，我自己的头脑。这是唯一能阻止我的东西，这非常好。
**Tracy Mumford**: 本周在接受《纽约时报》采访时，**特朗普总统**最直白地阐述了他的世界观，他说，在外交事务上，他是作为**总司令**的权力的唯一制约者。他说，引述：“**我不需要国际法**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Do you see any checks on your power on the world stage? Is there anything that could stop you if you wanted?
**>>**: Yeah, there's one thing. My own morality, my own mind. It's the only thing that can stop and that's very good.
**Tracy Mumford**: In an interview with the Times this week, President Trump laid out the most blunt articulation yet of his worldview, saying that he is the only check on his power as commander-in-chief when it comes to foreign affairs. He said, quote, I don't need international law.

</details>

**>>**: 我们必须保护我们认为自己有责任保护的世界部分地区的安全。**北约**根本不被**俄罗斯**或**中国**所惧怕。一点也不怕。我们之所以被极度惧怕，是因为我建立了强大的军队。如果我没有重建军队，我们就会和他们一样。
**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普断言，他拥有完全的自由，可以动用军事、经济或政治力量来确保美国在全球的**统治地位**。在与《纽约时报》记者会面时，他滔滔不绝地谈论着**条约**等事务，并明确表示，在他看来，前几任总统在使用美国武力方面过于谨慎，未能发挥其全部潜力。他还明确表示，他故意利用自己**不可预测**的声誉以及迅速诉诸**军事行动**的意愿，以此来**胁迫其他国家**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: We have to keep parts of the world safe that we feel responsible for. NATO is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit. We're tremendously feared because of the fact that I built a military. If I didn't rebuild the military, we'd be just like them.
**Tracy Mumford**: Trump asserted that he has complete freedom to use military, economic, or political power to secure American dominance around the world. Brushing aside things like treaties on topic after topic while sitting down with Times reporters, Trump made clear that in his mind, previous presidents had been too cautious to use American force to its full potential. And he also made clear that he intentionally uses his reputation for unpredictability as well as his willingness to quickly resort to military action as a way of coercing other countries.

</details>

### 委内瑞拉军事行动争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，
**>>**: 毫无疑问，轰炸另一个国家的首都并推翻其总统是**战争行为**。简单明了。美国宪法没有任何条款赋予总统这样的权力。
**Tracy Mumford**: **参议院**昨日罕见地以**两党一致**的方式谴责了特朗普，52 名议员投票支持一项旨在**限制总统在委内瑞拉动用武力**的措施。特朗普在未与**国会**协商或获得授权的情况下，就对委内瑞拉采取了近期行动。**参议员兰德·保罗**表示，部分共和党人之所以与民主党人一起投票，是因为特朗普本周表示美国可能在委内瑞拉陷入多年。现在，下周将进行另一次投票，届时将迫使特朗普在继续在委内瑞拉的军事行动前获得国会批准，尽管特朗普可以**否决**任何国会最终通过的措施。在社交媒体上，特朗普抨击了那五名投票支持**国会**对其**战争权力**进行约束的共和党人。他称之为愚蠢，并敦促选民将他们赶下台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile,
**>>**: make no mistake, bombing another nation's capital and removing their president is an act of war. Plain and simple. No provision in the Constitution provides such power to the presidency.
**Tracy Mumford**: The Senate delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump yesterday with 52 lawmakers voting to advance a measure that would curb the president's use of force in Venezuela. Trump launched the US's recent actions there with no consultation or authorization by Congress. And Senator Ran Paul suggested that part of what convinced a handful of Republicans to join with Democrats in the vote was Trump saying this week that the US could be involved in Venezuela for years. The stage is now set for another vote next week that would force Trump to get congressional approval for continued operations in Venezuela, though Trump could veto any measure that Congress eventually passes. In a post on social media, Trump lashed out at the five Republicans who voted to assert congressional authority over his war powers. He called it stupidity and urged voters to push them out of office.

### 伊朗国内抗议

**Tracy Mumford**:
**>>**: [欢呼]
**>>**: 在**伊朗**，针对该国**威权政府**的全国性抗议活动于昨晚升级。人群聚集在**德黑兰**及其他主要城市，纵火焚烧汽车和政府大楼。几周以来，由于一系列问题，民众愤怒地走上街头，该国的不稳定情绪一直在积聚。其中最大的问题是伊朗**疲软的经济**。仅上个月，**通货膨胀**就超过了 **40%**。政府试图通过一系列措施来平息抗议活动。他们最近宣布了一项计划，向大多数公民每月支付约 7 美元，这笔钱在德黑兰大约够买两张披萨。昨天，在伊朗安全部门表示将对示威者采取**强硬措施**后，该国的**互联网被关闭**了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**:
**>>**: [cheering]
**>>**: In Iran, nationwide protests against the country's authoritarian government escalated last night. Crowds gathered in Thyron and other major cities, setting cars and government buildings on fire. For weeks, unrest has been building in the country as people have taken to the streets in anger over a range of issues. The biggest one, Iran's failing economy. Last month alone, inflation was over 40%. The government has tried to quell the protests with a range of measures. They recently announced a plan to give most citizens a monthly payment of about $7, roughly enough to buy two pizzas in Tyrron. And yesterday, the country's internet was shut down after Iran's security services said they would take tough measures against demonstrators.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 通过电话联系。十多名目击者告诉《纽约时报》，抗议活动仍在继续，全国各地的城市都形成了大批人群。他们说，人群构成多样，有男人、女人、年轻人、老年人。有些人高喊“打倒哈梅内伊”，这是对**伊朗最高领袖**的提及。人权组织称，近几天来，**数十人**在与政府军的冲突中丧生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: reached by phone. More than a dozen witnesses told the Times the protests still continued with large crowds forming in cities around the country. They said the crowds were diverse, men, women, young, old. Some chanted death to ham, a reference to Iran's Supreme Leader. Human rights groups say that in recent days, dozens of people have been killed in clashes with government forces.

</details>

### Poly Market 争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，
**>>**: 你可以押注任何事情。超级碗冠军、加密货币价格，甚至泰勒·斯威夫特的订婚。
**Tracy Mumford**: **投注网站 Poly Market** 已成为互联网和金融界的现象。
**>>**: 选举、通货膨胀、名人爆红、外星人。只要人们关心，就有市场。
**Tracy Mumford**: 去年，该平台交易额约达 **200 亿美元**，人们押注于你甚至不知道可以投注的事情。现在，该网站引发了一个非常奇怪的情况，让互联网上的人们争论在 Poly Market 上，什么才算得上真正意义上的“**入侵**”一个国家。很多人押注美国将入侵委内瑞拉。因此，当美军迅速行动并逮捕了该国领导人**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**时，他们以为自己即将领取奖金。但 Poly Market 在该特定投注页面上添加了一条说明，称美国的任务是“抓捕并撤离”任务，这在技术上不被视为入侵。用户对此并不满意，有人发帖称这分明就是入侵。当《纽约时报》联系该网站时，该公司拒绝置评，而监管 Poly Market 的政府机构——**商品期货交易委员会**——也没有回应。
**Tracy Mumford**: 目前，人们仍在该网站上对其他投注投入资金，例如美国是否会收购**格陵兰**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally,
**>>**: you can bet on anything. Super Bowl winners, crypto prices, even Taylor Swift's engagement.
**Tracy Mumford**: The betting site Poly Market has become an internet and financial phenomenon.
**>>**: Elections, inflation, celebrity breakouts, aliens. If people care about it, there is a market.
**Tracy Mumford**: Roughly $20 billion went through the platform last year with people gambling on things you didn't even know it was possible to bet on. Now the site has sparked a truly bizarre situation that has the internet debating what does it mean to really invade a country on Poly Market. A bunch of people had bet that the US would invade Venezuela. So when US forces swept in and seized the country's leader Nicholas Maduro, they thought they were about to collect their winnings. But Poly Market has added a note to the page for that particular bet saying the US mission was a snatch and extract job and that technically doesn't count as an invasion. Users didn't love that with one posting everyone is calling it an invasion. The company declined to comment when the Times reached out and the government agency which regulates Poly Market, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, didn't respond.
**Tracy Mumford**: At present, people are still pouring money into other bets on the site, like if the US will acquire Greenland.

### 格陵兰新闻测验

**Tracy Mumford**: 以上是今日头条。如果您想玩周五新闻测验，就在广告之后。
本节目由 Will Jarvis、Yan Stewart 和我 Tracy Mumford 制作。
原创主题曲由 Dan Powell 创作。特别感谢 Isabella Anderson、Lissa Anderson、Zoe Murphy 和 Paula Schuman。
现在，是时候进行测验了。我们准备了几个关于《纽约时报》报道过的新闻问题。准备好了吗？
**>>**: 美国打算购买格陵兰吗？
**Tracy Mumford**: 嗯，这从一开始就是总统的意图。他说，“我们需要格陵兰。”本周，特朗普政府加倍强调了其收购格陵兰的计划。
**>>**: 显然，格陵兰应该成为美国的一部分，即使这会遭到格陵兰和美国一些最亲密盟友的反对。
**Tracy Mumford**: 那么，这里有一个快速的抢答环节，测试您对特朗普声称应属于美国的这个岛屿的了解。我们有四个问题。准备好了吗？首先，格陵兰是哪个国家的半自治领土？[音乐] 答案是**丹麦**。它的首都是[音乐]**努克**。好的。第三个问题，格陵兰的总人口[音乐]大约相当于美国哪个城市？旧金山、缅因州波特兰，还是内布拉斯加州奥马哈？答案是，[音乐]格陵兰只有大约 58,000 人。这比缅因州波特兰的人口略少一些。[音乐]最后一个问题，这有点难，因为岛上植被很少。[音乐]历史上，格陵兰人从什么东西中获取大量维生素 C？[音乐]答案是鲸鱼皮，这显然是维生素的极佳来源。

**Tracy Mumford**: Those are the headlines. If you'd like to play the Friday news quiz, it is just after these credits. This show is made by Will Jarvis, Yan Stewart, and me, Tracy Mumford. Original theme by Dan Powell. Special thanks to Isabella Anderson, Lissa Anderson, Zoe Murphy, and Paula Schuman. Now, time for the quiz. We've got a few questions for you about stories the Times has been covering. Buckle up.
**>>**: Does the US intend to buy Greenland?
**Tracy Mumford**: Well, that's always been the president's intent from the very beginning. He said,
**>>**: "We need Greenland."
**Tracy Mumford**: This week, the Trump administration doubled down on its plans to acquire Greenland.
**>>**: Obviously, Greenland should be part of the United States,
**Tracy Mumford**: even over the objections of Greenland and some of America's closest allies. So, here is a quick speed round for you, testing your knowledge of the island Trump says should be part of the US. We got four questions. Ready? First, Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of what country? The answer, Denmark. Its capital city is Nuke. Okay. Number three, Greenland's entire population is roughly the same size as which of these US cities? San Francisco, Portland, Maine, or Omaha, Nebraska? The answer, there are only about 58,000 people in Greenland. That is just a little bit less than Portland, Maine. And last question, it is a toughy because there is so little vegetation on the island. Historically, Greenlanders got a lot of their vitamin C from what? The answer, whale skin, which apparently is a very rich source of the vitamin.

### 健康饮食指南

**Tracy Mumford**: 接下来，说到补充维生素，本周，卫生官员发布了**新的饮食指南**，包括一个改进版的食物金字塔。**梅梅德·奥兹博士**（Dr. Memed Oz），他在政府部门任职，大力宣传了其他一些更新的健康建议，称这些建议与那些以长寿闻名的地区的生活方式相符。
**>>**: 例如，看看世界各地的**蓝色区域**，人们最长寿的地方，这有时是他们饮食的一部分。所以，在这些饮食指南中，但其含义是早餐不要摄入。
**Tracy Mumford**: 他说的是什么食物或饮料？在最好的情况下，我认为你不应该喝酒，但它确实让人们有机会与朋友联络和社交，而且没有什么比以安全的方式与朋友共度美好时光更健康的了。
**Tracy Mumford**: 新的联邦饮酒指南建议人们**限制酒精摄入量**，尽管它不再列出具体的数量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next up, speaking of getting your vitamins, this week, health officials rolled out new dietary guidelines, including a revamped food pyramid. And Dr. Memed Oz, who serves in the administration, talked up some of the other updated health advice, saying it was in keeping with places that are famous for long lifespans.
**>>**: If you look at the blue zones, for example, around the world where people live the longest is sometimes part of their diet. So there is on these dietary guidelines, but the implication is don't have it for breakfast.
**Tracy Mumford**: What food or beverage was he talking about? In the best case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize, and there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.
**Tracy Mumford**: The new federal guidance on drinking says people should limit their alcohol consumption, though it no longer lists specific amounts.

### 冰球传奇格伦·霍尔

**Tracy Mumford**: 这是最后一个问题。
**>>**: **芝加哥**门将**格伦·霍尔**（Glenn Hall）闪耀的扑救阻止了**红翼队**得分。这位从根本上改变了冰球运动的**NHL**门将本周去世，享年 94 岁。
**>>**: 霍尔几乎是坚不可摧的。
**Tracy Mumford**: 在格伦·霍尔出现之前，门将几乎整个比赛都在站立。但霍尔开始跪下，以便将双腿张开在冰面上，基本上挡住整个球门。如果你今天看一场冰球比赛，几乎每个门将都使用这种技术。你的问题是，这叫什么？别担心，有提示。有提示。我会给你几个包含这个词的短语。想想“……效应”、“……刀”，或者“像……一样漂浮”？答案是，这被称为“**蝴蝶式**”（butterfly style），这让霍尔离冰面更近了。有趣的事实，我想这很有趣，他在门将戴面具成为标准之前就开始这样做，并且留下了伤疤作为证明。在霍尔的职业生涯中，他估计自己被飞来的冰球缝了 **300 多针**。一次射门在他脸上留下了一道大伤口并打掉了一颗牙后，他记得一位牙医告诉他他有多幸运。他透过肿胀的嘴唇回答说：“我不觉得幸运。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And last question for you.
**>>**: The sparkling acrobatics of Chicago goalie Glenn Hall prevent the Red Wings from scoring this week. The NHL goalie who fundamentally changed the game of hockey died at the age of 94.
**>>**: Hall is virtually indestructible.
**Tracy Mumford**: Before Glenn Hall came along, goalies spent almost the entire game standing up. But Hall started dropping to his knees so he could spread his lower legs out on the ice. and basically block the entire net. If you watch a hockey game today, almost every goalie uses that technique. Your question, what is it called? Don't worry, there are hints. There are hints. I will give you a few phrases that use the word. Think the blank effect, a blank knife, or float like a blank? The answer, it's called the butterfly style, which brought Hall way closer to the ice. And fun fact, I guess it's fun, he was doing this before goalies wearing masks was standard, and he had the scars to prove it. Over the course of Hall's career, he estimated he got over 300 stitches from flying pucks. After one shot on goal left him with a big gash and knocked out a tooth, he said he remembered a dentist telling him how lucky he was. He said he replied through swollen lips, "I don't feel lucky."
