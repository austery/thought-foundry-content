### 加拿大与Stellantis的争议

联邦政府正在挑战**Stellantis**（一家跨国汽车制造商）将其Jeep Compass车型的生产线南迁的决定。加拿大是否应该超越传统的“三大”汽车制造商，转而拥抱中国日益崛起的汽车产业呢？

<p class="english-text">The federal government is challenging Stalantis' decision to shift production of the Jeep Compass down south. Is it time for Canada to look beyond the big three automakers? Should we embrace China's ascendant auto industry instead?</p>
</details>

我向**麦克马斯特大学**（McMaster University）W. Booth工程实践与技术学院的副教授、前**丰田汽车加拿大制造公司**（Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada）总经理Greg Moru提出了这个问题。Greg，欢迎来到节目。你今天过得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I asked Greg Moru, associate professor in the W. Booth School of Engineering Practice and Technology at McMaster University and former general manager at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. Greg, welcome to the program. How are you doing today?</p>
</details>

**Greg Moru:** 很好，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Good. Glad to be here.</p>
</details>

我想从渥太华和Stellantis的事件开始。渥太华正在针对Stellantis将其原计划在宾顿（Bmpton）的汽车生产线转移到美国一事，启动一项争议解决程序。这有任何实质性的约束力吗？这一举动能否在追究其责任方面起到任何实质性作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to start with Ottawa and Stalantis. Ottawa is launching a dispute resolution process uh against Stalantis for moving a planned vehicle production from Bmpton to the US. Does this have any teeth? Does does this move anything substantial uh to hold them accountable?</p>
</details>

**Greg Moru:** 嗯，这些协议各不相同，我相信Stellantis肯定签署了关于其在温莎（Windsor）的工作以及我们正在具体讨论的宾顿（Bmpton）扩建项目，还有他们与**LG**（一家韩国跨国企业集团）在温莎合资建设电池工厂的协议。所以，所有这些协议都会有所不同。它们之间可能存在一些联系，但我不知道具体细节，他们也没有分享，因为这被认为是专有信息。但我过去曾研究过这些协议，它们通常以这样的方式获得资金：如果有一项协议规定你将引入这项技术，你将生产这款产品，如果你满足了要求并投入了资金，加拿大政府和安大略省政府就会以实物形式提供资金。如果你不这样做，就会就未来的行动或计划变更进行某种讨论，而计划确实会随着时间的推移而改变。就宾顿而言，据我所知，问题在于他们已经提供了1.1亿加元的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, every one of those agreements are different and I'm sure that Stellantis signed agreements for their for their uh work in Windsor and their extension of what we're talking specifically about in Bmpton as well as their joint venture with LG to uh to build batteries in Windsor. So, all of those will be different. They may have some connections between the two of them. I don't know the details of that. They haven't shared them. they it's considered proprietary. But I've looked at those in the past and they typically are they they are funded in such a way that if you know there's an agreement you're going to bring this technology you're going to build this product and if you meet your requirements and you spend the money the government of Canada in the province of Ontario will send the funds uh in kind and one and if you don't do that you'll have some kind of a discussion about what to do going forward or change plans change and plans do change as they go through. The issue is at this point from what I understand in so far as the Bmpton is concerned is that they funded $110 million.</p>
</details>

听起来很多。这可不是小数目。但坦率地说，如果Stellantis最终被告知，要退出宾顿需要支付1.1亿加元，我想他们很可能会说“我们退出”。所以你必须小心你的要求。话虽如此，坦率地说，我认为加拿大政府向Stellantis施压并不是一件坏事。我的意思是，最直接、也许最令人满意的一点是，这让他们必须面对现实。但坦率地说，让他们面对现实，可能会导致他们说：“听着，我们对宾顿没有任何计划。”承认他们对宾顿没有任何计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sounds like a lot. It's more than walking around change. But if uh frankly, if Stalantis comes through this and someone says for you to get out of BMPon it's going to cost you $110 million, I think they'll probably say we're out of there. Um so you got to be careful what you ask for. Having said that, I don't think it's a terrible thing, frankly, for uh the government of Canada to put the put pressure on Stalantis. I mean, the the first and and perhaps most satisfying aspect of that is it it holds their feet to the fire. But by holding this feet to the fire, frankly, it c it may cause them to say, "Listen, we don't have anything for Bmpton." Admit that they don't have anything for Bmpton.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，他们将对那些仍在坚持、抱着每小时45加元工作或希望的现有员工有所交代，他们将能够切断关系，坦率地说，继续他们的生活。他们越早做到这一点越好，这会很艰难，对每个人都很难。坦率地说，我坐在这里发表这样的声明很容易，但这让他们能够继续前进，因为宾顿没有人愿意雇佣那些每小时挣45加元的人，因为他们知道，可以理解的是，一旦他们被召回，第二天就会离开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And frankly, they'll be doing those employees their existing employees that are hanging on with those $45 an hour jobs or the promise or the hope of those $45 an hour jobs, they'll be able to cut their ties and get and frankly get on with their lives. And uh and the sooner they can do that, it'll be tough. It's difficult for everyone. Frankly, it's easy for me to sit here and uh and and and make that pronouncement, but it it allows them to do to go forward because nobody in in Bmpton wants to hire anybody that makes $45 an hour because they know understandably that they're gone the very next day when they get called back. So,</p>
</details>

所以，这是一颗难以下咽的药丸，但在某种程度上，它可能是工业部长为这次对话带来的一个积极因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's a it's a it's a tough pill, but in in and per but perhaps it's a uh it's a positive attribute of of what uh the industry minister has added to the conversation.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大汽车工业的衰落与“三大”的困境

说到难以下咽的药丸，我们现在是否应该讨论一下加拿大人对美国**D3**（底特律三大汽车制造商：通用汽车、福特、克莱斯勒，后来克莱斯勒并入Stellantis）的信心应该有多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, speaking of tough pills to swallow, is there a conversation right now that we should be having about how much faith we should Canadians should have in the big three US automakers right now?</p>
</details>

**Greg Moru:** 嗯，通常会说，在2000年或1999年，那是加拿大汽车工业的巅峰时期，我们在这个国家生产了300万辆汽车。其中绝大部分是由D3生产的。去年，我们在加拿大生产了130万辆汽车。最大的制造商是**丰田**（Toyota），排名第一，第二是**本田**（Honda）。他们负责了该国约四分之三的产量。所以，我们一直不断地听到D3的承诺和声明，但与此同时，他们的产量却在稳步下降。坦率地说，Stellantis仍然在温莎坚持着。那基本上是他们制造的足迹，也是加拿大最大的D3制造基地。但**通用汽车**（General Motors）的产量从本世纪初的超过一百万辆（包括在奥沙瓦（Ashawa）生产的一百万辆）下降到今天的仅约10万辆。他们曾经是加拿大最大的汽车制造商，现在是第四大。坦率地说，如果不是因为**福特**（Ford）现在什么也没生产，他们将是第五大，也就是最小的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's it's common to say that in the year 2000, which or 1999, which was the the high water mark for the Canadian auto industry, we made 3 million vehicles in this country. The the vast majority of those were made by the D3. Last year, we made 1.3 million vehicles in Canada. The big uh the big manufacturers were Toyota at number one, and number two was uh was Honda. They're responsible, excuse me, for about three quarters of the production in in this country. So, we've had a steady diet of uh of promises and pronouncements by the D3 and and and uh corresponding with that is a steady decline in their production. Frankly, uh you know, Stellantis is still hanging in there in Windsor. um that's basically their foot their manufacturing footprint and that's the largest D3 manufacturing uh out outlet in in Canada. But General Motors has gone from well over a million including a million in production in Ashawa in the early parts of this uh century to a rump of about a 100,000 today. They they used to be the largest automaker in Canada. Now they're the fourth largest. Frankly, they'd be the fifth largest, in other words, the smallest, if it weren't for the fact that Ford isn't making anything right now.</p>
</details>

### 历史经验：加拿大汽车工业的两次转型

我想让你继续谈谈这一点。我希望你能给我们上一堂历史课。这并不是加拿大汽车工业第一次面临挑战。请带我们回到50年代和60年代，以及我们是如何度过那段时期，从中我们可以学到什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want us to uh stay on [clears throat] this page. I'm hoping you can give us a bit of a history lesson here. This isn't the first time uh that Canada's auto industry has faced challenges. Take us back [clears throat] to the 50s and 60s uh and how that uh how we've sort of come through that uh and what we can learn from theirs.</p>
</details>

**Greg Moru:** 所以，我们可以从加拿大政府，主要是与安大略省政府一起采取的工业政策措施中吸取很多很好的教训。回到50年代末60年代初，这个行业开始遭受打击。我们对从美国进口的汽车征收17.5%的关税，这基本上创造了一个环境，如果你想在加拿大销售汽车，你就必须在加拿大制造汽车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there there are a lot of good lessons to be learned from the industrial policy measures that the governments of Canada primarily alongside the government of Ontario have have taken us. Back in the late 50s early 60s the industry was starting to suffer. It had we had 17 and a half I believe percent tariffs on vehicles coming in from uh from the US which essentially made for an environment where if you wanted to sell a car in Canada you had to make that car in Canada.</p>
</details>

因此，加拿大人可以理解地感到有些困惑，因为他们为本质上相同的车辆支付了更高的价格，因为当你无法实现规模经济时，你就无法以有竞争力的价格提供产品。与此同时，当时欧洲货币贬值，欧洲车辆大量涌入。然后经济也遭受打击，所有这些都意味着加拿大汽车工业的就业开始急剧下降。因此，行业面临压力。所以加拿大所做的，也是加拿大一贯的做法，就是成立一个皇家委员会，并将其稍微推迟一下。**Vincent Bladen**（加拿大经济学家，曾任皇家委员会主席）——我要讲很多故事——Vincent Bladen被任命为皇家专员，他听到了很多有趣的事情，包括**加拿大联合汽车工会**（United Auto Workers of Canada）提出的我们应该拥有一家加拿大自己的汽车公司的建议，这在当前时代可能也会引起共鸣。但最终，所有这些都促成了1965年的**汽车协定**（Auto Pact: 加拿大与美国之间关于汽车产品贸易的协定）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Canadians were understandably uh a little a little flumxed because they were paying more for for essentially the same vehicles because it when you can't achieve economies of scale, you can't uh you can't offer products at a at a competitive price. Meanwhile, we had the devaluation of uh of of currencies in Europe at that time and we had a uh had a uh influx of European vehicles. Um and then and then the economy was suffering and so all that meant was that the uh that employment started to crater in the Canadian auto industry. So there was pressure placed upon the industry. So what Canada did was what Canada does is set up a royal commission and kick it down the road a little bit. And Vincent Bladen, I'm going to tell you lots of stories. Vincent Braden was appointed the uh the Royal Commissioner and he heard lots of interesting things including the a presentation from the United Auto Workers of Canada that we should have a uh have a Canadian-owned automobile company which sound which will probably resonate in local times current times as well. But ultimately from out of all of that came something called the auto pact in 1965.</p>
</details>

它的实施方式是，你在加拿大每销售一辆车，就需要在加拿大制造一辆车。不一定非得是同一款车，但如果你是一家每年在加拿大销售10万辆汽车的公司，你就必须承诺每年在加拿大制造10万辆汽车。为了确保你不仅仅是从美国进口车辆，然后例如给它们装上轮毂盖就说是在这里制造的，我们规定每辆车必须有60%的加拿大附加值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the way it was implemented is you needed to to make a vehicle in Canada for everyone you sold. Didn't need to be the vehicle, but if you if you were a company selling a 100,000 vehicles a year in Canada, you had to commit to make a 100,000 vehicles a year in Canada. and to make sure that uh you weren't just uh um bringing in vehicles from the US for example and uh and and and putting some hub caps on them for example and saying there we made it here it we had a 60% Canadian value added for every for for the uh for the vehicles.</p>
</details>

你提到了汽车协定，我想接着谈谈。你提到了汽车协定以及它背后的人物。这些谈判背后的人物在多大程度上决定了一项好协议的成败？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh you mentioned I want to pick up on the auto pack. You mentioned the auto pack but and and [clears throat] you mentioned the people behind it. To what extent do the personalities uh behind these negotiations make the difference of a of a good deal?</p>
</details>

**Greg Moru:** 嗯，那是汽车协定，当然也有与此相关的人物。但如果你真的想谈论人物，那就到了加拿大汽车工业的下一个危机点，也就是70年代末80年代初。我们经历了1973年和1979年的**OPEC**（石油输出国组织）石油危机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um well that that's the auto pact and and and there are personalities associated with that as well. But if you really want to talk about personalities, you come to the next uh crisis point for the Canadian auto industry, which is the 19 the late 70s, early 1980s. We had uh the the um OPEC oil crisis of 1973, 1979.</p>
</details>

汽油价格飙升。北美消费者想要更便宜的汽车。当时北美汽车制造商无法生产高质量的小型汽车。于是日本汽车进入市场，对当时我们称之为“三大”的汽车制造商造成了巨大冲击，并提出了“如果你在这里销售，你就必须在这里制造”的理念，我们今天仍然能听到这种说法，尤其是在宾顿（Bmpton）问题和挑战之后。当时的关键人物是**Ed Lumley**（加拿大政治家，曾任贸易和工业部长），他是贸易和工业部长。他今年早些时候去世了，但坦率地说，对于像我这样的汽车工业政策研究者来说，Ed Lumley简直是个英雄。坦率地说，如果不是因为Ed Lumley的个性和魄力，加拿大今天就不会有汽车工业。因为他把“在这里销售，在这里制造”的口号带到了日本，他非常强硬，他不断地使用“大棒”政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Gas prices went way up. North Americans wanted cheaper cars. North American automakers didn't make good quality um small cars at that point in time. So the Japanese entered the market and caused all kinds of upheaval by the uh by the then what we known we called to the the big three and this notion of if you sell here you must build here and we still hear that today and uh in the aftermath of of Bmpton's issues and challenges. So the personality at the time was uh was Ed Lumley and he was the uh trade and industry minister. He he he passed away earlier this year but he frankly for auto industrial policy um researchers such as myself, Ed Lumbly becomes a bit of a hero. And frankly, there would be no auto industry in Canada today if it weren't for the personality and forcefulness of Ed Lumbley because he took that build here uh sell here build here mantra and he took it to Japan and he was very forceful and he used the steady diet of of of</p>
</details>

如果你不在这里建厂，我们就会对你征收高额关税。我们将要求内容条款。我们将在温哥华港检查每一辆汽车，以确保它们安全，并堵塞港口，让你寸步难行。这些都是威胁，但他也说：“但如果你来这里，你将受到欢迎，我们将为你创造一个积极的环境，我们将使用一种叫做**关税减免**（Duty Remission: 政府对特定商品进口关税的全部或部分返还或免除）的工具，让你在这里更有优势。”换句话说，如果你承诺在这里制造车辆或在这里采购零部件，或两者的某种组合，我们将减免你为进口车辆支付的那些关税或部分关税。因此，他们建立了所有这些有趣的政策工具来鼓励日本生产。

<details>

<p class="english-text">sticks. If you don't build here, we're going to tariff the heck out of you. We're going to require content provisions. We're going to we're going to inspect every car in the port of Vancouver to make sure that they're safe and and back up the port and uh make it difficult for you. These were the threats, but he said also, "But if you come here, you're going to be welcomed and uh and we're going to make it uh positive for you, and we're going to use this uh tool called duty remission um to uh to make it more advantageous for you to be here." In other words, we're going to remit those duties you pay or some of those duties you pay on your incoming vehicles</p>
</details>

从那时起，我们有了**铃木**（Suzuki）与通用汽车合作在英格索尔（Ingersoll）建立了Cammy工厂，这正是目前讨论中的。丰田来到了剑桥（Cambridge），本田去了阿利斯顿（Alliston）。这些都是非常小的工厂，丰田在剑桥只有5万辆的产能，阿利斯顿只有4万辆，而一个全面规模的汽车组装厂大约是25万辆。但它们逐渐发展壮大，现在丰田每年在剑桥和伍德斯托克（Woodstock）生产约50万辆汽车，本田每年在阿利斯顿生产约40万辆汽车。这又回到了人物很重要的观点。Greg，我想在我们最后一分钟的对话中，讨论我们现在需要走向何方？你的研究表明，中国似乎是加拿大汽车工业一个非常有吸引力的合作伙伴。请告诉我们为什么我们应该或可能应该朝那个方向看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you commit to build vehicles here or purchase parts here or some combination of the above. So, they established all of these interesting um policy tools to encourage Japanese production. So from that we had uh Suzuki which came into uh to to uh alongside General Motors for the Cammy plant in ingresol which is under discussion right now and Toyota came into Cambridge and uh and and and Honda went to Allist and so and they were very small plants 50,000 for Toyota um 40,000 for Allist when a uh when a when an when a full scale um assembly plant is about 250,000 but they grew and now Toyota makes about 500,000 vehicles a year in Cambridge and Woodstock and Honda makes about 400,000 give or take every year in Allist which comes back to the point that personalities are important. Greg, you I want to have a conversation of in our last minute where do we need to go now? Your research has shown uh in your research you have probably seen that China looks like a very attractive partner for Canada in the auto industry. Tell us why we we may should or why we should be looking in that direction.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大汽车工业的未来：拥抱中国？

**Greg Moru:** 嗯，如果纯粹从汽车工业政策的角度来看，毫无疑问，中国是我们应该追求的方向。当然会有很多人不同意我的观点，但我们需要进行这场辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if you look at it purely from the perspective of of automotive industrial policy, there's no question China is the is the is the avenue we should pursue. And there will be all kinds of people that disagree with me about that and and and we need but we need to have that debate. Um</p>
</details>

我理解中国在许多其他方面也很困难。我们不需要——我也不会深入讨论这些。如果我们要遵循你我所经历的教训，即与最强大或正在崛起的汽车制造商建立联系——60年代是美国，80年代是日本，那么现在显然是正在崛起的汽车制造商，尤其是在我们迈向出行电动化的时候。我们在北美在这方面进展不如世界其他地区快，但如果我们朝着这个方向发展，中国显然是领导者。例如，我自己的研究表明，过去十年中，中国在汽车专利方面的生成速度大约是美国的五倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I understand that China is difficult for lots of other reasons as well. We don't need to and and and I won't get into those. of China. If we follow the lessons that that you and I have gone through between attaching ourselves to the strongest or ascendant automakers, first in the 60s with the US, second in the 80s with Japan, and now clearly the ascendant automaker, particularly as we move into the electrification of mobility. We're not moving as quickly in in in North America as the rest of the world, but if we move in that direction, China is clearly the leader. My own research, for example, shows that China generates automotive patents and have had and have for the past decade at a rate of about 5 to one over the US.</p>
</details>

所以，你可以在一段时间内不像竞争对手那样创新，并且保持良好。但从长远来看，美国汽车工业没有任何迹象表明它将成为未来的全球领导者。美国工业政策措施或能源政策措施也没有任何迹象表明，继续将我们的工业与美国工业联系在一起是最好的选择。所以我知道中国在许多不同方面都具有挑战性，但如果我们纯粹从“我们希望加拿大拥有汽车工业吗？”的角度来看，我们需要进行这场对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you can get away with with with not innovating for to the same degree as your competitors for a while and uh and and and be okay. But over the long term, there's nothing about the US auto industry that suggests that it is going to be a global leader going forward. And there's nothing about the US industrial policy measures or the energy policy measures that suggest that the uh that tethering continuing to try to tether our industry to the US industry is the best bet. So I know China is is challenging for lots of different reasons, but if we're looking at it pure from where do we want to be in in so do we want an auto industry in Canada? We need to have that conversation.</p>
