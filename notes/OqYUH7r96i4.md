title: 重燃美国活力：a16z 创始人解析硅谷与国防的未来

### 引言：中心化控制 vs. 资本主义活力

资本主义的方式是混乱的，但你拥有活力作为你的优势。让我们回到宏观层面的问题：美国总体上是世界上一股向善的力量吗？美国的成功对世界是否重要？美国的价值观、西方的价值观在世界上占据主导地位是否重要？世界不陷入苏联式共产主义的全面蔓延是否重要？而另一个方向则是在对抗我们文化、历史和制度的一切。这种思想竟然有吸引力，就像某些人身上存在一种奇怪的心理缺陷。他们总是渴望中央控制，总认为那样更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The capitalist approach is messy but you have dynamism on your side. Just come back to the big picture thing. Is America in aggregate a force for good in the world? Is it important for the world that America succeed? Is it important that American values, Western values are preeminent of the world? Is it important that the world not devolve into a complete Soviet communism everywhere? The other direction is literally fighting everything about our culture, everything about our history, everything about our system. And the fact that it has appeal is like a weird psychological defect some people have. They just always want central control. They always think it's better.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便说一句，这种模式通常是行不通的。它常常会失败，因为世界太富于变化，而那种迭代周期根本不够快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And by the way, it routinely doesn't work. Like it routinely fails because the world is too dynamic and that's not nearly a fast enough iteration cycle.</p>
</details>

>> 人们想要的，正是我们为这个投资类别命名的东西。我们如何建设**美国活力**（American Dynamism：a16z 提出的一个投资理念，旨在支持那些解决美国国家利益关键问题的公司，涵盖航空航天、国防、教育、住房、供应链、交通等领域）？我们如何在自己的国家建设一个硅谷？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The thing that people want is exactly what we named the category. How do we build American dynamism? How do we build Silicon Valley in our own country?</p>
</details>

>> 从地缘政治角度看，我们进入了一个新时代。我们正处在一个激动人心的时刻，对新技术的需要和需求都比以往任何时候都要大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Geopolitically, we entered a new era. We're in this exciting moment in time where both the need and the demand for new technologies is greater than it's ever been.</p>
</details>

>> “五年计划”这个概念的创造者当然是约瑟夫·斯大林。苏联就是按照五年计划来运行的。我稍微调侃一下，他来自“伯克利人民共和国”。二战时期那种依靠大规模机械和大规模人力赢得战争的旧模式早已过时。如果我们能释放我们在灵活性、创新、创造力和活力方面的优势，并将其应用于未来的战场，这对美国将极为有利。如果我们真能做到这一点，我们理应获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The creator of the concept of the five-year plan was of course Joseph Stalin. It was literally the Soviet Union run as 5-year plans. I'll bend a little bit. He comes from the People's Republic of Berkeley. The old model of World War II era, mass machinery and mass men to win wars. Like those days are long over. This should play greatly to America's benefit if we unleash our strength with flexibility, innovation, creativity, dynamism, and apply that into the battlefield of the future. Like, we really ought to win if we're really able to do that.</p>
</details>

### “美国活力”基金的诞生

我想我们先从一个开场白开始。我想请本 (Ben) 和马克 (Marc) 谈谈，是什么时刻让你们确信，这个领域值得专门设立一个投资基金。本，你先来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought we'd start with a bit of an opener. I want to ask Ben and Mark to tell us about the moment when we got conviction that this was worth creating its own category fund around. Ben, do you want to take the first step?</p>
</details>

>> 是的。嗯，我想说，马克和我其实一直都有一种抽象的看法，那就是我们必须将美国商界和美国国防重新整合起来，因为我们正在落后。我们了解我们投资的公司，也了解我们购买导弹和航空母舰的那些公司，它们在技术曲线上所处的位置根本不在同一水平。所以我们知道，这对国家来说是一个国家安全问题。但我们当时并没有一个计划。然后，我记得大卫 (David) 说，“有位女士叫凯瑟琳·博伊尔 (Katherine Boyle)，我想招募她，她有一个非常非常好的想法。你们能和她谈谈吗？” 就在那时，她提出：“看，我们应该把它叫做‘美国活力’，我们应该把这件事做起来。” 我得说，这对我们来说是一个非常容易接受的提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, I would say that, you know, Mark and I kind of always were of the view in an abstract sense that we had to integrate the American business and American defense back together because we were falling behind. We we kind of knew the companies that we were investing in and we knew the companies that we were buying missiles and aircraft carriers from and like they weren't of the same caliber in terms of where they were on the technology curve and so we knew it was a kind of a national security problem for the country. Um, but we didn't, you know, we didn't have a plan. And then, as I recall, David, um, said, you know, there's this woman, Katherine Boyle, who I want to recruit, and she has this very, very good idea. Can you guys talk to her about it? And that's when she said, "Look, we should call it American Dynamism and we should build this thing." And it was a very easy sale for us, I would just say.</p>
</details>

### 回顾历史：硅谷与国防的紧密联盟

是的，也许我可以退一步来谈谈。在座的一些人可能太年轻，不记得了，但在硅谷曾有过一个更早的时代。其实那也并不遥远。本和我都很幸运，或许是生逢其时，成为了那个时代的一部分。那时，硅谷与美国的国家使命是紧密相连的。这不仅包括经济和技术的成功，也包括军事和情报上的成功，以及我们在国内外传播我们生活方式的能力。实际上，当时双方有着相当紧密的整合与合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And maybe I could just take a step back. So, some of you on this call are too young to remember this, but there was an earlier era in Silicon Valley. And it actually wasn't that long ago. And Ben and I were both lucky enough and maybe of the right generation to be part of it, which was, Silicon Valley and the United States, let's say, the mission of the United States as a country. And then, sort of the submissions of not just economic and technological success, but also military success and intelligence success and our ability to propagate our way of life not just in the country but around the world. There had actually been like a fairly tight degree of integration of cooperation.</p>
</details>

如果你追溯硅谷的历史，甚至在二战之前，很多最初的国防技术工作就发生在我们今天所在的北加州。然后，从50年代到90年代，这被视为理所当然的联盟，有着共同的美国使命。因此，许多伟大的美国科技公司，包括所有那些从50年代到90年代的知名企业，都有非常庞大的政府业务和国防业务，对国家使命至关重要。然后，在90年代，当本和我创建我们的公司 Netscape 时，这一点对我们来说始终是重中之重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you actually trace the history of Silicon Valley back before even before World War II there was a lot of the original defense technology work that happened in Northern California where we sit today. And then for sure through from the '50s through to the I would say to the '90s, it was just taken as given that this was inherently an alliance with a shared American mission. And so, many many great American tech companies, you know, including all the big names, from the '50s through the '90s all had very big government businesses, defense businesses, were very important to the national mission. And then, Ben and I in the '90s, when we built our company, Netscape, that was always front and center for us.</p>
</details>

>> 我第一次去五角大楼进行销售拜访是在1994年。当时我好像连一套西装都没有。那是31年前了。我们的公司 Netscape 最终成为了向美国政府提供技术的主要供应商之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> My first sales call to the Pentagon was in 1994. I don't think I actually owned a suit yet. And so 31 years ago, our company Netscape ended up being a major supplier of technology to the US.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。实际上，因为那些交易，我和马克都曾多年持有最高机密安全许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Actually both Mark and I had for years top secret clearance because of those deals.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。所以我们很长一段时间都在五角大楼和相关机构工作，也在民用领域工作。我们认为这很自然。我为我们在那里所做的工作感到非常自豪，而且这也成为了我们业务中非常重要的一部分。后来，业务还扩展到了美国以外的盟国政府。所以对我们来说，这一直都很自然。我认为，我所说的这一切，直到2000年代之前几乎都是没有争议的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So we've been working in, we were working in Pentagon and in related agencies for a very long time, on the civilian side also. And we just sort of considered it kind of natural. And I'm really proud of the work that we did there and it turned out to be a very big part of our business also. And then extended over time to also governments outside the US that were American allies. And so for us this was always very natural and I think this was even everything I'm saying is almost like non-controversial up until probably the 2000s.</p>
</details>

### 决裂：硅谷为何与华盛顿反目

然后，在过去的15到20年里，出于各种原因——包括一些人们感受非常强烈的原因，我们可以聊很久——争议变得越来越大，在某些情况下甚至升级为公然的敌意。我认为这种敌意主要来自硅谷的许多组成部分——不是全部，但肯定是重要的公司——对华盛顿特区以及任何国家使命感或国家目标的敌意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then, basically for the last 15 or 20 years, by the way for a variety of reasons including reasons that people feel very strongly about we could talk about for a long time, but just a much greater degree of contention and escalating in some cases to just outright hostility kind of developed. And I would say in most directions from Silicon Valley, let's say large components of Silicon Valley, not all but significant companies for sure, hostility towards DC and hostility towards any sense of national mission, national purpose.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，华盛顿很快就对硅谷报以同样的情绪。在过去的20年里，华盛顿有很多人都明确表示他们有多么讨厌我们。所以我觉得我们似乎陷入了一种退化的螺旋。本，你可能会同意，敌意和脱节的顶峰可能是在2010年代末、2020年代初。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then, quite frankly that feeling was quickly reciprocated by Washington back to Silicon Valley and there's plenty of people from Washington in the last 20 years who've made a point of how much they hate us. And so it just felt like we kind of entered this kind of de-evolutionary spiral over the course of the last 15 or 20 years. It probably, I think you might maybe you'd agree at sort of the peak hostility disconnection was maybe in the late 2010s, early 2020s.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我认为**谷歌 Maven 项目**（Project Maven：一个美国国防部项目，旨在利用人工智能分析无人机拍摄的大量视频数据，谷歌曾参与其中，但因员工抗议而退出）是一个分水岭时刻，人们在思想上必须站队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I think the Google Maven project was kind of a watershed moment where, you know, people had to take sides just kind of intellectually.</p>
</details>

>> 当时谷歌赢得了一份政府合同，我认为是关于将人工智能用于无人机技术之类的。然后，由于部分员工的抗议，他们基本上退出了这份合同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> When Google pulled, they won a government contract for I think it was AI to be used in kind of drone technology or something like that. And then they basically pulled out of the contract due to a protest from a bunch of their employees.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，而且不仅仅是温和的抗议，而是发自内心的、情绪化的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And not just and I think you confirm like not not just like a mild protest but like visceral emotional.</p>
</details>

>> 哦，是的，那就像一场反抗。我记得桑达尔 (Sundar) 曾向我描述，那是来自国际人工智能社区的一场反抗。所以，这相当疯狂，而且肯定是前所未有的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh like yeah it was like a revolt from I remember Sundar described it to me a revolt from the international AI community. And so it was pretty wild and certainly unprecedented.</p>
</details>

### 转折点：重拾硅谷的初衷

>> 是的。所以我觉得事情差不多在那时触底了。然后，我们中的一些人，当然也包括一些发挥了重要作用的新公司，像本和我这样经历过旧时代的人，有机会反思一下，事情是怎么发展到这么糟糕的地步，到底哪里出了问题，然后开始尝试找出解决办法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And so you know I think things sort of bottomed out there and then I think some of us and obviously there are new companies that have played a big role here but some of us like Ben and I who were involved in this in the old days, it was kind of a chance for us to kind of take stock of where things were, how things had gotten that bad, what went wrong and then start to at least try to figure out kind of how to fix it.</p>
</details>

所以，当大卫 (David) 和凯瑟琳 (Katherine) 提出这些想法，并为公司确立了这个新使命时，我非常热情。我觉得这从一开始就是一个绝妙的主意，现在依然如此。但我想强调的是，这件事有种“回到未来”的感觉。我们和其他人在这个领域所做的事情，是新颖、大胆、激动人心且与众不同的，与五年前的常态截然不同。这都是真实的。但与此同时，它也有一种历史的共鸣，那就是回归硅谷的原始价值观。我发现能够参与其中，是一件极其积极和重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so anyway, so that's why like I was so enthusiastic when David and then Katherine, you know, developed these ideas and developed this new mission for the firm. I thought it was just like an absolutely fantastic idea at the start and still do. And but I just wanted to go through that which is it's like a there's a back to the future component of it, right? Which is like it is like what we're doing and what others are doing in this space. It is new and bold and exciting and different and very different than the norm 5 years ago. And that's all real but at the same time there is a historical resonance which is it's also a return to the original values of Silicon Valley which is something I find to be just incredibly positive and important to be a part of.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，对此有两点补充很重要。第一，这实际上始于大学。弗兰克·特曼 (Frank Turman) 教授和威廉·肖克利 (William Shockley) 教授当时正在开发这些技术以支持战争。他们基本上鼓励自己的学生不要攻读博士学位，而是分拆出去创办公司来支持国家。这很讽刺，因为正是这些大学后来孕育了导致谷歌员工反抗的思想。另一点是，谷歌/Alphabet 后来无疑改变了他们的立场，现在也与美国政府和国防部合作了。所以我们在这方面处于一个愉快的境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And two footnotes to that that I think are important. One is it actually started with the universities. So, professor Frank Turman and William Shockley who were developing these technologies and to support the war effort basically encouraged their students to not pursue PhDs and spin out and build companies to support the country. So, which is an ironic turn because those same universities kind of spawn the ideas I would say that led to their revolt at Google. And then the other footnote is Google has definitely since Google/Alphabet has reversed their position and now do work with the US government and the defense department. So we're in a happy place there.</p>
</details>

### 探究根源：敌意从何而来？

为了把线索串起来，我们能花几分钟解释一下事情为什么会变糟吗？敌意产生的一些主要原因是什么？这样我们就能回到现在，描述一下发生了什么变化。关于这一点，我特别想听听凯瑟琳 (Katherine) 的看法，因为在过去十多年里，她既是观察者也是参与者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just to tie the threads together, can we spend just a couple minutes explaining why things went wrong? What are some of the headline reasons that the hostility developed so that we can then get back to the present and describe what changed. I want to hear from Katherine I think in particular on this because she was both an observer and a participant in it for the last decade plus.</p>
</details>

我想说，在哲学和世界观上存在着严肃且合理的差异。我最近和我10岁的儿子看了很多电影，昨晚我们看了《天才作反》（Real Genius）。这是1985年的一部电影，实际上是我们的好朋友布莱恩·格雷泽 (Brian Grazer) 制作的。这是我最喜欢的电影之一，非常棒。但它有点像后越战时代的产物。剧透一下，电影里的孩子们在一所伪装成麻省理工学院 (MIT) 的学校里研究激光，当他们惊恐地发现自己正在研究一种武器时，电影里的假设是，如果你在研究武器，你就是邪恶的。他们甚至没有停下来想一想，这东西是否可能非常有帮助，或者它在战略中扮演什么角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I start by saying like look there are serious and legitimate differences in philosophy and worldview. I just I happen to watch I'm watching a lot of movies with my 10-year-old and we've watched the movie Real Genius last night. It's a movie in 1985 actually made by our good friend Brian Grazer. It's just like an one of my favorite movies. incredible movie, but it was sort of an artifact in the post-Vietnam era in which, you know, spoiler alert, the kids in the movie are going to basically a thinly disguised version of MIT and they're working on lasers and they discovered to their enormous horror that they're working on a weapon. And the sort of assumption in the movie is if you're working on a weapon, you're evil. They don't even like pause for a moment to like ask the question of like, well actually could this actually be like super helpful or like you know is this how does this fit into strategy or whatever.</p>
</details>

这种情绪在生态系统中存在了很长时间。本提到了斯坦福大学在这方面的先锋作用。斯坦福在1970年代实际上被迫将其所有军事研发以及任何与军事相关的研发都剥离到一个名为斯坦福研究所 (Stanford Research Institute) 的机构。所以，许多顶尖的美国大学，基本上从越战后就一直不允许像**后备军官训练团**（ROTC: Reserve Officers' Training Corps）或情报机构在校园里招聘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's been some of that in the ecosystem for a long time. By the way, Ben mentioned Stanford the pioneering role of Stanford in all of this. Stanford was actually forced in the 1970s to divest all of their military R&D and any R&D that touched the military into something called the Stanford Research Institute. So you know there was this, many top American universities forever for basically since Vietnam have not allowed like ROTC or like intelligence agency recruiting happening on campus.</p>
</details>

在过去的15年里，我认为这一切都卷入了我们时代更广泛的国家政治戏剧中。人们觉得必须在各种政治问题上站队，而且觉得政治问题不仅仅是政治问题，它们完全是道德问题，如果你站在对立面，你就是不道德的。当然，这其中也有后伊拉克战争的因素，那就是，我们真的能信任那个把我们带入伊拉克战争的体系吗？这显然对我们的国家政治产生了巨大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in the last 15 years I think it just all got kind of wrapped up in the broader kind of national political drama of our time and you know basically people feeling like they have to take sides in all kinds of political issues and then I would say beyond that feeling like political issues aren't just political issues they're like fully moral issues and that you're immoral if you're on the other side. And you know, and by the way, there's also like a post Iraq, you know, component to it, which is, you know, can we really trust the system that took us into Iraq, which obviously had big impact on our national politics.</p>
</details>

### 回归宏大叙事：美国的全球角色

我只想回到那个宏观的问题上：美国总体上是世界上一股向善的力量吗？美国的成功对世界是否重要？广义上讲，美国的价值观、西方的价值观在世界上占据主导地位是否重要？世界不陷入全面极权主义是否重要？在20世纪的冷战期间，世界不陷入苏联式共产主义的全面蔓延是重要的。我想我们谁也不希望看到一个最终出现类似中国共产主义情景的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would just come back to the kind of the big picture thing right which is like is America in aggregate a force for good in the world like is it important for the world that America succeed? Is it important that broadly speaking American values western values are kind of preeminent in the world. Is it important that the world not devolve into a totalitarian... it was important during the in the 20th century cold war that the world not devolve into a complete Soviet communism everywhere. I don't think any of us want to see a world in which we end up with kind of the same scenario with like Chinese communism.</p>
</details>

你也可以对那些每天冒着生命危险保护我们的军人表示极大的敬意。我认为，一个相当合理的立场是，他们应该得到像我们这样的同胞的支持。是的，你也可以持这样的观点：我们生活在一个社会中，而社会的一部分就是政府将拥有某些能力，如果这些能力更好，情况就会更好，反之则更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you can also just say you can have a lot of respect for the men and women in uniform, who put their lives on the line every day protecting and defending us. And, you know, it's I think it's a pretty reasonable stance to say that they deserve to be supported by their fellow countrymen like us. Yeah, and then you could just also have the view of like, yeah, I mean, look, we as the cliche goes, we live in a society, right? And part of the society is that the government is going to have certain capabilities and it's going to be better if they're better and worse if they're worse.</p>
</details>

我认为，现在是很多人重新审视这个问题的好时机，因为过去八年那种极度激化的情绪或许正在消退。一些人开始说，好吧，我们实际上需要考虑未来30年会是什么样子，我们希望它以一种不同的方式运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think now is a good time for a lot of people to really kind of take stock of this as maybe some of the superheated emotions of the last eight years maybe are fading a little right now. And, you know, some people are kind of saying, well, actually, we need to think about what the next 30 years looks like, and we want it to work in a different way.</p>
</details>

### 文化鸿沟：华盛顿与硅谷的隔阂

>> 我要补充两点，因为我认为马克关于文化的观点在其中扮演了重要角色。我自2014年搬到硅谷以来，注意到了两件事。我从华盛顿特区搬来，我注意到的其中一件事是，如果你在华盛顿，你乘坐地铁，地铁会在五角大楼停靠。每次你坐地铁，你都会看到穿着制服的军人去上班。所以，国家安全问题是你日常生活的一部分。当人们在华盛顿谈论技术时，他们谈论的是航空航天、国防。他们谈论的是他们每天都能看到广告牌的那些公司，这与你在硅谷看到的广告牌非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I'll add two points to that because I think Mark's point on culture plays a huge role in this. But there's there's two things I've noticed since moving to the valley. I moved to the valley in 2014, but I moved from Washington DC. And one of the things that I noticed when I moved is that if you are in Washington DC, you ride the metro. Metro stops at the Pentagon. Every time you ride the metro, you see men and women in uniform going to work. So, it is a daily part of life that national security issues. When people talk about technology in Washington, they're talking about aerospace, they're talking about defense. I mean, they're talking about the companies that they see every day, the billboards for, which are very different than the billboards you see in Silicon Valley.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个巨大的因素，就是文化上，人们在华盛顿特区非常习惯于国家安全任务、需求和穿制服的人，而在硅谷则完全没有这些。你可能在硅谷待上十年也见不到一个穿制服的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So I think that's a huge part of it is just culturally people are very accustomed to national security missions and needs and people in uniform in Washington DC and there's none of that in Silicon Valley. You could go a decade in Silicon Valley without seeing a person in uniform.</p>
</details>

关于马克提到的文化，我一直认为电影《社交网络》(The Social Network) 对2010年代的影响最大，它定义了技术的意义。当你比较鲍勃·诺伊斯 (Bob Noyce) 那一代人亲手建设物理世界，以及那些工程师的出身，再对比那个激励了一代又一代在宿舍里学习计算机科学的大学生来到硅谷的哈佛宿舍故事，你会发现这是两个截然不同的人群，他们象征着两种截然不同的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But to Mark's point on on culture, I've always said that I think The Social Network had probably the greatest influence of the 2010s in terms of being a defining movie of what technology means. And when you look at the kind of Bob Noyce generation of working with your hands, building the physical world, where those engineers came from versus the story of a Harvard dorm room that inspired generations of college students who were studying computer science in their dorm to come to Silicon Valley, those are two very different populations and they symbolize two very different things.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，2010年代被这种哈佛式的社交网络文化所固化，这与那些建造卫星或任何物理世界事物的人的文化完全不同。直到马克发表了那篇名为《是时候建设了》(It's Time to Build) 的文章，直到2020年我们因为新冠疫情没有足够的个人防护设备 (PPE) 时，我们才真正开始讨论这些人对硅谷技术的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so what I think is interesting is probably like the 2010s were really solidified by this sort of Harvard-esque social network culture that is totally different than the culture of people who are building satellites or building anything in the physical world. And we really didn't start talking about how those people are necessary for Silicon Valley technology until Mark's essay "It's Time to Build," until 2020 when we didn't have enough PPE for COVID. And so I think it was really just sort of the logical 180 to what have we done here? We're not all Harvard grads building in the application layer when we should be thinking about the things that we actually need in the physical world.</p>
</details>

>> 我在威斯康星州的乡下长大，差不多是后越战时期。情况非常相似。如果你看看美国军队的战斗人员来自哪里，很多情况下是国家的中心地带。所以如果你在那种环境中长大，你会意识到这是你社会中不可分割的一部分。我可能更多地来自那种背景，然后我会稍微调侃一下本。他当然来自截然相反的地方——“伯克利人民共和国”。我猜在你年轻时，你看到人们穿着的制服可能不是迷彩服，而是别的什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I grew up in rural Wisconsin. I actually grew up in rural Wisconsin kind of post Vietnam. And kind of very similar thing like if you look at where the sort of war fighters in the American military come from, it's sort of the center of the country in a lot of cases. And so if you grew up in one of those environments, it's just like an integrated you just realize that this is an integrated part of your society. Yeah, and then I come from a little bit more of that background and then I'll tease Ben a little bit. He comes from of course the polar opposite, the People's Republic of Berkeley. In which I'm guessing probably the uniforms you saw people walking around in your youth were not camouflaged. They were something else.</p>
</details>

>> 那确实是真的。不过，我最终还是认识了几个去服役的人。可能因为我参加了橄榄球队。我认为，关于那种“我们不向美国军方出售东西”的反战立场，有一点总是让我觉得不正确。就好像，这些是我们的朋友，他们冒着生命危险来保护我们，而我们却不确保他们拥有最好、最安全的设备和技术。这就是你的道德立场？这总让我觉得非常奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That is definitely true. Although I ended up knowing a few people who did go to the service. Probably because I played on the football team I ended up knowing a few people who did go to the service and I mean I think that's one of the things that always struck me as incorrect. I'll just say about the kind of anti "we're not going to sell stuff to the US military" and so forth. That's like, well, so here are friends of ours who are risking their lives to protect us, and we're not going to make sure they have the best, safest equipment and technology available. Like, and that's your moral position. Like, that always struck me as very weird, but you know.</p>

### 情感战胜理性：对立观点的脆弱性

>> 我记得几个月前，保罗·格雷厄姆 (Paul Graham) 试图批评 Palantir 参与某种军事活动。这恰恰反映了那种2010年代网络文化中已经行不通的侮辱方式，因为文化已经变得如此不同。短短几年内，帕尔默·拉奇 (Palmer Luckey) 可能因为向“错误”的一方提供政治捐款而被 Meta 负面影响或解雇，而现在他却因为在拯救美国国防方面的工作而成为英雄。这正说明了过去几年文化变化之大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I remember a few months ago Paul Graham was trying to critique Palantir I think for sort of involvement in some sort of military activity. It is just indicative of kind of web 2010's insults that don't work anymore because the culture has changed so much such that you know within just a few years Palmer could be negatively impacted or let go from Meta for sort of political contributions to the wrong side or presumably the wrong side and now is a hero for his work in saving American defense. It's just indicative of how much the culture has changed the last few years.</p>
</details>

>> 我来抨击一下反方论点。很多反对意见的实质内容非常薄弱，它们本质上是情绪化的。我最喜欢的一个例子是，在特朗普第一任期内，2016-2017年，曾有一场大型抗议，反对科技公司与**美国移民及海关执法局**（ICE: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement）合作。当时出现了一种反抗，一群科技公司的CEO们摆出姿态说，他们绝不会与那些处理边境问题的人合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it turned out I'll just bash the counter arguments for a moment. Having been trying to be fair earlier, I'll be totally unfair. A lot of the arguments against, they're very thinly substantive. They're emotional in nature and very thinly substantive. And so my favorite story, Eric, of your example was there was a big protest against tech companies working with ICE in the first Trump term in 2016-2017 and there's sort of this revolt where a bunch of tech CEOs kind of did this posturing thing where they said of course we're never going to work with those horrible people who are trying to deal with everything on the border.</p>
</details>

我记得我的一位朋友，当时他经营着旧金山一家最具文化和技术先进性的酷炫科技公司。他们的服务被 ICE 以及数千个其他组织使用。他的员工们也表现出极大的愤怒，质问“我们怎么能做这种事？” 于是，在2017年，当情绪最激烈的时候，他请来了一位曾在奥巴马政府担任边境安全负责人的前主管，在公司举办了一场长达一小时的研讨会，解释边境的实际情况，包括所有复杂因素，不仅涉及过境人员，还涉及儿童、性交易、毒品等所有方面。他来做了一小时的演讲，全公司都受邀参加，结果只有三个人到场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I remember actually a friend of mine was running one of this kind of at the time one of the most like culturally advanced technologically advanced coolest tech companies in San Francisco and they had a contract, their services used by ICE along with thousands of other organizations. And his employees did the big outrage "how can we possibly do this". And so he actually went out this is I think 2017, he went out like during the heat when it was maximum level heat intensity of that time and he went out and actually got a former director, a guy who had actually been in the Obama administration as basically the head of border security, to basically come in and give an hourlong seminar at the company and just explain like here's what's actually involved at the border, here are all the things that make it complicated, here's all the stuff involving not just people coming across but also children and sex trafficking and drugs and all the other aspects of it. And he came in to do an hourlong talk and the entire company was invited and you know three people showed up.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为那种情绪化的高潮已经过去了。我希望我们和许多其他人都能回归本源，回归基本面。这些使命确实很重要，与当下的政治情绪无关。这些问题、这些人、这些组织都很重要，他们理应得到支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right and so like I think that, you know, that level of emotionality like it had its moment. And I think it's just over now. And I think we and, hopefully, a lot of others are just kind of back to basics, back to fundamentals. These missions actually really do, independent of the political mood of the moment. These issues, these people, these organizations matter and they deserve to be supported.</p>

### 内部视角：“美国活力”的起源故事

>> 当我2018年加入公司时，你必须记得那是什么时代，硅谷正处于什么时期。正如我们所讨论的，硅谷在关注国防、关注真正难题方面迷失了方向。硬件不受欢迎，软件与先进硬件的结合也不流行。我加入公司大约一年后，马克问我是否想见见 Anduril 的创始人帕尔默·拉奇 (Palmer Luckey)。我想马克当时对我们公司是否会对这样的交易感兴趣持怀疑态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> When I joined the firm in 2018, you have to remember what time that was, what era was in Silicon Valley. I think Silicon Valley lost its way as we've discussed in terms of focusing on defense, focusing on really hard problems. Hardware was not in vogue. The intersection of software and advanced hardware was not popular. And about a year after I joined, Mark asked me if I wanted to meet Palmer Lucky who is the founder of Anduril. I think Mark was skeptical that our firm would be interested in a deal like that for a variety of reasons.</p>
</details>

但我去了科斯塔梅萨他们的办公室。我们爱上了这家公司，认为他们所做的事情非常了不起。实际上，我在那里遇到了凯瑟琳 (Katherine)。她在 General Catalyst 时想领投 B 轮，我也想领投 B 轮。我们最终平分了这轮投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But I went down to Costa Mesa to their office. We had fallen in love with the company. We thought it was amazing what they were doing. When I was there, actually, I met Katherine. She wanted to lead the series B when she was at General Catalyst. I wanted to lead the series B. We ended up splitting it.</p>
</details>

>> 那不是一次最好的初次会面，这么说吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wasn't the best first meeting. I'll put it that way.</p>
</details>

>> 没错。我们基本上是从完全不认识对方、竞争一笔交易开始，到最后不得不平分。我做的最糟糕的一件事是，她为 B 轮做了那么多工作，所有的尽职调查、笔记，甚至帮助公司准备 B 轮。我没做那些工作。而雪上加霜的是，在平分了交易之后，我还向她要了她的笔记，以便我能写我们的投资备忘录。这可能是我最尴尬的时刻之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's true. We basically started out, I think, with not knowing each other at all, competing to win a deal, having to split it. I think one of the worst things I did was that she had done so much work for the series B. She had done all the diligence work. She had done notes. She actually helped the company prepare for the series B. I had not done that work. And I think to add insult to injury of having to split the deal, I then asked her for her notes so I could write our memo, which is really probably one of the more embarrassing.</p>
</details>

>> 我把笔记发给了他，因为我是一名好士兵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I sent them because I'm a good soldier.</p>
</details>

>> 几年后，我继续关注凯瑟琳的所有文章。她当时用的术语不同，但最终她提出了“美国活力”这个词。我认为这是一个完美的短语。2021年，我投资了 Flock Safety。那时，“黑人的命也是命”(Black Lives Matters) 运动声势浩大，人们认为在硅谷资助公共安全和支持警察不是什么酷事。但我们知道，当我们与 Flock Safety 的客户和社区里的人交谈时，他们都非常喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> A couple years later, I then continued to follow all of Katherine's writings. She was really, she used different terminology at the time but eventually she came up with the terminology of American dynamism. I thought that was a perfect phrase. In 2021 I think I invested in Flock Safety. That was at a time where Black Lives Matters was a big movement. People thought the idea of funding public safety and supporting the police was not so cool in Silicon Valley. But we knew that when we talked to people who actually were customers of Flock Safety and people in the communities, they loved it.</p>
</details>

那时，凯瑟琳越来越多地撰写关于这个理念的文章，以及在这些对国家利益至关重要的领域进行投资的重要性。在马克和本的支持下，我联系了她，说：“嘿，我认为我们应该联手，把这做成一个全面的事业。我们会做出长期承诺，我们会募集资金，成立一个基金。公司完全支持。” 我想她一开始不相信我。但后来她接受了。2021年底，她加入了公司，我们启动了“美国活力”实践，从那以后，一切都蒸蒸日上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> At that point, Katherine was really writing more and more about this idea and the importance in investing these areas critical to the national interest. And I reached out to her with Mark and Ben's support and said, "Hey, I think we should join forces. We should make this a full-fledged effort. We will make this a long-term commitment. We'll raise money. We'll raise a fund. The firm is totally behind it." I think she didn't believe me at first. She can give her version of it, but then she came around to it. At the end of 2021, she joined the firm and we launched the American Dynamism practice and it's been as they say up and to the right ever since.</p>
</details>

### 中心化计划 vs. 动态创新

>> 马克定义了中国的体系，但他也指出了采购方面的一个主要问题，即国防部以五年为周期来决定购买什么武器，生产周期则长达十年。由于我们自60、70年代以来构建的采购流程，要纠正航向非常困难。所以，我认为过去25年，第二个美国世纪的故事是关于美国活力、创新和创造力的，以及这在全球舞台上如何让我们从世界前十大公司中的三家科技公司发展到九家。但国防部并未从中受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Mark sort of defined the Chinese system, but he also sort of defined one of the major problems with procurement which is that the Department of War makes its decisions about what weapons it's going to buy on five-year cycles, 10-year production cycles, right? And it's very difficult to correct the ship because of the way that we've structured our procurement process going back to the 60s and the 70s. So I think there is something about the, if you look at the last 25 years, the second American century has been a story of American dynamism, innovation, creativity and how on a global stage that has actually led us from three companies in the top 10 to nine companies in the top 10 that are tech companies but the department of defense really hasn't benefited from that.</p>
</details>

>> 实际上，如果你和很多大公司合作，你会发现他们常常有五年计划，有五年的规划周期和战略。而“五年计划”这个概念的创造者当然是约瑟夫·斯大林。苏联就是按照五年计划来运行的。在1920年代到1950年代之间，这个想法实际上主流化地进入了西方社会和商界，并一直延续至今。顺便说一句，它通常行不通。它常常失败，因为世界太富于变化，而那个迭代周期根本不够快。然而人们仍然坚持五年计划。这就像苏联共产主义伸出坟墓的手，仍在扼杀我们前进和完成工作的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So it's actually just a historical tweak which is if you work with big companies a lot, one of the things you see is they often have five-year plans. They have five year planning cycles, five-year strategies. And actually, the creator of the concept of the five-year plan was of course Joseph Stalin. Like it was literally the Soviet Union run as five-year plans and actually in the between the 1920s-1950s that idea actually mainstreamed itself into Western society and into Western business and has stuck there ever since. And by the way, it routinely doesn't work. Like it routinely fails because the world is too dynamic. And, that's not nearly a fast enough iteration cycle. And yet people still stick to the five-year plan thing. And it's just like this, it's like the hand coming out of the grave, you know, kind of still strangling our ability to actually advance and be able to get our jobs done.</p>
</details>

>> 而且，战场本身也在变化。例如，在俄乌冲突中，你会看到战场技术和战术的迭代速度非常快。我不知道乌克兰军方是不是有什么“五日计划”，但他们采纳新技术和调整现有技术的速度非常快。这是他们战斗所必需的，如果他们没有这种方法，他们早就输了。顺便说一句，俄罗斯人也在努力跟上他们的步伐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And look, like just to double underline what Katherine said, right, the battlefield itself is changing. And so one of the things that you see for example in the Russia Ukraine conflict is an incredibly high rate of iteration, the battlefield techniques and use of technology on the battlefield. I mean I don't know whether they have a five-day plan or something in the Ukrainian military in terms of how fast they adopt new technology and adapt what they have. And that's what they need to be able to fight and if they didn't have that approach they would have lost a long time ago. And by the way the Russians are trying to match them on that.</p>
</details>

二战时期那种依靠大规模机械和大规模人力赢得战争的旧模式早已过时。即使在现代版的堑壕战中，你仍然需要这种快速的迭代周期。如果我们能释放我们的优势，即灵活性、创新、创造力和活力，并将其应用于未来的战场，这对美国将极为有利。如果我们真能做到这一点，我们理应获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so the old model of World War II era, just simply mass machinery and mass men to win wars, like those days are long over. Even when you have like this very kind of contentious, even the modern version of trench warfare, still you have this very rapid iterative cycle time. And if, and again, this should play greatly to America's benefit if we unleash our strength which is if we take our strength of flexibility, innovation, creativity, dynamism and apply that into the battlefield of the future, we really ought to win if we're really able to do that.</p>
</details>

>> 我只想补充一点，对美国来说，走向另一个方向，简直就是在对抗我们文化、历史和制度的一切。这种思想竟然有吸引力，我认为就像某些人身上存在一种奇怪的心理缺陷。他们总是渴望中央控制，总认为那样更好。一个很好的投资策略是，如果你看到一家公司有五年计划，就做空它。这招每次都灵。然而他们还是这么做。这真的没有任何依据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I would just add to Mark's thinking that going the other direction for the US is literally fighting everything about our culture, everything about our history, everything about our system. And the fact that it has appeal is like I think like a weird psychological defect that some people have where they're just they just always want central control. And they always think it's better. And this is, you know, a great investing strategy is to if you see a company with a five-year plan, short it. And it works every time. And yet they still do it. And it just comes it really has no basis in anything.</p>
</details>

### 投资前沿：能源、航空航天与国防

>> 我想能源是一个很好的例子。从宏观层面看，历史上我们已经看到，当你向一个系统中注入能源时，你会得到巨大的经济产出和增长。即使只看现在，我们对能源的需求也是永无止境的，无论是用于人工智能计算，还是人们转向电动汽车，甚至是系统电气化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I'll start and then maybe Katherine can jump in. I think energy is a great one. You can sort of zoom in at any level you want. At a macro level, we've just seen throughout history when you pour energy into a system you get just tremendous economic output, economic growth. If you look at where we are today not even looking forward we have this insatiable thirst for energy whether it's for AI compute or whether it's for people switching to electric vehicles or even moving to systems that are just electrified.</p>
</details>

这带来了发电、输电和储能方面的巨大机遇。问题是，我们认为这里是否存在风险投资规模的机会？我们认为是有的。我们投资了核能公司，一家叫做 Radiant Nuclear 的公司。我们投资了 Exowatt。我们考察了很多电池技术公司。我们认为这里有巨大的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This has this huge consequence of creating opportunities for power generation, power transmission, power storage. And the question is are there going to be opportunities that we think are venture scale there? We think there are. We've invested in nuclear power companies, a company called Radiant Nuclear. We've invested in Exowatt. We've looked at lots of battery technology companies. We might just think there's great opportunities here.</p>
</details>

>> 关于航空航天，我认为真正令人兴奋的变化是，过去每个人都必须进行垂直整合。所谓的“太空1.0”时代的特点是，公司都采用 SpaceX 的模式：所有东西都自己造。可能需要10年才能进入太空，但这没关系。现在情况不同了。我们是 Apex Space 最早的投资者之一。我相信他们是历史上从一张白纸的设计到进入轨道速度最快的公司，只用了13个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, I think the thing that's really changed about aerospace that I think we're incredibly excited about is it used to be that everyone had to vertically integrate. And sort of space 1.0 was very much categorized with companies taking the SpaceX model. You will build everything yourself. It might take 10 years to get to space and that's okay. That is not the case anymore. We were one of the earliest investors in a company called Apex Space. I believe they are the fastest company to get from clean sheet design to orbit in 13 months in history.</p>
</details>

他们的观点不同，他们只想制造卫星平台 (satellite bus)。如果我们能找到方法让卫星平台更便宜、更高效，并与所有传统和新兴的**主承包商**（prime contractor：在大型项目中直接与政府或客户签订合同，并负责整个项目管理和交付的公司）合作，将他们的有效载荷送入太空，这对那些正在建造不同类型有效载荷的公司来说将高效得多。我认为这个论点在很大程度上是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But they had a different view which is that we only want to make the satellite bus. And if we can figure out ways to make the satellite bus cheaper, more efficiently, and work with all of the legacy primes and the new primes, to put their payloads into space, that will be far more efficient for these companies that are building different types of of payloads. And I think that thesis has been has been largely correct.</p>
</details>

>> 关于国防，令人兴奋的是，客户——不仅是五角大楼，还有国会——第一次变得如此迫切并且行动迅速。我和马克、大卫最近在华盛顿与参议员和众议院成员交谈，他们都非常关注今年的**《国防授权法案》**（NDAA: National Defense Authorization Act），以及如何解决采购中的一些核心问题。我对这些采购改革的微小变化将对整个国防生态系统产生巨大影响，从未如此充满希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean the the thing that's really exciting about defense is for the first time you have sort of this I would say almost a golden triangle of the customer is desperate and moving very fast and the customer isn't just the Pentagon it's also Congress. David and I and Mark, we were just in Washington talking to senators and members of the House who were very engaged on this year's NDAA. How do we fix some of the core problems with procurement? And I think that I've never been so hopeful about these minor changes in procurement reform having a dramatic impact on all of the defense ecosystem.</p>
</details>

### 新地缘政治格局下的挑战与机遇

>> 从地缘政治角度看，我们进入了一个新时代。回顾二战后，我们基本上把我们的主要制造业竞争对手，如日本和德国，炸出了局，美国在几十年里成为了世界主导的经济强国。因此，我们可以扮演“美国队”和“世界警察”的角色，为所有人提供防务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I think that um, you know, geopolitically we we've kind of entered a new era. And so if you kind of go back, you know, post World War II, we had kind of um bombed our big manufacturing competitors, you know, Japan and Germany kind of out of existence or out of the game for a while and America became the just the dominant economic power in the world for for decades. And as a result, we could be team America world police and just kind of, you know, provide defense to everybody.</p>
</details>

快进到2025年，我们负债38万亿美元。而且，我们有了一个在经济上非常有竞争力的超级大国——中国，它对世界应该如何运作以及其社会应该如何运作的看法与我们截然不同。所以现在我们所处的境地是，盟友变得非常重要。不仅盟友重要，我们还需要他们能够自卫，并与我们合作，捍卫我们的价值观、生活方式和我们对自由的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Fast forward to 2025, we're $38 trillion in debt. And you know there's a very competitive superpower economically in China who has a I would just say a very different idea about the way the world should work and the way their society should work than we do. And so now we're in a position where allies matter a lot. And not only do allies matter, but we need them to be able to defend themselves and to work with us to kind of defend our values, our kind of way of life, our view of freedom.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为，如果你去华盛顿，现在到处都在谈论所谓的**可消耗系统**（attritable systems：指成本相对较低，即使在战斗中损失也可以接受的军事装备，如廉价无人机），即你不用花费数百万美元去建造只能使用一次的精良系统。你建造的是非常便宜的无人机、非常便宜的硬件，即使丢失了也没关系。这一点之所以如此重要，是因为我认为从乌克兰战争中学到的很多教训是，如果你有一个价值数亿美元的精良系统，但它能被一架价值一千美元的无人机摧毁，这就改变了战争的经济学，尤其改变了消耗战的经济学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, I thought the conversation that you all had in the last episode with Brian and Chris about what does it mean to participate in wars of mass is one that Silicon Valley really hadn't thought about until very recently. You know, if you go to Washington, there's all this talk now about what is what is known as attritable systems, which are systems where, you know, you're not spending millions and millions of dollars building out exquisite systems that that only are usable once. You're building out, you know, very cheap drones, very cheap hardware where if you lose them, that's okay. And the reason why that is so important is because I think a lot of the learnings of Ukraine, if you have an exquisite system that was hundreds of millions of dollars and it can be taken out with a thousand dollar drone, that changes the economics of war and it particularly changes the economics of a war of mass.</p>
</details>

### 重塑制造业：美国的未来之路

>> 我认为，过去40年制造业的大规模离岸外包，是一系列政策决策的结果。要扭转这一局面，也需要一系列政策决策，其中一些目前正在酝酿中。但是，引用赫拉克利特的话：“人不能两次踏入同一条河流，因为那不是同一条河流，他也不是同一个人。” 即使你清理了所有的监管和法律障碍，纠正了导致一切外流的激励机制，你实际上也无法让旧工厂回来，也无法让40年前失去的旧工作岗位以同样的方式回归。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look, I think the great offshoring of manufacturing that happened over the last 40 years, happened as a result of a set of policy decisions, like a set of explicit decisions that were made. There are a set of policy decisions that have to be made and are currently, some of them are in the works now, to kind of reverse that. But, to your point, actually, I'll quote Heraclitus. A man cannot step into the same river twice because it is not the same river and he is not the same man. So what's not like even if you completely cleaned up all the regulatory stuff and legal stuff which I think we should, and you sort of corrected the incentives that drove everything out, I think what you're just not going to get practically is you're just you're not going to get the old factories back and you're not getting the old jobs back in the way that they were 40 years ago when they were lost.</p>
</details>

你想要的是更好的东西。以自行车为例，你真正想要的是制造电动自行车，它们是更复杂的物理产品，涉及电池、电脑、芯片。你希望在一个更先进的制造工厂里生产，自动化程度更高，在那里你不需要人们站在生产线上10个小时重复同一个动作。相反，你会有大量可以称之为“蓝领+”的工作，以及白领工作和所有相关的服务业工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What you would like in contrast, would be something much better. And the better thing, let's just take bicycles as an example. What you actually want is you want to be making electric bikes. You want to be making ebikes, which are much more sophisticated, physical artifacts that involve batteries and computers and chips. You want to have a new kind of product that's much more sophisticated, built in a manufacturing plant that is more sophisticated, and has a much greater degree of automation where you don't have human beings standing in line turning the same sphere every time for 10 hours but where what you have is a large number of jobs that are kind of call them blue collar plus jobs and then also white collar jobs and all the associated service jobs around those.</p>
</details>

我认为你可以实现产品的飞跃，工厂的飞跃，并创造出更好的工作——薪水更高、技能要求更高、也更有趣的工作。如果你参观特斯拉的工厂，你就能看到这一切正在发生。我认为这才是正确的方案。如果我们不这样做，所有这些东西都将在中国制造。这意味着随着时间的推移，不仅手机和无人机在中国制造，汽车和机器人也将在中国制造。未来的伟大产业将是机器人，即人工智能的机械形态，我认为这将是史上最大的产业。而现在，默认情况下，中国已经准备好做这件事了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I think those jobs, and by the way you can see this if you visit a Tesla factory today, you see this in action. This is how the world's leading manufacturers actually do this. This is actually happening. And so I think what you can do is you can leap forward on the nature of the product you're building, you can leap forward on the nature of the plant that you're building and you can leap forward and actually create much better jobs, right, higher paying jobs, higher skilled jobs that are frankly a lot more pleasant, that are a lot more interesting. I think that's the formula. And by the way, if we don't do that, all of those things are going to get made in China, which does mean over time, not just phones being made in China and not just drones being made in China, but also cars. And also robots. The great industry of the future that we could spend a long time talking about is going to be robots, right? AI in mechanical form, which is going to be, I think the biggest industry that's ever been built. And you know, right now, by default, China's set up to do that.</p>
</details>

对于21世纪的美国来说，这将是一个多么了不起的故事：我们重新工业化，不是为了制造过去的产品，而是为了制造未来的产品。我认为这才是机遇所在。

<p class="english-text">>> You know, like what an amazing story it would be for America in the 21st century, which is we re-industrialize not to build the products of the past, but to build the products of the future. And I think that's the opportunity.</p>
</details>

### 最终的抉择：更像我们，还是更像他们？

>> 我们与苏联的第一次冷战期间，实际上也发生过这场争论。这场激烈的辩论始于1920年代，但在50、60、70年代全面爆发，即民主还是独裁，自由市场还是国家指导的资本主义。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So we actually had this fight, this fight actually happened during the during the first cold war with the Soviet Union.

And then, free markets or, you know, state directed capitalism.</p>
</details>

资本主义的方式是混乱的，对吧？它有繁荣-萧条周期，公司会倒闭，有时竞争过度，利润降至零。但你拥有活力作为你的优势，你拥有自由、探索、创造力、创新、自由市场竞争和活力。我认为这个问题在20世纪已经得到了非常明确的回答。

<p class="english-text">>> And then the capitalist approach is messy, right? And it has boom bust cycles and it has companies go out of business and there's like sometimes there's too much competition and profits go to zero. But you have dynamism on your side, right? You've got freedom, exploration, creativity, innovation, free market competition and dynamism on your side. I think that question was asked and answered in the 20th century quite definitively.</p>

当然，中央集权的方式并非没有优势。如果你想生产两千万辆坦克或十亿部手机，自上而下的中央集权方式确实有其可取之处。然而，我认为我们在第一次冷战中获胜，是通过我们自己的方式。我认为我们赢得第二次冷战，也要通过我们自己的方式。每当有人站出来说我们需要变得更像中国时，我总是反问：不，实际上，如果我们采取相反的方法呢？如果我们变得更像我们自己呢？如果我们更深入地拥抱创新、创造力和企业家精神呢？如果我们能更像我们自己，我们能做的事情不是会多得多吗？

<p class="english-text">>> It's not that the centralized approach doesn't have certain advantages. Like if you want to pump out 20 million tanks or something or if you want to pump out a billion phones, there is something to a top down centralized approach. Having said that, like I think we won Cold War I by doing it our way. I think we win Cold War II by doing it our way. Every time somebody stands up and says we need to get to be more like China, I always ask the counter question, where we need like more state control, more top down, more direction, more planning and all these things, I always just ask the opposite question, which is, well, no, actually, like what if we take the opposite approach? What if we become more like us? And what if we lean even harder into innovation and even harder into creativity and even harder into entrepreneurship? And isn't there so much more that we could do if we got to be more like us?</p>

### 未来展望：新时代的黎明

>> 我认为我们正处在一个激动人心的时刻，无论是公共安全、国防部，还是政府其他部门，乃至全美国，对新技术的需要和需求都比以往任何时候都要大。我们也正处于一个重大的转型时刻。马克提到，机器人是人工智能在物理形态上的体现。我认为这将非常令人兴奋，而且比人们想象的要近得多。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean I think that we're in this exciting moment in time where both the need and the demand for new technologies whether it's in public safety or in the department of war or anywhere else in the government or just anywhere across the United States is greater than it's ever been. We're also at this major transformation moment. You know, Mark mentioned I think robotics is AI personified in physical form. I think it's going to be extremely exciting. I think it's a lot closer than people think.</p>

我们看到，我们正进入一个不可思议的时刻，新技术正在与这些非常传统和古老的领域相遇，我对未来的发展感到非常兴奋。我们看到越来越多的创业者进入这些不同领域。对我来说，这就像美国在将新技术引入这些关键领域方面正处于一个重大复兴的早期阶段。我认为这非常令人兴奋。

<p class="english-text">>> We just see that we're just sort of entering this incredible moment in time where new technology is meeting these very, very legacy and old categories and I'm very excited about where it's going. We see more and more founders entering the area across all these different domains. And for us, to me it's just like this, we're just in the early innings of America sort of on a major comeback when it comes to introducing new technology into these key areas. I think it's pretty exciting.</p>
