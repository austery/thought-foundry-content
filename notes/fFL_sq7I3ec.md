### 日记的非评判性空间

**Suleika Jaouad**: 对我来说，很重要的一点是，日记是一个你可以抛开任何评判的地方。它可以是残缺的句子，可以是列表，也可以是涂鸦。没有正确或错误的方式。我很少回头读我的日记，因为我不想点燃那种自我意识的引信。它真的是一个你可以做自己的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: One thing that's very important for me is that the journal be a place where you abandon any sense of judgment. It can be sentence fragments. It can be lists. It can be doodles. There's no right or wrong way to do it. I rarely go back and read my journals because I don't want to ignite that pilot light of self-consciousness. It's really a place where you come as you are.

**Rosie Garren**: 我是**Rosie Garren**。您正在收听的是**Wirecutter Show**。

<details>

**Rosie Garren**: I'm Rosie Garren. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 大家好，我是**Rosie**。新年快到了，我们正在倒计时迎接2026年。我通常会在年底的时候有点反思，回顾我完成了什么，没能完成什么，明年想养成什么习惯，以及想抛弃什么。今年早些时候，我们采访了《**炼金术之书**》的作者，她的名字是**Suleika Jaouad**。那是一次很棒的对话，充满了鼓舞人心的故事和实用建议，关于如何培养自己的创造力，以及日记具体如何在这方面支持你。我们觉得现在再次与大家分享这期节目会很棒。希望你们喜欢，新年快乐。

<details>

**Rosie Garren**: Hey everybody, it's Rosie. It's almost the new year. We're counting down to 2026. And I usually find myself at the end of the year in a bit of a reflective mood, thinking back on what I accomplished, what I didn't manage to get done, habits I'd like to pick up in the next year, things I would like to leave behind. Earlier this year, we recorded a conversation with the author of The Book of Alchemy. Her name is Sulea Jiad. It's a wonderful conversation full of inspirational stories and practical advice about how to nurture your own creativity and how journaling specifically can support you in doing that. We thought it would be a great episode to share with you again right now. We hope you enjoy it and happy new year.

### 创意实践与日记

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 大家好。嘿。我们正在做一些不同的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Hi guys. Hey there. So, we're doing something a little different.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。我在这里工作了很长时间，我们网站上有很多内容都非常支持创意实践，对吧？我们有乐器评论，有能帮助你成为更好厨师的东西，还有美术用品。显然，你不需要购买装备或新东西来变得有创意。任何人都可以有创意，看看孩子们，他们会在泥巴里玩树枝，他们非常有创意。但是，我确实认为，如果你正在进行一项创意实践并且真正投入其中，拥有合适的工具——就像是为正确的工作选择正确的工具，对吧？所以我认为拥有这些工具确实有一些好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. I mean, I've worked here a long time and we have a lot of coverage on the site that is really supportive of a creative practice, right? So, we have reviews for musical instruments, for things that can help you become a better cook, art supplies. You obviously don't need to buy gear or new things to be creative. Anyone can be creative, watch kids, they'll play around with sticks out in the mud and they're very creative. But I do think that if you are approaching a creative practice and you really get into it, having the right tools can it's the right tool for the right job, right? So I think there are some real benefits to having that.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 所以，无论你是在制作精致的餐点、撰写小说还是演奏音乐中找到乐趣，我们今天都将讨论解锁创造力的策略。我们的嘉宾是**Suleika Jaouad**。她是一位艺术家、记者和作家。她撰写了名为《**隔离日记**》的**Substack**专栏。她最近的著作是《**炼金术之书**》，它探讨了日记如何帮助释放你的创造潜力。这将是一次非常非常特别的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: So whether you find joy in making elaborate meals or working on a novel, playing music, we're going to talk about strategy for unlocking creativity today. And our guest is Sulea Jad. She's an artist. She's a journalist. She's an author. She writes the Substack called The Isolation Journals. And her most recent book is called The Book of Alchemy. And it explores how journaling can help unlock your creative potential. This is going to be a really, really special conversation.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哦，是的。如果你是《**纽约时报**》的读者，你可能会认出**Suleika**，她曾写过一个专栏，那是在十多年前，名为《**中断的生活**》，主要记录了她在20岁出头时与癌症抗争的经历。她还写了一本关于这段经历的《**纽约时报**》畅销书，名为《**两个王国之间**》。我们将稍作休息，之后你们两位将与**Suleika**谈谈日记如何解锁创造力。再晚一点，你将与**Ariana Vasquez**谈论一些意想不到的日记工具。我会在最后与你们会合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Oh, yeah. And if you're a New York Times reader, you might recognize Sulea from the column she used to write. It was a little over a decade ago. called Life Interrupted, which basically documented her experience with cancer in her early 20s. She also wrote a New York Times bestseller about this experience called Between Two Kingdoms. We're going to take a quick break and on the other side, the two of you are going to talk with Sulea about how journaling can unlock creativity. And then a little bit later, you're talking with Ariana Vasquez about some unexpected journaling tools. And I'll catch up with you at the end.

### 日记与个人成长

**Rosie Garren**: 欢迎回来。现在我们请到的是**Suleika Jaouad**，她是热门**Substack**专栏《**隔离日记**》的作者，她最新的书是《**炼金术之书：一种启发人生的创意实践**》。今天，我们将深入探讨日记如何真正帮助你变得更有创意。**Suleika**，欢迎来到节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Welcome back. With us now is Sulea Jad. She writes the popular Substack, The Isolation Journals, and her most recent book is called The Book of Alchemy: A Creative Practice for an Inspired Life. Today, we're digging into how journaling can really help you become more creative. Sulea, welcome to the show.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 谢谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Thanks for having me on.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我们非常高兴你能来。对于不熟悉你故事的听众，你能简单介绍一下你是如何开始将日记作为日常实践的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: We are so pumped to have you here. For listeners who aren't familiar with your story, can you tell us a little bit about how you started journaling as a daily practice?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 我从能握笔的时候就开始写日记了。作为两个移民的孩子，我在幼儿园第一天报到时一个英语单词都不会说，我强烈地感到自己格格不入。小时候，日记之所以如此吸引我，是因为它是一个我可以完全做自己的空间。它不是优美的文字，甚至不是语法正确的文字。它是一个可以倾泻我脑海中所有思绪和感受的地方，那些我感觉无法大声分享的东西。所以，日记对我来说真的像一个避难所。但直到我22岁生病并被诊断出患有**白血病**，日记才真正成为我的一种生命线。我认为说日记救了我的命一点也不夸张。它是一个容器，我可以在其中书写发生的一切，并以我想要的任何方式使用它，有时像记者的笔记本，记录护士之间无意中听到的八卦；一个我可以发泄的地方；一个我可以谈论那些我无法大声说出来的事情的地方，比如我对疾病和预后的恐惧，以及那些感觉有些不好的情绪，比如嫉妒，看着我的朋友们在**Instagram**上旅行、开始工作、参加派对，以及年轻成人期的所有大大小小的里程碑，而我却感到深深的困顿。这真的很有趣，因为通常人们听到日记时，会觉得它很幼稚，会想到那种带锁的小笔记本，眼睛上点缀着小爱心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: So, I have been journaling from the time I was old enough to hold a pen. As the kid of two immigrants who showed up on the first day of kindergarten not speaking a word of English, I felt a palpable sense of being a misfit. What was so appealing about the journal as a kid is that it was a space where I could fully show up as I was. It wasn't beautiful writing. It wasn't even grammatical writing. It was a place to put all of the thoughts and feelings swirling around in my head that I felt I couldn't really share out loud. And so the journal for me really felt like a refuge. But it wasn't until I got sick at 22 and was diagnosed with leukemia that the journal really became a kind of lifeline. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that journaling saved my life. It was a container where I could write through whatever was happening and use it in whatever way I wanted as a kind of reporter's notebook on some days where I'd record overheard gossip between the nurses. A place where I could vent, a place where I could talk about the things that I couldn't say out loud. My fears around my illness and my prognosis. emotions that felt somehow unsavory like envy and watching my friends on Instagram traveling and starting their jobs and going to parties and all the other big and small milestones of young adulthood at a time where I felt profoundly stuck. It's just really interesting because usually when people hear journaling, they think it's childish, they think of the little notebook with the lock and the little hearts dotting the eyes.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 你在书中提到，有科学研究表明日记对心理健康及其益处有真正的影响。你能谈谈这方面吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: The way that you mentioned in your book, like there's scientific research that shows that journaling can have a real impact on your on on mental health and the benefit of it. So, can you just kind of talk a little bit about that?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的，日记的历史非常引人入胜。自古以来，人们就通过日记记录历史事件和个人经历，有证据表明日记有益处，从减轻焦虑和压力，到甚至改善免疫系统。但根据我的亲身经历，以及我撰写的**Substack**专栏《**隔离日记**》的反馈，日记对一个人的生活有着非常真实，甚至可以说是变革性的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah, the history of journaling is a fascinating one. People have been looking to the journal since the beginning of time to record historical events, to record personal events, and there is evidence that shows the benefits of journaling. Everything from reducing anxiety and stress to even improving your immune system. But I know anecdotally, both in the context of my own life and a substack I write called the isolation journals, the very real and dare I say transformational impacts of the journal on one's life.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 这就是为什么你的**Substack**如此受欢迎，因为人们真的感受到了与你和你所做的事情的联系，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: And that's why your your Substack is so popular is because people really felt a connection to you and and what you were doing, right?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的，我在疫情初期启动了它，目的是以一个100天项目的形式，与更广泛的社区分享我生病时培养的日记方法：每天一篇日记，配上一小段文字和灵感提示。因为在封锁初期，我们所面临的许多困境，对于我这个曾因医疗原因被隔离、无法出门的人来说，都感到很熟悉。令我非常惊讶的是，到第一个月底，我们吸引了来自世界各地、各个年龄段的超过10万人，他们不仅独自写日记，还互相分享日记内容。这个项目最有趣的地方在于，日记的形式并不总是像我那样。我是一个习惯写传统日记的人，或者说我生命中的大部分时间都是用笔记本和笔来写。但我们在这个项目早期听到的第一批女性中，有一位来自明尼苏达州的母亲，她失去了13岁的女儿。她决定在她的100天日记项目中，使用女儿旧的美术用品，每天创作一幅关于她女儿记忆的视觉日记。这成为了她的一种悲伤日记。她所说的话让我非常感动，她说这是她第一次，在失去孩子那种巨大而难以言喻的痛苦之外，也能够体验到回忆女儿的快乐，能够以这种非常美丽的创意方式与她交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah, I started it in the early days of the pandemic and the idea was to share this approach to journaling that I had cultivated when I was sick in the form of a 100 day project, one journal entry a day with a short passage and prompt for inspiration with a larger community because so much of what we were struggling with in those early days of lockdown felt familiar to me as someone who'd had to be in medical isolation, who couldn't leave my house. And to my great surprise, by the end of that first month, we had over a 100,000 people from all around the world of all ages, not only journaling individually, but also sharing those journal entries with one another. And what was so interesting about that project was that journaling didn't always look the way my journaling did. I am someone who keeps a kind of traditional journal or has for much of my life, a notebook and a pen. But one of the very first women we heard from during the early days of that project was a mother from Minnesota who'd lost her 13-year-old daughter. And she decided that for her 100day journaling project, she was going to use her daughter's old art supplies and make a visual journal entry every day of a memory with her daughter. And it became a kind of grief journal for her. And what she said that moved me so much was that it was the first time that alongside the immense indescribable pain of losing your child she for the first time was also able to access the joy of remembering her of being able to commune with her in this kind of creative way that is so beautiful.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 《**隔离日记**》这个项目，这个在疫情初期进行的100天项目，是你的新书的起源，对吗？对于可能不熟悉这本书的听众来说，它充满了来自一些非常非常著名作家的精彩文章。你有像**Gloria Steinem**、**George Saunders**、**Salman Rushdie**这样的人，但也有一些不那么有名的人为这本书贡献了文章。此外，还有写作提示。那么，你能告诉我们这本书是如何从那个项目中发展而来的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: The isolation journals. This project, this 100 day project at the beginning of the pandemic, this is sort of the the genesis of your new book. For listeners who maybe aren't familiar with the book, it is filled with these awesome essays from some very very famous writers. You've got people like Gloria Steinum, George Saunders, you have Salman Rushi, but you also have people that are not famous who have contributed essays to this book. And then there are also writing prompts. So, can you tell us a little bit about how the book developed from that project?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 尽管我是一个天生喜欢写日记的人，但我认为，像许多尝试写日记的人一样，我有时会放弃，因为我厌倦了重复同样的事情，感觉生活停滞不前，因此日记也停滞了。或者有时我不写日记，而这通常是我最需要写日记的时候，那是因为有些事情太脆弱，不忍触碰，有点太烫手了。所以这些年来，我尝试过各种日记方式。但我在《**隔离日记**》中找到的是这种“被提示”的概念。我不是那种通常会喜欢别人指导我按提示写作的人。那对我来说可能更像是家庭作业，有点过于指令性。但阅读一篇短文，阅读一个提示的体验，有一种万花筒般的效果，就像扭动万花筒的筒身，光线以不同的方式落下。有时我喜欢这个提示，它立刻激发了一个想法。有时我讨厌这个提示，这本身也很有趣，我也会写下这种感受。有时我完全忽略提示，但文章中有一句话触动了我。所以《**隔离日记**》一直在继续。它现在是一个每周通讯。但在运营《**隔离日记**》的过程中，我有幸收集到了我认识的最有创意的人撰写的精彩文章和提示。当我说“有创意”时，我指的是非常广泛的范围，因为是的，有像**George Saunders**这样的人，但这本书的许多贡献者并不是你通常会认为有创意的人。我们最年轻的贡献者当时只有六岁，是一位两次脑癌幸存者，名叫**L. Sullivan**。我们有一位在德克萨斯州单独监禁中，离执行死刑只有几天的人，他写了一篇文章和提示。我们还有一位即将成为寡妇的年轻母亲，她的丈夫病重，她正期待着新的开始，她提供了一个美丽的提示。这些人涵盖了如此广泛的范围，他们在我看来都体现了创意炼金术的精神。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Despite being a person who is primed to enjoy journaling, I think like a lot of people who've attempted to journal, there are moments where I either fall off because I'm tired of repeating the same old things and I feel like I'm stuck in my life and therefore I get stuck in my journal entries or other times where I don't journal and it's usually when I need to journal most and that's because there's something that feels too tender to look at. It's a little too hot to touch. And so I've tried every kind of journaling over the years. But what I arrived at with isolation journals was this notion of being prompted. And I am not someone who typically, if someone had instructed me to write to a prompt, thought I would have enjoyed that. It would have probably felt like homework to me and a little too directive. But the experience of reading a short essay, of reading a prompt has a kind of kaleidoscopic effect of sort of twisting the chamber and the light falls differently. And sometimes I love the prompt and it immediately sparks an idea. Sometimes I hate the prompt and that's interesting in and of itself and I write about that. Sometimes I ignore the prompt altogether, but there's one sentence I read in the essay that moves me. And so the isolation journals has continued. It's now a weekly newsletter. But in the course of running the isolation journals, I've gotten the privilege of gathering these incredible essays and prompts from the most creative people I know. And when I say creative, I say that very broadly because yes, there are the George Saunders, etc. of the world. But many of the contributors in this book are not people who you would typically think of as creative. Our youngest contributor was six years old at the time, two-time brain cancer survivor named L. Sullivan. We have a man who writes an essay and prompt who's days away from execution in solitary confinement in Texas. We have a beautiful prompt from a young mother who is about to become widowed, whose husband is sick and is anticipating a new beginning. It's such a wide range of people who to me embody that spirit of creative alchemy.

### 创意疗愈与日记的扩展

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我想谈谈你在新书中提到的一件事，即写日记能够治愈创意创伤。你能详细谈谈这一点吗？也许可以举一些你在《**隔离日记**》社区成员中，或者那些亲自给你反馈的人身上看到的具体例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: I want to talk a little bit about something that you talk about in this new book, how the act of journaling has this ability to heal creative wounds. Can you talk a little bit about that and maybe some specific examples that you've seen maybe in the people that are involved in in the isolation journal community or who've just responded to you personally?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的。我的丈夫对我来说是**John**，我13岁时在乐队夏令营认识了他。但现在对全世界来说，他是**John Batiste**，是的，我作为一名杰出的音乐家，显然是有偏见的。我认为毫无疑问他是一位杰出的天才，一位音乐天才，一个彻头彻尾的杰出人物。我把这本书献给他，因为在某些方面，我认为他是我第一位创意炼金术理念的老师。他也是这本书的贡献者之一。但当我22岁时，我发现自己被困在纽约市的医院病房里大约两个月，**John**，一个乐队夏令营的老朋友，得知我生病了，他最终带着他的整个乐队，未经通知、不请自来地出现在我的病房门口。就在我的病房里，他和他的乐队开始演奏。随着大号、口风琴和萨克斯管的声音传到走廊，病人和医生、护士们开始好奇地探出头来，围到我的病房周围。每个人都开始拍手、跳舞和唱歌。肿瘤病房通常不是欢乐的地方，可以说它们通常是缺乏音乐的地方，但在**John**的演奏下，他将一个极其严峻和艰难的日子变成了一场最欢乐的“第二线”游行。我想，目睹这一切让我开始思考如何实现我自己的创意炼金术体验。对我来说，这总是发生在日记中。因此，我得以见证许多人以自己的方式做到这一点。我最喜欢的《**隔离日记**》早期社区成员之一是一位80多岁的老人，名叫**Charlie Greenman**。他以前从未写过日记，也不觉得日记适合他，但他现在已经成为我们社区最热心、最活跃的成员之一，他热爱写日记。他这样描述：“这感觉像是一场冒险，我不知道它会走向何方，但最好的事情是我不需要知道。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah. So, my husband to me is John who I met at band camp when I was 13. But now to the rest of the world he is John Batiste who yeah I'm obviously biased as a brilliant musician. I I think there's no dispute that he is a brilliant genius musical genius and and and brilliant person full stop and I dedicated this book to him because in some ways I think he was my first teacher in the idea of creative alchemy. He's also one of the contributors in the book. But when I was 22 years old and I found myself here in New York City stuck in a hospital room for about 2 months, John, who was an old friend from band camp, learned that I was sick and he ended up showing up with his entire band unprompted unannounced at my hospital room door. And right there in my hospital room, he and his band began to play. And as the sound of the tuba and the melodica and the saxophone filtered out into the hallway, patients and doctors and nurses started to poke their heads out and to come around my room in curiosity. And everyone began to clap their hands and to dance and sing. Now oncology wards are not joyous places. I think it's safe to say they're typically musicless places, but in the place of the beeping IV poles and the wheezing of monitors, John transformed what was an incredibly grim and difficult day into the most joyous of second lines. And I think witnessing that led me to start to think about how I might enact my own experiences of creative alchemy. And for me, that's always taken place in the journal. And so I've gotten to witness so many people doing that in their own ways. One of my favorite early community members of the isolation journals is a man named Charlie Greenman who was in his 80s. He had never journaled before, didn't really think it was for him, and has become one of our most ardent, active members of the community, and he loves journaling. He says that the way he described it, he said, "It feels like an adventure, and I have no idea where it's going, but the best thing is I don't need to know."

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 你在其他方面也是一个非常有创意的人。你画画，你还有其他的创意实践。你觉得写日记是否也与这些其他的创意实践有所关联？比如，我发现如果我早上冥想，我的一天往往会更好、更平静，一切似乎都连接得更好。当你写日记时，你也有类似的体验吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: You're also a really creative person in other ways, too. You paint. You have other creative practices. Do you find that journaling kind of speaks to those other creative practices? You know, like I find for instance, if I meditate in the morning, I tend to have a better, calmer day and everything seems to connect a little bit better. Do you have a similar experience when you journal?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 绝对是。我觉得在提笔之前，我就是一团混沌。我是一个在开始写下思绪之前，不太清楚自己感受如何，甚至不知道如何理清思绪的人。对我来说，很重要的一点是，日记是一个你可以抛开任何评判的地方。它可以是残缺的句子，可以是列表，也可以是涂鸦。没有正确或错误的方式。我很少回头读我的日记，因为我不想点燃那种自我意识的引信。它真的是一个你可以做自己的地方。无论写出什么都很好。我想写多久就写多久，如果只有30秒，只要我坚持不懈地做，那也很好。我确实认为它影响了我创意工作和生活的方方面面。三年前，我发现**白血病**复发了，需要再次进行骨髓移植，我住进了医院，当时我想，我能行。我带了大约六本日记。我有我的医疗日记、记者笔记本，还有我的个人日记。我的视力暂时受损了几周，无法写日记，所以我开始写视觉日记。我不是受过专业训练的画家，但我开始使用水彩，并且对绘画产生了痴迷。这是一种全新的创意语言，如果没有写日记的行为，我肯定永远不会偶然发现它。我认为，对我来说，这正是日记之所以能持续不断地带来活力和趣味的原因，它让你能够不带任何目标或结果地写作，你可以追随直觉的线索，而不知道它会把你引向何方。这种意识流对我来说非常重要，它能帮助我触及真相之下的真相之下的真相。只需花一点时间深呼吸，坐下来，通过写作找回自我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Absolutely. I feel like I am made of chaos until I put pen to paper. I'm someone who doesn't quite know what I'm feeling or how to even begin to entangle my thoughts until I start to write them down. And one thing that's very important for me is that the journal be a place where you abandon any sense of judgment. Can be sentence fragments. It can be lists. It can be doodles. There's no right or wrong way to do it. I rarely go back and read my journals because I don't want to ignite that pilot light of self-consciousness. It's really a place where you come as you are. Whatever comes out is great. I do it for as long as I want or for 30 seconds if that's all I have as long as I do it consistently. And I do think that it has informed every aspect of both my creative work and my life. I 3 years ago found out that the leukemia was back, was going to have another bone marrow transplant, went into the hospital and I was like, I've got this. I brought like six journals. I had my medical journal, my reporter's notebook. I had my personal journal and my vision was temporarily impaired for a couple of weeks and I wasn't able to journal and so I started keeping a visual journal. I'm not a trained painter and started using watercolor and I have become obsessed with painting. It is a whole new creative language that I certainly would never have stumbled across without the act of keeping a journal. And I think that to me is what keeps it endlessly enlivening and interesting is the ability to write without any goal or outcome in mind where you get to follow the thread of your intuition without knowing where it's going to lead. And that kind of stream of consciousness to me is so important in getting to the truth beneath the truth beneath the truth. And just taking a small moment to take a deep breath to sit down and to write my way back to myself.

### 培养日记习惯的建议

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我觉得很多人读了你的书，听了你的故事，听了这个播客后会感到受到启发。然后，你可以随心所欲地做任何事情，这很棒，但有时也可能有点令人望而生畏。你知道，就是那种你可以做任何你想做的事情，但从何开始，如何坚持下去呢？你有什么建议可以帮助那些想开始并持续坚持写日记的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: I feel like a lot of people will read your book or hear your story, listen to this podcast and feel inspired and then there's so much freedom that you can do whatever you want and that's awesome but sometimes it could also be a little bit daunting. You know, just the idea of you could do anything you want but like where do you start and how do you keep going? Do you have any advice to help people who want to start this continue doing it consistently?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的。我认为这是最困难的事情之一，因为很多人买了日记本，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah. I mean, I think that's one of the hardest things because lots of people buy a journal.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我就是这样。

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Guilty as charged,

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 然后又买了一个新的日记本，因为那个旧的“毁了”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: then buy another journal because that one's ruined.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 这是为了美观，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: It's the aesthetic

**Suleika Jaouad**: 包含了你未能坚持的证据。所以，对我来说，总是有所帮助的是某种形式的责任感。我喜欢100天的“容器”概念，这本书就是设计成一个100天项目，包含100篇散文和提示。但也许可以从10天开始，或者从30天开始，并有一些东西来提示你。因为我不知道你怎么样，但空白页会立刻唤起所有问题，当然最大的问题是“我到底有什么可说的？”所以，有一个小小的指导，可能会把你的思路推向一个意想不到或新的方向，我发现这很有用。无论出现什么都很好。如果是你的购物清单，太棒了。如果是一些小抱怨，那也很好。你不再把它们背负在身上了，你已经把它们外化到纸上了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: contain the evidence of your failure to commit. So, for me, what's always helped is some kind of accountability. I love the 100 day container and the book is designed as a kind of 100 day project with a 100 essays and prompts but maybe start with 10, maybe start with 30 and some things to prompt you because I don't know about you but the blank page immediately summons all of the questions certainly the big question of what is it do I that I possibly have to say? And so just having a a little directive that might push your train of thought in a unexpected or new direction I find to be useful. And whatever comes up is great. If it's your grocery list, wonderful. If it it is a petty grievance, fabulous. You're no longer carrying that around in your body. You've externalized it onto the page.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Yeah.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我们将稍作休息，回来后我们将讨论日记的实际操作。**Suleika**，我们将谈论你最喜欢的日记工具，之后我们将请来我们的同事**Ariana Vasquez**，谈论一些我们评测和推荐的意想不到的数字工具。我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: We're going to take a quick break and when we're back, we're going to talk brass tax of journaling. Sulea, we're going to talk about your favorite tools for journaling and then after that we're going to bring on one of our colleagues, Ariana Vasquez, to talk about some unexpected digital tools that we've reviewed and recommended. We'll be right back.

</details>

### 传统日记工具与习惯

**Rosie Garren**: 欢迎回来。我们和《**炼金术之书**》的作者**Suleika Jaouad**在一起。我们之前谈到了养成日记习惯如何帮助你释放创造力。现在我们将深入探讨一些实际细节。**Suleika**，因为这是一个**Wirecutter**播客，我们当然要讨论你的装备。你是一个喜欢笔和纸的人，对吧？你必须手写。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Welcome back. We're here with Sulea Jad, author of the book of alchemy. So earlier we talked about how adopting a journaling practice can help you unlock creativity. And now we're going to get into some of the practical details. So Sulea, because this is a wire cutter podcast, of course we have to discuss your gear. So you are a pen and paper person, right? You have to handwrite.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 我是一个喜欢笔和纸的人。你做任何适合你的事情。我个人无法抗拒退格键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: I am a pen and paper person. You do whatever works for you. I personally can't resist the backspace bar.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 哦，我也是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Oh, me too.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 所以，为了不进行自我编辑，钢笔墨水越浓越好。我实际上用的是一支**Lamy**钢笔。我喜欢手掌接触纸张的感觉。这样我不太可能划掉东西或重新开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: And so, in order to not self-edit, the inkier the pen, the better, I actually use a fountain pen, a lammy pen. And I like the feel of palm on paper. And I'm less likely to scratch things out or to start over.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 你有喜欢的纸张吗？因为如果你用钢笔，你选择什么纸？好的。它像那种旧的皱巴巴的羊皮纸吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Do you have a favorite paper that you use? Cuz if you're using a fountain pen, what what's your paper of choice? Okay. Is it like an old wrinkled like scribe?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的，没错。我手工制作纸张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah, exactly. I make the paper by hand.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 你把它配对起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: You match it up.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 我收藏了很多日记本。我喜欢来自某个国家的药店练习本。如果我去一个新的国家，我就会有我的**Leuchtturm**和**Moleskine**。我真的不太在意日记本本身。我现在用的是**Leuchtturm**，我非常喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: I have a collection of journals. I love a drugstore composition book from a country. If I'm visiting a new country, I have, you know, my look terms and my Moleskins. I'm really not precious about the actual journal itself. Right now I'm using a Luke term and I like the Luke term a lot.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 它们的纸质非常柔软。纸张的质地非常可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: They have really nice soft paper. I It's like very very the texture of the paper is really lovely.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 它们有这种无酸、防墨水渗透的纸张，这对于钢笔来说尤其重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: They have like this acidfree ink bleed proof paper which is especially important with the with the fountain pen.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 听起来是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Sounds like it.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Yeah.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的，我实际上想回到你的日记仪式。你总是固定时间写吗？你在户外写吗？你的物理设置是怎样的？你是如何养成日记习惯的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Well, I actually want to get back into your ritual of journaling. Do you always do it at a specific time? Are you outside? What does your physical setup look like? How do you get into your journaling habit?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 所以，你知道，我们谈到了责任感，我认为这对于持续做某事很重要，但我也认为把它融入你日常生活中不可或缺的一部分也很重要。所以，对我来说，我的日常生活中唯一不可或缺的部分可能就是我的第一杯咖啡。就像，在我喝到第一杯咖啡之前，其他任何事情都不会发生。所以那就是我写日记的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: So, you know, we talked about accountability as something that I find to be important in order to do it consistently, but I also think folding it into a non-negotiable part of your routine is important. So, for me, perhaps the only non-negotiable part of my routine is my first cup of coffee. like nothing else is going to happen until I have that first cup of coffee. And so that's when I journal.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 有时我会在法式压滤咖啡冲泡的5分钟里写日记，然后继续写。但通常是在我喝第一杯咖啡的时候。我日常生活中另一个不可或缺的部分是遛狗。所以我会在我遛狗回来后写。但我认为，你知道，我听到的最常见的事情是“我没有时间写日记”。对于任何这样说的人，我建议他们看看手机上花在他们选择的社交媒体应用上的时间。我想说的是，你会为你重视的事情腾出时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Different times I would journal and the 5 minutes it took for my French press to steep and then I would keep journaling. But it's usually around my first cup of coffee. My other non-negotiable part of my routine is walking my dogs. So I'll do it when I get back from walking my dogs. But I think the most common thing I hear is I don't have time to journal. And to anyone who says that, I would suggest that they look on their phone at the number of hours they've spent on their social media app of choice. What I would say is that you make time for the things that you value.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 以及对你重要的事情。所以，我真正努力为自己做的一件事就是降低门槛。我不拘泥于页数，当然也不拘泥于字数。我的感觉是，如果我出现了，即使只有几句话，那也足够了。我更感兴趣的是它的**一致性**，因为在保持一致的过程中，特别是如果我没有把它弄得太复杂，我更有可能回来，也更有可能从中获得好处，以至于我真的会优先考虑它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: And that are important to you. And so, one thing I really try to do for myself is to lower the barrier to entry. I don't adhere to a page count or certainly a word count. My feeling is if I show up, even if it's a couple of sentences, that is more than enough. I'm much more interested in in the consistency of it because in the act of being consistent, especially if I'm not making it too complicated, I'm more likely to return and I'm more likely to reap the benefits of it in a way that does make me prioritize it.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 除了笔和纸之外，你的创意实践中还有什么其他东西能帮助支持你的日记实践吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Is there anything else that you use in your creative practice beyond pen and paper that helps kind of support your journaling practice?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 我热爱仪式感，我总是为自己设计和重新设计一些小仪式。所以我喜欢蜡烛，或者一些熏香之类的东西。通常，当我写日记时，我会蜷缩在沙发上，旁边放着咖啡和我的狗，还有某种蜡烛或类似的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: So, I I love ritual and I'm always designing and redesigning little rituals for myself. So, I love a candle or some incense or something. Typically, when I journal, it's curled up on the couch with my coffee with my dogs and some kind of a candle or something.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 你现在有喜欢的蜡烛吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Do you have a favorite candle right now?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 哦，天哪。好吧，你问我这个。我痴迷于**Le Labo**的**Santal 26**。我可能会说错。它是木质香调，但不会过于浓烈。它让我想起我父母曾经烧过的一种熏香。我想这就是我如此喜欢它的原因。而且它的香味能持续很长时间。所以我喜欢那支蜡烛。我用来进入创意模式的其他东西是水彩。除了文字日记，我还一直在写视觉日记，那可以是一个涂鸦，也可以是一种颜色的一个色块。我一直很兴奋能够扩展我对日记的早期定义，看看这如何改变我的思维方式以及我度过一天的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Oh my gosh. Okay, you're asking my I am obsessed with Lola Labo's Santal. I'm going to get it wrong. Santal 26. It's woodsy, but it's not overpowering. It kind of reminds me of an incense that my parents burned. I think that's why I like it so much. And it's lingers for a long time. So, I love that candle. Other things that I use that kind of get me into a creative mode is watercolor. I've been keeping a visual journal in addition to a written journal and that can be a doodle. It can be one swatch of a color. I've been really excited to sort of expand my earlier definitions of journal and to see how that kind of shifts the way that that I think and the way that I then move through my day.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 我桌上还有一叠我最喜欢的一些作家的日记，我发现那非常鼓舞人心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: The other thing I have on my desk are stacks of the journals of some of my very favorite writers and I find that to be really inspiring.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 太棒了。你现在有没有特别喜欢的一些？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: That's awesome. Do you have any particular ones that you're loving right now?

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 嗯，我会告诉你我桌上总是放着的那些。**Susan Sontag**的日记。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: Well, I'll tell you the ones that I always have on my desk. Susan Zantag's

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Oh, yeah.

</details>

**Suleika Jaouad**: 还有**Virginia Woolf**的。**Audre Lorde**的《**癌症日记**》。我喜欢**Frida Kahlo**的日记，因为它们是写作和绘画的混合体。**Sylvia Plath**的，因为她实际上非常有趣和调皮。是的，我想我只是着迷于人们在不考虑读者的情况下如何写作和思考。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Suleika Jaouad**: journals. Virginia Wolf, Audrey Lord's The Cancer Journals. I love Freda Ko's journals because they're a kind of hybrid of writing and painting. Sylvia Pla because she's actually so delightfully funny and wicked. Yeah. I I think I'm just fascinated by how people write and think when they're not doing it with an audience in mind.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 非常感谢你今天加入我们。

<details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Thank you so much for joining us today.

### 数字日记工具

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 现在**Ariana Vasquez**和我们一起在演播室，她是**Wirecutter**的家庭办公室作家，她来和我们聊聊**Wirecutter**推荐的日记工具。**Ariana**尝试过很多不同的工具，所以我们很高兴能和她聊聊。**Ariana**，欢迎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: So now Ariana Vasquez is in the studio with us and she is Wire Cutter's home office writer and she's here to chat about journaling tools that Wire Cutter recommends. Ariana has tried a lot of these different tools so we're really excited to chat with her. Ariana, welcome.

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 嘿，谢谢。哦，这很令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Hey, thank you. Oo, this is exciting.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我们刚才和**Suleika**谈了用纸笔写日记。但是**Wirecutter**也推荐一些数字工具，对吧，用于写日记，特别是像数字笔记本。这到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: We actually just talked with Sulea about journaling with a paper and pen. But Wire cutter also recommends some digital tools, right, for journaling, specifically like digital notebooks. What even is this?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 想象一下你最喜欢的电子阅读器，比如**Kindle**或**Kobo**，它有纸张大小。你可以在上面书写、画笔记、素描。这与在平板电脑等玻璃上书写的感觉不同。笔在表面上会有更多的摩擦力。它不是**LED**屏幕，而是**电子墨水屏**，所以你会有更像用铅笔或钢笔在纸上书写的感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Imagine your favorite e-reader like a Kindle or a Coobo that's the size of a sheet of paper. You can write on them. You can draw notes. You can do sketching. It's a different feeling than writing on a glass like a tablet. There's a little bit more friction with the pen on the surface. It's not an LED screen. It is an e ink screen, so you get that feeling more of like a pencil or a pen on paper.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 那么这个设备会将你的日记条目存储在云端吗？你能够从其他设备访问它们吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: And is this device storing your entries in the cloud? Are you able to access them from other devices?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 是的，我们推荐的很多产品内部都有文件夹结构，你可以将所有笔记整理成不同的类别。你可以有一个日记本、一个待办事项清单和各种各样的东西。然后，有时通过订阅，有时通过购买设备，取决于你选择的型号，你可以将所有这些内容上传到驱动器、云端、你的**Google Drive**或他们自己的在线服务器，任何你需要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Yeah, a lot of all of our pics have like a folder structure inside where you can organize all your notes into different things. You can have a journal and a to-do list and various things. And then sometimes with the subscription, sometimes buying the device, depending on the model you get, you can have all of that stuff uploaded to a drive, a cloud, your Google Drive or their personal online servers, whatever you need.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的，太棒了。那么**Ariana**，为什么选择电子墨水笔记本而不是传统的纸笔呢？你为什么喜欢在电子墨水设备上写日记？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay, great. So Ariana, why choose an e in type of notebook over traditional pen and paper? Why do you like to journal on e- in?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 你有一个非常纤薄、轻巧的设备，里面有用于日记、待办事项、大型项目和计划的文件夹。我们所有的推荐产品都有一个应用程序，其中包含一个艺术空间，你可以在那里进行铅笔素描、艺术创作或涂鸦。虽然数字笔记本并非坚不可摧，但如果你的笔记已备份到云端，即使你的水瓶在包里打开了，你也不会像笔记本湿透了而没有机会快速擦干那样，失去所有内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: You've got one very slender, lightweight device that has folders for your journaling, your to-dos, your big projects and plans. All of our pics have a app of sorts that has an art space so you can do your pencil sketches or your arts or do your doodles. While digital notebooks are not indestructible. If your notes are backed up to the cloud and a bottle, your water bottle opens in your bag, you haven't lost all of that the same way that you would if your notebook got wet and you didn't get a chance to like wipe everything down really quickly.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 对。你带了一个到演播室。我们能看看吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Right. You brought one into the studio. Can we see?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 是的。这是**Remarkable**，是我们的一个推荐产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Yeah. This is the remarkable, which is a pick.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我喜欢这个名字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: I like that name.

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 是的，它很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: And yeah, it is pretty cool.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 你能描述一下它长什么样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Can you describe what this looks like?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 想象一个非常薄的练习本。就像一本大部分页面都被撕掉的笔记本，它可能只有四分之一英寸厚。然后它有一个锁定和解锁功能。当你解锁它时，它就是一个非常简单的用户界面，显示你所有的笔记本。你可以点击加号，例如打开一个快速页面。它本质上就像一个小小的艺术空间。所以如果你想在上面画画，或者

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Imagine a really thin composition notebook. like a notebook where most of the pages have been ripped out and it's maybe only like a quarter of an inch thick. And then you just it's got a lock and an unlock. And then when you unlock it, it's just a really simple user interface with all the notebooks that you have. You can hit a plus sign and open a quick sheet for example. And it's essentially like a little art space. So if you wanted to draw on it or

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 它也像**iPad**一样，附带一支笔。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: it's got a pen attached to it the way that like an iPad would, too.

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Yeah.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的，好的，我实际上对这种书写的感觉感到非常惊讶。我也是一个喜欢纸笔的人，因为我非常注重触感。这确实感觉有点像在白板上用马克笔写字，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay. Okay, I'm actually really surprised at the way that this feels to write on. I'm also a pen and paper person because I'm very tactile. This does feel like it's kind of like writing on a a whiteboard with a marker, right?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 我试试看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: I'm try it.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 这个做得相当不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: This does a pretty good job.

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 假设我正在写一本小说，我在海滩上写我的小说。我可以手写所有内容，然后就不必回去打字了。它就会直接

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Let's say I was working on a novel and I was at the beach writing my novel. I could write it all in hand and then I wouldn't have to go back and type it up. It would just like go

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 进入神奇的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: to the magical place.

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 我的意思是，我试过几次，它相当不错。我的笔迹可以把任何医生的笔迹都比下去。那真是鸡爪字。但它能把我那些勉强能辨认的字母转换成实际可读的单词，这很好，因为我写日记时的笔迹太糟糕了，尤其是我写得很快，进入心流状态，把东西写出来的时候，笔迹会变得非常糟糕，然后三天后我回头看，就不知道自己写了些什么。所以，它是一个非常方便的工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: I mean, I've I've tried it a few times and it's pretty good. like my handwriting can put any doctor's handwriting to shame. It's real chicken scratch. But it was able to get most of my barely passable letters into like actual words that I could read, which is nice cuz my handwriting is so bad when I'm journaling, especially if I'm moving fast and like in a flow and getting things out, it gets really bad and then I go back 3 days later and I'm like, I can't tell what the heck I wrote. So, it's it's a very handy tool.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 你能告诉我们你们推荐的产品是什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Can you tell us what our picks are?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 是的。我们的主要推荐产品是**Supernote Nomad**。它更小巧，更便携。它的书写体验与这个设备有点不同，你需要像旧平板电脑一样用力按压，但它非常棒。如果你喜欢高端钢笔，**Supernote**的钢笔很有分量，感觉像一支高端钢笔。这是我们的另一个推荐产品，**Remarkable 2**。我们还有另一个不同品牌的推荐产品，适用于不想使用**Amazon Kindle**应用的人。它是**Kobo**，与我们这里的**Remarkable**类似。如果你不喜欢使用**Kindle**，它也提供了使用其他第三方产品的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: Yeah. So, the primary pick is a Supernote. It's the Nomad. And it's smaller, more portable. It's a little bit different writing experience than this is in that you kind of have to press through like old old tablets, but it's fantastic. And if you're someone who really likes a premium pen, the pens that you can get from Supernote are like weighty and they feel like a premium pen. This is another one of our picks. This is the Remarkable 2. And then the other pick we have is by a different brand. It's for people who don't want to necessarily use the Amazon Kindle app. It's by Coobo and it's a similar to this one that we have here, the Remarkable. It also gives you the opportunity to use other third party stuff if that's what you prefer if you don't want to use Kindle.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的，太棒了。这些笔记本的大致价格是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay, great. And what is the ballpark price of of these notepads?

</details>

**Ariana Vasquez**: 就价格而言，我们这里的**Remarkable 2**是400美元，它们的价格范围从300到400美元不等，如果你想要更多功能，比如颜色，价格还会更高。所以价格仍然偏高。肯定比一个笔记本和一支笔贵得多，但你会用它更长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ariana Vasquez**: As far as prices go, this unit here, the Remarkable 2, is 400 and they range in price from 300 to 400 and they go up from there if you want more features like color for example. So, the prices are still kind of high. Definitely way more than a notebook and a pen would be, but you're going to have this for a lot longer.

</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 谢谢你，**Ari**。谢谢你的到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Thank you, Ari. Thanks for coming.

</details>

### 总结与反思

**Kyra Blackwell**: 太棒了。我对这些东西很感兴趣。我回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: That was so great. I'm very intrigued by these. I'm back.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 大家好。嘿。我想听听进展如何。你们都学到了什么关于创造力的东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Hello. Hey. I want to hear how it went. What did you What did you all learn about creativity?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 太好了。太好了。嗯，我非常喜欢和**Suleika**的这次对话。我非常喜欢她的许多建议，我打算采纳她在这一集中谈到的一点。如果你想养成一个习惯，就把它融入到你日常生活中无论如何都会做的一个不可协商的事件中。所以对她来说，就是喝一杯咖啡。那时她会写日记。我觉得那对我来说也是一个很好的时间来搭配一些写作。然后，和**Ariana**的谈话也很棒。我真的很喜欢这些数字笔记本。我想我想要一个。嗯，它们有点贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So good. So good. Um well, I was just really into this conversation with Sulea. I loved so much of her advice and I am going to take something that she talked about in this episode. If you're trying to establish a habit, rolling it into a non-negotiable sort of event that you do in your day anyways. So for her it was having a cup of coffee. that's when she journals. I feel like that's a really good time for me to pair some writing as well. And then it was also great to talk with Ariana. I'm really into these digital notepads. I think I want one. Um they kind they're kind of expensive.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 如果它们能把价格减半，我会很感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: I'd be interested if they cut the price in half.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。这是我应该等打折的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. Is this something I should wait for a sale?

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 也许吧。也许吧。它们的价格在300到400美元之间，所以不便宜，但我真的很喜欢其中一些也可以用作电子阅读器。所以我可能会觉得这很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Maybe. Maybe. They're they're $300 to $400, so they're not cheap, but I I really like that you could also use some of them as an e-reader. So I could find that. That's really cool.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的，我可能会以此作为理由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah, I could find that as a way to justify it.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 一个未来的工具。它真的很未来化。非常棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: A tool for the future. It It's really so futuristic. It's pretty awesome.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 太棒了。你呢？这次对话对你来说怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
