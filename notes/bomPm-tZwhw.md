### 项目介绍

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Rachel Abrams，这里是《The Daily》。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is The Daily.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 随着联邦政府在可再生能源项目及其他与**气候变化**相关的政策上逆转方向，各州、市和地方团体正在挺身而出。今天，我的同事 **Cara Buckley** 和 **Katherine Einhorn** 将介绍他们记录全国各地为解决气候和环境问题所做的、虽小但意义重大的努力的项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: As the federal government reverses course on renewable energy projects and other policies related to climate change, states, cities, and local groups are stepping into the breach. Today, my colleagues Cara Buckley and Katherine Einhorn on their project to document small but significant efforts to solve climate and environmental problems in every state in the country.

### 系列缘起

**Rachel Abrams**: 这是 1 月 2 日，星期五。Cara，Katherine，新年快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: It's Friday, January 2nd. Cara Katherine, happy new year.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 新年快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Happy new year.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 新年快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Happy new year.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你们两位刚刚完成了一个非常宏大且雄心勃勃的系列——“**50个州，50个解决方案**”。我必须说，它比我们通常在《纽约时报》上读到的报道要乐观得多。所以我想谈谈这个系列的起源。告诉我这个系列是怎么开始的。Cara，我先问你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The two of you just completed this really big and ambitious series, 50 states, 50 fixes. And I have to say it is more, let's say, optimistic than the types of stories we typically read in our August pages. So I want to talk about the origin of this. Tell me how this series started. Cara, I'm going to start with you.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 好的。要回答你的问题，我得回到过去。我以前是报社的文化记者。我采访过电影明星，报道过像“MeToo”这样的事件。但在此过程中，尤其是在 2010 年代后期，我发现很难消化所有关于地球**过热**、**物种灭绝**等负面**气候**新闻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Right. So to answer your question, I have to go back in time. I used to be a culture reporter at the paper. I was interviewing movie stars. I was reporting on things like me too. But throughout it all, especially in the late 2010s, I was finding it really hard to process all the negative climate news we were hearing about the planet overheating, species crashing, etc.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你当时遇到了个人困境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: You were having a personal struggle.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 我当时确实遇到了个人困境，而且我真的不明白人们是如何应对这一切的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: I was having a personal struggle and I just really didn't understand how people were coping with it.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 我想，我们能做什么？我能做什么？于是我想，也许我可以报道出来，但要以一种关注人们为**扭转气候变化**所做的所有努力的方式来报道。你知道，那些正在产生影响的事情，因为很多事情都能产生影响。所以，我在 2021 年加入了气候报道组，从一开始我的重点就是那些在社区里做着有效事情的人。这在某种意义上很不寻常，因为我们通常认为新闻业是报道问题，而不是解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: and I thought well what can we do? What can I do? And so I thought maybe I can report this out but in a way that focused on all these efforts that people were doing to try and reverse climate change. You know things that were having an impact because a lot of things can have an impact. So in 2021 I joined the climate desk and my focus from the start was on people that were doing things in their communities that were working which is kind of unusual in the sense that we normally think of journalism as writing about problems not about solutions.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对吧？所以这种报道方式就像是在关注，你知道，不是飞机失事，而是那些不仅成功着陆，而且做得非常出色的飞机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Right? So this kind of beat is kind of looking at you know not the plane crashes but the planes that are not only successfully landing but doing it really well.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 我早期报道的一个故事是关于人们接管旧高尔夫球场并对其进行**复育**，这有助于**生物多样性**。我还报道了印第安纳州**卡梅尔**市的**环岛**，它们是最可持续的交叉路口类型，并能减少**排放**。通过这三年的报道，我意识到每个州都会有解决方案。我听到了一些，于是我想，让我们给自己一个挑战，去找出每个州一个独特的**气候**或**环境**成功故事。Katherine，我记得几年前你刚加入气候与环境报道组时，我们谈过。我想你当时也有些担心如何报道这个话题，而不总是陷入 Cara 所说的那种**生存恐惧**的调调。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: An early story I did was about people taking over old golf courses and rewing them, which was helping biodiversity. I did stories about roundabouts in Carmel, Indiana, which are the most sustainable types of intersections and reduce emissions. And it was out of that reporting that I did over three years, I thought there's going to be a solution in every state. I was hearing about some of them and I thought let's set ourselves a challenge and also go and find out a distinct climate or environmental success story in each one of the 50 states. And Katherine, I remember us talking a few years ago right after you joined the climate and the environment desk. And I think you were also kind of concerned about how to write about this topic in a way that wouldn't always hit that same note of existential dread that Cara is talking about.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的。我记得给自己定了一个目标，要在故事的某个地方包含一个解决方案。即使它只在文末稍作提及，我也会至少说出解决方案是什么。我不知道我是否完全成功了，但我努力了。我加入气候报道组是为了报道**生物多样性**，也就是野生动物和生态系统。我报道**灭绝**，对吧？所以，当我第一次听说 Cara 的系列时，是在 2025 年 1 月，当然是在大选之后。我对此感到非常兴奋，因为我们知道特朗普总统将要**拆除**很多**气候政策**、**环境政策**和**环境法规**。我非常有兴趣关注人们仍然会做、正在做、一直以来都在做的事情，来解决州、地方和部落层面的问题，独立于联邦政府。我被这个系列深深吸引，因为我觉得那将是行动发生的主要场所。所以，当你开始做这个系列时，**任务**是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yeah. I remember setting a goal for myself that I would include a solution in the story somewhere. Even if it was a little bit at the bottom, I would at least say what the solution was in every story that I wrote. I don't know if I totally succeeded, but I tried. But I came to the climate desk to cover biodiversity, so wildlife and ecosystems. I cover extinction, right? So, when I first heard about CARA series, it was in January 2025 after the election, of course. And I was really excited about it because we knew that President Trump was going to be dismantling a lot of climate policy, environmental policy, environmental regulation. I was so interested to focus on the things that people will still be doing, are doing, have been doing to address things at the state, local, tribal levels separately from the federal government. I was really drawn to this series because it seemed like that's where a lot of the action was going to be happening. So when you set out to do this series, what was the mandate?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我们想要“多重赢利”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: We wanted win-winwins. Multiple wins.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 多重赢利。所以，它不仅仅是**韧性**，不仅仅是**适应**。它是那些正在**减少温室气体排放**、使**生态系统**更健康、帮助**恢复濒危物种**的事情。所以我们希望同时也能**改善人类健康**并**为人们省钱**。对吧？基本上，你是在通过这个系列展示我们的**气候**与我们的**经济**、我们的**健康**之间的**相互关联性**。听起来是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Multiple wins. So it's not just resilience. It's not just adaptation. It's doing things that are reducing greenhouse gas emissions that are making ecosystems healthier that are helping restore imperiled species. So we want at the same time helping human health and saving people money. Right. In a way basically you're showing the interconnectedness of our climate to our economy to our health with the series. It sounds like

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 精确地说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: precisely.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，到目前为止，你们已经报道了全部 50 个州。恭喜！你们走遍了全国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So at this point you have reported from all 50 states. Congratulations. You have traversed the country and

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 不仅仅是我们俩，公平地说。不是只有我们两个人。有一个完整的团队非常努力地完成了这个系列，包括我们部门的同事，以及全国的 50 多名摄影师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: not just us to be fair. It wasn't just the two of us. We had there was a whole team of people that worked really hard on this series including colleagues on our desk and on national 50 plus photographers.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 50 多名摄影师和 13 名记者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 50 plus photographers and 13 reporters.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 好的，这太棒了。我想聊聊其中的一些故事。那么，你们每人给我讲一个让你印象深刻的故事吧。也许是因为它带来了你提到的那种多重赢利或下游效应。Cara，我们先从你开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Okay, that is cool. I want to talk about some of those stories. So let's start with each of you telling me about one that really stood out to you. maybe because it had that multiple win or downstream effects that you mentioned. Cara, let's start with you.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 是的，绝对。有一个故事让我印象非常深刻，是关于密苏里州西北部的一位**殡仪员**。他住在该州最偏远的县之一。他叫 **Eric Chamberlain**。他经营一家家族殡仪生意。他很长一段时间以来一直在担心他的小镇越来越小，人们纷纷离开，而且不会回来，他一直在努力想办法，他能帮上什么忙？有什么办法可以扭转这个小镇的经济困境吗？有一天，他在开车送殡车时，去了爱荷华州边境，看到了巨大的白色**风力涡轮机**叶片。他以前从未见过它们。他想停下来，但他在护送葬礼队伍，所以他没有停。但他开始调查这件事，他联系了州**自然资源部**，他说：“我的地盘风很大。我们能不能在这里安装风力涡轮机？”他最终启动了一个**风能项目**。他说服当地农民在他们的田地里安装风力涡轮机。起初，只有四台。Eric 告诉我，他清楚地记得在 2008 年按下开关，看着小镇的**电力**计反转。Rockport 宣布，它是全国第一个风力发电量超过自身需求的社区。这开始蔓延。该县的更多地方开始安装风力涡轮机。如今，全县有超过 340 台。它提供了 50 个永久性工作岗位。至关重要的是，这个小镇从这些风力涡轮机中获得了**税收**基础。每年 600 万美元。这占该县房地产税收入的一半以上。它还为拥有风力涡轮机的农民提供了额外的收入。这从根本上改变了这个县的经济。而这一切都始于一个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Yeah, absolutely. So, one of the stories that really popped for me was about a funeral director in northwest Missouri. He lived in one of the most rural counties in the state. His name was Eric Chamberlain. He runs a family funeral business. And he had been worrying for a long time about how his small town was getting smaller. people were moving away and they weren't coming back and he was just trying to figure out like how could he help? Is there anything to reverse the economic misfortunes of the town? And he was at work one day driving a hearse. He was over the border in Iowa and he saw these giant white blades of a wind turbine. He'd never seen them before. He wanted to pull over, but he was leading a funeral procession so he did not. But he began investigating it and he approached the Department of Natural Resources at the state and he said, "There's a lot of wind in my neck of the woods. Can we maybe look at putting in wind turbines here?" He ended up setting in motion this wind energy project. He convinced local farmers to put wind turbines in their fields. At first, there were just four. And Eric told me he distinctly remembers flipping on the switch in 2008 and watching the town's electricity meter running backwards. Rockport announced it was the first community in the country to be producing more electricity from wind energy than what it needed. And this ended up acrewing. More places in the county started putting up wind turbines. Today there's more than 340 throughout the county. It supplies 50 permanent jobs. And really crucially, the town has a tax revenue base from these wind turbines. $6 million a year. It's more than half of the real estate tax revenue for the county. And it's supplying extra revenue for farmers who have wind turbines, too. It fundamentally changed the economy of this county. And it all started with one guy.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 哇。我想聊聊你系列中一个让我印象深刻的故事。我是个爱狗人士。这是一个狗狗成为英雄的故事。你猜我说的是哪个？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Wow. I want to talk about one of the stories that really stood out to me from your series. I'm a dog person. This is a story where dogs are the heroes. Can you guess which one I'm talking about?

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 蒙大拿州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Montana.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的，蒙大拿州。你想解释一下吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yes. Montana. You want to explain what it is?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的，是的。我知道我想写关于**牲畜守护犬**的故事，你知道，就是那些被培育用来保护牲畜免受**郊狼**或……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yeah. Yeah. I knew that I wanted to write about livestock guardian dogs, you know, which are dogs that are bred to protect livestock from predators like coyotes

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 或者**灰熊**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: or grizzly bears

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 或者灰熊，在这个案例中。在蒙大拿州，蒙大拿州的平原上，他们已经很久没有遇到灰熊了，因为我们基本上已经把它们从那个地区**灭绝**了。你知道，它们在很大程度上被灭绝了，在较低的 48 个州……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: or grizzly bears in this case. And in Montana, on the plains of Montana, they have not been dealing with grizzly bears for quite some time because because we basically eradicated them from that area. You know, they were eradicated from much of the lower 48 states

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 是因为它们危险，还是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: because they're dangerous or

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 因为它们被射杀了。在 1800 年代到 1900 年代初期，有很多**捕食者**活动，然后出台了法律，这些捕食者开始**反弹**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: because they were shot. There were a lot of predator campaigns in like the 1800s to early 1900s and then laws were put into place and these predators started rebounding

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: basically to preserve them. So they wouldn't go extinct.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: to preserve them basically. So they wouldn't go extinct.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 所以它们不会灭绝。正是如此。所以这些灰熊一直在慢慢地走回蒙大拿州的平原，那里在有生之年几乎没有人记得它们了。他们发现的一个东西是小麦和大麦农场。这对灰熊来说是很好的食物。如果是一只灰熊，这是非常好的、容易获得的食物来源。所以这些农民，他们以前从未有过熊来袭击他们的果园。现在突然之间，熊开始偷他们的苹果，袭击他们的谷仓，他们不敢出门，更不用说让孩子在外面玩了。在蒙大拿州，有一位名叫 **Wesley Sarmment** 的人，当时是州野生动物部门的**熊****经理**。所以他接到了所有这些农民的电话，他们都快绝望了，因为这些熊不断出现在他们的地盘上。Wesley 试图用尽一切办法让它们离开，包括**诱捕**，但这很危险。他试过让每个人都把谷物清理得很干净，但这是不可能的，因为那是正在运作的农场。他试过给谷仓通电，这确实有效，但对农场工人来说非常糟糕，因为它非常笨拙，让工作变得更困难。然后他听说一位当地农民的儿子发现了一只流浪的牲畜守护犬，一种**皮瑞尼**犬，你知道，通常会放在羊群旁边来保护它们免受郊狼或其他侵害。令所有人惊讶的是，这只狗竟然能把熊赶走，包括带着幼崽的母熊，灰熊。所以 Wesley 找到了一位研究牲畜守护犬的教授。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: So they wouldn't go extinct. Exactly. And so these grizzlies have been slowly walking back out to the plains of Montana where there's no real recollection of them in living memory. And one of the things that they've discovered is the wheat and barley farms. And this is like really good eating. If you're a grizzly bear, it's a really nice, easy source of food for them. And so these farmers, they never had bears raiding their orchards. Now all of a sudden there's bears stealing their apples and raiding their grain bins and they're scared to go outside, certainly to let their children play outside. And in Montana there's a man named Wesley Sarmment who at the time was the bear manager for the state wildlife department. So he's getting all these calls from these farmers who are just desperate because these bears keep showing up on their property. And Wesley's trying everything to get them to go away, including trapping them, but that's dangerous. He tried having everyone clean up the grain very well, but it was impossible because they're on a working farm. He tried electrifying the grain bins, which did work, but it was really bad for the farm workers cuz it was just really awkward and made working a lot harder. And so then he heard about a local farmer whose son found a stray livestock guardian dog, like a Pyrenees type dog, you know, that often put out like with sheep to protect them from coyotes or whatever. And to everyone's surprise, this dog was chasing bears away, including like mother bears with cubs, grizzlies. And so Wesley gets with this professor who studies livestock guardian dogs.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 他们决定进行一项研究，其中这些狗不看管牲畜。它们基本上是看管人。它们看管农场。他们选择了像**坎格尔犬**和**安纳托利亚牧羊犬**这样的大型土耳其犬种，并招募农民参与这项小型研究。这些狗对农民来说简直是**变革性**的。这个故事的美妙之处在于，这些狗在保护人们，也在保护熊，因为如果熊威胁到人们的生命和生计，它们就会被杀死。所以这些狗是**共存**的工具，而这些家庭非常喜爱这些狗，不止一位农民说过同样的话：“这只狗会为我牺牲生命。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: And they decide to try this study where the dogs were not guarding livestock. They were basically guarding people. They were guarding the farms. And they get these big breeds, these Turkish breeds like Kangles and Anatolian Shepherds, and they they recruit farmers to participate in this little tiny study. And these dogs were just transformative for the farmers. And like the the beautiful thing about this story is that these dogs were protecting the people and they were protecting the bears because if the bears are going to threaten people's lives and livelihoods, they're going to get themselves killed. So the dogs were this tool for coexistence and the families were really in love with the dogs and more than one farmer said the same thing which was this dog would lay down his life for me.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你从在蒙大拿州的整个经历以及人们想出的解决方案中得到的**启示**是什么？这个由这位熊经理和这位教授想出的**小想法**，最终为这些农民带来了**实际成果**，然后开始传播到其他农场，因为该地区的其他农民看到了它的**效果如何**，这真的很令人震惊。熊的拜访次数大大减少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: What was your takeaway from this whole experience in Montana and the solutions that these people had come up with? It was really striking how this little idea, you know, cooked up by this bear manager and this professor ended up having these real results for these farmers and then started spreading to other farms because other other farmers in the area were seeing how well it was working. Huge reduction in bear visits

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 突然之间，他们也得到了狗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: and so all of a sudden they were getting dogs.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 所以这是一个方面，这有点像整个系列，对吧？就是关于这些想法如何传播。另一个与灰熊特别相关的事情是，他们正在重新发现这种**古老的知识**，对吧？Wesley 深入研究了整个问题。他看到**美洲原住民社区**和灰熊之间的冲突减少了。他认为这可能与他们保留区周围游荡的那些狗有关。当然，他知道在欧洲和亚洲，几百年前就培育了这些大型犬来驱赶熊，对吧？所以他谈到，随着像灰熊这样的大型捕食者在过去几百年里消失，我们忘记了这些**共存**的方法。现在随着它们正在恢复，我们不得不重新学习这些被遗忘的古老习俗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: So that was one thing and that sort of speaks to the whole series, right, is about how these ideas can spread. The other thing specific to the grizzly bears is that they were really rediscovering this ancient knowledge, right? Wesley went into the whole thing. He saw less conflict between Native American communities and grizzlies. And he thought that maybe that had to do with all the dogs that kind of roam around on the reservation. And of course, he knew that in Europe and Asia, these large dogs hundreds of years ago were bred to chase bears, right? And so he talked about how with the loss of these big predators like grizzly bears over the last couple hundred years, you know, we forgot about these methods of coexistence. And now as they're recovering, we're having to relearn these ancient practices that had been forgotten.

</details>

### 挑战与政治化

**Rachel Abrams**: 你们俩为自己设定了寻找 50 个州故事的目标。我确实想知道，是否有任何原因导致某些州比其他州更具挑战性？显然，有些州在立法上，如果不是文化上，可能或多或少地更关注**气候**、**环境**和**保护**等问题。例如，我想象一下，如果你去了波特兰，很容易找到有人会想出有创意的**素食**解决方案来解决某个问题。顺便说一句，在我读你的故事之前，我甚至不知道有**素食纹身店**这种东西。所以，这是一个引子。任何听众都应该去读那个故事。但是，我想知道，你是否发现美国有些地区**更难**找到那些谈论我们一直在讨论的这些问题的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The two of you set yourselves up to find stories from all 50 states. And I do wonder if for any reason some states were more challenging than others. Obviously certain states just legislatively, if not culturally perhaps are more or less focused on things like climate, on things like environment, on things like conservation. For example, I would imagine if you went to Portland, you would be quite easy to find somebody who would come up with a creative vegan solution to something. By the way, I didn't even know before I read your story that there is such a thing as a vegan tattoo parlor. So, that's a tease. Anybody listening should just go read that story. But, I wonder, did you find areas of the country that were just harder to find folks who were talking about any of these issues that we've been discussing?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的，波特兰在**素食**选择方面确实让人惊叹。那里有一家**素食脱衣舞俱乐部**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yeah, Portland really boggles the mind in terms of its vegan offerings. It's home to a vegan strip club.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Wow.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的。舞者不允许穿皮革或羽毛。我不知道是否要说出她们的口号。它很性感。说出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yeah. The dancers are not allowed wear leather or feathers. I don't know if I'm going to say their motto. It is saucy. Tell it.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 口号是“我们把肉放在杆子上，而不是盘子里”。正如我所说，有创意的素食解决方案。但有些州确实比其他州更难。当我们进行这个系列到后期时，我们已经报道了太多关于如何应对气候和环境危机的**迭代**，我们不想重复。所以确实存在挑战，但我们最好的故事之一，我最喜欢的故事之一来自**北达科他州**，在我们最后批次的报道中。我的同事 Sachi Milky 在那里找到了一个很棒的故事。她发现**Standing Rock 部落**正在努力在部落土地上安装**电动汽车充电桩**。快速提醒一下，Standing Rock 这个名字我们都熟悉，是因为**达科他输油管道**抗议活动，那曾是全国乃至国际新闻。他们试图阻止一条管道穿过他们的土地。他们也为此努力了多年，同时也在努力摆脱他们部落土地上的**化石燃料**，拥抱所有这些**清洁能源项目**。最近，他们一直在安装电动汽车充电桩，这样你就可以开车了，这是一个**部落间网络**的一部分，所以你可以在穿越部落土地时驾驶电动汽车，而无需加油。我想安装电动汽车充电桩不是一个便宜的项目，尤其是我没记错的话，Standing Rock 保留地位于一个有很多**贫困**的地区，对吧？达科他输油管道的问题之一就是它穿过了这个本已脆弱的地区。他们从哪里获得这个项目的资金？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: The motto is we put the meat on the pole, not on the plate. As I said, creative vegan solutions. But some of the states were definitely harder than others. And by the time we were working through the series towards the end, we had covered so many iterations of how to tackle climate and environmental crisis that we didn't want to do repeats. And so there were challenges for sure, but one of our best stories, one of my favorite stories came from North Dakota, which it was in our second last batch of stories. And my colleague Sachi Milky found a beautiful story there. She found that the Standing Rock tribe was deep in an effort to get EV chargers set up throughout tribal lands. And just remind us quickly, Standing Rock. We all know that name because because of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, which were national international news. They were trying to stop a pipeline from going through their land. And they had been trying for years as well, concurrent to that, to get off fossil fuels in their tribal lands by embracing all these clean energy projects. And more recently, they've been putting up EV chargers so you can drive, it's part of a intertribal network, so you can drive electric vehicles without ever having to gas up as you drive through tribal lands.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 对。那么，他们从哪里获得这个项目的资金呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I would imagine that installing electric vehicle chargers is not an inexpensive project, especially if I'm not mistaken, the Standing Rock Reservation, that is in an area where there's a lot of poverty, right? That was one of the issues with the Dakota Access Pipeline is it was cutting through this already sort of vulnerable area. Where did they get the money for this project?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 对。嗯，一个主要的来源是**能源部**的**拨款**。他们赢得了一项 600 万美元的拨款来资助这项工作。所以，这使得这一切成为可能。正如我们在对话开始时所讨论的，然而，联邦资金、联邦在环境和气候方面的倡议正在消失或被**拆除**。所以我只是想知道，这对未来的类似项目有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Right. Well, one major source it was the Department of Energy grants. They won a $6 million grant to help fund this effort. So, that made this possible. And as we spoke about at the beginning of this conversation, however, federal money, federal initiatives for environment and climate are going away or being dismantled. So I just sort of wonder how does that affect programs like this in the future?

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 是的，很多项目不得不**搁置**，你知道。在阿肯色州**费耶特维尔**，他们通过**堆肥**减少了**垃圾填埋场**的**甲烷排放**，他们有两个价值 2000 万美元的**气候韧性项目**不得不推迟。但另一方面，城市也在关注属于他们管辖范围内的、可以**节省大量资金**的事情。在**匹兹堡**，当它决定处理**光污染**时就是这种情况。光污染，一种我不知道有多少人真正认为是**真正污染**的污染。人们不认为它是真正的污染，但根据 2023 年的一项研究，它在全球范围内以每年 10% 的速度增长。许多地方**过度照明**。你知道，我们知道晚上不应该暴露在**蓝光**下。就像我们盯着电脑屏幕一样。我们知道。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Yeah, a lot of them are having to put things on hold, you know. So in Fagetville, Arkansas, where they've reduced methane emissions from the landfill through composting, they had two $20 million climate resilience projects they had to shove. But on the flip side, cities are looking at things too that are under their purview where they can save a lot of money. And that was the case in Pittsburgh when it decided to tackle light pollution. Light pollution, a type of pollution that I wonder how many people actually think of as real pollution.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的，我们知道，但我们不这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: People don't think of it as real pollution, but according to a 2023 study, it's growing globally at 10% a year. Many places are overlit. You know, we know that we're not supposed to have exposure to blue light at night. Like, we're staring at our computer screens. We know.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 但我们不这样做，但我们知道，我们知道它正在影响我们的**褪黑素水平**。它不仅仅影响我们。它影响**授粉者友好物种**、鸟类和蝙蝠。随着全球光照的增长，它还在干扰**大气**中实际清洁空气的过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Yes, we know that, but we don't do it. But we don't do it, but we we know we know it's having impact on our melatonin levels. It's not just impacting us. It's impacting pollinator friendly species and birds and bats. It's also interfering as global light grows. It's interfering with processes in the atmosphere that actually clean the air

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 需要**夜间黑暗**才能根据一项研究来过滤污染。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: that need nighttime darkness according to a study to literally filter out the pollution.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Wow.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 是的。我们还为此消耗了大量**能源**。所以，在匹兹堡，一位那里的**天文学教授**，她希望她的学生能在夜间看到**黑暗的天空**。她一直在积极呼吁，试图提高人们对**更柔和、更暗淡灯光**益处的认识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Yeah. We're also using a ton of energy doing it. And so in Pittsburgh, an astronomy professor there, she wanted her students to see the dark skies at night. and she had been agitating trying to raise awareness about the benefits of dimmer, softer lights.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，他们想出了什么办法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So, what did they come up with?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 他们想出了**可调光路灯**，城市官员可以通过手机进行**调光**。就像，如果你是城市官员，你可以在手机上滑动一下，就能降低夜间路灯的亮度。他们还设计了带有**遮罩**的路灯。所以，光线不会向上眩光，从而可能**扰乱鸟类和其他飞行动物**，而是被遮罩住，并将光线直接向下引导。而且他们还**省钱**。该市预计每年将节省 942,000 美元的**能源成本**，并每年**减少 12,000 公吨二氧化碳排放**。有一件事让我听着这些故事时真的感到惊奇，就是我们一次都没有谈论过**政治**。这些似乎不是政治问题或政治化的解决方案。这似乎是人们在自己的社区里试图弄清楚如何处理一个具体影响我的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: So, they came up with dimmable street lights that certain city officials can dim from their phones. Like, you can just swipe across your phone if you're a city official and turn down the intensity of street lights at night. They also designed street lights that have hoods over them. So instead of the light glaring upwards where it can disorient birds and other flying animals, they're hooded and just direct the light down. And they also save money. The city projects that it'll save 942,000 in energy costs a year and it'll prevent 12,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. One thing that's really striking me listening to these stories also is that we have not talked about politics once. These do not seem like political problems or politicized solutions. These seem like people in their communities trying to figure out how do I deal with a problem that is affecting me specifically.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我可以想象，你遇到的那些人，我指的是，你们去了所有 50 个州，你们可能遇到了来自非常不同观点和出发点的人。所以，我只是想知道，关于报道这件事的**政治**，有什么可以说的吗？我来举个例子。**俄克拉荷马州**修复的河流比任何其他州都多。他们之所以能做到这一点，部分原因在于他们能够说服农民，尤其是**养牛农民**，把牛从河里赶出来。给牛围起来。所以，一位这样做的农民发现，因为他的牛不再喝脏水，它们长得更快了，他的**兽医账单**也降低了，而且因为它们不再在河岸上滑来滑去，整个河岸都**恢复了生机**，有了**野生动物**。**白头鹰**在筑巢。我们一次都没有谈论过政治。他谈论的是做那些能帮助他**盈利**、帮助他的牛更健康、并帮助**自然**的事情。同样，在我们很多报道中，我不会说它**超越了政治**，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And I would imagine though that the folks you talked to, I mean again you went to all 50 states, you probably encountered folks who all come from very different perspectives and starting points. So, I just sort of wonder what if anything there is to say about the politics of reporting on this. I'm going to jump in with an example. Oklahoma has restored more streams than any other state. And part of the reason they were able to do that is they were able to convince farmers, especially beef farmers, keep your cows out of the streams. Fence off your cows. So this farmer that had done this, he found that because his cows weren't drinking crappy water, they were putting on more weight, his vet bills were going down, and they were also because they weren't slip sliding up and down the bank. The whole bank had come back to life with wildlife. Bald eagles were nesting. We didn't talk about politics once. He was talking about doing things that helped his bottom line, helped his cows be healthier, and helped nature. In the same token, it was almost like in a lot of our reporting, it I'm not going to

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 但人们想要**干净的空气**。他们想要**干净的水**。他们想要周围的美景。这就是我们在报道的每个州都发现的一条**主线**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: say it transcended politics, but people want clean air. They want clean water. They want beauty around them. And that was like a throughine we found in every single state we reported on.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我确实想知道，也许你访问的社区没有关于问题是什么的疑问，但我可以想象，也许关于**原因**存在争论，尤其是当它与**气候**有关时。那么，原因在你们的谈话中占了多大比重，或者说，原因在多大程度上影响了人们为自己想出的解决方案？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I do sort of wonder like maybe there was no question in the communities that you visited about what the problem was, but I can imagine that maybe there was debate about what the cause was, especially especially as it related to climate. And I how much did that factor in to your conversations or even like how much did the cause of things affect the solutions that people were coming up with for themselves?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 我确实认为值得指出的是，有时人们不想谈论**气候变化**。比如，他们有时会感到，我采访人们时，他们甚至不敢使用“气候变化”这个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: I do think it's worth pointing out that sometimes people didn't want to talk about climate change. Like they almost felt sometimes I'd be interviewing people and they'd be scared to even use the term climate change.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 而且你知道，农民和牧场主经常经历气候变化，但他们要么不想使用这个词，要么绝对不想谈论它是**人为造成的**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: and you know farmers and ranchers often are experiencing climate change but they either don't want to use that word or they definitely don't want to talk about it as human caused.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Why?

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 因为它已经被**政治化**了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: Because it's been politicized.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 因为他们不想在社区里受到**反弹**，或者因为他们不相信，或者……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Because they didn't want blowback in their communities or because they didn't believe it or like

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 我认为两者兼有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: a combo I think.

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Okay.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 而且有些人不想和我们谈。我们有一个故事已经准备好了，我们真的很喜欢，我们真的很想讲，然后他们互相商量，他们说我们真的很害怕，你知道，谈论这件事，因为我们不希望**联邦政府**找上门来，因为我们在谈论气候，而且因为我们确实得到了一些联邦政府的资助，我们不希望危及它。所以，你知道，这很微妙。在实地，这常常很复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: And there were people who didn't want to talk to us. We had one story lined up that we really loved. we really wanted to tell it and then they talked amongst themselves and they said we're really scared of, you know, talking about it because we don't want the federal government to come after us because we're talking about climate and because we did get some funding from the federal government and we don't want to imperil it. So, you know, it it was nuanced. It was complicated often times on the ground.

</details>

### 希望与基层行动

**Rachel Abrams**: 我想知道，在花了这么多时间与那些在**超地方层面**思考解决方案的人们在一起之后，你对未来的看法是否有所改变？你如何看待国家或地球面临的更广泛、更大、更**整体**的问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I wonder if your outlook on the future has changed after spending so much time with people who have been thinking about fixes at this hyper local level like how are you looking at sort of the broader bigger holistic problems that the country or the planet faces?

</details>

**Cara Buckley**: 是的，对我来说，答案是双管齐下的。大局非常可怕，正如大局常常那样。我的意思是，我们面临的**危机**是真实的。它们在不断增加。它们对某些人的影响比对其他人更大。但然后在**地方层面**，当我们报道这些故事时，当我看到社区应对气候变化不同方面的所有不同方式时，我忍不住感到一丝**希望**。比如，全国各地有这么多人正在找到与地球**合作**而不是对抗的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cara Buckley**: Yeah, for me the answer is really two-pronged. The big picture is very scary as the big picture often is. I mean, the crises we're facing, they're real. They're mounting. They're hitting some people disproportionately compared to others. But then on the local level, as we reported out these stories, as I was seeing all the different ways communities were tackling different aspects of climate change, I couldn't help but feel a little bit hopeful. Like there are so many people all over the country that are finding ways to work with the planet rather than against it.

</details>

**Katherine Einhorn**: 这与与那些努力让社区变得更好的人共度时光非常有意义，我个人非常享受这一点。但在更广泛的层面上，它让我想起**简·古道尔**，你知道，那位著名的**灵长类动物学家**和**环保主义者**，她于 10 月去世，她在她生命的晚期，尤其强调的一点是，我们生活的每一天都在**创造差异**。我们的行动正在产生影响，而我们可以决定我们创造什么样的影响。而我们今年为这个系列采访的人们，正是这种精神的体现。这些人确实活在这种精神中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Einhorn**: it is really meaningful to spend time with people who are working so hard to make their communities better and I really enjoyed that personally. But like in a broader way, it makes me think of something that Jane Goodall, you know, the famous primatologist and environmentalist who died in October, something that she emphasized a lot, especially toward the end of her life, was that like every single day that we live, we are making a difference. Our actions are making a difference, and we get to decide what kind of difference we make. And the people that we interviewed this year for the series just embodied that. These people were really living in that spirit.

**Rachel Abrams**: 以下是您需要了解的其他信息。今天，**Zoron Mandani** 于周四午夜刚过宣誓就任**纽约市市长**。在他的就职演说中，他发誓要代表所有纽约人，即使是那些可能对他的政府持“**不信任或蔑视**”态度的人。如果你是纽约人，我就是你的市长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Here's what else you need to know. Today, Zoron Mandani was sworn in as mayor of New York City just after midnight on Thursday. In his inauguration speech, he vowed to represent all New Yorkers, even the ones who may view his administration with quote distrust or disdain. If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 无论我们是否同意，我都会保护你，与你一起庆祝，与你一起哀悼，并且永远，一秒钟也不会躲避你。演讲中穿插着对帮助 Mandani 登上市政厅的**工薪阶层纽约人**的提及。市长提到了开出租车、清洁公共公园以及提供他所说的“**印多米**和**牛肉饼**”的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Regardless of whether we agree, I will protect you, celebrate with you, mourn alongside you, and never, not for a second, hide from you. The speech was peppered with references to the working-class New Yorkers who helped drive Mandani to city hall. The mayor called out people who drive taxis, clean public parks, and serve, as he put it, biryani and beef patties.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 虽然 Mandani 花了几个月时间向市民和商界领袖保证他的**务实主义**，但他承诺将作为一名**民主社会主义者**执政，誓言要“**扩张性地**和**大胆地**”管理这座城市。对于那些坚持认为“**大政府时代**已经结束”的人，请听我说。市长办公室将不再犹豫利用其权力来改善纽约人的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: While Mamani has spent months reassuring civic and business leaders of his pragmatism, he pledged to govern as a democratic socialist, vowing to run the city, quote, expansively and audaciously. To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this. No longer will city hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers lives.

**Rachel Abrams**: 还有一位**环境记者**，也是**卡罗琳·肯尼迪**的女儿**Tatiana Schlober**，周二去世了。Tatiana 最近因她在《**纽约客**》上发表的一篇感人至深的**文章**而受到广泛关注，文章讲述了她在生下女儿后不久被诊断出患有**白血病**。这篇文章讲述了她与一种罕见疾病的斗争，以及她对美国人不断变化的**医疗保健格局**的担忧。但它也非常个人化。关于死亡，关于**育儿**和**记忆**。她说：“当你濒临死亡时，一切就开始了。至少以我有限的经验来看，你会开始回忆起一切。”我们中的一些人有幸在 Tatiana 担任《**纽约时报**》记者时与她共事。本周，同事们一直在分享他们自己的回忆，她工作多么努力，她的智慧和**从容**，以及她非常幽默。Tatiana Schlober 年仅 35 岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And Tatiana Schlober, an environmental journalist and a daughter of Caroline Kennedy, died on Tuesday. Tatiana received a wave of attention recently for a powerful essay she published in the New Yorker about how she was diagnosed with leukemia right after giving birth to her daughter. The essay was about her battle with a rare form of the illness and also about her alarm at the changing healthcare landscape for Americans. But it was also very personal. It was about dying and it was about parenting and memory. It begins when you are dying. At least in my limited experience, you start remembering everything. Some of us had the pleasure of working with Tatiana when she was a reporter at the New York Times. And this week, colleagues have been sharing their own memories, how hard she worked, her intelligence and poise, and also that she was very funny. Tatiana Schllober was 35.
