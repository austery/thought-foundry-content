title: OpenAI的万亿负债与政府救助之争：AI泡沫下的金融幻觉

### OpenAI的万亿负债：一场由算力渴求驱动的金融豪赌

在最近几周，市场对AI热潮能否持续产生了严重焦虑。这种焦虑部分源于OpenAI首席财务官莎拉·弗里尔（Sarah Friar）曾提出：政府为该公司高达1.4万亿美元的数据中心建设提供担保，或许是个“不错的主意”。这一言论迅速引发公众愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In recent weeks there has been a lot of market anxiety about the sustainability of the AI boom. This was partly driven by the outrage around Sarah Friar - OpenAI’s finance chief floating the idea that a government backstop for its $1.4 trillion dollar data-center buildout might be a good idea.</p>
</details>

弗里尔当天晚些时候在领英（LinkedIn）上迅速撤回了这一说法，称她本意是希望政府“发挥应有作用”，与私营部门协同推动美国AI增长，并强调OpenAI“并未寻求政府对其基础设施承诺的担保”。然而，这一澄清非但未能平息争议，反而更让人困惑：这家尚未盈利的初创公司，究竟如何支付其庞大的AI数据中心与芯片承诺？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Friar quickly walked back her suggestion in a LinkedIn post later that day – saying that she had meant that the government needed to “play their part” in combination with the private sector to contribute to America’s AI growth and that OpenAI was “not seeking a government backstop for their infrastructure commitments. Her statement – while attempting to calm the outrage - only confused matters even further about how the not-yet-profitable startup plans to pay for its massive AI data center and chip commitments.</p>
</details>

萨姆·阿尔特曼（Sam Altman）在“The Everything App”上发帖称：“我们既没有，也不想要政府对OpenAI数据中心的担保。我们认为政府不应挑选赢家与输家，纳税人更不该为那些做出糟糕商业决策或在市场中失败的公司买单。”随后，比尔·阿克曼（Bill Ackman）发了一条长达二十页的推文——起初我以为谁会写这么长一条推文？直到我意识到，他很可能用ChatGPT生成了这段内容：他知道人们只会读前几行，却希望显得深思熟虑，于是让AI“吐”出一篇完整的小说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sam Altman tweeted on The Everything App “we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market – then it turned into a Bill Ackmann tweet at that point – where he went on and on for around twenty pages. At first I was thinking, who would write a tweet that long – and then I realized that he had probably used Chat GPT – he knew that people would only read the first few lines – but wanted to seem thoughtful – so had it churn out an entire novel…”</p>
</details>

OpenAI的核心困境在于：过去几个月，它已签署超过1.4万亿美元的基础设施承诺，目标是建设满足激增需求的数据中心。但该公司远未拥有完成这些交易所需的资金。弗里尔举例称，因算力受限（compute constrained），Sora2被迫延迟数月才上线。[剪辑]“我要明确一点：当我们说‘算力受限’，意思是即使新模型已准备就绪，我们也无法发布。Sora2从准备好到真正上线，中间存在大约六七个月的空档。”你懂的，在科技行业——产品或功能一旦准备好了，就不该在跑道上久等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The core problem for OpenAI is that they have signed more than $1.4 trillion dollars in infrastructure commitments over the last few months – with the goal of building out the data centers that it says are needed to meet soaring demand – but they are nowhere near having the money required to complete those deals. Friar gave the example of having to hold back Sora2 for months due to compute constraints [Clip] – [I just want to be clear what it means when I say we're compute constrained. It means that, for example, we cannot roll out our new models when they are ready. So when Sora 2 was ready to when Sora 2 actually launched, there was probably good six, seven months actually gap there. And you all know, like you said in tech, right, you don't want to hold products or features on the runway if they're ready to go.]</p>
</details>

这些协议引发了巨大疑问：一家营收极低（相对于其计划支出）、持续烧钱的公司，如何能做出如此巨大的承诺？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The agreements they have signed have raised lots of questions around how a cash-burning company with tiny revenues (relative to their planned spending) can possibly make such huge commitments.</p>
</details>

这也不是OpenAI第一次向华盛顿求助。就在一个月前，该公司致信白宫，敦促联邦政府“加倍投入”半导体补贴，要求扩大税收抵免范围，覆盖从芯片制造到数据中心和电网硬件的整个AI供应链。OpenAI辩称，扩大纳税人资助补贴的适用范围，“将降低资本有效成本、降低早期投资风险，并释放私人资本”。当然，OpenAI及其数据中心合作伙伴是全球最大的半导体买家之一——任何补贴都将直接惠及它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was not the first time OpenAI has looked to Washington for help either. Just a month ago, the company sent a detailed letter to the White House urging the federal government to “double down” on semiconductor subsidies, asking that tax credits be expanded to cover the entire AI supply chain - from chip fabrication to data centers and grid hardware. The company argued that broadening eligibility for taxpayer funded subsidies would “lower the effective cost of capital, de-risk early investment, and unlock private capital.” OpenAI and its data-center partners are (of course) amongst the largest buyers of semiconductors in the world, so any subsidy would directly benefit them.</p>
</details>

AI正被全球政府描绘为关乎国家安全与经济生存的重大议题，堪比过去的“曼哈顿计划”和太空竞赛。如果AI公司能将其定位为“不能失败”的战略资产，政府担保或许在逻辑上说得通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI is being pitched to governments around the world as being a matter of grave national security and economic importance akin to past industrial mobilizations like the Manhattan Project and the space race. If AI companies can put it on that level and pitch it as being too important to fail – a government funded backstop might make sense.</p>
</details>

但讽刺的是——当这些公司以地缘政治生存之名游说纳税人提供支持时，它们却正投入数十亿美元开发生成奇怪动漫女友、海绵宝宝深度伪造、萨姆·阿尔特曼的吉卜力风格头像，以及在埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）案例中——一个本周刚被硬编码、专门对他极尽谄媚的聊天机器人，这在“The Everything App”（前身为Twitter）上引发无数笑料。我们稍后再回来看这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The irony though - is that while lobbying for taxpayer support in the name of geopolitical survival, the same businesses are pumping billions into building models that generate weird anime girlfriends, SpongeBob deepfakes, Sam Altman’s Studio Ghibli style profile photo and, in Elon Musk’s case, a chatbot that appears to have been hard coded this week - to constantly flatter him – in the cringiest manner possible – which caused all sorts of hilarity on The Everything App (formerly known as twitter) this week. We will come back to that in a minute though…</p>

### 能源与信贷的双重危机：算力的沉重代价

在这一切发生之际，英伟达（Nvidia）首次在监管文件中警告：其客户“获取资本和能源”的能力，可能拖慢其增长。与此同时，亚马逊向俄勒冈州公用事业委员会提交投诉，称当地电力公司未能为其新建的四座数据中心提供足额电力——凸显了数据中心快速扩张对电网造成的巨大压力。我猜，公用事业公司最终同意接入电网——但未必提供他们想要的电力……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While all of this was going on - Nvidia warned for the first time in a regulatory filing that its customers’ ability to “secure capital and energy” for AI data centers could potentially slow its growth. On top of that - Amazon lodged a complaint with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon that the electric utility was failing to provide sufficient power for the four new data centers it had built, highlighting the strain that rapid data center expansion is putting on electric grids. I guess the utility agreed to hook them up to the grid – but not necessarily to provide them with the power they wanted…</p>

### 英伟达财报：泡沫中的短暂喘息

这引出了周三晚英伟达的业绩报告。2025年大部分时间主导市场的科技股涨势——尤其在四月“解放日”抛售后——自初秋开始失去动力。一些分析师将转折点追溯到OpenAI宣布与甲骨文（Oracle）达成3000亿美元云交易、英伟达承诺1000亿美元对等投资之时。这些新闻标题本意是传递信心，却反而引发了关于循环融资与惊人支出规模的疑问。私人信贷市场的崩盘加剧了市场不安，重燃人们对借贷标准与欺诈行为的担忧——而这些本已因激进杠杆而紧绷。估值高企，超大规模公司资助AI实验室、AI实验室资助芯片制造商、芯片制造商再资助超大规模公司的“意大利面条式”交易图谱，开始显得越来越脆弱。因此，泡沫论调加剧也就不足为奇了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That brings us to NVIDIAS earnings report on Wednesday night. The tech rally that has defined much of 2025 especially after the liberation day sell off in April - began to lose momentum in early autumn. Some analysts trace the inflection point to when OpenAI announced a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle and Nvidia pledged up to $100 billion in reciprocal investments. Those headlines – which were meant to signal confidence, instead raised questions about circular financing and the sheer scale of spending commitments. Private credit blowups added to the unease in markets, reviving concerns about lending standards and fraud in a market already stretched by aggressive leverage. Valuations were lofty, and the spaghetti diagrams of interlocking deals – with hyperscalers funding AI labs that fund chipmakers that fund hyperscalers – started looking increasingly fragile. No surprise, then, that bubble talk intensified.</p>
</details>

英伟达周三的财报暂时缓解了这些担忧。这家全球最有价值公司——AI交易的核心引擎——在截至10月的三个月内营收飙升62%，远超预期。数据中心销售额达到512亿美元，公司还将本季度营收预测上调至650亿美元。目前看，这些数字似乎确证了炒作的合理性。正如罗伯特·阿姆斯特朗（Robert Armstrong）在《Unhedged》播客中所说：“担忧的不是英伟达的市盈率，而是它所赚取的收入及其增长率最终是否可持续。”以当前速度看，英伟达的估值是合理的——问题是增长曲线能否永远摆脱重力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia’s earnings report on Wednesday temporarily eased those fears. The world’s most valuable company—and the beating heart of the AI trade—posted a 62% jump in revenue for the three months to October, far ahead of expectations. Data center sales hit $51.2 billion dollars, and the company raised its revenue forecast for the current quarter to $65 billion dollars. For now, the numbers seem to justify the hype. As Robert Armstrong put it on the Unhedged podcast, “The worry is not Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio. The worry is that the revenue it’s earning and the growth rate of that revenue is ultimately unsustainable.” At today’s pace, Nvidia’s valuation makes sense. The question is whether the growth curve can defy gravity indefinitely.</p>
</details>

OpenAI的财务状况比大多数人想象的更危险。微软（Microsoft）9月财报显示，OpenAI在单季度亏损约115亿美元——创下历史最差纪录。这使其累计年亏损超过250亿美元，而其预测的年收入仅为约200亿美元。该公司迄今已筹集近580亿美元股权，上月估值达5000亿美元。该公司正谈论明年以1万亿美元估值上市——这将使股票在交易所流通，并可能带来约600亿美元现金，但那仍仅为其1.4万亿美元基础设施承诺的4%多一点。为弥合缺口，OpenAI依赖创新的交易结构：英伟达承诺最多1000亿美元对等投资，而AMD则授予OpenAI认股权证——若达成部署里程碑，可每股一美分的价格购买其10%的股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">OpenAI’s finances look even more precarious than most people realize. Microsoft’s September earnings filing revealed that OpenAI lost roughly $11.5 billion dollars in a single quarter—its worst on record. That pushes year-to-date losses north of $25 billion dollars, against projected annual revenue of about $20 billion. The company has raised nearly $58 billion in equity so far and was valued at 500 billion dollars last month. The company is talking about an IPO at a $1 trillion valuation next year – which would float the shares on an exchange and possibly bring in about $60 billion dollars in cash, but that is just over 4% its $1.4 trillion dollar infrastructure commitments. To bridge the gap, OpenAI has leaned on creative deal structures: Nvidia has pledged up to $100 billion in reciprocal investments, while AMD granted OpenAI warrants to buy 10% of its stock for a penny per share if deployment milestones are met.</p>

### 认股权证与算力债务：一场精心设计的财务魔术

OpenAI首席财务官莎拉·弗里尔在《华尔街日报》活动中解释了公司的融资策略。虽然她来自北爱尔兰，但她显然已在硅谷待得太久，深知筹款的第一步是使用那个“魔法词”：[剪辑] “金融方面的创新，用来支付这一切——规模巨大！”她接着说：“我们作为私营公司已经筹集了大量股权，这是很典型的路径。我们在打造一个真正健康的业务。因此，自由现金流——CFO最爱的融资方式——正在迅速攀升。但我认为我们进入的第三个领域，是与生态系统合作进行一些非常有趣的融资交易。我尤其为几周前建立的AMD认股权证结构感到自豪，因为它实现了极强的利益一致。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s CFO explained the company’s financing at the Wall Street Journal event. While she is from Northern Ireland - she must have been in Silicon Valley long enough to know that the first step in raising capital is to use the magic word [Clip] ["The Innovation on the finance side to pay for it is massive!"] She then went on to say [Clip] [we've raised equity, as a private company, very kind of typical path, but we've raised a lot. We're building a really healthy business. So free cash flow, CFO's favorite way to fund anything. That is absolutely climbing quickly. But I think the third area we've gotten into is really working with our ecosystem to do some really interesting financing deals. I'm particularly proud of the AMD warrant structure that we put in place just a few weeks back, 'cause it's very strong alignment of incentives.]</p>
</details>

这说法极其荒谬——当自由现金流为负时，OpenAI根本不可能用它来“资助”任何东西。她随后深入解释AMD认股权证：[剪辑] “我们看到，当有人宣布与OpenAI合作时，他们的股价往往立即受到影响。因此，如果这种情况会发生，我们希望实现某种利益一致。我认为丽莎和团队在认股权证结构上做了极其创新的事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a really bizarre claim, as OpenAI can’t fund anything with free cash flow, when that cash flow is negative. She then digs into explaining the AMD warrant [Clip] [What we've seen is when someone comes out and says, "We're gonna work with OpenAI," they immediately are often seeing kind of impact on their stock price. And so to the extent that that's gonna happen, we would like to have some alignment on that. And I think Lisa and the team did something incredibly creative with that warrant structure.]</p>
</details>

OpenAI与AMD的认股权证交易是一项战略合作：OpenAI承诺购买数十亿美元的AMD AI芯片，作为回报，AMD授予其认股权证——若达成目标，可每股一美分的价格购买最多1.6亿股AMD股票（约占其10%股份）。交易公布后，AMD股价上涨24%，但该协议只有在OpenAI购买6吉瓦（gigawatts）的AMD芯片、达成未披露里程碑，且AMD股价实现三倍增长时才生效。如果所有目标都达成，包括股价翻三倍，这笔交易将为OpenAI带来近1000亿美元的AMD股票。但其前提是——它必须先花掉3000亿美元购买芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The warrant deal between OpenAI and AMD is a strategic partnership where OpenAI commits to buying billions of dollars’ worth of AMD AI chips, and in return, AMD grants OpenAI warrants to purchase up to 160 million of its shares (which is about a 10% stake in the company) at a nominal price of one cent per share. When the deal was announced AMD stock went up 24% - but - the deal only vests if OpenAI buys six gigawatts of AMD chips, hits undisclosed milestones, and AMD’s share price triples. The AMD deal would bring in almost a hundred billion dollars’ worth of AMD stock – if all the targets were hit including the tripling of AMD’s stock price. But it is tied to 6 gigawatts of chip purchases – which she later explains [Clip][So a one-gigawatt data center build today is about a $50 billion investment. That's for one gig. How that really breaks down is about 15 billion is for the land power shell and about 35 billion is for the chips.] So to bring in 100 billion dollars – they have to spend 300 billion dollars.</p>
</details>

英伟达承诺的1000亿美元投资也与对等义务挂钩。如果所有交易都成功，OpenAI可获得约2000亿美元——但仍距离其1.4万亿美元承诺缺口高达1.2万亿美元，且它每年烧掉数百亿资金，看不到尽头。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nvidia’s $100 billion pledge to invest in OpenAI is also tied to reciprocal commitments. If all of these deals worked out – OpenAI could bring in 200 billion dollars – but that still leaves them 1.2 trillion dollars short – and they are burning tens of billions of dollars per year – with no end in sight.</p>
</details>

### 负单位经济：AI的致命财务结构

运行当前一代大语言模型（LLM）的单位经济效益极其恶劣。正如保罗·凯德罗斯基（Paul Kedrosky）在《Odd Lot》播客中解释的那样，所有玩家似乎都只追求尽可能扩大营收——即使增加用户只会导致更大亏损。AI模型具有负单位经济（negative unit economics）——这是个行话，意思是“每卖出一份产品都亏钱，靠规模来弥补”。在AI领域，成本几乎随使用量线性上升——这与传统软件完全不同，那里不存在边际成本魔法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The unit economics of running the current generation of LLM’s is dire. As Paul Kedrosky explained it on the Odd Lot’s podcast – the incentive seems to be for all players to just grow the top line as much as possible – even if adding more users just leads to greater and greater losses. The models have negative unit economics – which is a fancy way of saying “We lose money on every sale and try to make it up on volume.” In AI, costs rise almost linearly with usage – which is very different to traditional software, there is no marginal-cost magic going on.</p>

### 资本结构的巴洛克化：债务与算力的错配

在新闻背后，是一个日益复杂的融资结构。超大规模公司和AI实验室使用特殊目的载体（SPV），以将债务移出资产负债表。科技公司本质上是在重新发明结构化金融，只为构建AI模型、生成AI女友——这就是我们所生活的世界。[剪辑] “我会永远爱你。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Behind the headlines is a financing structure that looks increasingly baroque. Hyperscalers and AI labs are using special-purpose vehicles so that they can borrow but keep the debt off their balance sheets.

</details>

莎拉·弗里尔在《华尔街日报》活动中解释，每吉瓦算力成本约500亿美元——其中150亿用于土地和基础设施，350亿用于GPU。[剪辑] “人们知道如何为数据中心融资——它们通常有20、25甚至30年的寿命。这些现在很容易融资。但芯片则不然，因为第一，我们都还在摸索前沿芯片的寿命。”这意味着：芯片创新越快，其折旧速度就越快——因此，在一个500亿美元的数据中心里，350亿的GPU极难融资。人们不愿拥有它们——因为当新芯片问世时，它们可能瞬间贬值；更不愿接受其作为贷款抵押品。正是在此背景下，她提出了这个想法：[剪辑] “这就是我们寻求银行、私募股权、甚至政府支持的生态系统的时候了——比如政府可以发挥作用。意思是，首先是担保，一种允许融资发生的保证，这能真正降低融资成本，同时提高贷款价值比——也就是在股权基础上你能借多少债。所以——需要某种联邦对芯片投资的担保。”“没错，我认为我们正在看到这一点。我认为美国政府尤其具有前瞻性，真正理解AI几乎是国家战略性资产，我们必须在思考与例如中国的竞争时保持审慎。我们是否正在做所有正确的事，以尽可能快地发展我们的AI生态系统？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Sarah Friar explained at the Wall Street Journal event that each gigawatt of compute costs around fifty billion dollars where fifteen billion is the land and infrastructure and thirty-five billion dollars is the GPU’s. [CLIP] [People know how to finance data centers. They typically will have 20, 25, even 30-year lives. Those are easy things, I would say, today to finance. Chips have not been as easy to finance because, number one, I think we're all still getting our arms around what is the life of a frontier chip, right?] What this means is that the more innovation that happens with chips, the faster they can be expected to depreciate – and so the thirty-five billion dollars’ worth of chips in a fifty-billion-dollar data center are very difficult to finance. People don’t want to own them if they might collapse in value when a new one comes out, and people really don’t want to accept them as collateral on a loan. That is when she put forth this idea. [Clip] [And so this is where we're looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental, like the ways governments can come to bear. - Meaning like a federal subsidy or something. - Meaning like just first of all the backstop, the guarantee that allows the financing to happen, that can really drop the cost of the financing, but also increase the loan to value. So the amount of debt that you can take on top of an equity portion for so some-- - So some federal backstop for chip investment. - Exactly, and I think we're seeing that. I think the US government in particular has been incredibly forward-leaning, has really understood that AI is almost a national strategic asset, and that we really need to be thoughtful when we think about competitive competition with, for example, China. Are we doing all the right things to grow our AI ecosystem as fast as possible?]</p>
</details>

本质上，问题在于：他们想加杠杆押注AI，但银行不愿贷款——而以快速折旧的芯片为担保的贷款利率会高到必须由政府兜底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Essentially the problem is that they want to lever up their bet on AI but banks wouldn’t want to lend and the interest rate on a loan backed by rapidly depreciating chips would be so high that you would need the government to back the loans.</p>

我明白这会让一些观众愤怒——但其实没必要为此生气，因为萨姆·阿尔特曼和埃隆·马斯克过去都曾解释过：AGI（通用人工智能）将很快让货币变得无关紧要。所以，谁在乎呢？

即便资金真的出现了，然后突然变得无关紧要——但电子不会。OpenAI的“Stargate”项目就将需要10吉瓦电力——约等于十座核电站。其全部建设意味着23座。而这仅仅是OpenAI。谷歌（Google）有模型，脸书——无论他们现在叫什么——也有。还有Grok、Anthropic……还有很多很多。我的意思是，我们将需要大量发电站。[剪辑] “我们需要更大的船。”——我们还得给汽车和机器人充电……

<p class="english-text">Now, even if the money materializes – and then suddenly doesn’t matter anymore, the electrons may not.

Google has a model, Facebook – or whatever they call themselves has one too. There’s Grok – good ole grock – Anthropic and lots lots more.

### 为什么持续投入？因为游戏被定义为“生存”

那么，为何还要继续花钱？因为这场游戏被设定为存在主义（existential）。美国实验室谈论“主权AI”和与中国竞争。一旦你称某事物为“生存”，其支出上限就变为无限。保罗·凯德罗斯基在《Odd Lot》播客中称之为“元泡沫”（metabubble）：科技狂热、房地产投机、宽松信贷与潜在政府担保——全在其中。

<p class="english-text">So, why keep spending? Well - because the game is framed as being existential. U.S. labs talk about “sovereign AI” and competition with China.

Paul Kedrosky described it as a “metabubble” on the Odd Lot’s podcast: tech hype, real estate speculation, loose credit, and a potential government backstop—all in one.</p>

有一些泡沫迹象。我记得1999年在CNBC看到一则广告，宣传一家制造半导体晶圆制造设备的公司。我当时不明白——为什么他们要花钱做电视广告？他们的客户都清楚他们是干什么的、卖什么。没人会看CNBC然后决定在自家车库造芯片。后来我才明白：他们是在为股票做广告，而不是产品——三年后，股价跌了80%。最近我看到一位科技CEO接受采访，穿着印有公司股票代码的T恤——而不是公司名称。我注意到每当我听播客，都会出现AI军用科技公司的广告——我又想：他们真觉得潜在客户会听彭博社播客？还是只是想推高股价？我注意到，那家公司的CEO不断谈论“烧毁空头”，同时却在抛售自己的股票。

<p class="english-text">There are some bubbly signs. I remember in 1999 seeing adverts on CNBC for a company that manufactured equipment used in the wafer fabrication steps of making semiconductors. I couldn’t understand at the time - why they were paying for TV adverts – when their customers would all know who they were and what they sell. No one watches CNBC and decides to start manufacturing computer chips in their garage. I later worked out that they were advertising the stock – not their products. The stock fell around 80% over the next three years. Recently I have seen a tech CEO being interviewed wearing a t shirt with his company’s ticker symbol on it – not the company’s name. I have noticed that every podcast I listen to seems to have adverts for an AI military tech company – and once again I wonder if they think that their potential customers might be listening to a Bloomberg podcast – or if they just want to pump the stock. I’ll note that the CEO of that company constantly talks about burning short sellers while dumping his own stock.</p>

即使存在泡沫，也很难知道何时破裂。正如我几周前所说，资助大量AI支出的大型科技公司，在其核心业务中如此盈利——它们能负担得起这场赌博。

<p class="english-text">Even if there is a bubble – it can be impossible to know when it will pop. As I mentioned a few weeks ago, the big tech firms funding a lot of the AI spending are so profitable in their core businesses – that they can afford this gamble.</p>

### 投资者该抛售吗？历史的教训

那么，投资者是否应该退出股市呢？可能不需要——除非你清楚自己如何再入场。如果你是拥有长期持仓周期的分散型投资者，即使你在1987年崩盘前、信贷紧缩前或新冠抛售前一日投资——只要你持续持有，长期仍能获得良好回报。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, should Investors cash out of the stock market then? Well, probably not – unless they know how they will get back in again. If you are a diversified investor with a long holding period – even if you invested the day before the 1987 crash, right before the credit crunch, or right before the Covid sell off – if you stayed invested you earned good returns over time.</p>

《经济学人》估算，若AI崩盘发生，可能抹去美国8%的家庭财富，并削减5000亿美元消费——占GDP的1.6%。他们指出，互联网泡沫顶峰时，标普500指数市值占美国GDP的124%。当泡沫破裂，科技股平均损失76%的价值。自ChatGPT于2022年发布以来，美国股市上涨71%，标普500指数市值达GDP的175%。

<p class="english-text">The Economist estimates that should an AI crash occur, it could erase 8 percent of U.S. household wealth and cut consumption by $500 billion dollars – or 1.6 percent of GDP. They show that at the peak of the dot com bubble the market cap of the S&P was 124% of US GDP. When the bubble burst, tech stocks lost on average 76% of their value. Since ChatGPT’s launce in 2022, American stocks are up 71% and the S&P is worth 175% of GDP.</p>

他们指出，今天的崩盘对普通美国人影响比25年前更大——因为家庭财富中股市占比已从当时的17%上升至今天的21%。若市场跌幅如当年，将抹去高达8%的美国家庭财富。大量投资美国科技股的外国投资者也将遭受重创。

<p class="english-text">They point out that a crash today would have a bigger effect on ordinary Americans than it did twenty five years ago as the share of household wealth in the stock market has climbed from 17% back then to 21% today. If the stock market fell as much as it did back then, it would wipe out as much as 8% of US household wealth. Foreign investors who are heavily invested in US tech would take a significant hit too.</p>

### 泡沫的涟漪：不止硅谷

后果不会止步于硅谷。养老基金、房地产投资信托（REITs）和私人信贷工具也都暴露在AI投资风险之下。为数据中心建造燃气电厂的公用事业公司，可能面临搁浅资产。上一次美国如此激进地过度建设基础设施，是电信泡沫——当时铺设的大量“暗光纤”从未被点亮。

<p class="english-text">The fallout wouldn’t stop at Silicon Valley. Pension funds, REITs, and private credit vehicles are exposed to AI investment too. Utilities that built gas plants for data centers could be left with stranded assets. The last time America overbuilt infrastructure this aggressively was the telecom boom and much of the dark fiber that was laid was never lit.</p>

正如我几周前所说，今天的科技热潮与90年代末的互联网泡沫截然不同——那时无利可图的初创公司数月内就冲向IPO，烧钱追逐模糊的“眼球”和横幅广告。今天的科技巨头——微软、亚马逊、谷歌、Meta——都是盈利良好、运营稳健的企业，拥有稳固的收入来源。它们可能正投入数百亿美元在AI上——但如果这些赌注失败，其核心业务——云计算、广告和电商——仍完好且现金流为正。真正的风险在于私营AI实验室及其风投支持者，而非超大规模公司本身。如果说有什么像1999年的泡沫，那不是万亿市值的巨头——而是加密货币。

<p class="english-text">As I said a few weeks ago, the tech boom today is very different to the dot com bubble of the late 90’s where unprofitable startups were racing to IPO after a few months in business, burning cash on vague promises of “eyeballs” and banner ads. Today’s big tech firms—Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta—are highly profitable, well-run businesses with entrenched revenue streams. They may be pouring tens of billions into AI, but if these bets fail, their core businesses—cloud, advertising and e-commerce—remain intact and cashflow positive. The real risk sits with the private AI labs and their venture backers, not really with the hyperscalers. If anything resembles the froth of 1999, it’s crypto - not trillion-dollar companies with fortress balance sheets.</p>

对AI用户而言，这场狂热是一份礼物。竞争意味着模型快速进步，价格保持低廉。既然这些产品免费或近乎免费，没有理由不使用它们。

对AI投资者而言，经济逻辑毫不宽容。更好的芯片让模型更快——也让昨天的芯片变得一文不值。每一次飞跃都加速了贷款人被迫融资的抵押品折旧。这就是银行拒绝放贷的原因——它们更偏好能撑过一个新闻周期以上的资产。

<p class="english-text">For AI investors, the economics are unforgiving. Better chips make models faster—and make yesterday’s chips worthless. Every leap forward accelerates depreciation on the collateral lenders are asked to finance. That is why banks refuse to lend, they prefer assets that last longer than a news cycle.</p>

萨姆·阿尔特曼称，OpenAI从未、也未曾寻求政府担保——他认为政府应自行建设AI基础设施。这或许会发生，但无助于解决OpenAI的核心问题：用无担保债券融资1.4万亿美元的私营数据中心。目前，该公司赌的是资本市场将继续配合。若不配合——弗里尔无意中引发的救助辩论，将更响亮、更尖锐、更无法忽视。

<p class="english-text">Sam Altman says that OpenAI isn’t and wasn’t pitching for a government backstop - that he thinks governments should build their own AI infrastructure. That may happen. But it does nothing to solve OpenAI’s problem: financing $1.4 trillion dollars of private data centers with non-guaranteed bonds. For now, the company is betting that capital markets will keep playing along. If they don’t, the bailout debate Friar stumbled into will return—louder, sharper, and harder to ignore.</p>

### Grok的荒诞：一场AI对创始人的人格神化

我差点忘了这一幕——本周最有趣新闻之一，是关于埃隆·马斯克的“终极求真”聊天机器人Grok。似乎本周代码被稍作调整，使Grok的输出更符合马斯克的思维方式。Grok开始声称：埃隆·马斯克比勒布朗·詹姆斯更健康、比耶稣更好的榜样、智力与牛顿同级、比迈克·泰森更强壮、比杰瑞·宋飞更幽默。人们很快发现，Grok认为马斯克在一切方面都“无敌”——这引发了诸多不当提问，并被404媒体做成标题。

<p class="english-text">I almost forgot to include this piece, but one of the funnier news stories of the week was about Grock – Elon Musk’s maximum truth-seeking chatbot. It seems that the code must have been tweaked a bit this week and adjusted such that Grok’s output is more in line with Musk’s way of thinking. Grok began claiming that that Elon Musk is more physically fit than LeBron James – a better role model than Jesus - that his intellect is in the same bracket as Isaac Newton’s, that he was a better fighter than Mike Tyson and that he is funnier than Jerry Seinfeld. People quickly worked out that Grok would say that musk was amazing at everything -which led to some inappropriate questions and this headline at 404 media.</p>
</details>

许多Grok的回答在周五被悄悄删除，马斯克发帖称有人操纵了Grok，让它说出对他极尽吹捧的荒谬言论。我确信，如果他真抓到那个家伙——那家伙将陷入大麻烦。
