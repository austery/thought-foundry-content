### 纸箱：一个不寻常的宏观经济指标

**Tracy:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello, and welcome to another episode of the All Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我是Joe Weisenthal。Tracy，我要提出一个东西，你来告诉我那是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, I am going to put something on the table and you tell me what it is.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的，你来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Go on. All right, here I go. Okay. Oh.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这是一个我相信是**瓦楞纸箱**（Corrugated Cardboard Box: 由多层纸板制成，中间有波浪形瓦楞芯纸以增加强度），上面贴着写有“易碎品”的胶带。我猜它大约有18英寸乘36英寸，我不擅长测量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a, This is a this is a corrugated, I believe, cardboard box, that has a tape that says fragile. And I would guess it's about, I don't know, I'm not good at measurement. Maybe 18in by 36in, something like that.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 那是对一个纸箱非常好的物理描述。然而，我要说你错了。它实际上是一个**宏观经济指标**（Macroeconomic Indicator: 反映整体经济状况的统计数据）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is a very good physical description of a cardboard box. However, I'm going to say you're wrong. It is, in fact, a macro economic indicator.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 另一个可接受的答案是它是Atlas标志的一部分。没错，没错。它是一个箱子，这是Adelaide的核心。但你知道，现在我们要谈论的是，当你想到箱子时，你通常不会首先想到魔术钱箱谜题。当你想到箱子时，你通常也不一定会想到集装箱船，它常被称为“箱子”，就像《The Box》这本书里写的那样。但我认为当人们想到箱子时，他们想到的是瓦楞纸箱，无论是否瓦楞。顺便说一句，现在是思考箱子的好时机，因为已经有一些关于这方面的评论了，我们基本上经历了一场“箱子末日”（Boxpocalypse）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other acceptable answer is it's part of the Atlas logo. That's right, that's right. It's a it's a box. And that is core to Adelaide's. But you know now we're going to talk about literally when you think box you don't often first think magic money box puzzles. And when you think box you often don't necessarily think of a container ship, which is often called a box is in the book, the box. But I think when people think about a box, they think about a cardboard box, corrugated or not. Now is a very good time to be thinking about boxes, by the way, because there's been some commentary about this, but we've basically had a sort of box Pocalypse.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的，在美国，我们还在经历吗？目前尚无定论，我们会在讨论中深入探讨。但美国的纸箱出货量（即箱子的箱子，我觉得这很有趣）已降至2015年以来第二季度最低水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, in the States, are we still having one? Jury's kind of out, and we'll get into that in the discussion. But US box shipments, so boxes of boxes, which I find funny sort of box and, anyway, US box shipments have fallen to the lowest second quarter reading since 2015.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这是根据纤维箱的数据。所以这些很可能是折叠起来的。是的，是的。所以你有很多这样的箱子，它们可能用塑料或其他东西包裹着。这些出货量降到了2015年以来的最低水平。是的。我认为我们还可以讨论其他一些数据，比如金融危机以来最糟糕的数字等等。显然，人们担心的是，箱子通常装着人们购买的产品。对吧。所以如果没人购买箱子，那对零售支出、消费者健康和更广泛的经济走向意味着什么？这就是你进入宏观指标领域的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's according to the fiber box. So so these are quite like, probably like they're like folded up. Yeah. Yeah. So you have a bunch of them, they're maybe wrapped in plastic or something like that. So shipments of those lowest it's like 2015. Yeah. And I think there are some other numbers we can get into that are like the worst since the financial crisis and things like that. And obviously the concern is boxes tend to contain products that people are buying. Right. So if no one's buying boxes, what does that say about retail spending, the health of the consumer and the direction of the broader economy? That's when you get into the macro indicators stuff.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我喜欢电子商务，但我讨厌拆箱子。我知道我太讨厌了。然后，你知道，把它撕开，它从来都不快。我希望在易于折叠方面能有一些创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I you know, I love e-commerce, but I hate breaking down box. I know I hate it so much. And then, you know, like rip it up and there's no it's never quick. I would like to see some innovation on the ease of collapse ability.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 你知道我做了什么吗？因为我买了很多东西，我训练我的狗撕开亚马逊的箱子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what I did? Because I buy a lot. I train my dog to rip apart Amazon boxes.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，那太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh that's amazing.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 但后来它罢工了，不干了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then you kind of went on strike and stopped doing it.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，那本来会很酷的。让你的孩子来做吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that would have been cool. Get your kids to do it.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，让他们工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, put them to work.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的。我很高兴地说，我们确实请来了完美的嘉宾。我们将与Ryan Fox对话，他是Bloomberg Intelligence的集装箱和包装分析师。Ryan，非常感谢你来到我们的节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, I am happy to say we do, in fact, have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Ryan Fox. He is a containers and packaging analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. So Ryan, thanks so much for coming on our thoughts.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 很高兴能亲自见到你，因为我们已经通过视频会议讨论箱子很久了。我不知道这怎么会变得如此有趣，但很可能是因为我们一直在看到的下降趋势。请给我们讲讲这些数字。箱子出货量实际下降了多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's so nice to actually meet you in person because we've been I being for a while talking about boxes. I don't know how this became so interesting to me, but, probably because of the decline that we've been seeing. Walk us through the numbers. Like how bad is the actual fall in boxes of boxes? Shipments of boxes? Yes.</p>
</details>

### 纸箱出货量：经济健康的晴雨表

**Ryan Fox:** 是的，当我们谈论纸箱出货量时，它们就像你说的，以**折叠平装**（Knocked Down Flat / KDF / CDF: 指纸箱在运输前被压平折叠，以节省空间）的形式运输。CDF代表“折叠平装”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we think about box shipments, they are shipped, like you said, knocked down flat or CDF for sure. CDF stands for oh knocked off right now. Anything. I already learned something.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 哦，我学到了一些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anything. I already learned something.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 它们有时用托盘运输，有时只是堆叠起来。但在美国，它们会运往食品制造商、饮料制造商、工业产品制造商等终端市场。我们美国消费的纸箱中，约有50%会通过杂货店销售。所以这是思考它的一个很好的方式。我们看到上半年纸箱出货量下降了约2.3%。这主要是由于关税带来的不确定性。在疫情期间，我们看到了一个巨大的增长，纸箱出货量在疫情第一年增长了约2.4%，第二年增长了3.5%。当我们用具体术语来思考时，我们用“十亿平方英尺”来衡量纸箱出货量。当我们谈论十亿平方英尺时，比如4000亿平方英尺，可以绕地球约30次。这是一个非常大的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so they're shipped sometimes on pallets. Sometimes they just stack them in. But they're going to in the US, end markets like food manufacturers, beverage manufacturers, people who make industrial products. But about 50% of the boxes that we consume in the US are going to go through a grocery store. So that's a really good way to think about it, What we've seen box shipments have fallen in the first half, about 2.3%. And this is largely due to uncertainties. They're stemming from tariffs. We saw a big ramp up during the during the pandemic where box shipments grew. The first year, the pandemic by about 3.5%, actually 2.4%, then 3.5% the following year. When we think about it in in concrete terms, we talk about box shipments in terms of billions of square feet. And when we talk about billions of square feet, like 400,000,000,000ft² would wrap around the Earth like 30 times or something like that. It's a very big.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 那么，具体测量的是什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what's great? What exactly is being measured here? Right.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 好的。如果你把这个箱子拆开。顺便说一句，这是一个**常规开槽纸箱**（Regular Slotted Carton / RSC: 最常见的纸箱类型，所有箱盖都是相同长度，外箱盖在中心接缝处相遇）。这是一个**双层瓦楞纸箱**（Double Wall Box: 由两层瓦楞芯纸和三层面纸组成的纸箱，提供额外强度）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you were to take this box here and we were to tear it all apart, okay. So by the way, this is a regular slotted carton okay. This is a double wall box.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 那是什么意思？它不是瓦楞的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does it mean. It's not corrugated?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 不，这是瓦楞的。所以让我们快速插一句。纸板实际上不是这个。对于所有纸箱爱好者来说，这是一个**瓦楞纸板**（Corrugated Fiberboard: 由一张或多张瓦楞芯纸夹在两张面纸之间制成的材料）箱。这个特定的箱子是双层的，有五层。平坦的纸张叫做**面纸**（Liner: 瓦楞纸板的平坦外层），中间波浪形的部分叫做**瓦楞芯纸**（Medium: 瓦楞纸板中间的波浪形层）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. This is corrugated. So let's let's take a little quick parenthetical thought here. So cardboard is actually not this. This is a corrugated fiberboard box for all you box nerds out there okay. This particular one is a double office. There's five layers. The flat sheet is called liner. The wavy part in the middle is called medium.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你现在是不是感觉像在天堂？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you like in heaven right now?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 我现在感觉就像在天堂。你根本不知道我在说什么。不，你不用等。所以如果我们把这个东西展开，分开胶缝，把它平铺开，你做一些基本的数学计算，或者你用卷尺量一下长度。对。那样就可以用平方英尺来测量它。这个箱子，它已经被裁小了，所以看起来没有实际那么大。但它可能大约有20平方英尺。如果我们愿意，我们可以测量它，但我们不会。但如果你对每一个箱子都这样做，这就是他们测量它的方式。真正重要的是，这些箱子是在各种不同的机器上制造的。它被称为瓦楞纸箱的原因之一是它是在瓦楞机上制造的。那是一种机器，它将不同种类的纸张层压在一起。它们通常用玉米淀粉或其他淀粉产品粘合在一起。其中一个机制叫做瓦楞辊。它是一个带有这些小褶皱的辊子。它们对纸张进行蒸汽处理，形成那些小拱形。这就是赋予纸板强度的原因。这些小东西有不同的尺寸，它们被称为**瓦楞**（Flute: 瓦楞纸板中波浪形芯纸的波峰和波谷），但你不能吹奏它们，它们不会发出任何音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am so much in heaven right now. You don't even know I talk about. No, you don't have to wait. So if we were if we were to unfold this thing, separate the glue seam and lay it out flat, and you just do basic math, or you take your tape measure and you go with the length. Right. So that would measure it in terms of square footage. And this box right here, it's been cut down so it doesn't look as big as it really is. But it's probably somewhere around two 20ft². We could measure it if we wanted to, but we won't. But if you were to do that for every single box, that's how they will measure it. The, what's really kind of important is these boxes are made on a variety of different machines. And one of the reasons why it's called a corrugated box is it's made on a corrugated. And that's a machine that takes different kinds of paper and it laminates together. They stick together with typically corn starch or some other starch product. And so one of the mechanisms is called the corrugated roll. And it's a roll with these little wrinkles in it. They steam the paper and it forms those little arches. And that's what gives the board its strength. There are different sizes of these little things like that in they're called flutes, but you can't play them. They don't make any music.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 为什么它如此有趣？是的。超级有趣。我们继续谈论这个箱子。为什么瓦楞工艺能使其更坚固？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why does it so interesting? Yeah. Super interesting. Let's just keep talking about this box. Why? What is it about the corrugation process that makes it stronger?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 从物理角度来看，它赋予了箱子形状和物质。这背后有很多科学。事实上，我们现在有办法通过数学方法预测箱子在实际情况中的表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So from a physics standpoint, it's what gives the box its shape and substance. And there is a lot of science that goes behind this. In fact, we now have ways to predict how the box will perform in real world situations. Just mathematically.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我们会进行箱子测试，把箱子弄坏吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do we do box testing where we do beat up a box?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 绝对会。是的。对于很多公司来说，他们必须通过**国际安全运输协会**（International Safe Transit Authority / ISTA: 制定和实施包装运输测试标准的国际组织）的测试。他们实际上会测试箱子，以确保它能承受UPS或FedEx的运输，在某些情况下，他们甚至会确保无论发生什么，箱子都能完好无损。这些测试可能花费数千美元。所以这是一个非常严格的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Yeah. And so for a lot of companies, they have to go through the Ista International Safe Transit Authority. They actually test the box to make sure it will hold up against UPS or Fedex or in some instances, they go so far as to make sure that no matter what happens, it's going to survive. And those tests can cost thousands of dollars. So it's a very robust process.</p>
</details>

### 纸箱行业的历史与主要参与者

**Tracy:** 在我们深入探讨现在发生的事情之前，最好的箱子是什么样的？每个人都有自己喜欢的箱子。我的意思是，我知道作为成年人，当你拿到那个箱子，然后你说“这是一个非常好的箱子”时，你才真正进入了成年阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the best box for before we go into what what's happening right now? Everyone has their favorite box. I mean, I know as adults we you've really gotten into adulthood when you get that box and you're like, that's a really good box.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 任何容易折叠的，任何容易……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anything that's easy to collapse, anything that's easy</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 容易折叠是一种方式，不，任何容易打开的。我喜欢拉链。拉链。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">collapse is is one way, no, anything that's easy to open. I like the zipper. The zippers. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 是的，很多人喜欢拉链式开口。有些箱子设计非常精巧，设置起来几乎不需要任何操作。它们可以自行折叠和锁定。哦，是的。我们称之为**模切纸箱**（Die Cut Boxes: 通过模具切割成特定形状的纸箱，通常用于定制包装）。它们是用切割模具制作的，看起来像一个大饼干切割器。它们可以制作你想要的任何形状。最流行的款式是我们称之为**卷边纸箱**（Roll End Box: 一种模切纸箱，其盖子可以卷入箱体内部或外部以锁定）。它们可以向内或向外折叠。但这确实是一个很好的箱子。如果你在网上购买东西，你可能会看到这种箱子。它们真的在追求那种“惊喜因素”，因为它们会让你打开箱子并展示产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of people like the zipper pulls. There are some boxes that are very elaborate, and they don't require much at all to set them up. They kind of fold and lock in on themselves. Oh, yeah. We call those die cut boxes. They are made from a cutting die. That looks like a big cookie cutter. And they will make any shape that you want to make, The most popular style is what we call a roll. A roll end box. And they can tuck on the inside. They can tuck on the outside. But this is really a nice box. It's it's a box that you might see if you were to buy something online. And they're really trying to go for that wow factor because they're going to get for that to open the box and show off the product.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 让我们更多地谈谈桌上的这个箱子。你在这个领域学得足够多，可以分辨出它来自哪个工厂或哪一年，或者你有什么内部消息吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk more about this box on the table here. Like, are you learned enough in the space? You could say like, oh, I think this came from x mil or X year or like, you have any other inside tip here.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 好的。这个箱子没有，我能看到的。但在大多数美国制造的箱子上，底部都有一个小的圆形印章，叫做**纸箱制造商证书**（Box Maker's Certificate: 印在纸箱底部，标明制造商、地点和纸箱规格的圆形印章）。美国大约有1100家工厂生产瓦楞纸箱，底部的小印章会告诉你哪家公司制造了箱子以及它的位置。更具体地说，它会告诉你箱子的材料是什么。在我的工具包里。嗯，这有点像一个愚蠢的细节，但它实际上可以追溯到60多年前，甚至100多年前，当时箱子刚开始出现。大多数人不知道瓦楞纸箱只有130到140年的历史。直到19世纪90年代末才开始实施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, this box doesn't have it, okay. That I can see. But on most boxes that are made in the USA, there is a small little stamp on the bottom of the box. It's round and it's called a box maker's certificate. Okay. There are around 1100 facilities in the U.S that make corrugated boxes, and that little stamp on the bottom will tell you what company made the box and where it's located. And more specifically, it will tell you what the stuff is made of. And in my kit. Well, that's kind of a stupid detail, but it goes back over 60 years, actually goes back over 100 years to when boxes were first starting to come around. Most people don't know that corrugated boxes are only 130 140 years old. Only implemented in the late 1890s</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我试图想象在这之前是什么样的。Joe，你觉得第一个瓦楞纸箱是什么时候出现的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm trying to think of before this was a Joe. What do you think? The first corrugated. As if I would even begin to have a guess. Anyway. Keep going.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 就像我会有任何猜测一样。无论如何。继续。所以在世纪之交之后，1900年代初期，公司正在寻找运输产品的方法。当时他们唯一的机制，我们还没有18轮卡车。我们有火车。所以铁路公司在修建新铁路时，他们砍伐森林。他们有很多木材可以利用。那么他们做了什么呢？他们制造了板条箱。但板条箱非常昂贵且笨重。所以人们正在寻找替代品，他们想出了瓦楞纸箱。这实际上可以追溯到，一个有趣纽约的故事。Dumbo地区是车库大楼的所在地，车库是纸质包装的早期先驱之一。他偶然发现你可以给纸张划线并制作出这些漂亮的小箱子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So right after the the the turn of the century, in the early 1900s, companies were looking for ways to ship their product. The only mechanism they had in that time, we didn't really have 18 wheelers. We had trains. And so the rail companies, as they were making new rails, they're cutting down forests. They had lots of wood to do something with. So what did they do? They made crates, But crates were very expensive and they were very heavy. And so people were looking for alternatives and they came up with a corrugated box. It actually goes back, funny New York story. The Dumbo area is home to, the garage building and garage was one of the early pioneers of paper packaging. And he kind of discovered by accident that you could score paper and and create these nice little boxes.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我再也不会用同样的方式看待Dumbo了。好的。实际上，这让我想起。那么，纸业的实际大玩家是谁？因为我想我一下子说不出一个名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will never look at Dumbo the same way again. Okay. Actually, that reminds me. So who are the actual big players in the paper industry? Because I don't think I could name a single one off the top of my head,</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 我可以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，国际纸业（International Paper）和以前的Smurfit Stone。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, international paper and what used to be Smurfit Stone.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 哦，是的。Smurfit。好的。是的，那很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. Smurfit. Okay. Yeah. That's good.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 所以你完全正确。国际纸业最近变得更大了。他们收购了Dr. Smith，它曾经叫做Crown。Crown也曾是。嗯，他们仍然是。我实际上在大约20年前短暂担任股票分析师的时候，我记得我做了一些关于这个领域的研究，纸箱分析师，一个同行的纸箱分析师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're exactly right. International paper recently got even bigger. They acquired Dr. Smith out of it was one named Crown. Brown was also. Well, they're still you know, this. I actually in the brief time when I was an equity analyst over about 20 years ago, I think I did a little research into this space box analyst, a fellow box, and.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 好的，非常简短的恶魔。无论如何，继续。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, very brief devil. And anyway, keep going. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 所以，国际纸业最近收购了Dr. Smith。他们变得更大了。他们与总部位于爱尔兰都柏林的Smurfit Kappa保持同步，后者收购了美国的WestRock。他们成为了第一家全球性的巨型公司。国际纸业也紧随其后。所以他们是美国最大的两家，也是世界上最大的。美国包装公司（Packaging Corporation of America）是美国第三大公司，其次是Georgia-Pacific、Pratt Industries以及各种小型独立公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, International Paper recently bought Dr. Smith. They got even bigger. They were keeping pace with Smurfit Kappa based out of Dublin, Ireland, who bought WestRock, who's here in the US. They became kind of the first global mega company. IP followed suit. So they're the two biggest in the US and the biggest in the world. Packaging Corporation of America is number three in the US, followed by Georgia-Pacific, Pratt Industries and a variety of smaller independents.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 箱子来自树木，对吧。或者说木材来自树木。我们在节目中谈论了很多木材。我们了解到的一件事是，木材行业一直在整合，尤其是在大金融危机之后，工厂产能大幅削减。这与住房直接相关，住房是重灾区。那么，过去20年美国工厂产能的故事是什么？从大金融危机之前到2010年代再到现在，我们真的没有看到很多新的工厂产能出现，就像20年前一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Boxes come from trees, right. Or come lumber comes from trees. You know, we've talked about lumber a lot on the show. And one of the things that we learned, you know, there's been consolidation in the lumber space, but also particularly after the great financial crisis, there was a lot of reduction in mill capacity. Now that's related to housing specifically, which was ground zero. But what is the story of American mill capacity over the last 20 years, from prior to the great financial crisis to the 20 tens to now, we really didn't see a whole lot of new mill capacity come along like 20 years ago.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 但我们确实看到了。那里有一些投资。有一些新的工厂出现了。我实际上在加入彭博社之前，在瓦楞包装行业工作了十年，并为一家拥有自己造纸厂的综合性公司工作。我工作的那些工厂是100%回收的。所以他们的一些投资，就会体现在过去20年里。他们实际上在过去20年里建造了许多最新的工厂。但我们真正看到增长爆发是在疫情前后。所以在2023年，新增了250万吨100%回收的**箱板纸**（Containerboard: 用于制造瓦楞纸箱的纸板，包括面纸和瓦楞芯纸）生产能力上线。现在箱板纸是一个技术术语。它是指这些箱子里使用的纸张的统称。所以箱板纸意味着面纸和瓦楞芯纸。所以这是一个大词。

<p class="english-text">But we did see it. There was some investment there. There were some new mills that would come along. I actually spent ten years working in the corrugated packaging industry before coming to Bloomberg and worked for one of those integrated companies who has their own paper mills. The mills that I worked for were 100% recycled. And so some of their investment, would have shown up in that last 20 years. They were actually they've built many of the most recent mills over the last 20 years. But we really saw an explosion of growth right around the time of the pandemic. So in 2023, 2.5 million tons of new, 100% recycled containerboard making capacity came online. And now containerboard is a technical term. It's the big term for the paper that goes in these boxes. So containerboard means liner board and we're the medium. So it's this big term.</p>

### 纸箱出货量与消费者支出的关系

**Joe:** 所以每个人都在疫情期间为他们的酵母面包运送面粉，或者购买新烤箱来改造他们的房子。回到箱子作为宏观经济指标的想法。我的意思是，我确实看到人们偶尔会谈论箱子作为领先指标的想法。这很不寻常，但有些人确实会这样做。在试图弄清消费者状况方面，箱子出货量或追踪箱子行业有多大价值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So everyone's shipping flour for their like sour dough or something during the pandemic or buying new ovens to remodel their houses while they can. Just going back to the idea of the box as a macroeconomic indicator. I mean, I do see people talking about like, this idea of boxes as a leading indicator every once in a while. It is unconventional, but some people do it. How valuable are box shipments or tracking the box industry in terms of trying to figure out what's going on with the consumer?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 对消费者来说非常重要。就像我说的，大约50%的纸箱消费会通过杂货店。所以当你开始看到纸箱出货量下滑时，我们可能需要关注杂货店和快速消费品公司，看看那里发生了什么。过去两年，我们看到了一个非常具有挑战性的消费环境。我个人认为，我们正处于**消费品衰退**（Consumer Goods Recession: 消费者对非必需品和耐用品的支出显著下降的时期），因为我们所看到的情况。2025年上半年，纸箱出货量比疫情高峰期下降了12%。这是一个巨大的跌幅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very important for the consumer. Like I said, about 50% of box consumption is going to go through a grocery store. So when you start to see box shipments slip, we probably need to be looking at grocery stores and CPG companies, to see what's going on there. And we have seen a very challenged consumer environment over the last two years. My personal opinion, I would say we're in a consumer goods recession because of what we've seen. First half of 2025, box shipments were down 12% from the height of the pandemic. That's a massive fall off.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 所以早些时候我们讨论了如何用十亿平方英尺来衡量这些东西。嗯，2021年我们有4160亿平方英尺。上半年大约是这个数字的一半。所以大约208。是的。情况真的很糟。快速计算一下，2025年上半年是1900亿平方英尺。所以跌幅相当大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So earlier we talked about how we would measure these things in billions of square feet. Well, in 2021, we had 416,000,000,000ft². The first half was right around half of that. So like about 208. Yeah. It was really bad. Quick math with 190,000,000,000ft² for the first half of 2025. So pretty big fall off.</p>
</details>

### 纸箱价格的异常上涨与行业结构

**Tracy:** 价格方面发生了什么？显然，衡量平方英尺是一回事。价格方面发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's happening with prices and so obviously right. So measuring square feet is one thing. What is happening with prices.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，价格讨论充满了争议。那么，是什么推动了价格？是真正的供需关系吗？还是更基于成本？多年来，在美国，价格是基于供需的，当**工厂开工率**（Mill Operating Rates: 衡量工厂生产能力利用程度的指标）达到96%时，库存会变得非常低，然后他们会提高价格。或者相反，当工厂开工率低于90%时，库存会上升，价格会下降。但过去一年半，我们实际上看到这些基本面都没有站住脚。工厂开工率勉强达到90%。第一季度末库存达到了五周。然而价格仍然上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the pricing the pricing discussion is one that, is sure full of controversy. So what drives pricing is it is it truly supply and demand? Is it something that's more cost based? For many, many years in the US, it was supply demand based where mill operating rates would hit 96%, inventories would get real low and they would raise prices. Or the opposite mill operators would go below 90%, inventories would rise and prices would fall. But over the last year and a half, we've actually seen none of those fundamentals hold up. So mill operating rates have barely been 90%. Inventories hit five weeks at the end of the first quarter. And yet prices still went up.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 五周的库存很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Five weeks is a lot of it.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 五周的库存很多。历史平均水平约为四周。三周半就有点危险了。当库存比这更少时，我们开始担心供应链问题。大约一半的箱板纸是在造纸厂生产的，并通过铁路运到纸箱厂。铁路不如零担运输（LTL）或整车运输（FTL）那样快速高效。但铁路可以运输比卡车更多的卷筒纸。所以你必须有更多的时间来允许这些卷筒纸的运输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Five weeks is a lot of inventory. Historical averages are around four weeks. To to kind of set the floor there three and a half weeks gets a little dangerous. When it's a little lighter than that. We start worrying about supply chain issues. About half of the the containerboard, is made at a paper mill and shipped by rail to a box plant. And rail isn't quite as fast and efficient as an LTL, or will actually be a full truckload. But you can carry more rolls by rail than you can by a truck. So you kind of have to have a little bit more of that time, to allow for the transit for those roles.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你认为为什么造纸公司实际上在提高价格，即使库存似乎很高，需求也在下降？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's your take on why paper companies are actually increasing prices, even, you know, when inventory seems to be high and demand is going down.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，你问得很有趣。四年前，我开始尝试弄清楚我们是否能“读懂茶叶”（read the tea leaves），可以说。我们汇集了一系列输入数据。在行业工作过，我们知道“香肠是如何制作的”。我们所做的就是汇集了这一系列输入数据，并将其与历史走势关联起来。我们的算法解释了彭博终端A级纸箱定价算法中93%的价格变动原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's funny you ask that. So four years ago, I started trying to figure out if we could read the tea leaves, sort of say. And, we put together a mix of inputs. And having worked in the industry, we kind of know how the sausage is made. And what we did was we put together this series of inputs and we correlated it back to historic movements. And our algorithm explains 93% of the reasons why prices have moved for Bloomberg terminal class A box pricing algo. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的。所以对于终端用户来说，BK BCI指数。是的，把它调出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So BK, BCI I index for people who are on the terminal. Yeah, Pull this up right I c keep going.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，BK BCI。是的。BCI代表**彭博瓦楞纸箱成本指数**（Bloomberg Corrugated Box Cost Index / BCI: 彭博社用于衡量瓦楞纸箱生产成本的指数）。直到今年，当我们进行最后一次多元回归分析时，它的R平方值达到了93%。所以它真的很好，对吧。然而，今年行业定价与我们的指数出现了偏差，即使成本下降，价格却上涨了。这实际上并非完全异常。我们几年前在2017年和2018年的指数中也看到过这种情况。但当时没有那么明显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well bk b wait, what is it BCI yeah. Do you see BCI stands for Bloomberg corrugated box cost index. And up until this year, when we did our the last multiple regression analysis, it had a 93% r-square. So it was really good, right. Well, pricing in the industry diverted from our index this year where prices went up even though costs are going down. And that's actually not a complete anomaly. We did see this in our index a few years back in 2017, 2018. But it wasn't quite as pronounced.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，抱歉。为了澄清，因为我想弄清楚。我正在看的指数是箱子成本指数。所以它不是在衡量箱子的成本，而是箱子价格可以上涨，即使图表上的这条线正在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, sorry. Just to be clear, because I want to get this right. And the index that I'm looking at is the box cost index. So it's not so much that it's measuring the cost of box like, so box prices can go up even though this line on the chart is rolling.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 正确。这很重要。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. This is important. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 有些人可能称之为**有机利润率扩张**（Organic Margin Expansion: 公司通过提高效率或产品价值来增加利润率，而非通过收购），而另一些人则有更生动的词语来形容。但在美国，90%的行业是**垂直整合**（Vertically Integrated: 公司拥有其供应链的多个环节，从原材料生产到最终产品销售）的。这意味着他们有自己的造纸厂。他们将纸张运到自己的纸箱厂，然后卖给自己的客户。因此，不像其他地区那样，这里没有太多开放市场。在其他地区，比如欧洲，他们没有那种垂直整合水平。所以有一个更健全的开放市场，它会因为正常的供需基本面而压低价格。如果库存绝对过剩，价格就会下跌。我们最好的数据显示，全球约有5000万吨的箱板纸过剩。这并非仅限于美国。这是一个全球性的数字，但这确实会改变你的意识框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some might call this, kind of organic margin expansion. Others have more colorful words for it. But in the US, 90% of the industry is vertically integrated. And what that means is they have their own paper mills. They move that paper to their own box plants and sell it to their own customers. And so there really isn't much of an open market the way there is in other regions. In other regions, like in Europe, they don't have that vertical integration level. So there is a much more robust open market, and it drives prices down because of normal supply demand fundamentals. If you do have just an absolute glut of inventory, prices are going to fall. Our best data says globally, we have around 50 million tons of oversupply of containerboard. Now we don't have that just in the US. That's a global number, but that does kind of alter your frame of consciousness.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** Tracy，顺便说一句，这太棒了。每个人都应该去彭博终端，因为我现在正在阅读描述方法论的PDF。顺便说一句，权重包括柴油成本、苛性钠成本、天然气价格使用、回收纤维价格、玉米价格指数、维修和保养、平均卡车运费、美国平均时薪。这就是他们如何得出箱子成本的方法论。这真的很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tricia, by the way, this is just so fantastic. Everyone should go to Bloomberg Terminal because now I'm reading the PDF that describes how the methodology, the weights, by the way, are the cost of diesel, the cost of caustic soda, natural gas price use, recycled fiber price, corn price index, repair and maintenance, average truck rate, U.S. average hourly earnings. And this is how they derive the cost of what a box and it looks are all the methodology. It's really fantastic.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 想到玉米是一种投入，这很有趣。根据方法论，它的权重是7%。最大的权重是美国回收纤维价格，占37%。这很合理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's so funny to think that corn is an input. It's a 7% weight. According to the methodology, the biggest weight is the U.S. recycled fiber price of 37%. Makes sense.</p>
</details>

### 库存过剩、效率与数据挑战

**Tracy:** 仅就库存而言。今年纸箱出货量下降有多少是由于库存过剩？我们是否有关于库存与需求之间关系的良好数据？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just on the inventory. See how much of the decline, this year in terms of box shipments is just an inventory glut. Do we have like a good read on that versus demand from a box standpoint?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 我们没有这方面的良好数据。好的。如果我们考虑杂货店，那些箱子周转得非常快。在行业工作过，箱子会在纸箱厂制造。它会运给客户。我们会想到通用磨坊（General Mills）、家乐氏（Kellogg's）和好时（Hershey's）以及我们知道的所有大品牌。它不一定会长时间存放在他们的设施中。它可能在30天内回到系统中。事实上，我去过杂货店，我的孩子们讨厌我们去杂货店的时候。我总是翻看箱子，看看是谁制造的，但有时他们会在箱子上盖上生产日期。哦，我见过最快30天内就在店里了。而且通常当Smurfit Kappa收购WestRock时，我在交易后90天内就看到了一个全新的Smurfit WestRock BMC。所以这只是一个有趣的小花絮。如果你从现在开始发现自己会翻看箱子……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't have a good read on that. Okay. If we're thinking about the grocery store, those boxes turn over very quickly. Having worked in the industry, the box is going to get made at the box plant. It's going to go to a customer. We're going to think like General Mills and Kellogg's and Hershey's and all of the big brand names that we know. It's not going to necessarily sit in their facility for very long. It will maybe get back into the system within 30 days in fact, I've been to the grocery store and my kids hate it when we go to the grocery store. I'm always turning over boxes to see who made them, but sometimes they will date stamp the boxes as to when they were produced. Oh, and I've seen as quick as 30 days in the store. And oftentimes when Smurfit Kappa bought or bought WestRock, I was able to see a brand new Smurfit WestRock BMC within 90 days of that transaction. So it's just an interesting little like tidbit. And if you find yourself turning boxes over from now on,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我也要开始那样做了。箱子的平方英尺与箱子里实际销售的商品之间的关系有多稳定？我之所以问这个问题，是因为我记得我第一次在线订购杂货时，收到这些包裹。我当时想，这包装效率真低，你收到一个箱子，里面只有两个西红柿。这真的需要这样吗？亚马逊就是一个经典的例子，但我猜亚马逊也不喜欢这样。我猜他们总是试图优化箱子的容量，这样，你知道，你为你的Kindle Fire或其他什么东西买了一个新的遥控器，它就不会装在一个大箱子里，对吧？在有效利用这些箱子内的立方英尺空间方面，是否一直在取得进展？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to start doing that. How stable is the relationship between square footage of boxes and the actual goods sold in boxes? And the reason I ask this is that, you know, I remember the first several times that I ordered groceries, for example, online, and I would get these deliveries. I was like, this was really an efficiently unpacked, like, you get a box and there's two tomatoes in there. And it's like, was this really did they really need to just have this? Or Amazon is a classic example, but I imagine the Amazon doesn't love this either. I imagine they're always trying to optimize for a box capacity such that, you know, you buy a new, remote control for your Kindle Fire or whatever. It doesn't come in a big box, do they? Is there progress always being made on the efficient use of the cubic footage? Space within these boxes? Yes.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 是的。好的，我们来谈两件事。首先，我们来谈谈消费者是谁。其次，我们来谈谈尺寸调整。所以首先，当我们想到消费者时，沃尔玛、塔吉特、亚马逊、家得宝，他们都是消费者。制造的大多数箱子都是为他们准备的，而不是为我们。事实上，这就是为什么他们称之为“大卖场”（big box stores），对吧？对。所以，我们稍后可以深入探讨，但这个旧箱子实际上有自己的售后市场，我们回收的大约80%的物品都来自这些商店，而不是来自我们的家门口。好的。所以当我们想到消费者时，我们真的需要首先想到大商店，因为他们是这些箱子的主要消费者。所以当你想到我们正在看到的变化时，如果我们在这些商店看到显著变化，我们可能会想到**缩水式通胀**（Shrinkflation: 产品尺寸缩小但价格不变或上涨的现象）或公司改变产品尺寸，然后不得不改变容纳它们的箱子尺寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's talk about two things. First. First, we're going to talk about who the consumer is. The second we'll talk about right sizing. So first when we think about consumers Walmarts targets Amazon Home Depot, they are consumers. And the majority of boxes that are made are intended for them, not for us. In fact, that's why they call them big box stores, right? Right. So, we can get into this later, but this old box actually has its own aftermarket, in which probably 80% of the stuff that we recover comes from those stores, not from our doorsteps. Okay. So when we think about consumers, we really need to think about the big stores first, because that's who the main consumers of these boxes are. And so when you think about the changes that we're seeing, if we're seeing significant changes at those stores, we may be thinking about things like Shrinkflation or companies altering the size of their products and then having to alter the size of the boxes that hold them.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 所以我认为虽然这是一个重要的想法，但它可能不如我们家里和亚马逊收到的东西那么重要。例如，让我们谈谈传统的电子商务，或者我想我可能会开始称之为“**纸箱到纸箱商务**”（Cart to Carton Commerce: 描述从购物车到包装箱的电子商务流程，强调包装在其中的作用）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think while it's an important idea, it's probably less significant than what we get at our homes and Amazon. For instance, let's let's talk about traditional e-commerce, or I think I may start referring to this as cart to cart and commerce.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，非常好。是的，那很好，因为今天的电子商务或数字销售，有些人谈论的，也可以包括Uber Eats或Instacart之类的东西。它还可以包括在线购买，到店取货。所以“纸箱到纸箱商务”可能是一个更好的思考方式，或者，你知道，也许你可以想出一个新词。我会考虑的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh very good. Yeah, that's good because e-commerce today or digital sales is some people talk about it can can also include things like Uber Eats or Instacart. It could also include a buy online pick up at the store. So a cart to cart and commerce might be a yeah, better, better way to think about or like a you know, maybe you can come up with a new term. I'll I'll think about it.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 根据我们最好的猜测，亚马逊在2024年至少占美国所有制造箱子的8%。我们从许多从事这种传统电子商务或“纸箱到纸箱”业务的公司那里看到的是“尺寸调整”（right sizing）。所以你可能收到过一个看起来有点奇怪的亚马逊箱子，对吧？它很轻，是真正的纸，它自己折叠起来。它有拉链，它看起来不像桌上这个用胶带封起来的常规开槽纸箱。你可能见过那种，或者你可能收到过一个纸质邮寄袋。亚马逊一直在邮寄袋和包装技术方面开辟道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Amazon, from our best guesses represents about 8% of all of the boxes made in the US, at least in 2024. And what we're seeing from a lot of these companies who do that kind of traditional e-commerce or the cart to carton, we're seeing a right sizing. So you may have gotten an Amazon box that looks a little bit weird, right? It's lightweight, real paper. It's folded in on itself. It's got that zipper pull on it, and it just doesn't quite look like this box on the table that's been taped up. And it's sort of a regular slotted carton. You may have seen that, or you may have gotten a paper mailer. And Amazon is really been forging the way in mailers and in packaging technology.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 等等，什么是纸质邮寄袋？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, what's the paper mailer?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 纸质邮寄袋是一个由纸制成的袋子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A paper mailer is a bag. Oh, there's made from paper.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 哦，我只收到过亚马逊的塑料袋。我没收到过。哦，等等，不，我可能收到过里面有气泡膜的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I've only ever gotten the plastic ones of those from Amazon. I don't think I've gotten. Oh, wait, no, I probably have with the bubble wrap inside,</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 有些甚至不再有气泡膜了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some of them don't even have bubble wrap anymore.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我没收到过那种。好的，但这让我想起，如果我在亚马逊、沃尔玛或其他类似公司的采购部门工作，我决定为业务选择哪些箱子的因素是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I haven't gotten one of those. Okay, but this reminds me, if I am working in the procurement department of an Amazon or, I don't know, a Walmart or someone like that, what are the factors that go into me deciding what boxes I actually want for the business?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 这将反映你的产品是什么，每种产品都有自己的规格，需要哪种箱子。所以如果你正在制造一个小部件，你将决定有多少个小部件会装入一个箱子。这将取决于它的重量和易碎性，以及你可能需要的其他内部包装。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's going to be a reflection of what your product is, and every product has its own specification, what kind of box it needs. So if you're making a widget, you will determine how many of those widgets are going to go into a box. And that's going to be a function of its weight and fragility. And what kind of other internal packaging you might need.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 让我换个方式问这个问题。为什么亚马逊，至少从历史上看，似乎喜欢大箱子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask this question in a different way. Why does Amazon, at least historically, seem to like big boxes?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，我不知道我能替亚马逊回答这个问题，但这似乎取决于他们在包装站包装的人的判断，以及他们可用的箱子库存可能是什么样的。我见过一些这样的操作。它是一个包裹。它只是一个小型包装台，上面有一些高架储物箱，里面装着折叠平装的箱子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't know that I can answer for Amazon on that one, but it does seem to be maybe at the discretion of people who are packaging at their packing stations and what their available inventory of boxes might be like. I've, I've seen some of these things in action. It's a package. It's just a small packaging, desk of sorts, with some overhead bins that have knock down flat boxes in them.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这一定是一个有趣的工程问题，因为我作为最终消费者可能会说，看看这箱子空间的低效利用。我收到一个箱子，里面只有一个小遥控器。另一方面，也许优化是因为包装工人有四种箱子可供选择，如果他们有更多的选择，也许他们可以有更高效的空间与商品比率，但这会占用更多的仓库空间，并使整个过程效率降低。所以有很多我作为最终消费者甚至没有想到的算法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This must be an interesting sort of engineering problem, because I might, at the end consumer level, say, look at this inefficient use of, box space. I got a box and all has a little remote control. On the other hand, maybe the optimization occurred because the packer has four boxes to choose from, and if they had more choices, maybe they could have had a more efficient, space to, good ratio, but then that would have taken up more warehouse space and made that whole process less efficient. So try all kinds of algorithms that I'm not even thinking about as the end consumer here.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 有很多算法。当你考虑传统电子商务中的箱子和包装时，他们不仅从包装角度，从定价角度，而且真正从运输中的体积角度寻求优化。对吧？所以我们必须考虑到亚马逊或Chewy或任何电子商务平台都会处理所有这些订单。他们处理订单，然后通过他们的配送中心。如果你是亚马逊，你有自己的卡车。你想确保你可以在一辆卡车上尽可能多地装载这些东西。优化可以在包括卡车包装在内的各种不同点发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are lots of algorithms. And when you think about boxes and packaging in traditional e-commerce, they are looking to optimize not just from a packaging standpoint, from like from a pricing position, but really from a cube in the shipments. Right? So we have to think that Amazon is going to process all these orders or chewy or whatever the e-commerce platform is. They process the orders, they're going to go through their distribution centers. And if you're Amazon, you have your own trucks. You want to make sure that you can put as many of those things on a truck as possible. There's all kinds of different points at which the optimization could occur for including packing the truck.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你知道，当我们谈论更广泛的宏观经济数据时，特别是现在，有很多关于总量是否遗漏了部分故事的问题，特别是在当今的许多商业活动中，每当有零售首席执行官说情况良好时，但它实际上是由高端市场驱动的。高端市场使其保持 afloat。中产消费者受到挤压，低收入人群受到挤压。你知道，各种各样的事情，当我们谈论已发货的箱子平方英尺时，我们是在谈论总量。但是否有更细致的数据可以查看，比如纸板的质量等等，可以告诉我们经济中哪些方面是强劲的，即使总体数字正在下降？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, when we're talking about broader macroeconomic data these days, in particular, there are a lot of questions about the degree to which the aggregates are missing part of the story, and specifically in a lot of commerce these days, anytime there's some retail CEO that like things are holding up well, but it's really being driven by the high end. The high end is keeping it afloat. The middle consumer is getting squeezed, lower income is getting squeezed. You know, all kinds of things are there different. You know, we're talking in aggregate when you when you talk about box square footage having been shipped. But is there more granular data that one could look at in terms of the quality of cardboard, etc., that could tell us different things about what's strong within the economy, even if the big numbers are declining.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 高档箱子，高档箱子实际上并不存在。所以我们行业面临的一个问题是，我们没有很好的数据。在行业工作过，并提供过这些数据，这是一项没有人真正仔细核对的苦差事。你带来了一个新客户，对吧？你正在为新客户提交所有文件。其中一项是他们的**北美行业分类系统**（North American Industry Classification System / NAICs Code: 用于对北美经济活动进行分类的系统）代码。嗯，没有人会检查以确保它是正确的，对吧？你只是随便填一下，你知道，查一下他们是否可能向商务部长或其他机构提交了文件。就是这样。所以，最细致的数据充其量是模糊的，但它具有洞察力，而且是一致的，因为更换供应商是有成本的。我们确实看到它发生。对于非常大的箱子客户，他们不喜欢改变。你通常有长期的关系，很多很多年。你有很多库存单位（SKU）。如果你是一家非常大的公司，并且在各地都有运营设施，你不想经历这些。所以数据虽然模糊，但可能是一致的。我们确实看到一些这样的情况，例如在2024年，我们看到制成品食品下降了3.7%。所以如果加上饮料，纸箱使用量下降了4%多一点。那么我们如何描述这种情况呢？这些公司的销量是否也出现了类似的下降？我认为数据表明这可能非常接近。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fancy boxes, the fancy box is not really there. So one of the problems that our industry faces is that we don't have great data. Having worked in the industry and having provided that data, it it's a chore that no one really double checks. You've brought on a new customer, right? And you're submitting all your paperwork for the new customer. One of those things is a classification of their NAICs code. The North American industry could well, no one ever checks to make sure that's proper, right? You just kind of wing it you know, look it up and see if they've maybe filed it with the Secretary of Commerce or something like that. And and that's it. So the the granular data is murky at best, but it is insightful and it is consistent because there is a cost to changing your supplier. Like we we do see it happen. And for very big box customers they don't like change. And you have a long standing relationship typically many, many years. You have lots of SKUs. And if you're a really big company and you have operating facilities all over the place, you don't want to go through that. So the data, while murky, might be consistent. And we do see some of those things, like in 2024, for instance, we saw that manufactured food felt like by 3.7%. So if you combine that with beverage, it was a little over of a 4% decline in box usage. Now how do we describe that? Did did those companies see similar falls in their volume? I think I think the data would suggest that that's probably very close.</p>

### 回收经济学与包装创新

**Ryan Fox:** 瓦楞包装确实有一些已知的权衡。其中之一是**可回收塑料容器**（Returnable Plastic Container: 可重复使用和回收的塑料包装容器）。目前主要推向农产品。沃尔玛（Walmart）和Sprouts Market特别一直在推动他们的一些人采用可回收塑料容器作为可行的选择。它减少了浪费。他们正在围绕这些东西建立供应链，以帮助运输它们。所以这是我们看到的一种削减纸箱消费的东西。我们不知道它是否已经成为一个大问题，但它确实存在，而且它确实是一个问题。我们看到的另一件事是向更大尺寸箱子的转变，有些箱子有托盘那么大，你知道，48英寸长，40英寸宽，可能40英寸高。对于你的小孩子来说，这是一个很棒的玩具屋。

<p class="english-text">Corrugated packaging does have some known trade offs. One of those things is a returnable plastic container. That is mainly being pushed right now towards produce. Walmart specifically Sprouts market, have been pushing some of their people to adopt returnable plastic containers as a viable option. It reduces waste. They're building supply chains around these things to help carry them around. So that is one of the things that we've seen kind of cut into box consumption. We don't know that it's a big thing yet, but it is out there and it is a thing. The other thing that we've seen is a movement to larger format boxes, some that are the size of a pallet, you know, 48in long, 40in wide and maybe 40in tall. A great playhouse for your young kids.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我记得小时候用大箱子做房子。为什么现在还会有人投资这个领域？因为你描述了巨大的供应过剩，然后需求又在下降，也许是因为关税。如果美国开始在国内生产更多商品，它会再次回升。但似乎大多数趋势都在朝着错误的方向发展。这个行业到底有什么吸引力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember doing that with huge boxes, turning them into houses. Why would anyone invest in this space currently? Because when you describe this enormous glut in supply and then the fact that demand is going down, maybe it's because of the tariffs. Maybe if the U.S. starts manufacturing more goods, it'll domestically it'll start to pick up again. But it seems like most of the lines are kind of trending in the wrong way. What what exactly is like the allure of this industry?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 这是一个很好的问题，我希望我知道答案，除了他们确实一直在支付股息，而且是持续支付的。所以，它被认为是一个相当稳定、非常稳定的股息。我认为这是一个相当安全的投资。我们确实看到，我的意思是，它在终端角度来看非常受欢迎，我一直收到零售客户的询问。他们正在试图弄清楚这是否仍然是一个好的投资。虽然我们不做买入、卖出、持有建议，但我们仍然看到这些领域有大量的流量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a great question, and I wish I knew the answer, other than they do have dividends that they have been been paying and and consistently paying. So, so it's considered like a fairly like stable state, very stable dividend. I think it's a pretty safe investment. We do see I mean, it's very popular from, from a terminal standpoint, I get bluer clients at retail all the time. They're looking to figure out if this is still a good investment. And while we don't do buy, sell, hold recommendations, we still see a lot of traffic in these in these lanes.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这是否仅仅取决于你的公司规模有多大，以及你在市场上的定价权有多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does it just depend on how big your company actually is and how much pricing power you have in the market?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，我认为那是一个神话。我认为实际上没有定价权。如果存在定价权，我们就不会看到当今世界上正在发生的一些行动。我的意思是，有些工厂生产非常坚固的纸张。它的性能非常好。而且这种纸张具有科学特性，使其与众不同。然而，他们并没有获得他们应得的溢价，因为有替代品。这就像想要一辆法拉利却以野马的价格出售。它们都很棒，但其中一辆显然有吸引力，另一辆也有自己的客户群。当你能买到一辆野马并且它能用时，你不会总是想买那辆法拉利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, see, I think that's a myth. I think I think there really isn't pricing power. If there were pricing power, we wouldn't see some of the actions that we're seeing in the world today. And what I mean by that is there are some mills that make a really robust paper. It performs really, really well. And there are scientific properties to that paper that set it apart from anything else. And yet they aren't getting the premium that they should be getting because there is an alternative. And and it's it's like wanting a Ferrari and selling for a mustang. They're both great, but one obviously has the allure and one has its client base too. And when you can buy a mustang and it works, you're not always going to want to buy that Ferrari.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 嗯，实际上，这让我想到我想去的地方。首先，美国最大的箱子或包装博览会的名称是什么？它会在某个地方集中展示吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, actually, this sort of gets me to where I want to go. First of all, what what would be the name of the biggest box or packaging expo in the United States like that? Get it together somewhere? Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 从包装的广义角度来看，是Pack Expo。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In in big round terms for packaging pack expo.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那在哪里？拉斯维加斯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where's that Vegas.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 今年将在拉斯维加斯举行。也许有一天我们会去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's going to be in Vegas this year. Maybe we'll go one day.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 好的。撇开我们认为理所当然的销量和定价趋势不谈，每个人都好奇目前Pack Expo会讨论哪些热门话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So setting aside the volume and pricing trends which we take for granted, everyone is curious about what would be the hot topics right now that would be discussed at Pac Expo.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 哦，可持续性长期以来一直是一个非常热门的话题，它与**生产者延伸责任法**（Extended Producer Responsibility / EPR Laws: 要求生产者对其产品在整个生命周期（包括消费后阶段）的环境影响承担责任的法律）相匹配。这是一项州级倡议，旨在将回收的负担从居民转移到制造废物的公司身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ooh, sustainability has been a really big topic for a long time, and it's matched with extended producer responsibility laws. So this is a state by state initiative to basically shift the burden of recycling away from its residents and onto the companies who are creating the waste.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这具体是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does that work exactly?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 所以目前，我们有少数几个州已经通过了立法。俄勒冈州是第一个真正实施这项法律的州，他们制定了收费标准。他们衡量了该州每月或每年产生多少废物，并为每种商品分配了每磅多少美元或多少美分的费用。如果你向该州销售商品，他们实际上会对你寄往该州的废物收取费用。你必须向他们支付一张支票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So right now, we have a handful of states who've actually passed legislation. Oregon's the first one that that is really kind of enacting this, and they've set up a fee schedule. They've measured how much waste their state produces in a month or in a year, and they've allocated a certain number of dollars per pound or cents per pound for each one of those commodities. And if you're selling something into the state, they are essentially placing a fee on the waste that you're sending in their state. And you have to pay a check to them.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** Mike，你能多谈谈回收的经济学吗？因为我把我用过的很多纸板都放进了正确的垃圾桶，回收的经济学。是的，但就像我总是这样，这适用于任何回收，那就是当我想到实际的劳动时，当我想到人们的勤勉程度时，我会说，可能高于平均水平的勤勉程度，关于正确的垃圾桶分配。但我知道我并不完美，但当我想到勤勉程度和低效率，以及所有这些劳动时，然后和一个人谈谈，什么时候它实际上是经济的，什么时候它只是一种没有真正目的的**货物崇拜**（Cargo Cult: 指人们模仿先进文明的行为，却不理解其深层原理，期望能带来类似结果的现象）行为？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mike, can you talk a little bit more about the economics of recycling? Because I put a lot of the cardboard I used into the problem, into the proper bin, the economics, the recycling. Like, yeah, but like I'm always in this goes with any recycling really, which is that when I think about the labor that actually when I think about a, the degree of diligence that people and I would say, and probably higher than average diligence about been, proper been allocation. But I know I'm not perfect, but when I think about the degree of diligence and the inefficiency and then the labor and all of this stuff and then talk to a guy, what? When is it, actually economical and when is it just sort of some sort of cargo cult type, behavior that people engage in where there's no real purpose?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 嗯，大多数时候回收费用是由税收支付的。例如，在我住的街道上，情况并非如此。我必须每季度支付25美元来获得一个垃圾桶。不算太糟糕，但我必须为此付费。回收的经济学大致是这样的。收集和处理回收材料的成本从每吨400美元到700美元不等。所以你会看到一辆卡车来收集你的可回收物。它会运到一个叫做**市政回收设施**（Municipal Recovery Facility / Murph: 集中处理和分类回收材料的设施）的设施。在那里进行处理。他们有很多生产线来分类塑料、金属、纸张等所有东西。然后他们生产压块。所以这些材料被压成紧凑的立方体，然后出售。所以如果我们使用一个大致的数字，说每吨500美元，那么从Murph出来的净吨数在市场上的价值只有每吨100到140美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so most, most of the time the recycling fees are paid by taxes. My street, for instance, that was not the case. And I had to pay $25 a quarter for a bin. Not not terrible, but I had to pay for it. The economics in big round numbers work like this. It costs anywhere from about $400 a ton upwards to $700 a ton to go out and do the collections and processing for recovered materials, all of that stuff. So you'll see a a truck come and pick up your recyclables. It goes to a facility called a Murph, a municipal recovery facility. And there it's process. And they have lots of lines that sort things out plastics and metals and papers and all that stuff. And then they produce bales. So a a compact cube of sorts of these materials, and then they get sold. So if we were to just use a big round number and say $500 a ton, the net ton that comes out of the Murph only has a street value between 100 to $140 a ton.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 很少能得到这个。那太糟糕了。那太糟糕了。最疯狂的是瓦楞纸箱。是的。它才是真正让家庭回收发挥作用的原因。因为我们从数据中得知。这是我几年前质疑过的事情，我们最好的数据显示，美国大约66%的瓦楞纸箱被回收。这是一个相当不错的数字。行业过去常说93%的箱子被回收。这不可能。但我们没有数据表明它低于66%。但我们确实有一种方法论来达到这个数字，它实际上得到了国家可再生能源实验室（National Renewable Energy Lab）的支持。现在你可能也能在他们的一些数据中找到漏洞。但重点是，我们知道大约60%多的箱子被回收。而且我们知道它们有一个非常健全的售后市场。我们每年处理大约3500万吨旧瓦楞纸箱。其中大约三分之一会运往海外。还有很多其他国家想要我们这里生产的**原浆纤维**（Virgin Fiber: 未经回收的全新木材纤维）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very little getting that right. That's just terrible. That's terrible. And the craziest thing is the corrugated box. Yeah. Is what really makes household recycling even work. Because, we know from from data. And this is something which I challenged several years ago, our best data says that we recycle about 66% of of the corrugated boxes in the U.S. it's a pretty good number. The industry used to say 93% of boxes got recycled. There's no way that's possible. But we don't have the data to say it's lower than 66%. But we do have a methodology that we use to kind of get their it was actually supported by the National Renewable Energy Lab. Now you can probably shoot some holes in some of their stuff too. But big point is we know that about 60 some percent of these get recycled. And we know they have a very robust aftermarket. We process about 35 million tons of old corrugated cartons almost every year. About a third of them are going to go overseas. There are a lot of other countries that want the virgin fiber that we produce here.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 既然我们已经揭示了回收令人沮丧的真相，让我问一个稍微积极一点的问题，那就是在箱子制造方面是否有任何酷炫的技术发展？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that we've revealed the depressing truth about recycling, let me ask a slightly more positive question, which is have there been any cool technological developments when it comes to box making?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 他们不断地为箱子申请专利，制造新的设备以更快地生产它们。改进我们造纸的方式，我们正在努力制造更坚固、更轻的纸张。所以如果你想到其中一些，我们回到EPR法律一秒钟。这些费用是基于你消费的重量。所以如果公司能购买更轻的材料，那么他们的费用就会下降。对。所以现在有一个推动，看看我们是否能减轻纸张的重量，使其同样坚固但重量更轻。所以这些是我们在未来5到10年内将真正看到一些变化的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are constantly patenting boxes, making new equipment to make them faster. Improving the the way we make the paper, we're trying to make stronger paper that's lighter and weight. So if you think about some of these, we'll go back to the EPR laws for a second. Those fees are based on the weight of what you're consuming. So if the companies can buy a lighter weight material then their fees go down. Right. So there is a push now to see if we can lightweight the paper, make it as strong but with less weight. And so these are things that we're going to see really take some some shape in the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
</details>

### 全球包装质量与行业展望

**Joe:** 你提到出口，我很高兴。我注意到一件事，每当我出国旅行时，即使是到相当富裕的国家，但我肯定在较贫穷的国家注意到，包装材料的质量明显比这里差。所以，我经常注意到的例子是，你知道，你在美国杂货店买一瓶水。它很好，很坚固，它能很好地保持形状。你在危地马拉的杂货店买一瓶水，我几年前去过墨西哥，它皱巴巴的。它很容易被压扁。你可以看出它是一种不太耐用的塑料。如果我们看看像危地马拉这样的发展中经济体中的纸箱，我们会发现这与我们在这里看到的纸板质量明显不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know I'm glad you mentioned export. One of the things that I've noticed whenever I am, traveling abroad, even to fairly rich countries, but I definitely notice it when I'm in poorer countries, is that the quality of packaging materials is distinctly worse than here. So and I the the example that I often notice is, you know, you buy a bottle of water in a U.S grocery store. It's nice, it's sturdy, it holds its, form very well. You buy a bottle of water at a grocery store in Guatemala where I was a couple of years ago from Mexico. It's crinkly. It smashes over easily. You could tell that it's a less durable, plastic. If we were to look at the cardboard boxes running through a developing economies such as, Guatemala, etc., we see that this is noticeably different than the quality of cardboard that we're seeing here.</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 技术术语是**备料**（Furnish: 制造纸张或纸板所用的原材料，如木浆、回收纤维等）。好的。所以你用什么来制作箱子？美国历来是**原浆牛皮纸板**（Virgin Craft Liner Board: 由新鲜木材纤维制成的未经回收的箱板纸）的生产国，这意味着他们砍伐树木。他们将树木削片。他们将这些木片转化为新的原浆纸。这实际上一直在下降和逆转。我们看到越来越多的回收产能上线。而且因为我们仍然有一个非常好的原浆基础，所以美国这里的回收纸质量一直很好。现在在其他国家，他们可能没有南方黄松，所以他们购买岩石，或者他们使用自己的橡木或旧瓦楞纸箱。所以他们只是把他们拥有的东西撕碎。如果他们从低质量的箱子开始，那么他们就会得到低质量的纸张，而且更少。所以有时他们会有较低等级的纸张。在世界其他地区，他们实际上对这种纸张有不同的定义。所以他们会有不同等级的纸张。所以，是的，有时你会得到低等级的纸张，因为它是一种商品，然后它就会起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The technical term is going to be furnish. Okay. So what are you using to make the boxes? The US has historically been a maker of virgin craft liner board, meaning they cut down trees. They chipped the trees. They they turn those chips in into new virgin paper that's actually been declining and reversing. We've seen more and more recycled capacity come online. And because we've still had a very good virgin base, the recycled paper here in the US has been very good. Now in other countries they may not have southern yellow pine, so they are buying rock or they're using their own oak or oaks, old corrugated cartons. So they're they're just going to rip up the stuff that they have. If they start with a low quality box, then they're going to get a low quality paper on the back end and less so sometimes they are going to have a lower grade paper. And in other areas of the world they actually have different definitions for that kind of paper. So they would have different grades of it. And so yeah, you sometimes you get the low grade paper because it's a commodity and then it'll work.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 所以我还有一个问题。只是为了总结一下。这是一个包装笑话。包装笑话。好的。总结一下，你对今年下半年纸箱出货量的预测是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I just have one more question. Just to wrap it all up. That's a packaging joke. Packaging joke. Okay. Wrapping it all up, summarizing what's your, prediction for the second half of the year in terms of box shipments?</p>
</details>

**Ryan Fox:** 我们认为它们仍然会面临很大的挑战。全年我们预计可能会下降2.5%，甚至可能高达3%。这真的取决于会发生什么。很多问题都源于关税和白宫出台的政策。所以这真的取决于这些公司在展望未来时有多少信心。我们看到进入美国的集装箱数量，比如货船，是提前装载的。对。现在关税已经到来，或者可能没有到来，并且已经有所减弱，看看会发生什么会非常有趣。但也许换个角度思考。你知道，大多数美国人在有钱的时候会买东西，没钱的时候会用信用卡。我们看到信用卡债务创纪录。这对于人们是否会花钱来说不是一个好兆头。所以我们真的不认为即使是假期，前景也会很乐观。或者美国人可能会花钱。它会和往年完全一样吗？可能不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We think they're still going to be very challenged. Full year, we're saying there's probably going to be down 2.5%, maybe as high as 3%. It really depends on what happens. A lot of this is stemming from tariffs and policy coming out of the, the white House. So it really depends on how much confidence some of these companies have as they look forward. We've seen the the number of containers coming into the U.S, like the cargo ships was front loaded. Right. And then and now that the tariffs are kind of here or maybe they're not here and they've been kind of tapering off a bit, it will be very curious to see what happens. But to to maybe think about it another way. You know, most Americans buy stuff when they have money and when they don't have money, they put it on credit cards. And we're seeing records, amount of credit card debt. And that's not a great sign for if people are going to spend money. So we don't really think that that's a really hot outlook for even the for the holidays. Or Americans can spend money probably. Is it going to look exactly like it did in prior years? Probably not.</p>

<p class="english-text">I wouldn't if someone had asked me how I thought they would measure box shipments, I might have guessed, you know, cubic feet, red square feet. But yes, I, I wouldn't have, you know, all this covering the world stuff. Yeah. It's pretty cool. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我猜关于箱子作为宏观经济指标的有用性问题仍然存在，因为我们确实有过去两个月的零售销售数据，看起来相当有韧性，相当强劲。尽管纸箱出货量下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I guess the question over, how useful a macroeconomic indicator boxes actually are, it still kind of lingers because we did have retail sales data, for the past two months that are available that came in, like, pretty resilient, pretty strong. Despite the decline in box shipments.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我说的那个词是什么？“纸箱到纸箱商务”？我真的很喜欢这个词，因为它是真的。对。现在的电子商务包含了这么多不同的东西。所以有一种经典的电子商务，你上网站，买东西，然后它装在箱子里送来。但当然，还有在线购买，到店取货，这是一种稍微不同的变体。或者你可能会收到装在纸箱里的食物等等。所以我喜欢这个想法，好的，电子商务如此广泛，如果我们想对纸箱的某些用例有类似的轨迹，我们可能需要更细致一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I what was the term huge cart to carton commerce? I really like that because it's true. Right. What is e-commerce that now encompasses so many different things. So there is this sort of classic e-commerce where you go on a website, you buy a thing and it comes in a box. But then there's of course, you know, buy and you pick up at the store and that's a slightly different variation. Or maybe you get, food delivered in a cardboard box, etc.. So I like the idea of, okay, e-commerce is so broad that if we want to have like for like trajectories of some of these use cases for cardboard boxes, we have to maybe get a little bit more granular.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 嗯，这让我想起，实际上，我认为包装行业仍然被低估的一点是，它对更广泛的通货膨胀有多大的影响。是的，是的。这是我记得一些经济学家在疫情后时代提出过的问题。但有趣的是，现在，即使纸箱出货量下降，价格似乎仍然具有粘性，甚至还在上涨。那么这对通货膨胀意味着什么？我喜欢这样想，当你购买东西时，我总是这样想，有时它可能有点形而上学，但当你在杂货店购买东西时，比如说你买一个牛油果，或者你买什么？当你购买牛油果时，你到底在买什么？对。因为，好的，有一个你可以切开的实体牛油果，但你也在购买它在冷藏空间中度过的时间。你正在向那些冷藏、运输的所有者支付租金等等。思考你购买的任何商品都很有趣，无论是生菜等等。生菜有多小？无论如何。即使是生菜也意味着什么，因为生菜的种植需要劳动，还有生菜的土地等等。所以当你购买东西时，你到底在购买什么？通常这包括包装，但通常根本不清楚它到底是什么，除了这一捆商品和服务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, that reminds me, actually, I think one thing that's still really underappreciated about the packaging industry is how much it feeds into broader inflation. Yes, yes. And this is something I remember some economists bringing this up, during the post pandemic era. But the interesting thing is now, even though box shipments are going down, prices still seem to be kind of sticky and even going up. So what does that mean for inflation? I like to think when you buy, I always think about this and sometimes it maybe gets a little metaphysical, but when you buy a thing in a grocery store, let say you buy an avocado or you buy, what? Like what are you buying when you buy the avocado? Right. Because, okay, there is the physical avocado that you might cut open, but then you're buying the time it spent in a refrigerated space. You're paying rent to those, owners of refrigeration, transportation. You're buying the transportation, etc. it's interesting to think about any good that you buy, period ahead of lettuce, etc.. How little is the lettuce? Whatever. Even the lettuce means, because there is labor that went into the planting of the lettuce and there is the land of the lettuce, etc. so the idea of what are you buying when you're buying something? Often that include the packaging, but often it's just never really clear at all what it is except this bundle of goods and services.</p>
