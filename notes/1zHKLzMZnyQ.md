### Robinhood 2025年第三季度财报前瞻

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Tech Bros 直播。今天是 11 月 3 日，星期一。大约两天后，也就是周三，我们将迎来 Robinhood 2025 年第三季度的财报。所以，本期节目将主要围绕这份财报展开。如果时间允许，我们也会谈谈其他几个话题，但 Robinhood 将是今天非常重要的话题。Roy Tanner，你最近怎么样？

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Tech Bros. We are live. It is Monday, November 3rd and in about two days on Wednesday, we are going to be getting Robin Hood earnings for Q3 2025. So, this episode is going to be pretty much dedicated to those earnings. I think we'll if we have some time, we'll talk about a couple other topics, but uh Robin Hood is going to be a very important topic for today. Roy Tanner, how you doing?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，这总是激动人心的时刻。是的，我也很好。对周三和周四充满期待。财报季真是太密集了，伙计。这周可能会比上周更忙。当然，Robinhood 的财报在周三发布，那将是非常精彩的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh well, it's always an exciting time. >> Yeah, I'm doing well as uh as well. Um yeah, really excited for Wednesday and Thursday. These earnings are just packed, man. This is going to be the busiest week, probably busier than next or or busier than last week. And uh Robin Hood, of course, is on Wednesday, so that's going to be an exciting one.</p>
</details>

我讨厌 Chime 的财报偏偏要和 Robinhood 在同一天发布。我真想两个都直播，但却不能在同一个小时进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I don't know is that a chime for me. I was gonna stream one or the other, but I thought, hey, you know what? Might as well do Robin Hood. I'm I'm on the earnings call. So, no, I'm kidding. But dude, I hate the fact that Chime has to be on the exact same day. I hate the fact that I want to stream both and I can't do it the same hour. Even if it was five and then the other one was six to seven.</p>
</details>

你是在抱怨因为 Robinhood 的财报日，你没有机会直播 Chime 的财报吗？我没听错吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you are you actually complaining that you don't have the privilege of streaming Chime on the day of Robin Hood? Is that what I'm hearing right now?</p>
</details>

>> 兄弟，我跟你说，我觉得 Chime 的股价会有个上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Bro, I'm telling you, I think there's going to be a pop.</p>
</details>

就算有，难道你对 Chime 财报的期待超过了 Robinhood 吗？我真搞不懂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, no. Even if there is, are you more excited for time earnings than Robin freaking hood? Like, I don't I don't even get that. >> I think there's going to be a pop.</p>
</details>

>> 好吧，Vlad（Robinhood CEO），如果你在听，这个人不配再收到邀请了。反正他也不是美国人，没有 Robinhood 的应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, Vlad, if you're listening, this man doesn't deserve an invite anymore. He's not an American anyway. He doesn't have the the Robin Hood app.</p>
</details>

>> 开个玩笑。我当然对 Hood 的财报很兴奋。不过，我觉得他们每月公布数据的方式，确实减少了一些看财报时的紧张感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Just kidding. >> Exactly. >> I'm excited for Hood. I'm excited for Hood. But um you know, I think the fact that they show all the monthly numbers takes away a little bit of the uh anxiousness of seeing earnings</p>
</details>

>> 不过这次，我们知道的要少得多，这主要是因为他们业务中新增了部分，包括预测市场。而且，市场的期望值也非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> there though. This one, and we'll get into it. It there's a lot less that we know this time just because the nature of the new legs of their business, including the predictions market. So, um, yeah, and the expectations are really high, too.</p>
</details>

### Palantir 的惊人业绩

顺便说一下，在深入讨论 Robinhood 之前，我们能暂停一下，回顾 Palantir 这家公司有多么了不起吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, by the way, before we get into the Robin Hood stuff, can we just pause a moment and reflect on how amazing a Palunteer is as a business?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，Tanner 也听了财报电话会，让他先说说他的看法吧。Tanner，你觉得这个季度怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, I I'll let I'll let Tanner give his thoughts because he was listening to the call as well, but Tanner, what' you think of the quarter?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，简直是完美无瑕。他们是一家疯狂的公司。我不知道自己是否见过任何公司有如此强大的执行力。收入增长超过 63%。**净收入留存率**（Net Dollar Retention: 衡量现有客户收入增长的关键指标）不仅在增长，我认为已经达到了 134%，而且其增长速度在过去六个季度里每个季度都在加快。这太疯狂了，很不正常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, I mean, just nothing shy of like perfection. They they are an insane business. Like I don't know if I've ever seen execution like this from any company. 63 plus percent or something like this for revenue. Net dollar retention is not only growing. I think it got to 134%. But the rate at which it's growing has increased every quarter for like the last six quarters. Like it's crazy. That is not uh normal.</p>
</details>

显然，我仍然认为 Palantir 的公允价值不在 200 美元的区间，但每次看到他们的季度数据，我的估值都会提高。我会想，“哇，我愿意以比上个季度高得多的价格购买这家公司。”这种情况在过去六个季度里连续发生。所以，也许他们真的值 200 美元，但你必须把这个价值折现到未来。是的，他们非常昂贵。但如果非要你做空两家公司，你会选择 Palantir 和英伟达吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I obviously um still don't think the fair value of of Palunteer is in the $200 ranges, but every time I see their their quarterly numbers, it increases. And and I'm like, wow, you know what? I I would buy this company at a much higher price than I would have last quarter. And that that seemed to have happened the last, you know, six quarters in a row. So, so maybe they are worth 200, but you have to kind of discount that out into the future. Yeah, they're they're super expensive. But if you were if you were forced to go short on two companies, would you pick Palunteer and Nvidia to to be short on?</p>
</details>

>> 不，我觉得那是疯了。谁那么做，估计就有胆量做空整个房地产市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh, no. I think that's insanity. Um, and whoever did that was probably brave enough to short the entire housing market. Um, so</p>
</details>

### 迈克尔·贝瑞的 AI 泡沫论

>> 他喜欢下这种赌注。他们说的是贝瑞（Michael Burry），因为他披露了一个**看跌期权头寸**（Put Position: 赋予持有者在未来以特定价格卖出资产的权利，用于押注资产价格下跌）。虽然现在可能已经平仓了，但这是在第三季度披露的。比披露这个头寸更有趣的是，看看贝瑞一小时前在推特上发了什么。他发了一堆图片，显示**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）增长率与 99 年的科技泡沫相当，并指出英伟达和 OpenAI 本质上是在互相送钱。这些基本上是过去几周我们很多人听到的传统看空论点，从他最新的帖子来看，贝瑞完全赞同这些观点。在我们进入 Hood 财报讨论之前，我们可以稍微聊聊这个话题。Roy，总的来说，你对这位最著名的做空者站出来说 AI 是泡沫有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> he uh, >> yeah, I mean, he likes to take these bets. They're talking about Bur because he disclosed a well, it's a put position. Uh, it could have been closed by now, but it was in Q3. But then even more interesting than the disclosure of the put position, look at what Bur's tweeting an hour ago. All these pictures of uh, basically capex growth rates matching tech bubble of 99, Nvidia OpenAI are essentially giving money to each other. I mean, the the sort of conventional bear arguments that a lot of us have been hearing over the past couple weeks, Bur is on board with all those arguments based on his latest post. And uh well, I guess we can a little have a little bit of this conversation right now before we get into hood earnings. Roy, in general, what what are your thoughts on the most infamous short coming out and basically saying AI is a bubble?</p>
</details>

>> 是的。这个论点有两个原因。一个是关于周期性收入的说法，这有点道理。如果 Sam Altman 真的是在欺骗所有人，他所构建的东西不是真的——我对此表示怀疑，因为那家公司受到了很多审视——但如果真是这样，那就会产生多米诺骨牌效应。这不会导致大规模崩盘，但会产生相当大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, there's there's two reasons for that argument. One is a little bit of that cir cyclical revenue which there's a little bit of a merit to that where if if there if like Sam Alman is really scam alman and is ripping everybody off and it's not real what he's building which I doubt um because there's a lot of scrutiny on that company uh but if it is then that's a domino effect now it's not going to cause a massive crash but it will have a pretty big impact.</p>
</details>

很多人试图将现在与 1999 年相提并论，部分原因是价格走势相似。但我们现在的情况完全不同。从本质上讲，看看那些进行资本支出的公司，它们是那些只是在烧钱、没有真实收入或者只有一点点收入、没有任何实际盈利的公司吗？不。这些公司实际上是世界历史上盈利能力最强的公司之一。它们的盈利能力如此之高，以至于可以无限地在资本支出上烧钱而安然无恙。所以，无论从哪个角度看，这都不是互联网泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but uh a lot of people are trying to compare this to 1999 too partly because of the price action And but we have a really different setup here. Like in essence, if you look at the companies that are spending the capex, are these companies that are just burning money and have no real revenue and or just a little bit of one and don't have actually any real earnings? No. These are some of the actually the most wildly profitable companies in entire world history. and they're so ridiculously profitable, they can infinitely burn money on capex and be perfectly fine. So, this is not the.com bubble by any measure.</p>
</details>

此外，科技发展的速度也不同，AI 实现投资回报所需的时间将比当初互联网还是新生事物时要短得多。我们已经在 Palantir 和英伟达的产品以及使用这些产品的公司身上看到了这一点。所以我认为他从各个方面来看都是错的。他正确的地方在于，确实有一些估值昂贵的公司，Palantir 就是其中之一。但说英伟达昂贵，我觉得是忽视了另外一百家比英伟达更贵的公司。老实说，我认为做空英伟达比做空 Palantir 更愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, also the way that tech has ramped, uh, it's going to take a lot less time for AI to really deliver ROI. We've seen it with Palanteer certainly and with Nvidia products and those that are using those products um, than was the case with the internet when it was relatively novel. So, I I think he's just wrong by every measure. What he's right about is there are some expensive names out there. Palanteer is one of them. I I think Nvidia, like calling it expensive, is overlooking probably another hundred companies that you could say that over Nvidia. I think it's I think that's even dumber than Palanteer, honestly.</p>
</details>

如果你想看空，说某些领域存在泡沫，**私募股权**（Private Equity: 投资于非上市公司的基金）领域或许有些道理。但为什么不选择 Quantum 呢？为什么不选择一些和互联网泡沫时期非常相似的、还没有收入的公司呢？这些公司大多只是空有其名。当然，它们不止是名字，也在尝试做一些实事。我不知道是否该相信 Quantum，我个人不会做空它，但这很奇怪。选择两家最令人印象深刻的公司来做空，是的，Palantir 估值很高，但我猜他选择 Palantir 仅仅是因为它估值高，而这是做空某物的最愚蠢的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I don't know a lot more Palanteer than Nvidia. Um, and if you were going to be negative and say that there's a bubble in some of these areas, private equity, there's probably some something to be said on that, but also like why not pick Quantum? you why not pick, you know, some pre-revenue companies that are very similar to what we had in the dotcom bubble uh and that are mostly just names. I mean, they're more than names. They're doing they're trying to do some real things. I don't know whether or not to believe in quantum and I wouldn't short it personally, but I don't know. It's it seems weird to pick two of the most impressive companies and yes, Palanteer is richly valued, but I I am guessing he's picking Palunteer only because it's richly valued, which is the dumbest reason to go short on something.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是鲁莽的。也许他已经平仓了。如果没有，他将承受巨大的痛苦，或者说他至今一直在承受痛苦。他也可能是在赌一个宏观事件，比如他认为市场会有一次回调，而这些股票会跌得更多。但我们至少看到了 Palantir 在四月份的表现，它做得很好。虽然不是特别出色，但比几乎所有多头预期的都要好。所以我认为他目光短浅，我认为他错了，我认为他站错了队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think this is reckless. You know, maybe he's already out. If not, he's in for a lot of pain or he has been so far. You know, he could also time it for maybe it's just a macro event where he's like, "Hey, we're going to have a pullback. These names will pull up more." But we saw at least how Palunteer performed in April, it did a lot. It didn't do great, but it did a lot better than almost any even Bull was expecting it would perform in April. So, I I think he's shortsighted. I think he's wrong, and I think he's off sides.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，整件事看起来有点奇怪。他提前发布了消息，他发了推文——他从不发推文，他会删除所有推文。所以他发了推文，提前 11 天披露了信息。他把所有东西都称为泡沫，他一直在说各种泡沫。所以如果有人认为迈克尔·贝瑞的每个决定都是成功的，那其实恰恰相反。我实际上认为，他的这些做空决策的成功率相当低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, the whole thing seemed a little weird. He published early. Uh he tweeted about He never tweets. He deletes all his tweets. So, he tweeted about it, disclosed it 11 days early. Um he calls everything a bubble. He's been calling multiple bubbles. Uh so if people think that, you know, every decision that Michael Bur has made is a success is actually quite the opposite. I actually think like for the most part his success rate is actually quite low on these short calls.</p>
</details>

他唯一做多的就是中国股票和水资源。想想看，他唯一没称之为泡沫的就是水，这对我来说真是太搞笑了。所以，我不知道，我不再关心迈克尔·贝瑞做什么了。就像你说的，我甚至不介意他做空 Palantir 的部分。也许他是想针对财报做文章，也许他预料到了最坏的情况。但是，英伟达，那真是个有趣的选择。根据其增长情况，它看起来甚至都不那么贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so the only thing that he's been going long on is like Chinese stocks and water. And to, you know, just to think about it, the only thing that he hasn't called a bubble is water is pretty freaking funny to me. So, um, I don't know. I don't really care what Michael Bur does anymore. Um, like you said, I I don't even mind the palunteer part. Maybe he was trying to do this for earnings. Maybe he expected the worst. But, uh, you know, Nvidia, that's a that's an interesting one. Doesn't even look that expensive based on their growth.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，还有一件事，我也很想听听你的看法。关于 Palantir，如果是基于估值，我能理解。我不认为这是一个做空的好理由，但我们看到了，他们的财报简直荒谬。上个季度我说那是我一生中密切关注过的所有公司里最好的财报，然后他们这次又超越了自己。但股价在盘后下跌了。为什么？我们得看看未来几周的情况，但很可能在这一点上，它的定价已经超出了完美。因为，如果你在这样的财报后股价下跌，这并不太令人震惊。我们也看到它在财报前股价上涨，这也是一个因素。所以，也许他在这一点上是对的，但这并不意味着……我不知道，英伟达那个选择就更疯狂了。Emit，你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and one more thing uh init I'd love to hear your thoughts too, but um like the Palunteer one if it's on valuation, you know, I get that. Um I I don't think that that's a great reason to to go short, but like we've seen like those earnings were absolutely ridiculous. Like last quarter I said they were the best earnings of any company I've ever followed closely in my entire life and then they just outdid themselves. Um and the stock fell after hours. Why? Well, we'll have to see, you know, how it shakes out over the next few weeks, but it's pro it's likely priced beyond perfection at this point because, uh, if you fall in those earnings, it's not too shocking. You know, we've we've seen it run up into earnings, too. That's a factor. But, um, so, you know, maybe he's right there, but that doesn't mean I don't know. The Nvidia one's like even crazier. So, Emit, what do you think?</p>
</details>

>> 我同意。我同意你们说的所有话。我们已经反复讨论过为什么我认为 AI 不是泡沫。Palantir 创造了历史上最疯狂的季度之一。我是说，我甚至想不出一个形容词来描述我们看到的那些数字，特别是利润率和营收增长。只是股价已经计入了很多预期。所以我觉得人们因为股价跌破 200 美元而恐慌，但我想说，老兄，上周它还在 170 美元，而 170 美元也是一个相当激进的估值。所以我只是觉得人们在看待这些波动时非常短视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, >> I agree. I agree with everything you guys said. You we've talked at Nauseium about why I think AI is not a bubble. Pounder had one of the craziest quarters in history. I mean like I don't even think there's an adjective to describe that those numbers that we saw especially on the margin profile along with the topline revenue growth. It's just the stock had a lot priced into it. So I think people are freaking out because it's down below 200. I'm like dude it was at 170 last week and 170 is a pretty aggressive valuation too. So it's like I just think people are very short-term in in nature when it comes to these moves.</p>
</details>

我们也在 SoFi 身上看到了同样的情况。尽管季度业绩很好，但股价没有大幅上涨，人们就感到恐慌。但如果你多年来一直投资于这些公司，比如 SoFi、Palantir、Hood、Rocket Lab，这都无所谓。你关心的是执行力。我的意思是，Robinhood 可能会交出一份惊人的季度报告，但股价可能会跌回 130 美元，因为现在 Robinhood 的股价已经计入了很多预期，而且比特币和加密货币市场并不配合。所以，你知道，有一些自然的逆风因素我们会讨论，但这并不意味着这些公司不好或者没有以惊人的水平执行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know same thing we saw with SoFi. People freaked out when it didn't move as much even though it was a great quarter. But if you've been investing in these names, SoFi, Poundinger, Hood, Rocket Lab for years, it doesn't matter. You care about the execution. I mean, Robin Hood might deliver an amazing quarter and that stock might go back down to 130 because there's a lot priced into to Robin Hood right now and Bitcoin and crypto has not been cooperating. So, you know, you have some natural headwinds that we'll talk about, but it doesn't mean those companies are are bad or not executing at a phenomenal level.</p>

### Robinhood 财报数据预测

好了，我们开始吧。Robinhood。我们来做一些财报预测。Tanner 通常会用 Excel 表格记录所有数据。所以，Tanner，我想你可以把表格调出来，我们来逐个过一下数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Robin Hood. Um, we'll do some earnings predictions. Tanner usually keeps track of all the numbers in an Excel sheet. So, Tanner, I think you can bring that up and we'll kind of go through all the numbers. Um,</p>
</details>

>> 华尔街预计营收为 12 亿美元，这将是同比增长超过 50% 或接近 50% 的增长。他们预计**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share）约为 54 美分。我们会深入探讨这些数字，然后比较一下我们的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> sure. >> Streets expecting 1.2 billion of uh topline revenue, which would be uh I think well over 50% year-over-year growth for or just about 50% year-over-year growth. And they're expecting about 54 cents of EPS. So, we'll get into these numbers and then we'll kind of go through what we're thinking.</p>
</details>

>> 我也预测是 12 亿美元。我看到的是同比增长 89%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I also have it at 1.2 billion. Um, I'm seeing 89 uh% year-over-year growth.</p>
</details>

>> 你可能是对的。我可能看错了季度。哦，6.37 亿。是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You're probably You're probably right. I was probably looking at the wrong Q. Oh, 637. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's</p>
</details>

>> 第四季度的比较基数会困难得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it's going to be much harder Q4. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Q4 is >> that's whenever it's going to get pretty freaking hard.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，即便如此，季度环比增长仍接近 22%，达到 12 亿美元。交易收入我预测增长 63%，因为我认为这也包括了预测市场。净利息收入我总是预测得比实际需要的高，但我预测是 3.72 亿美元。其他收入我预测是 7000 万美元。通常从第二季度到第三季度会有所下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh yeah, still 20 nearly 22% quarterover-arter growth, $1.2 billion. Um and then so transactionbased revenue I have growing at 63%. Because I also think that this is uh this includes prediction markets. Uh net interest revenue I'm always higher than where it looks like I need to be. Um but 372 million. And then for other revenue I have 70 million. It's usually uh a drop quarter over quarter from Q2 to Q3.</p>
</details>

我看到的是 12.2 亿美元，每股收益 55 美分，我不知道华尔街的预期是多少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm seeing 1.2 2 million and I don't know if I have um 55 cents of EPS, which I don't even know what the street is at right now. >> 54. Yeah. >> Yeah. Okay. So, I'm I'm I'm right in line.</p>
</details>

>> 我预测总收入是 12.15 亿美元，每股收益 57 美分，因为他们的大部分成本是固定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um so, I have 1215 for total revenue. Um, and yet I have 57 cents for EPS just because of that the way that they um their most of their costs are actually fixed. Um,</p>
</details>

这个季度有很多我们不确定的事情，比如利润率，我认为会表现得很好。Tanner，你对 Trade PMR 和 Bitstamp 的具体预测是多少？因为我可能在那里有偏差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know where I'm a little under yours, but um I guess we could go through like the nitty-gritty, but uh yeah, I mean trying there's a there's this quarter like there's a lot of things that we don't know like margin is one of those things where I think it's going to do very well. Uh and uh I don't know. I have I I really didn't know what to put there. What did you have for trade PMR in Bitstamp specifically, Tanner? Because that might be where I'm off because I</p>
</details>

>> 我没有把 Trade PMR 单独算进去。我只是看总的托管资产。现在它已经包含了 Trade PMR，因为名称改成了总管理资产之类的。然后我稍微降低了费率，因为月底有一次降息。Bitstamp 我是这样算的……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm not including trade PMR. Um might be a, you know, I I don't really know how to look at it too much. I'm just looking at the total assets under custody. >> And so that's inclusive of trade PMR now because it's >> um total assets under administration or whatever it changed to. Uh, and then I lowered the the take rate just slightly because the the rate cut just at the end. Um, and Bitstamp I have at I'll show you what I did.</p>
</details>

>> 我们有九月份的月度交易量数据，所以我相信你也据此做了一些推断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We got the September monthto-day volumes. So, I'm sure you extrapolated a bit of that as well >> for uh Bitstamp. >> Well, for everything.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我是根据已有的天数、总交易日、日均交易量来推断剩余天数的交易量。所以我对九月份的股票交易量预测是 2400 亿，期权合约 2.1817 亿，Robinhood 应用内加密货币交易量 96 亿，Bitstamp 交易量 144 亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so what I did um was monthto date I took the the total days that we saw so far, how many total trading days, the average daily volumes and then just extrapolated out how much there would be for the remaining days. So this is actually my se my September estimate for equity trading volume 240 billion uh options contracts 21817 million uh Robin Hood app crypto 9.6 billion and Bitstamp at 14.4 billion.</p>
</details>

>> 你整体的加密货币费率是多少？我的加密货币名义交易量费率是 0.58%，Bitstamp 我用的是 0.15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What's your overall crypto take rate? Uh my my cryptonotional volume is 0.54 or sorry 0.58 and then uh for Bitstamp I did 0.15. >> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 因为那里有一些消费者交易量，但大部分，大约 80%，是机构交易，费率通常要低得多，大概是十分之一到二十分之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because there's some >> there's some consumer uh volume in there but a lot of it like 80% is um institutional which is usually you know 120th practically one one10enth of of the take rate. So much much lower.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，那么在其他收入里，你预测是 7000 万。你是否包含了 2000 万的预测市场收入？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. And then for others, you have 70. Um, are are you including 20 million of prediction markets in that or</p>
</details>

>> 预测市场我放在了基于交易的收入里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> prediction markets? I put in uh transactionbased revenue. >> Oh, okay. >> Okay.</p>
</details>

>> 根据我假设的总交易量和费率，我得出期权收入 3.05 亿，加密货币收入 2.94 亿（包括 Bitstamp），股票收入 8400 万，然后在其他交易收入中，我计入了预测市场，从 4800 万增长到 8000 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so that is just slightly higher. So if we go down to >> Sorry. Sorry, I'm all over the place. So, so if you take a look at my total um volume and the take rate that I assume, that's how I get to 305 million in options, 294 million in cryptocurrency, which is inclusive of Bitstamp, uh 84 million in equities, and then in other is where I have prediction markets, which went from 48 million to 80 million,</p>
</details>

>> 等等，所以那是你的其他交易收入。好的。

<p class="english-text">which Wait. So, so that Oh, that's in your others transaction revenues. Okay. >> Others transaction revenue. Yeah, >> exactly. >> Yeah,</p>

<p class="english-text">>> it's in it's in others transaction. I just read it. Um other transaction based revenue primarily comprises revenue related to instant withdrawals uh interchange revenue which is offset by rewards and expenses and event contracts.</p>

>> 好的，完美。那么放在交易收入里就说得通了。看，我同意你所有的数据。我不认为这个季度很难预测。真正的问题在于第四季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, perfect. Okay, so that makes sense in transaction revenues then. Yeah, look, I agree with all your numbers. I I don't think this quarter is that hard to figure out. Uh the real question is going to be Q4,</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Um I Well, I had a couple of questions. So, one um Lenny in in my audience asked, "Is he counting staking crypto? Hood takes a percent of staking. Did you increase?"</p>
</details>

>> 没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So, yeah, these are usually the way Tanner does these and and and I'm assuming it's the same way is that these are like pretty conservative. Um >> decently. Yeah. >> And and and then what's unknown is you either extrapolate or you're just like, well, that'll just be gravy on top. So, Right. Right.</p>
</details>

>> 你说预测市场总共带来了多少收入？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and predictions overall, you said you had how much? TW</p>
</details>

>> 我加了大约 2000 万左右。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> uh I added roughly around 20 million, something like that.</p>
</details>

>> 我的是 2500 万，但很接近了。另外，上个季度一个真正的亮点是证券借贷业务，增长非常显著。你有没有单独把它分出来，或者考虑进去了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I was at 25, but yeah, that's that's close. And then uh the other that was a real standout from last quarter um was the securities lending which increased dramatically. Did you break that out or did you accommodate for that? Okay.</p>
</details>

>> 我只看净利息收入，只是用一个百分比来跟踪趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I I only look at uh net interest revenue just just here in terms of taking a percentage and trying to follow that as like a trend.</p>
</details>

>> 我对净利息收入的预测要高一些。我考虑了降息因素，但不知道证券借贷是否是原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> was a good bit higher on net interest income. Um which I I you know accounted for the rate cuts, but I don't know if securities lender was the reason why. Yes,</p>
</details>

>> 利润率对我来说也是一个亮点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> margin also a standout for me.</p>
</details>

>> 这就是我们一直看到的趋势线。我只是假设这个趋势会继续，不作任何剧烈变动，让管理下的资产继续流入平台，并且不对其做任何额外假设。只是一个持续下降的百分比趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This is the sort of the trend line that we've been seeing. And then if I just take this and move this over one, all I'm assuming is that that trend sort of continues, right? >> Um not making any drastic changes and then letting the amount of assets under management just continue to flow onto platform and uh making no additional assumptions about it. Just a continued trend of a lower percentage.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便问一下，你认为本季度会进行股票回购吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so that's what I was going to ask. You didn't think buybacks would happen this quarter?</p>
</details>

>> 不，我认为会回购。但他们在财报中说，他们会回购足够的股票来抵消**股权激励**（SBC: Stock-Based Compensation）的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I do. I do think buybacks are going to happen. Um, but I think it they they said in their earnings that they're going to um buy back enough to >> like flatten stockbased compensation. >> Yeah. Okay.</p>
</details>

>> 所以我不认为他们的股票数量在 2025 年会减少。我只是认为他们希望抵消 SBC。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I don't think that their share count's going to go down in 2025. I just think they're looking to offset >> SBC.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，那么问题来了。财报将会很出色，同比增长 89% 是惊人的。经营杠杆仍然会很棒。所有核心指标都可能向好。问题在于股价。你们怎么看？因为比特币和以太坊在第四季度表现不佳。十月很糟糕，十一月到目前为止也是一场灾难。所以，如果华尔街展望第四季度——他们需要超过 10 亿美元的收入，我认为即使第三季度表现强劲，他们也有办法做到——在你们看来，这足以让股价超过 150 美元的历史高点吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So, then here's the question. Earnings are going to be I look 1.89% year-over-year growth is phenomenal. Operating leverage is still going to be amazing. Um, all the the core metrics are likely going up and to the right. The question is about the stock. What do you guys think? Because Bitcoin and Ethereum are not cooperating in Q4. October was horrendous. November so far is a disaster. Uh, I know it's only three days in, but it's not good. So, if the street's looking forward to Q4, which they're going to have to beat a billion in revenue, and I think there's ways they can, even if they have a massive Q3, is it enough in your opinion to get the stock, you know, above alltime highs at 150?</p>
</details>

>> 要实现这一点，需要几件事同时发生。首先，财报可能需要一个相当不错的超预期表现，这是有可能的。其次，他们可能需要公布十月份的数据，而且这些数据必须看起来比我们预期的要好得多，因为我们知道加密货币业务会很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, they they several things would have to happen. Um, one is probably a pretty nice beat, which is possible. There's there's some numbers that we don't know out there. Um, >> they would I think they would also probably need to release the October numbers and they would have to look a lot better than we expect because we know c- crypto is going to be horrendous.</p>
</details>

除此之外，他们还必须真正地详细说明并分享更多信息，我认为他们绝对会这样做，而且这将比 Vlad 在交易量达到 40 亿时所展示的更能显示出预测市场的增长势头。我认为这可能会激发市场热情，让我们回到历史高点，但我猜我们可能会有一个回调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and coupled with that, you know, they'll have to really break out and share more, which I think that they absolutely will and I think it will show the ramp that's happening in the predictions market more than, you know, what Vlad shut off when they hit the four billion uh mark. Uh, I think that that could excite things and get us back to all-time highs, but yeah, my guess is we probably have a pullback. Um,</p>
</details>

我认为 Robinhood 越来越擅长像 SoFi 那样，当业务的某些部分表现不佳时，他们会专注于其他方面。

<details>

### 深入探讨预测市场

>> 是的，现在体育市场非常强劲。所以对于事件合约，他们一直在推出数百个新合约，确保在大型比赛开始前都覆盖到。我们刚刚看到职业棒球锦标赛、NBA 都带来了巨大的交易量。看看这个，十月份就有 2500 万美元的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And so sports markets are really really strong right now. And so so event contracts, they've been pushing out hundreds of new contracts, making sure that they have all the big games before they happen. Uh we just saw huge volume on these pro baseball championships, uh NBA, all of like look at that. $25 million in revenue in October.</p>
</details>

>> 等等。这个数字是真的吗？你对这些数字的准确性有多大信心？2500 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. >> Is that Hold on. Is that one I know you do a good job uh tracking this, but is that legit? like how confident are you that you're right on those numbers? 25 million.</p>
</details>

>> 我看到的情况是，他非常保守，因为他基本上只采用他能实际看到并推断的数据。他不会考虑人们提前退出合约或者他观察不到的情况，通常只追踪他的主要事件。所以，这听起来可能很激进，但我认为他并不激进。老实说，这可能会对冲第四季度加密货币业务的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, technically it's not that hard to figure it out, right? 2.5 >> and he'll he'll reply, but what I've seen is he's very conservative because he takes basically only what he can actually see and extrapolate. He doesn't accommodate for numbers where people actually exit the contracts early or things that he doesn't observe either and usually just tracks his main event. So, this is a um I don't know, it sounds aggressive, but I don't think that he is. Uh which that could hedge against crypto in Q4 to be honest.</p>
</details>

>> 这太疯狂了，因为我预测整个季度的预测市场收入大约是 2500 万。这是一个非常快的增长速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And and this is insane because you know I I'm predicting and and maybe you're you're higher than me admit but I'm predicting about 25 million from the entire quarter for predictions market previously. >> Yes. >> And this is a fast ramp. Really fast.</p>
</details>

我需要 Hood 对此提供更多明确信息，因为我们需要确认我们看到的交易量是 Robinhood 的交易量。我们能确定吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. I I want some more clarity around this from Hood because we need to confirm that the volume we're seeing is Robin Hood volume. Like, are we sure about that? that when you trade on Rob Nood those</p>
</details>

</details>

>> 预测市场非常酷，对社会也非常有用，可以让你更有意义地参与新闻，更好地预见未来。但不仅如此，预测市场可能实现的核心突破在于，如果你能更好地预测未来，你就在为风险定价。你可以为任何风险定价。我的意思是，现在我们有了一种更好的方法来衡量公司、政府、人类乃至任何事物可能面临的所有这些风险，无论是气候、新冠、健康、经济还是政治。如果你能为风险定价，那么你就能做出关于风险的更好决策。如果你能更好地理解风险，你就能做出关于如何管理风险的更好决策，而且你还可以转移风险，比如进行对冲。我认为这就是机构会进入的地方，市场会变得非常非常大，因为机构面临着未来可能发生的各种他们无法控制的坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Prediction markets are extremely cool and very useful society in terms of like engage with the news more meaningfully and see the future better. But it's not just that like the core unlock that could happen in prediction markets is like if you forecast the future better you are pricing risk like you price any risk and and what I mean by that is like now we have a better way to measure all these risks that could happen to companies to government to humanity to anything whether it's you know climate covid health um the economy all you know politics all these different things and and if you can price risk then you can do make better decisions about risk like if understand the risk better, you can make better decisions about how to manage it and also you can like transfer it like you can hedge and I think that's where the institutions will the market really really becomes very very large because institutions are very exposed to all types of bad things happening in the future they don't have control over</p>
</details>

>> 好的，他之所以在 X 上被嘲笑，是因为他被看作是典型的科技兄弟，谈论着民主化之类的东西。是的，这段视频很容易被拿来取笑和制作成表情包。但其核心是，他说你可以为任何事情创建一个预测市场。如果 Robinhood 在未来五年内这样做，为任何事情创建预测市场，并且这成为机构、对冲基金、投资者等用来下注或为风险定价（即对冲和管理自己的头寸）的方式，那么随着越来越多的事件变得重要，越来越多的人进入这个预测市场生态系统，即使他们不积极交易，只是消费信息，这也将成为他们数十亿美元的业务。在未来五年内的某个时候，其可扩展性很可能成为对冲业务中许多其他周期性部分的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> okay so the reason he got clowned on X is because he was seen as like the typical tech bro who's talking about democratizing yada yada and like like you know yes it's it's a very easy clip to make fun of and make a meme out of but at its core he's saying you can make a prediction market out of anything. If Robin Hood does this over the next five years and just makes prediction markets out of anything and this is the way that institutions, hedge funds, investors, etc. use to to either a bet or b price risk, which means hedge and sort of navigate their own positions. Like the more and more events that become important, the more and more people that enter into this ecosystem of prediction markets, even if they're not actively trading, even if they're just consuming, this is going to be a billion dollar business for them. at some point over the next five years and and and the the scalability of that likely is a hedge against a lot of the other cyclical parts of the business.</p>
</sidetails>

>> 是的，我想我们上周或两周前讨论过一篇关于在 AI 世界里，当你不知道什么是真什么是假时，预测市场价值的策略文章。我认为可能会有操纵行为，尤其是在这个市场变得越来越知名和流行的时候。

And this I think we talked about it last week or maybe two weeks ago strategy article that talked about the merits of the prediction market in the world of AI when you don't know what's real and what's not. Um there there is and there can be manipulation I think especially as this becomes more wellknown and popular.</p>

### 预测市场的操纵风险

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and and and then it comes down to what Brian Armstrong did. Do we want to talk about that? Because that to me was ridiculous.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Let me get the clip right here. >> Uh he basically completely manipulated the uh the the crypto market. This is what he said at the very end of their call as well. on that. Um,</p>
</details>

>> 我有点分心，因为我正在追踪关于 Coinbase 在下次财报电话会议上会说什么的预测市场。我只想在这里补充一下比特币、以太坊、区块链、质押和 Web3 这几个词，以确保我们在电话会议结束前把它们都说出来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call. And I just want to, >> you know, add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking, and web 3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call.</p>
</details>

>> 我知道这听起来很有趣，但我一听到就觉得这是我见过最尬的事情。我不认为 Brian Armstrong 有一些朋友在赌这些词，然后他觉得这是个有趣的笑话。但我立刻想到，天啊，这完全是核心的内幕交易。想想看，虽然 Coinbase 电话会议的那个合约可能不那么受欢迎，Robinhood 的合约上只有不到 2 万美元，但你只让那些赌“是”的人赚钱了。你把所有赌“否”的人都给坑了。

<details>

I don't think Brian Armstrong has like some buddies that you know bet a b on these words and like yeah I think someone literally sent it in the slack as he said and he thought it was a fun joke but immediately my mind goes to oh my goodness this is completely like insider trading at its core think about the tens and I I don't know how popular that contract is for the you know Robin Hood or or for the Coinbase call for example the Robin Hood call has less than $20,000 on it um But you you you only gave money to the people that said yes.

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That was the worst part. That was the worst part.</p>
</details>

>> 也许是因为 Brian 喜欢这些词，比如比特币、以太坊、稳定币，所以他想让投“是”的人赢。但这很奇怪，老兄。我可以想象，不仅仅是在 Robinhood 的财报电话会议上，在任何财报电话会议上，如果你赌的是人们会说什么，监管机构会在什么时候介入？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, and maybe it's cuz Brian liked the words. Like he likes the word Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stablecoin, which is why he wanted to give it to the people who voted yes. But like it's weird, dude. And I I could imagine, forget just on Robin Hood's earnings calls, but any earnings calls if this is what you're betting on, what people say. At what point do the regulators get involved?</p>
</details>

>> 我不喜欢这样，老兄。我真的认为这是一个问题。如果你有一个没有任何道德或伦理的人，处于有影响力的位置，然后他们能够利用这种影响力，就像 Coinbase 的 CEO 一样，这真的让我感到不舒服。我甚至不觉得那是个笑话，他做的方式就让人感觉很恶心。我绝不期望 Vlad 会做那样的事，但如果他做了呢？

<p class="english-text">>> I I I don't like it, dude. I I really do think it's an issue.

Like, I I didn't even think it was a joke. It just felt like icky the way he did it. Um, and I would never expect Vlad to do anything like that, but like what if he did?</p>

### 监管的必要性与市场自净能力

>> 我认为，如果你意识到市场是如此明显地可被操纵，比如“嘿，说个词”，然后你看到像 Brian Armstrong 这样的人只是为了好玩就出来把所有词都说了，那就别跟他们对着干。根本就不需要有这个市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

There doesn't need to be a market.</p>
</details>

>> 不，Tanner，那种逻辑经不起监管框架的推敲，而这个框架是必要的，以确保 Brian Armstrong 或任何 CEO 不会通过让朋友赌某个词然后说出来的方式操纵市场。而且你无法证明 Brian Armstrong 知道他有一群朋友在赌这个词。他可能只是为了好玩而说，但如果存在这种意图，那就是明显的操纵，对吧？那就像他给朋友发短信一样。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> No, Tanner, that that that that that line of logic does not withhold the regulatory framework that should be necessary to make sure that Brian Armstrong or any CEO doesn't manipulate the market by, as Roy said, having some buddies bet on a word and then saying, and you can't prove that Brian Armstrong knows that he has a bunch of buddies betting on this word. He might just say it for the hell of saying it, but if that is, you know, if that intention is there, that's obvious manipulation, right? That's like that's like him texting his friend.</p>

>> 这就像在操纵一个不存在的市场。人们只会停止把钱投入这些东西。就像我说的 Robinhood 那个合约，交易额不到 2 万美元。这不像在你拉高股价之前买入数亿美元的英伟达股票。易手的钱也就几千美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it's manipulation of a non-existing market. >> Like it it people will just stop putting their money in these like like I said with the Robin thing, there's less than $20,000 trading on this thing. This is not like, you know, uh buying up hundreds of millions of dollars of Nvidia stock before you pump it. I mean the the amount of money that's going to trade hands is going to be in the thousands of dollars.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，但这个论点不成立。如果我们期望整个市场能大规模复合增长，最终交易额将远不止 2 万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. But that argument doesn't make sense. If we're expecting this whole market to kager massively, eventually there will be a lot more than $20,000.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，对于重要的事件，比如谁会赢得棒球比赛，谁会赢得下一次选举，因为这些事情更难操纵。至于谁会在财报电话会议上说什么，是的，他们可以移除那些市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Of the important of the important like who is going to win the baseball game, who is like who's going to win the next election because it's going to be much harder to manipulate those types of things. Who's going to say something in an earnings call? I mean, yeah, they can remove those.</p>
</text>
</details>

>> 我同意存在问题。我认为市场会自己解决这个问题，通过不参与那些赌注，因为他们意识到这些赌注会被严重操纵。这就像在玩三张牌的骗局，我们都知道那是骗局，你就会停止玩。那不是一个公平的游戏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I agree there's a problem. I think the market's going to solve it themselves by not by not betting on those because they realize that there's only like like they're going to be so heavily manipulated. It's like it's like playing a game of a threecard monty or something under the parasite tower. Like we all know it's a scam. You stop playing it. It's not a fair game.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为，需要更明确的监管框架。其中之一是，如果你或你认识的人将从你影响预测市场的决定中获得重大利益，那是不允许的。你不能那么做。当然，这很难证明，举证责任应该在 SEC 或其他组织身上。但我担心的是未来的发展方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think and I think we're all probably there. We're just in the same ballpark of there needs to be more regulatory clarity, but also a lot of these things will take care of themselves. >> Yeah. I mean, look, for these $20,000 volume bets, like it probably will take care of it. I just when I saw that from Brian Brian Armstrong, I just like I didn't think it was funny. I thought it was like this guy's just straight up man and if this had anything to do with the actual earnings results you know then the SEC would get involved so but this is the wild wild west so it doesn't matter and there's barely any money being bet you know it's not a stock it's just what he's going to say so I agree with you Tanner the markets probably will solve themselves like I think you have a really good point there that it's so minuscule and stupid in the grand scheme of things that it shouldn't be an issue enough to regulate so I guess the the best of both worlds is if we see a highprofile situation of manipulation maybe then you know we should think about regulatory frameworks, but until then, you know, maybe the markets solve it themselves.</p>

### Robinhood 的其他业务拓展

>> 你们怎么看 Sage 和 Hood 正式合作推出折扣抵押贷款利率？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um what did you guys think about Sage and Hood officially teaming up to uh roll out discounted mortgage rates? Right.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这很有趣。Vlad 的评论中提到，这项服务现在面向 Robinhood Gold 年度会员。我很好奇这是否为未来开创了先例，也许会有更多针对年度会员的福利。但这很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. It was it was interesting like one one of the things like at least Vlad's comments was that this is now uh for Robin Hood Gold annual members and of course you can do monthly subscription or you could do annual as well. I'm kind of curious. I I'm guessing that maybe that's a like hey all the annual guys get it first and then everybody else is on Robin Hood Gold just like two-step roll out. I'm wondering if that kind of sets a precedent for the future and if perhaps there will be perks that are geared towards more towards annual. But yeah, this is nice.</p>
</details>

Vlad 谈论此事时，听起来好像需求巨大。我相信确实有一些需求，但现在房地产市场非常冷淡。所以，如果未来几年市场真正升温，那将非常有趣。此外，可能还会有很多其他优惠，不仅是针对 Sage，也可能针对其他合作伙伴，甚至可能是 SoFi，面向那些被充分了解且富裕的 Robinhood Gold 用户群体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it's I don't the way that Vlad talked about it, it sounded like massive and like huge interest in demand and I'm sure there was some uh but right now the housing market is very cool. So, what'll be very interesting is if we see that really heat up over the next couple of years. Uh, plus there's a lot of other offers that could be out there, not even just for Sage, but other partners, even potentially SoFi towards a very um well understood and affluent Robin Hood Gold cohort.</p>

### 总结与最终展望

>> 好的。所以我们认为财报会很好。预测市场是一个巨大的顺风车，不会消失。很可能没有监管框架会阻止它的增长。这个 Sage 房屋贷款项目长期来看绝对是利好，我认为这进一步推动了他们向银行业进军。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So, the earnings we think are going to be good. Prediction markets, massive tailwind, not going anywhere. uh likely no regulatory frameworks that stop the growth of it. Uh this Sage home loans thing is definitely bullish long term and I think overall it uh it it it further increases their push into banking.</p>
</details>

看，到年底我们还没有看到银行业务的全面推出。一些人已经获得了访问权限，但大多数人还没有。我认为 Robinhood 正在努力确保他们把用户体验做到极致。他们有 2700 万用户，也许他们邀请了几十万人参与试点测试，就像他们为房屋贷款和银行业务所做的那样。但这似乎是 2026 年的一大推动力，就是通过银行业务正式提供真正的金融服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now look, we haven't gotten banking by the end of the year. Uh some people have gotten access to it but most people have not. I think Robin Hood's really trying to make sure they nail the user experience and you know they have 27 million users. Maybe they invited a couple hundred thousand to be in the pilot test just like they did for home loans for banking. But that seems to be the big tailwind for 26 is just officially offering real financial services via banking.</p>
</details>

然后是新加坡，我猜向东南亚的扩张可能会在 2025 年发生。所以你在明年初有银行业务和国际扩张，加上我们在峰会上看到的所有 AI 核心技术。然后你在十二月还有另一个 AI 活动，再加上一个强劲的季度。这是否足以让这只股票突破 150 美元？我想这是我们必须拭目以待的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then Singapore I I guess that expansion to Southeast Asia maybe that's happening in 2025 as well. So you have banking and international expansion towards the beginning of next year along with all the AI core tech stuff we saw at the summit. And then you have another AI event happening in December along with a monster quarter. Is that going to be enough to get this bad boy above 150? I guess that is the question that we have to see.</p>

</details>

>> 老兄，不过这很好。还有另一件事，老兄。我认为我们现在说这个很重要，因为在 Palantir 财报发布前我可能说得不够多，鉴于现在股价低于 200 美元，人们都在恐慌。如果这只股票跌到 130 美元，年初至今只上涨了 254% 而不是 272%，我只希望人们不要恐慌。人们会恐慌，但我希望一个理智的投资者不会因为一只股票上涨了 230% 而恐慌，即使它年初至今曾上涨 170%。是的，如果 Robinhood 跌掉三四十美元，投资组合会受到重创，我理解人们对此感到恐慌的人性。但这是你需要退一步看，说他们今年做得非常出色，Vlad 为股东们执行得非常出色。如果你在这些价位买入，你必须准备好进行**定期定额投资**（DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging）如果市场就是不想给它更高的溢价，这种情况可能会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> dude. Well, here it's nice though. Well, here's the other thing, dude. I think and and this and I think it's it's important we say this right now because maybe I didn't say it enough before Palanteer earnings given you know the stocks below 200 and people are freaking out. If this thing drops to 130 and it's only up 2 uh 54% instead of 272%. I just hope people don't freak out and people are going to freak out but I hope a sane investor doesn't freak out at a stock being up 230% even if it was 170% year-to date which yes portfolios would take a massive hit if you see Robin had lose 30 40 bucks and I get the human nature of freaking out about it but you this is one of those situations where you got to zoom back and say they've crushed it this year Vlad has absolutely executed at a phenomenal level for shareholders and If you're buying at these levels, you have to be ready to DCA if if the market just doesn't want to give it a bigger premium, which could happen.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我认为如果你审视这家公司，那些你在它上涨时喜欢的东西，在财报后开始下跌时并没有改变。Vlad 继续以比任何人都快的速度迭代产品。他们以非常高的成功率迅速进入新的垂直领域。就像我们发现了银行业务、信用卡或预测市场一样，未来还会有新的业务。会有我们甚至没有想到的新领域，他们会进入，这将把我们带过 200 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I I think if you're to look at this business, like the things that you loved on the way up haven't changed if it starts to go down after earnings. Like Vlad continues to iterate on the product faster than anyone else. they enter new verticals with high success rates very very quickly and and just like we found banking or the credit card or uh prediction markets there's going to be new ones. You know there's there's going to be ones we haven't even thought of that they will enter that's going to bring us past $200.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yep. Yep. >> But yeah, we've seen them continuously expand their TAM and there's a lot of known vectors where they are expanding and they will expand and a lot of those are international which still very much United States play but it's in the early innings in international and it's over the next few years really going to to ramp up. um what you know and we'll have bare markets and uh crypto winters where it doesn't perform that well but that's okay.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> A minus. There's a couple of metrics that uh could have been a bit better in my opinion, but everything I wanted to see from them I saw. And so Tanner just hates Grab, which is why he he he rolled his eyes right now. But</p>
</details>

>> 不，我只是觉得任何带 A 的评分都太疯狂了。那是我见过最平庸的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> no, I just Anything with an A in front of it is crazy. That was the most mid- earnings I've ever seen. But uh</p>
</details>

>> 为什么？首先，Tanner，我听你在直播里说，“什么是 group MTU？”你不能说财报平庸，却连**月度交易用户**（MTU: Monthly Transacting Users）代表什么都不知道。你不了解这个业务，这没关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> why why was it? First of all, Tanner, you I was listening to you on the stream. You were like, "What's a group MTU?" You can't say it's a mid- earnings and you don't even know what the MTU stands for. You don't understand the business, which is okay. But</p>
</details>

>> 这不是一个那么难懂的业务。它就是一个金融科技公司和 Uber 的结合体。他们没有创造新东西。

</details>

>> 我不完全了解这个业务，但我知道营收增长 17% 是什么水平，而你却要为此支付相当高的溢价。你可以去投资 New Bank 或 DLocal，找到 40-50% 以上的营收增长和更好的利润率。这有什么好兴奋的？你为什么不直接去买 Uber？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't I don't fully understand the business, but I understand what 17% topline growth is whenever you're paying a decent premium. Like there's there's companies you can go pay for for for New Bank or DLO and find 40 50 plus% topline growth and better margins. You how exciting what why don't you just go and buy Uber?</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Well, hold on. How does Grab underwrite what is their competitive advantage?</p>
</details>

>> 不，不，但好吧，这是我的问题。你不能说大部分收入增长或业务增长来自贷款发放，然后说任何人都可以放贷，因为在没有实际分析业务、听财报电话会议、讨论 Grab 作为一家金融科技公司拥有的、东南亚其他所有银行都没有的数百个不同变量的情况下，就说放钱出去超级容易。这就是为什么他们的信贷损失准备金控制得很好，并且能够将贷款规模扩大到十亿美元的年化运行率，因为他们知道商家的收入，知道司机的收入，知道他们的月度交易情况，他们的网络效应中有变量，实际上允许他们进行承销，并向三分之一的人口提供贷款，这些人去东南亚的银行会被嘲笑。给一个每月赚 500 美元的司机贷款？Grab 可以给那个人贷款，因为他们实际上知道他们能收回钱。所以当你说任何人都可以放贷，却不看东南亚作为商业环境的复杂性或 Grab 在承销方面的网络效应，然后说财报平庸……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, no, but Okay, so this is my problem. You cannot say the majority of the revenue growth or the majority of the growth in the business came from the loan dispersals and then say anyone can just give out loans because it's super easy to just give out money without actually analyzing the business and listening to the earnings call and talk about the hundred different variables that grab as a fintech has that every other bank in Southeast Asia doesn't have in order to underwrite which is why they are well within their credit loss provisions and are able to scale to a billion uh dollars on their loan run rate right 3.5 billion on a a TTM basis. because they know their uh merchants's revenue, they know their drivers income, they know their monthly transactions, they have variables in their network effect that are actually allowing them to underwrite and give people onethird of the population that don't that they go to a bank in Southeast Asia, they would laugh at them to give a driver who's making $500 a month a loan. It's like no, a grab can give that person a loan because they actually know they're going to get paid back. So when you say anyone can give out loans and then don't look at the intricacies or the nuances of Southeast Asia as a business and grabs network effect in being able to underwrite and then say the earnings are mid.</p>
