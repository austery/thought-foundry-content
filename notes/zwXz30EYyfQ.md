title: Radical AI：用AI重塑科学发现，告别低垂果实
---

### AI的真正潜力：追求新颖发现

人工智能（AI: Artificial Intelligence）如此不可思议，这项技术将改变世界。我不明白的是，为什么每个人都在摘取低垂的果实，解决一些小问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI is so incredible; this technology is going to change the world. What I don't understand is why everyone is picking low-hanging fruit and solving small problems.</p>
</details>

我们看到许多人工智能公司专注于软件或普通的**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）业务。为什么没有人利用人工智能来治愈癌症呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We saw a bunch of AI companies in software or normal SaaS-based businesses. Why is no one using AI to cure cancer?</p>
</details>

我们正试图颠覆材料领域中一些最大公司沿袭了150年的旧有流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are trying to disrupt the 150-year-old process with some of the biggest companies today in materials.</p>
</details>

我们希望重塑科学研究的方式。我们不满足于在现有系统中实现百分之一、二或五的改进；真正极具挑战性的是**新颖发现**（Novel Discovery: 指前所未有的、突破性的科学发现）。最重要的领域往往是最具挑战性的，我认为这些才是人们应该努力的方向，因为如果成功，你将从根本上重塑人类的发展轨迹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We want to reinvent the way we do the scientific process. We don't struggle with driving one, two, or five percent improvements in a current system; what is incredibly challenging is novel discovery. The most important areas are the most challenging, and I think those are the things people should work on because if you succeed, you will fundamentally reshape human trajectory.</p>
</details>

我们在**Radical AI**（一家致力于利用人工智能进行科学发现的公司）招聘的每一个人，我们都会问同样的问题：“如果你只是在找一份工作，这里不适合你。你非常聪明，可以在其他地方找到工作。但如果你在寻找一项使命，那么你就应该来这里工作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every single person that we hire into Radical AI, we ask the same question: 'If you are looking for a job, this is not the place for you. You're incredibly intelligent; you can go get employed other places. If you are looking for a mission, then you should come work here.'</p>
</details>

我是Joseph Krauss，Radical AI的联合创始人兼首席执行官。在Radical AI，我们正在构建用于科学发现的**人工通用智能**（Artificial General Intelligence, AGI: 指具备人类智能水平，能执行任何智力任务的AI），并从**材料科学**（Material Science: 研究材料的组成、结构、性能及其相互关系的学科）领域开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My name is Joseph Krauss, and I'm the co-founder and CEO of Radical AI. At Radical AI, we are building artificial general intelligence for scientific discovery, starting in material science.</p>
</details>

今天的材料发现过程极具挑战性。材料领域的研发过程耗时极长，通常需要十年以上。我们的人工智能代理将索引数百万篇科学出版物，并了解某个领域已经完成了哪些工作。因此，与人类科学家相比，这个过程可以以惊人的速度进行，大约是我们今天人类科学家操作速度的370倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The material discovery process is challenging today. Processes in materials just take an incredibly long time, typically 10-plus years. Our AI agents will index millions of scientific publications and learn what a field has done already. This process can happen at an incredible speed compared to a human scientist, operating at about 370 times the speed we operate as a human scientist today.</p>
</details>

### 个人成长与使命驱动

我一直被教导并真心希望像我父亲一样，追求那些我自认为在世界上最擅长且真正热爱的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just always was taught and really wanted to be like my dad in pursuing something that I knew I was the best in the world at and that I truly love to do.</p>
</details>

我的父亲总是灌输我一个观念，那就是不仅仅要对你所做的事情感到快乐，更要全身心地投入其中。找到你能在世界上比任何人都做得更好的事情，我在哪里能产生影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My father, he always instilled that not just about being happy about what you're doing, but much more engaged in what you're doing. Find the thing that you can be better at anyone else in the world in. Where can I make an impact?</p>
</details>

这对我来说一直是指引我该做什么以及如何做的明灯。所以，当我还是本科生时，我偶然遇到了一位在国民警卫队兼职服役的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That for me has always been this guiding light into what I want to do and how I want to do it. And so when I was an undergraduate, I actually bumped into someone who was serving part-time in the National Guard.</p>
</details>

我真的很想去美国的军事院校，它们声望极高，你有机会报效国家。所以我认为这会适合我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really wanted to go to a military academy in the United States. They're incredibly prestigious. You have the opportunity to serve the country. So I thought that this would be for me.</p>
</details>

**美国国民警卫队**（US National Guard: 美国武装部队的预备役组成部分，由各州管理，可在联邦需要时动员）是陆军和空军的预备役部队。你基本上每个月参加一个周末的训练，夏天再进行两周的训练，以确保你的军事训练符合要求，并应对可能被部署到战区的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the US National Guard is a reserve component both of the Army and the Air Force. You pretty much go to drill one weekend a month and then you do two weeks in the summer of training to actually make sure you're up to code with your military training. and if you ever get deployed down range.</p>
</details>

当时我想，这太棒了！我既可以继续学习，也可以在业余时间服兵役，我是这样看待的。所以，我在大学三年级时入伍了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was like, well, this is amazing. I can continue to study, but I can also serve in the military in my free time is the way I looked at it. So, I enlisted in the military my junior year of college.</p>
</details>

基础训练是一次很棒的经历，对吧？因为你和一群从未谋面的人在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basic training is an amazing experience, right? Because you're with a bunch of people you've never met in your life.</p>
</details>

我遇到了来自各行各业的人，有来自纽约、宾夕法尼亚、佐治亚、缅因州以及东海岸到中西部或西部各州，甚至远至加利福尼亚，有来自圣地亚哥或硅谷的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meeting people from so many different walks of life. I met people from New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maine, and the East Coast through to the Midwestern or or or western states all the way through to California coming from San Diego or Silicon Valley.</p>
</details>

每个人都怀着相同的使命：他们为了同一个目标，即建立一支更强大的军队，以保护和捍卫美国希望在全球传播的自由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And everyone was there for the same mission. They were there for the same goal of building a stronger military to protect and defend the freedoms that America likes to propagate throughout the world.</p>
</details>

这不仅鼓舞人心，也是我第一次被迫将自己置于次要地位，把团队的使命——我当时服役的炮兵连——放在个人之前。那是一次极富洞察力的教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was not only inspirational but was the first time I was forced to remove myself from the equation and put the mission of the team which was the battery that I was serving in before yourself. And that was an incredibly insightful lesson.</p>
</details>

所以，我参加了基础训练，然后回来完成了大四学业，之后又去参加了训练，才开始在**莱斯大学**（Rice University: 位于美国德克萨斯州休斯顿的一所私立研究型大学）读研究生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so went away to basic training and then came back and finished my senior year and then went away to training again before starting graduate school at Rice.</p>
</details>

选择莱斯大学有一个具体的原因。我参加了一个本科生研究研讨会，并在会上展示了我的工作并赢得了该研讨会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for Rice there were one specific reasons. I had went to this undergraduate research symposium which I presented my work on and I won that symposium.</p>
</details>

在赢得研讨会最佳演示后，我有机会与该项目中的研究生和教授们坐下来，询问他们的研究和工作。其中有一个共同的主题：他们都在研究可能产生巨大影响的问题，是他们试图在某个时候实现转化的实际事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in winning the symposium the best presentation I got to sit with a bunch of both graduate students and professors inside the program and ask them about their research and what they were working on and there was a concurrent theme through that. They were all working on problems that could have a big impact, actual things that they were trying to transition at one point or another.</p>
</details>

我在考虑去哪里上学时面试了很多研究生项目，但没有一个像我在莱斯大学遇到教职员工和学生时那样，对未来以及他们试图构建的东西有如此强烈的专注感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I interviewed at a lot of graduate programs when I was thinking about where to go to school and none had felt as strong as I did when I met the faculty and students at Rice and this kind of focus on the future and what they were trying to build.</p>
</details>

所以，我同时在读研究生和服兵役，但我不知道研究生毕业后想做什么。我不知道是否想成为一名专业的科学家。我曾考虑过法律、专利法等领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I was doing them concurrently in graduate school and in the military at the same time, but I didn't know what I wanted to do after graduate school. I didn't know if I wanted to be a professional scientist. I had thought about fields like law, patent law.</p>
</details>

因此，在研究生期间，我深入研究了自己能在哪里产生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in graduate school, I did this deep dive in understanding where could I make an impact.</p>
</details>

### 从基础研究到商业化：创业的萌芽

我在国民警卫队服役期间，同时也在**陆军研究实验室**（Army Research Lab: 美国陆军的官方研究机构，专注于基础科学和应用研究）担任科学家。这是一个由美国陆军拥有的企业研究实验室，许多科学家在此工作，试图将新颖研究推向更高的**技术成熟度等级**（Technology Readiness Levels, TRL: 用于评估技术发展阶段的指标），或使这些科学对陆军更具实用性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While I was serving in the National Guard, I was also not together a scientist at the Army Research Lab. It is this corporate research lab that the US Army has a bunch of scientists working in to try to push novel research up to higher technology readiness levels or or make that science more approachable for the army.</p>
</details>

以前，指挥官们会来参观设施，我们必须向他们解释我们正在做的工作与陆军的相关性。但他们所认为的相关性与我们不同。他们考虑的是未来的冲突，如何增强部队或使其更强大。我们则在思考电子和氢原子，思考如何为不同的技术制造新型二维材料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We used to have these commanders who would come through and tour the facility. We would have to tell them why the work we were doing was relevant to the army and their relevance was not the same relevance to us. They were thinking about future conflict about how to bolster the force or make it stronger. We were thinking around electrons and and hydrogen atoms and thinking about making new novel 2D materials for different technologies.</p>
</details>

因此，陆军领导层与我们所推动的科学视角之间存在脱节。有一天，我必须解释我们在实验室所做的工作最终将如何影响未来的战争或陆军可能想使用的未来技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there was this disconnect between leadership at the army and the scientific perspective that we were driving. And there was this day where I had to actually explain why what we were doing in the lab could eventually impact future of warfare or future technology that the army would want to use.</p>
</details>

那时我意识到，这正是我想要做的事情。我希望从推动我们对科学理解的基础研究领域，转向真正将科学商业化，将科学转化为能够产生影响的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's when I realized that that is exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to transition from this fundamental area of research driving our understanding of science to actually commercialize science. Science that could actually go into products and make a difference.</p>
</details>

那时，事情开始明朗起来：真正做到这一点的唯一方法是以新颖的方式推动技术发展，在这种情况下，初创公司在我看来是今天最好的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was where things started to come together that the only way to really do this is to actually push technology in a novel way in which case startups are the best in my opinion the best place to do that today.</p>
</details>

好的，我知道有一天我想创办一家公司，但我不知道如何创办。所以我告诉自己，让我找到过去创办过公司，现在又投资未来公司的企业家和投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I know one day I want to build a company, but I have no idea how to build it. And so I said, let me find entrepreneurs and investors who have built a company in the past and now are investing in the companies of of the future.</p>
</details>

于是，我寻找了许多风险投资家和企业家，我真的很想在纽约。实际上，我将搜索范围限定在纽约，然后我遇到了**Kevin Ryan**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I looked up a bunch of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and really wanted to be in New York. Actually, I I tailored my searchs to New York and I bumped into Kevin Ryan.</p>
</details>

Kevin Ryan是纽约市一位多产的企业家。他创立并运营了**Doubleclick**（一家数字营销公司，后被Google收购），并将其成功上市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kevin Ryan is a prolific entrepreneur in New York City. He built and ran doubleclick before taking that company public.</p>
</details>

之后，他离开了Doubleclick，创办了**Ali Corp**（一家集孵化工作室和早期投资公司于一体的机构）。当我与Kevin交谈时，我告诉他：“如果你不投资材料领域，你就不会投资未来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he came out of that and started Ali Corp, which is both an incubation studio as well as an early stage investment firm. And when I talked to Kevin, I had told him, if you're not investing in materials, you're not going to invest in the future.</p>
</details>

他说：“这是一个很大的赌注。你为什么不来证明一下呢？”于是，我请了假，一周后搬到纽约，开始了为期六个月的实习，看看这是否适合我，是否是我的职业道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he said, "That's a big that's a big bet. Why don't you come prove that out?" And so I took a leave of absence. I moved to New York a week later, and I had a six-month internship to see if this was the field for me, if this was the career for me.</p>
</details>

Kevin在我职业生涯早期就教导我，你必须有**行动偏见**（Bias to Action: 指倾向于立即采取行动而非长时间规划或分析），并把事情办好。战略可能有效，但大多数时候也会导致没有行动的死胡同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kevin had taught me early part of my career that you have to have a bias to action and just get things done. Strategy can be effective but most of the time will also lead to a dead end with no action involved.</p>
</details>

最优秀的企业家都有极强的行动偏见。他们只是把事情办好，并在此过程中看着结果在他们面前展开，然后他们继续推进他们的进程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The best entrepreneurs have an immense bias to action. They just get things done and in doing so watch the results unfold in front of them as they do that and then they continue to go to go through their process.</p>
</details>

初创公司已经够难了，让它们变得更容易的方法是：比你所在领域的任何人都做得更多，拥有比你所在领域的任何人都更多的信息，并提出一个没有人能想到的论点。这才是真正能创造价值的东西，我认为行动偏见是我从他那里学到的最重要的一课。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Startups are already hard enough and the way to make them easier is to do more than anyone in your space will do with more information than anyone in your space has with a thesis that no one else has been able to come up with. That is truly what can drive good value and I think a bias to action is the most important lesson I've learned from him.</p>
</details>

### Radical AI的诞生与愿景

我和我的另一位联合创始人**Jorge**都在Ali Corp担任投资者。Jorge像所有优秀的投资者一样，也在研究人工智能技术，但他是从一个非常基础的层面进行研究。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of my other co-founders and I were both investors at at Ali Corp and Jorge was looking into AI technology as every good investor was, but really at a fundamental level.</p>
</details>

他阅读了关于新型架构和机器学习新方法的出版物，以及这项技术的真正影响。有一天他来到我身边，我们坐在办公室里，他说：“你知道，人工智能太不可思议了。我真的相信这项技术将改变世界。我不明白的是，为什么每个人都在摘取低垂的果实，解决一些小问题。为什么没有人用人工智能来治愈癌症？”这是他问我的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was reading the publications coming out on novel architectures and novel approaches to machine learning and really what the impact of the technology was. and he came over to me one day. We sat next to each other in the office and said, "You know, AI is so incredible. I am actually convinced this technology is going to change the world. What I don't understand is why everyone is picking lowhanging fruit and solving small problems. Why is no one using AI to cure cancer?" was the question he asked me.</p>
</details>

我说：“嗯，我不知道治愈癌症的事，但这确实是一个很好的机会。”于是，我们花了一个半月的时间阅读了数百篇关于我们认为人工智能可以应用的各个领域的研究论文。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and I said, "Well, I don't know about curing cancer, but that's a really good opportunity." And so we spent the next month and a half reading hundreds of research papers on all the different fields that we think AI could be put into.</p>
</details>

最终，我恍然大悟：材料科学领域存在碎片化、进展缓慢、短期内缺乏突破等问题。这可能是一个非常适合人工智能应用的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally it dawned on me that well material science problems with fragmentation, slowmoving ability, you know, lack of progress over short timelines. This might be a great area for AI to be implemented in.</p>
</details>

于是，我们又进行了一次深入研究，阅读了所有能找到的关于材料科学、人工智能以及后来发现的机器人技术交叉领域的出版物。这让我们找到了第三位联合创始人**Herd Cedar**，他曾在**劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室**（Lawrence Berkeley National Lab: 美国能源部下属的国家实验室，以科学研究闻名）建立了一个自主科学实验室。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we took another deep dive and we read every publication we could find at the intersection of material science, AI, and as we found out, robotics. And that led us to our third co-founder, Herd Cedar, who had built an autonomous scientific lab at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.</p>
</details>

我们三人与他一起，真正看到了并提出了科学将如何发展、人工智能和自主技术将如何构建科学发现新范式的愿景，将我们从人类驱动的流程转向人工智能和自主驱动的流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And together with him, us three really saw and came up with this vision for where science is going to go, where AI and autonomy are going to build a new paradigm of scientific discovery, driving us from a human-driven to an AI and autonomydriven process.</p>
</details>

我们都一致认为，无论我们是否创办Radical AI，科学都将朝着这个方向发展。而且，必须由我们来创办这家公司。于是，我们三人都同意了，这就是Radical AI的成立故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we were all aligned that whether we started Radical AI or not, this is the way science was going to go. And it had to be us who were going to build this company. And so all three of us agreed and that was the formation story for radical AI.</p>
</details>

最重要的领域是最具挑战性的。我认为这些才是人们应该努力的方向。如果你看看今天的技术，我们Radical AI并不纠结于我们所说的优化问题，即在现有系统中实现百分之一、二或五的改进。我们实际上很擅长这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important areas are the most challenging. I think those are the things people should work on. I think if you look at technology today, we don't struggle with what we call optimization problems at Radical AI, driving one, two, or 5% improvements in a current system. We're actually quite good at that.</p>
</details>

真正极具挑战性的是新颖发现。而这正是大多数难题所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is incredibly challenging is novel discovery. And that's where most hard problems lie.</p>
</details>

当我们三人想要组建公司并创办Radical AI时，我们有一个观点：如果你想影响世界上最重要的行业，如汽车和航空航天、制造业和国防、气候能源、半导体，所有这些都直接源于材料研发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when us three wanted to form the company and we're going to build radical AI, we had this opinion that if you want to impact the most important industries in the world, automotive and aerospace, manufacturing and defense, climate energy, semiconductors, all of them are a direct result from materials R&D.</p>
</details>

但这些材料领域的研发过程耗时极长，通常需要十年以上，并且从新颖发现到规模化材料系统需要极其高昂的成本。而这正是我们可以产生巨大影响的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But these processes in materials just take an incredibly long time, typically 10 plus years and an exorbitant amount of cost to go from a novel discovery to a scale material system. And this was the exact place that we could make a massive impact.</p>
</details>

我们认为人工智能和自主技术将推动这一过程的变革，并在此过程中，能够真正解锁并消除材料作为我们一些最重要行业的最大障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We think AI and autonomy are going to drive change in the process and in doing so can actually unlock and remove materials as our biggest barrier to some of our most important industries.</p>
</details>

我认为，如果你认同这个使命，那么你想要解决的问题自然会很难，因为如果成功，你将从根本上重塑人类的发展轨迹。这是一件极具影响力的事情，对世界的未来也极其重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think if you are aligned on that mission, then the problems that you want to solve are naturally going to be hard because if you succeed, you will fundamentally reshape human trajectory. And that is an incredibly impactful thing to be able to do and also incredibly important to the future of the world.</p>
</details>

### 融资与人工智能的独特优势

我们将离开Ali Corp，当然会筹集资金来创办公司。正如我提到的，Ali Corp喜欢孵化公司，我们正在Ali Corp的保护伞下孵化这家公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to leave Ali Corp and we're going to raise money of course to start the company and Ali Corp as I mentioned likes to incubate companies and we were incubating this company inside the Ali Corp umbrella.</p>
</details>

所以我们知道Kevin告诉我们，他们将在这种孵化环境下投入一些资金，然后我们将从那里发展。我们知道我们需要大量资金。材料科学是一个难以建立业务的领域，我们正在构建一个全栈解决方案，这需要大量资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we knew Kevin had told us they are going to put some money in in this incubation setting and then we'll roll out from there and we knew we needed a lot of capital. Material science is a hard business to build in and we are building a full stack solution which requires a lot of capital.</p>
</details>

所以我们知道我们想要筹集一笔相当大的种子轮资金。于是我们找到Kevin说：“看，我们要创办这家公司。”我们准备了一份长达100页的演示文稿，解释了为什么我们认为现在是机会，今天的技术状况如何，以及为什么跨学科方法对解决问题至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we knew we wanted to raise a fairly large preede round and so we went to Kevin and said look we're going to we're going to start this company put together a whole 100page pitch deck on why we think the opportunity is now where the technology is today why interdisiplinary approach is incredibly important to solving the problem.</p>
</details>

人工智能在这个领域如此有影响力的原因是其索引信息的能力。我们总是喜欢举的最好例子是**AlphaGo**（由Google DeepMind开发的人工智能围棋程序）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason AI is so impactful in this space is its ability to index information. The best example that we always like to give is Alph Go. It was this AI that was built by the Google team and it played the best player in the world, a game of Go.</p>
</details>

这个故事最精彩的部分是它下出了一步臭名昭著的棋，当时所有观看的人都认为人工智能犯了一个错误，但实际上，它已经索引了如此多的围棋对局，它下出了一步人类大脑从未想过的棋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the best part of the story is this infamous move it makes where everyone watching thinks the AI makes a mistake and in reality it has indexed so many games of Go. It made a move the human brain has never thought of before.</p>
</details>

当我们把这一点带入科学领域时，我们科学中的所有局限都来自于人类大脑。我们能阅读多少论文？我们能模拟多少事物？我们能进行多少实验？然后我们如何将所有这些联系起来，就我们想要构建的东西提出新的假设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when we take that to science, all of our limitations in science come from the human brain. How many papers can we read? How many things can we simulate? how many experiments can we run and then how do we tie all those together to make a new hypothesis on what we want to build.</p>
</details>

但如果你将人工智能和自主技术置于其中心，你就能解决人类科学家所感受到的这种索引问题。你可以阅读数百万篇出版物，模拟数十亿种材料，并测试数千种，实时连接所有这些信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you bring AI and autonomy to the center of that, you unlock this indexing problem that a human scientist feels. You can read millions of publications, simulate billions of materials and test thousands of them connecting all this information in real time.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你能做到这一点，我们认为我们真正能构建的世界是一个我们称之为**逆向设计**（Inversely Designed: 指从所需性能或功能出发，反向推导出材料或系统的设计）的世界。我们不再是先制造材料，然后寻找解决方案。我们实际上是解决最困难的问题，并从中逆向设计材料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if you can do that, the world that we think we can really build is one that is what we call inversely designed where we are no longer making materials and then looking for a solution to solve.

人类科学家今天无法做到这一点，或者即使能做到，也需要非常非常长的时间，而人工智能和自主技术可以以极快的速度和极高的效率做到这一点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And human scientists can't do that today or if they can can do so in only very very long time frames whereas AI and autonomy can do that incredibly fast and incredibly efficient.</p>
</details>

我们实际上认为人工智能所能做的不是取代科学家，而是为他们提供工具和能力，让他们能够跨越多种不同的实验过程进行索引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we actually think AI can do is not replace that scientist but rather give them the tools and the capabilities to index across a multitude of different experimental processes.</p>
</details>

这样他们就能把时间花在思考下一步要制造什么材料或解决什么问题上，而不是进行基础研究的单调过程。这正是我们看到人工智能对科学的影响，以及我们如何构建科学过程的未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they are spending their time thinking around what next material to build or what next problem to solve and not on going through the monotonous process of fundamental research. That is really where we see the impact on AI for science and how we are building the future of the scientific process.</p>

值得称赞的是，Kevin说：“你不会在其他任何地方筹到钱。我愿意全部给你。”所以他是唯一的投资者。我们在大约45分钟内完成了种子轮融资，这很棒。

<p class="english-text">And to Kevin's credit he said you're not going to raise money anywhere else. I want to give you all of it. And so he was the only investor. We raised our preede round in about 45 minutes uh which was great.</p>

### Radical AI的文化与“51%决策法则”

我们对公司内部的文化充满热情。我们招聘到Radical AI的每一个人，我们都会问同样的问题：“如果你只是在找一份工作，这里不适合你。你非常聪明，可以在其他地方找到工作。但如果你在寻找一项使命，那么你就应该来这里工作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are incredibly passionate about the culture that we build at the company. Every single person that we hire into Radical AI, we ask the same question. If you are looking for a job, this is not the place for you. You're incredibly intelligent. You can go get employed other places. If you are looking for a mission then you should come work here.</p>
</details>

每个来到Radical AI的人都深深地相信我们正在追求的使命。我们保持这种一致性的方式是通过文化。我们从不害怕失败。我们知道失败是发现和学习过程的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every person that comes to radical AI deeply deeply believes in the mission that we are going after. And the way that we keep that alignment is through culture. We are never afraid to fail. We actually know failure is a part of the discovery and learning process.</p>
</details>

因此，我们将积极、不懈地推动技术发展，从**第一性原理**（First Principles: 指最基本的假设或事实，不能再被简化或从其他事物中推导出来）重新思考，并建立一个能够真正发现新材料的互联系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we will push aggressively, relentlessly to drive technology to rethink from first principles and to build a connected system that can truly discover novel materials.</p>
</details>

所以我们在公司早期就采纳了一个规则，我相信**SpaceX**（美国一家航空航天制造商和空间运输服务公司）首先采用了它，叫做“**51%决策法则**”（51% Rule: 指当对一个决策有51%的信心时就应立即做出决策，以避免不必要的拖延）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we adopted a rule very in the company. I believe SpaceX started it called the 51% rule where when you are at 51% confidence on a decision, you just make that decision.</p>
</details>

原因在于，如果你对可以快速决定的事情进行辩论，并观察该决定的结果，实际上会浪费更多时间，降低整个公司的效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason why is you will actually cause more time and less efficacy across the company by debating on decisions that you could otherwise quickly decide on and see what the result of that decision is going to be.</p>
</details>

谈到51%法则，我们考虑两件不同的事情：首先，这个决策有多大；其次，如果决策错误，风险是什么。这两者结合起来，能让我们识别何时达到了51%的信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When it comes to 51% two different things that we think about first how big is the decision and second what are the risks if the decision is wrong and those two together allow us to actually identify when we are at 51% or not.</p>
</details>

当然，我们会进行大量研究，进行大量对话和辩论，以达到51%的置信区间。但如果这是一个日常决策，例如，它不是决定一年或十年的重大决策，那么我们就可以有信心快速做出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, we do a bunch of research and have a bunch of conversations and debate around getting to that confidence interval of 51%. But when it is a decision in dayto-day, for example, it's not year defining or or really decade defining and what we're trying to go after. Well, then we can have confidence to make it quickly.</p>
</details>

当我们思考该决策的另一面时，最坏的情况是什么？这通常会提醒你，你已经达到了51%，或者你离51%还很远。这是一个很好的检查点，我们问自己和公司里的每个人，并不断推动快速而有效的决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when we think about what the other side of that decision is, what is the worst case scenario that happens that usually alerts you to you are already at 51% or you are nowhere near 51%. And that is a great checkpoint that we ask ourselves and everyone in the company and constantly pushing towards uh getting getting at quick decision-m but effective decision-m as well.</p>
</details>

51%法则不仅仅是为了快速决策而快速决策。51%法则是在你已经打算做出的决策上，只是更早地做出，然后处理并非总是100%正确的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, 51% is not about just making decisions fast for fast sake. 51% is making decisions that you are already going to make, just making them earlier and then dealing with the effect of not always being 100% correct.</p>
</details>

因为无论你思考一个决策两周还是两年，仍然有可能你不会是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because no matter if you think about a decision for 2 weeks or 2 years, there's still a likelihood that you're not going to be correct.</p>
</details>

由于我们以这种方式运营公司，失败是内在的。如果你来Radical AI工作，你所做的事情中会自动包含失败。我们不认为某个人失败了，或者一个项目失败了。我们将其视为学习和重新创建我们刚刚认为应该构建的过程的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And because we operate the company that way, failure is inherent. You will automatically fail if you come work at Radical AI in something that you do. We don't view someone as failing or a project as failing. We view it as learning and an opportunity to recreate the process that we just thought that we should build.</p>
</details>

所以对我们来说，我实际上认为我们更深入地探讨了“为什么”和“第一性原理”的本质。我们不把事情看作失败。尝试不奏效的事情，从中学习，然后再次尝试，这在Radical AI是正常的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so for us, I actually think we go deeper into the essence of asking why and first principles. And we don't view things as failure. It is just normal to try things that don't work, learn from them, and try again at Radical AI.</p>

我世界上最喜欢的一句话是，你知道，史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）说的“连接点滴”。你永远无法向前看连接点滴。你只能向后看连接它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of my favorite quotes in the world is, you know, Steve Jobs is connecting the dots. You can never connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards.</p>
</details>

这是一个确切的时刻，我不知道这个点会引向何方。但现在当我回首时，我必须经历那段经历，并经历今天材料研究的挫折。你需要点滴才能连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is an exact moment where I didn't know where this dot was going to lead. But now when I look back, it was imperative that I went through that experience and lived through the frustrations of materials research today. You need dots to be able to connect.</p>
</details>

虽然你可能不知道这个点会产生什么影响，但你永远不知道它会如何影响接下来的事情。所以，我不在乎我不知道接下来会发生什么。我不在乎它是否会成功。我不在乎我是否会成为一名真正的科学家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And while you might not know where this dot is going to make an impact, you never know where it is going to or how it is going to impact what comes next. And so I didn't care that I didn't know what was coming next. I didn't care if it was going to work or not. I didn't care if I was going to be a scientist or not in in the real retrospect.</p>
</details>

我关心的是继续前进，寻找答案。我认为这正是我最终找到答案的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I cared about was continuing to push forward and searching for the answer. And I think that's truly how I ended up getting to the answer.</p>
</details>

所以，我每天都提醒自己，这会带来一些成果。无论情况如何，你都绝不能放弃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I just reminded myself every day that this will lead to something. You have to never ever give up no matter the scenario.</p>

我们希望消除材料作为这些创新的障碍。这就是为什么我们认为这家公司没有终点。我们认为这家公司将存在100年、200年。它将远远超越我和两位联合创始人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We want to remove materials as the blocker to those innovations. And that's why we don't think there's an end to the company. We think this company will be 100, 200 years old. It will way outlive myself and and the two co-founders.</p>
</details>

这是一家公司，一项技术，当它成功时，将真正能够创造一个今天无法想象的世界。
