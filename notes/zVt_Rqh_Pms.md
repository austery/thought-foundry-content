title: 加拿大在中美竞争中寻求务实外交：摆脱美国压力还是风险管理？
summary: 本期访谈探讨了在当前中美关系紧张的背景下，加拿大如何调整其外交和贸易策略。专家Lynette Ong认为，加拿大正寻求摆脱美国主导的政治压力，与中国进行更务实的接触，这既是风险管理，也是贸易多元化战略的一部分。访谈比较了英国和加拿大与中国打交道的方式，并分析了加拿大主导的、不含美国的欧洲与印太地区贸易集团的潜力。同时，访谈也触及了加拿大在关键矿产领域与美国合作的考量，以及中等强国在全球舞台上联合发声的重要性。

### 外交新格局

**Lynette Ong**: 我同意您的看法。如果“集团政治”指的是**美国**及其西方盟友，我认为美国实际上已经破坏了包括**加拿大**和**欧洲国家**在内的许多盟友之间的信任。所以，各国都在试图追求自己的利益，通常是基于具体问题来处理。就我们而言，**中国**一直是第二大贸易伙伴。我认为**加拿大**寻求与**中国**进行贸易，实现贸易多元化，摆脱对**美国**的依赖，这是有道理的。但我们不应止步于中国。中国应成为我们多元化战略的起点。我们还应关注**印太地区**和**欧洲**。

**Lynette Ong**: I would agree with that. If by blockchain politics you mean United States and its Western allies, I think United States have actually broken trust among a lot of allies, including Canada and European countries. So people. So countries are out there trying to pursue their own interests, often on an issue by issue basis. And in our case, China has been the second largest trading partner. I think it makes sense for for Canada to look to look to China, kind of to diversify away of our trade from the United States towards China. But I think we shouldn't stop at China. China would be the beginning of our of our diversification strategy. We should also look to Indo-Pacific and Europe.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 好的。我们将讨论一些潜在的可以达成交易的国家。但有些人认为，加拿大与**北京**的贸易协议是在压力下的风险管理，而不是脱离美国的信号。您对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: All right. We'll talk about some of those potential countries making deals. But some see Canada's trade deal with Beijing as risk management under pressure and not a pivot away from the US. What are your thoughts on that?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 正如总理所说，我认为这是一种购买保险的方式。是的，这是风险管理。不是把所有鸡蛋放在一个篮子里。而是将我们的鸡蛋分散到许多不同的篮子里。但这同时也意味着我们正在脱离美国。我们正在将依赖性从美国转移到许多其他国家。其中，也是最大的一个，就是中国。所以，这可以说是两者兼有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: Like the Prime Minister has put it, I think it's a way of buying insurance. Yes, it's a risk management. It's not putting all our eggs in one basket. So diversifying our eggs in many different baskets. But that also means that we are pivoting away from the United States. We are diversifying our reliance away from the United States towards a bunch of other countries. And one of them, and the largest among them would be China. So it's a bit of both.

### 国内政治

**Interviewer**: 在**加拿大人**中，与中国的接触仍然是一个政治敏感话题，尤其是在**特鲁多**政府时期，两国政府之间多年来一直存在敌意。**马克·卡尼**应该如何处理这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Among Canadians, engagement with China remains politically sensitive, following years of hostility between the two governments, especially under Trudeau. How should Carney navigate that?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 我认为他必须走一条非常微妙的、精细的路线。我认为到目前为止，他做得相当不错。在国内方面，我们看到加拿大人对美国的态度发生了转变。在**特朗普**执政期间，美国的不喜欢率实际上有所上升，相比之下，**北京**（中国）曾因非常明显的原因在加拿大非常不受欢迎。我们有两名加拿大人被拘留了 **1000 天**，对吧？我认为在国内方面，国内形势发生了一些变化，在特朗普执政期间，**华盛顿特区**现在比北京更不受欢迎，这反映在加拿大乃至许多西方国家最新的公众意见调查中，这些调查由**皮尤研究中心**进行。所以在这方面，他获得了一点更多的授权。但我认为政府需要走出去，不仅要让人们认识到我们需要更多地关注中国，而且还要对中国保持强硬，不要忘记我们对**台湾**民主的承诺，以及在**人权**问题等我们仍然重视的所有价值观上保持坚定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: I think he has to walk a very fine, fine line. I think so far he has done pretty well, I would think. On the domestic front, we have seen a shift towards Canadians attitudes towards the United States. Under Trump, Unfavorability rating of the United States has actually gone up vis a vis Beijing. Beijing China used to be very unpopular in Canada for very obvious reasons. We have got two Canadians being detained for 1000 days, right. And I think on the domestic front, the domestic landscape has changed a little bit, has changed quite a bit under under Trump, Washington, D.C. is now more unpopular than Beijing, and that's reflected in the kind of latest public opinion poll, not only in Canada but across a lot of Western nations conducted by Pew Research. So on that front, he has got a little bit more mandate, but I think the government needs to go out there and not only sell to people that we need to pay more attention to China, but also be also be firm on China, not forgetting, you know, our commitment towards democracy in Taiwan and be able to come to trade between China and our commitments towards, you know, all the values that are still important to us, including democracy in Taiwan, human rights issues and so forth.

</details>

### 坚定立场

**Interviewer**: “坚定”看起来是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: What does firm look like?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 举个例子，我认为我们与**台湾**的业务应该照常进行，应该像往常一样。我们不应过早地让议员们退出台湾的访问。好的。对。我们不应取消任何我们计划中的对台贸易协议。我认为那将是过早地屈服。我认为那将是过早地……我认为那样，我们是在向北京发出信号，表明我们需要他们胜过他们需要我们。我认为这不一定正确。我认为中国正处于经济疲软的阶段。房地产使用占 GDP 增长的 **30%**。其经济增长未能恢复到大流行前的水平。它可能永远不会。现在它需要依靠出口导向型增长来驱动其经济。加拿大是它关注的地区之一。但更重要的是，我认为，因为加拿大与**美国**共享边界，曾是美国的亲密盟友，并且是逮捕**孟晚舟**的指令来源。不要忘记这一点。因此，在**美国**和**中国**之间进行大国竞争的时代，我们会认为中国自然希望与加拿大建立更好的关系。所以从这个意义上说，我认为我们应该带着所有的信心去那里，我们确实手中有牌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: You know, for instance, I think our business with Taiwan should go according as usual, you know, should should be as usual. We shouldn't prematurely pull MPs out of Taiwan trip. Okay. Right. We should not cancel any Taiwan trade deal that we have planned. We have planned for. I think that would be prematurely kowtowing. I think that would be prematurely being you know, I think with that, we are we are signalling to Beijing that we need them more than they need us. I think that's not necessarily true. You know, I think China is at a phase where economically it's weak. Real estate use accounts for 30% of GDP growth. Its economy, its economic growth has has not recovered to the pre-pandemic level. It probably never will. And it now needs to to depend on export led growth to drive its economy. And Canada is one of those places that it looks to. But more importantly, I think because Canada shares a border with the United States, used to be closest ally of the United States, and where the instruction to arrest Meng Wanzhou came from. Not to forget that. So in the in the age of kind of great power competition between the United States and China, we would think that China naturally wants a better relationship with Canada. So in that sense, you know, I think we should go in there, you know, with all the confidence and we, we we do have cards in our hands,

### 国际会晤

**Interviewer**: 我想更好地了解**马克·卡尼**上个月的会议，以及英国首相**基尔·斯塔默**的会议。他们出来的结果非常不同。您能稍微介绍一下这两个会议的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: I want to get a better understanding of the meetings that happened with Mark Carney just last month, but also the UK's prime minister, Keir Starmer. He had went but very different in terms of what had come out of it. Can you can you give us a little insight into how those two meetings would have gone?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 是的。你知道，英国首相**基尔·斯塔默**的北京之行，他在国内受到了抨击。但你知道，**马克·卡尼**之后去了达沃斯，然后回来时被誉为英雄。我认为这是两种截然不同的反响。人们会说，英国在访问前给了太多东西。他批准了在**伦敦**建造大型大使馆，这引起了很多关于潜在间谍活动、间谍以及地下隧道等的担忧。所以他在去北京之前给了太多东西。因此，他被视为有点软弱，在与中国打交道时做出了让步。而我认为我们（加拿大）坚持得更坚定一些。我们实际上并没有做出很多让步。**电动汽车 (EV)** 的关税减免实际上仅限于非常小的几个季度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: Yeah. You know, Keir Starmer, the British prime minister of the Beijing trip, he was hammered at home. Right. But you know Mark Carney after that he went to Davos and then came back celebrated as a hero. They're two very different reception I think, you know, people would say that Britain gave away a little bit too much before the trip. He approved the mega embassy in in London with a lot of, you know, concern about potentially espionage and spies and, you know, underground tunnels and so on. So he gave away a little bit too much before he went to Beijing. So he was seen as kind of weak, giving concessions vis a vis China. Whereas us I think we have hold on to it a little bit more, more firmly. And we didn't actually give away a lot of concessions. The EV tariff reduction is actually restricted to a very small number of quarters.

### 美国贸易集团

**Interviewer**: 您提到了**电动汽车**。所以我们需要谈谈一些**关键矿产**。**特朗普政府**最近宣布了一个新的**美国贸易集团**。这将有所帮助，因为中国拥有相当大的市场份额。但加拿大尚未签署。加拿大应该签署吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: You bring up EV. So I need to talk about some critical minerals. The Trump administration recently announced a new US trade bloc. And that would help because China owns a pretty substantial share of the market. But Canada has not signed yet. Should Canada?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 我不确定美国是否有信誉来动员任何国家组成贸易集团，鉴于其最近在**格陵兰**问题上的行为和语气，疏远了一批欧洲盟友。您看到了**慕尼黑安全会议**上发生的事情。人们并未感到安心。信任肯定已经破裂。**鲁比奥**在慕尼黑之后去了**匈牙利**，并与**维克多·欧尔班**进行了交谈。人们不知道美国的立场是什么。那么，如果我们与美国就**关键矿产**达成一项贸易集团协议，他们可能会反过来对付我们。我认为，没有这种可预测性和可信度，就很难领导任何联盟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: I'm not sure whether US has the credibility to mobilise any country to form a trade bloc, with its recent behaviour tone towards taking over Greenland, alienating a bunch of European allies. You see what happened in Munich security conference. People are not reassured. Trust has definitely broken Rubio. Right after Munich went to Hungary and spoke to Viktor Orban. People don't know where the United States stands. So what if we enter into a trade bloc on critical minerals with the United States? They could turn around and do something against us. I think without that sort of predictability and credibility, it will be difficult to lead. And any sort of alliance.

</details>

### 区域合作

**Interviewer**: 有了这一点，加拿大正在带头努力在**欧洲联盟**和**印太地区**的 **12 个国家**之间创建一个贸易集团。我们谈论的是所有这些国家总共 **15 亿人口**。美国不参与其中。我很想知道，鉴于您提到的所有情况，它在没有美国的情况下能否成功？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: With that. Canada is spearheading its own efforts to create a trading bloc between the European Union and a 12 nation Indo-Pacific bloc. This is we're talking, 1.5 billion people amongst all those nations. The US is not part of this. And I'm curious, can it succeed without the US with everything that you've mentioned?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 是的。这项提议是在 CBC（*注：此处原文为CBC，可能为转录错误，结合上下文和后续 interviewer 的提及，可能指代某种贸易协定或倡议*）和一群**欧洲联盟**国家之间进行的。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: Yeah. The proposal was between CBC and and and a bunch of European Union countries. Right.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 当然，Lynette，当您提到**全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定 (CPTPP)** 时，我们谈论的是《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: And of course, Lynette, when you say CPTPP, we are talking about the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific partnership.

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 我认为其核心理念是这些国家之间的互补性，即**印太地区**的更多发展中国家与**欧洲**的更多工业化国家。因此，如果这两个地区结合起来，我认为它们将构成世界 GDP 的很大一部分，这将是对**美国**的一个很好的制衡。我不认为这是否必然需要美国才能成功。但我认为，如果这些国家之间有足够的互补性和比较优势的差异，就能获得很多好处。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: I think the very idea is kind of complementarity between these countries, which is more developing countries in the Indo-Pacific versus more, more industrialised nations in Europe. So if those two regions combined, I think would constitute a large proportion of the world's GDP, that would be a good counterbalance against the United States. I don't see that as kind of necessarily as whether we need the United States to succeed. But I think if there is enough complementarity and differences in comparative advantage among these countries, there's a lot of benefits to be gained. Yeah.

</details>

### 中等强国

**Interviewer**: 这是否提供了一个机会？您提到了在达沃斯的演讲。这是**中等强国**的机会吗？这是加拿大在世界舞台上更加自信的机会吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Does this present a chance? You mentioned the speech at Davos. Here's an opportunity for the middle powers. Is this a chance for them to be for Canada to be more assertive on that world stage?

</details>

**Lynette Ong**: 我认为是，我认为是。我认为加拿大处于领导的有利位置，因为我们曾经是美国的亲密盟友，而现在不是了。因此，加拿大外交受到了很多严重损害。我认为我们的总理，除了是一位政治领导人，他也是一位知识分子，一个能够构思想法、能够阐述宏大理念并将其传达给普通民众的人。结合这两点，我认为我们处于一个有利的位置，可以领导和动员国家，坚定立场，让**中等强国**团结起来，共同推进我们的利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lynette Ong**: I think so I think so I think Canada is in the right place to lead because we are we used to be the closest ally to the United States and now we are not. So we have there's a lot of serious damage being done to Canadian diplomacy. And I think our prime prime minister, in addition to being a political leader, he's also an intellectual, someone who could conceptualise ideas, who could articulate kind of big ideas and deliver it to common people. With a combination of the two, I think we are in a good position to lead and mobilise countries and to stand to stand firm and get middle powers, hang together to advance our interests.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 好的，我们就谈到这里。当然，这是我们将继续关注的事情。非常感谢您的见解。
