### 美国AI竞赛现状

**主持人**: 很高兴见到大家，我非常激动能和大家讨论当下的热点问题，那就是我们世界中的人工智能和AI。**David**、**Michael**，我想请你们谈谈我们目前在争取成为头号AI强国方面进展如何？**David**，我们做得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Great to see everyone and I'm thrilled to be able to talk about the issue of the day and that is artificial intelligence and AI in our world. Um David, Michael, I'd love you to talk about what where we are right now in terms of the pursuit to be the number one uh lead AI country. How are we doing, David?

</details>

**David**: 我认为我们做得很好。**Maria**，去年7月，**特朗普总统**发表了一次重要的AI政策演讲，他宣布美国必须赢得AI竞赛。他首先声明我们已经身处这场竞赛中。我认为他的演讲让人想起**肯尼迪总统**宣布我们身处太空竞赛并必须赢得那场竞赛的时候。自那时起，你看到的是美国公司不断创新。各种令人难以置信的产品不断发布。我认为美国的AI模型、芯片、数据中心只会越来越好。所以我对美国在这场AI竞赛中的地位感觉非常好。当然，我们有一些非常能干且强大的竞争对手。中国显然有很多非常聪明的人在这个领域工作。但我确实认为，你现在从**硅谷**的美国公司那里看到的创新确实令人难以置信。然而，关于所有正在进行的用于建设数据中心的支出，仍然存在许多问题。当然，问题不断出现：我们是否花费过多？我们能获得投资回报吗？你对此怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: I think we're doing great. Um Maria, last year uh **President Trump** gave a major AI policy speech. is in July and he declared that the United States had to win the AI race. Uh he he had first of all declared that we were in one. Uh and I think his speech was reminiscent of when **President Kenny** declared that we were in a space race and had to win that race. I think since then what you've seen is that American companies have only innovated more. You're seeing all sorts of really incredible products being released all the time. I think that um American uh uh AI models, chips, um data centers only just keep um getting better and better. And so I feel very good about the American position in this AI race. Certainly we have some very uh you know competent uh and formidable competitors. Um **China** obviously has a lot of very smart people working in this area. But I do think that uh just what you see from uh American companies in **Silicon Valley** right now is really incredible. And yet there are still so many questions about all of the spending underway uh to build this out with regard to data centers. And of course the question keeps coming up are we spending too much. Will we get the return on investment? How do you see that?

</details>

**Michael**: 我认为我们会。我认为之所以看到如此庞大的基础设施建设，是因为最终需求是存在的。我知道很多人担心这是否会像**互联网泡沫**时期的情况。还记得90年代末我们进行了光纤建设，然后互联网泡沫破裂。这里的区别在于，90年代末和2000年代初，我们有一个被称为“暗光纤”的问题，即光纤建成了但没有被使用。现在没有“暗**GPU**”这种东西。每个被放入数据中心的**GPU**都在被使用。它被用来生成**tokens**，为新一代AI聊天机器人或编码助手提供动力。过去几个月，在编码方面发布了一些产品，如果你关注软件开发人员的说法，他们会说这令人震惊，它正在彻底改变他们的行业，所以对**tokens**的需求只会增加，这反过来增加了我们正在看到的数据中心建设的需求。所以我认为它不会很快停止。去年，这项基础设施建设为**GDP**增长率贡献了大约2%，这帮助我们达到了4%到5%的增长率，我认为今年你也会看到类似的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: I I think that we will. Um I think that the reason why you're seeing this huge infrastructure buildout is because the demand is ultimately there. I I know a lot of people worry and about whether this could be like a **dot situation**. And remember where we had the whole fiber build out in the late '9s and then we had a doc crash. The difference here is that uh in the late '9s and early 2000s we had a a problem known as dark fiber where you had this fiber buildout and then it didn't get used. There's no such thing as a **dark GPU** right now. Every **GPU** that's being put in a data center is getting used. Uh and it's being used to generate **tokens** and that's to power the this new generation of AI chat bots or coding assistants. uh and there's just been some releases in the last couple months on the coding front that you know it's if you're following what develop software developers are saying they're saying it's mind-blowing it's completely revolutionizing their industry so demand for **tokens** just increases and that increases the demand for this data center buildout that we're seeing so I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon and just last year this infrastructure buildout added about uh 2% to the **GDP** growth rate and I and that's what helped propel us to this you know four to 5% % growth rate and I think you're going to see something similar this year.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，这确实在引领增长，**Michael**。我很高兴能和你们两位进行这次对话，你们是真正的领导者。**David**，谢谢你。**Michael**，谢谢你。同样的问题问你，**Michael**。评估一下我们目前在AI方面的状况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, it is certainly leading growth, Michael. Um, and I'm so happy to be able to get this conversation going with both of you who are really leading this. David, thank you. And Michael, thank you. Same questions for you, Michael. Assess where we are right now on AI.

</details>

**Michael**: 我认为只是提醒一下大家，对于那些没有像我们每天一样密切关注的人。这个计划基本上有三个支柱：第一，美国如何才能继续超越竞争对手进行创新？第二，我们如何推动支持这场AI革命所需的基础设施建设？第三，我们如何将我们伟大的美国技术分享或出口到世界各地？对于这三个支柱，联邦政府已经采取了相当多的行动来推动其发展。我认为我们可以非常自豪地说，我们在这三方面都取得了相当不错的进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: I I think just a reminder for the group for those who haven't been tracking as closely as we do every day. The the plan really had essentially three pillars and it talked about how one, how can the US continue to out innovate our competitors? two, how can we drive the infrastructure build that we need to support um this this AI revolution? And three, how do we actually share with the world or export our great American technology? And for each of those three pillars, there was quite a lot of actions that the federal government has taken to drive that forward. Um, and I think I think we're pretty proud to say that we've made, I think, pretty good progress on on all three.

</details>

### AI监管挑战与联邦框架

**Michael**: 稍微关注一下你之前提到的创新问题。我认为我们一直以来关于如何推动创新的核心见解是，你必须有一个监管环境，允许这项技术在美国开发并最终商业化。与世界其他地区相比，美国在建立和创建有效框架方面做得很好。但我们总能做得更好，改进它。总统在7月的演讲中谈到了州级法规的“拼凑”问题，以及我们如何确保AI没有50种不同的规则。关于这场辩论，我认为很多人有时会忽略最重要的一点是，这种拼凑对早期阶段的年轻公司和创业者来说是最有害的。如果你想开发一项新的AI技术，如果你想在我们某个伟大的**前沿模型**之上构建一些东西，却必须弄清楚如何应对50个不同州的50种不同规则，这会产生很多摩擦，最终只有大公司才能在这种环境中取得最佳成功。因此，我们正在花费大量时间思考如何制定一项立法提案，能够真正提供一个合理的国家框架来解决这个监管问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Um just focusing a little bit on the innovation one you were talking about earlier. I think the the the the the core um insight that we've always had about how you drive this innovation is you have to have a regulatory environment that allows this technology to be developed and ultimately commercialized in the United States. And the US has done a great job compared to the rest of the world on sort of setting that up and creating a framework that works. But we can always do better and improve it. And the president in his his speech in July talked a lot about um this issue of a patchwork of state regulations and how can we ensure that there aren't 50 different rules around AI and and what's most what's most important about this debate which I I think a lot of people sometimes don't sometimes miss is the patchwork is actually most detrimental to early stage young companies and entrepreneurs. If you want to develop a new AI technology, if you want to build something on top of one of our great **frontier models**, having to figure out how to navigate 50 different rules across 50 different states creates a lot of friction and ultimately the big guys are the ones that can succeed in in that environment the best. Um, so we're spending a lot of time trying to think about how can you create a legislative proposal that can actually um deliver on um a sensible national framework to solve to solve this regulatory issue.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，**Michael**，你认为在这种联邦监管中，哪些是必须具备的基本框架？因为美国有些州确实反对，说：“不，不，我们希望在AI方面能够掌控自己的命运。”当你审视这种联邦监管框架时，最重要的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, so what would you say then, Michael, are the basic frameworks that are uh sort of must-have in in that kind of federal oversight? Because some states did push back in the US and say, "No, no, we want to be able to control our destiny when it comes to AI." What's most important when you look at that framework in terms of um a federal oversight?

</details>

**Michael**: 是的，我认为在总统12月签署的行政命令中，指示我们研究这项提案，他列出了一些州应该能够继续独立追求的事项。例如，关于**儿童安全**的立法或规则就在其中。关于数据中心和建设的许可规则也应继续由各州审视。所以有一些明确列出的事项，但这正是**Dave**和我将要努力解决的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Yeah, I think in the executive order the president signed in in December directing us to kind of work through this proposal, he listed a few things that um the state should continue to be able to pursue individually on their own. Um legislation or rules around **child safety** was on that list. Um the rules around permitting of data centers and buildouts are continuing to be something that states should should look at. So there are a few things that were enumerated, but that's the kind of stuff that I guess Dave and I are going to be working through.

</details>

**David**: 是的，我的意思是，我认为我们面临的基本问题是，坦率地说，各州现在正在疯狂地进行监管。目前有超过1200项法案正在州议会审议。我认为这很大程度上是一种膝跳反应。我知道人们对AI有很多担忧，但似乎对于每一个假设性的担忧，现在都有多项州级法案试图在我们真正了解其发展之前就对其进行监管。我认为，由于这项技术如此新颖，环境如此动态，最好花更多时间研究AI的实际使用情况以及哪些风险正在实际发生，然后再过度监管。但无论如何，这就是我们目前在州层面看到的情况。而且我认为总统一直非常坚持，最好在联邦层面有一个统一的规则手册，一个轻量级的联邦标准。我认为这个问题只会随着时间的推移变得更加尖锐，因为当你有50个不同的州朝着50个不同的方向发展时，这种“拼凑”问题只会变得更加严重。所以，无论如何，我认为今年我们将密切合作，看看我们能否就联邦框架达成足够的共识，以制定一项法律。最终只有**国会**才能限制各州。我们理解这一点。而且你知道，让一项法案通过**国会**是非常困难的。参议院需要60票。所以，在某种程度上必须是两党合作。但我们将努力争取达成共识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah, I mean I I think the the basic problem that we have is that I mean frankly the states are going hog wild right now with regulation. There's over,**200 bills** going through state legislatores right now. I think it's very much a knee-jerk reaction. I know there's a lot of fears and concerns about AI, but it seems like for every hypothetical concern, there's um multiple state bills now to try and regulate that thing before we really know how it's going to play out. And um I think it would be better to I think since this technology is so new and the environment is so dynamic, I think it'd be better to spend a little bit more time studying how AI is actually being used and what risks are actually materializing before you overregulate the thing. But in any event, that that's the what we're seeing right now at the state level. And um and and I think that the president's been very consistent that it would be better to have a single have one rule book, a single rule book at the federal level, lightweight federal standard. Uh I think this problem is only going to get more acute over time because again you you as you have 50 different states running in 50 different directions, the patchwork problem only gets um more significant. So, in any event, this is something that we're going to work, I think, closely together on this year, which is to see if we can get enough consensus on a federal framework to enact a law. Only **Congress** can ultimately cramp the states. We understand that. Um, and you know, as you know, it's very difficult to get a bill through **Congress**. You need 60 votes in the **Senate**. So, has to be bipartisan to to a certain degree. So, but we're going to try and see if we can um work to get that consensus.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。那么，关于**国会**对联邦监管的支持，你有什么明确的时间表吗？或者你认为根据你所谈论的州，那里也会有阻力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And do you have any clarity on the timing on that in terms of um support in Congress for a federal oversight or do you see push back there as well depending on the state you're talking about?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，**国会**对没有联邦标准的“优先权”概念存在阻力。换句话说，你不能用“无”来取代“有”。这是我们反复听到的说法。但我认为**众议院**和**参议院**都对制定某种轻量级联邦标准非常感兴趣。但我们仍在这些对话的早期阶段，我们将看看今年能做些什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, there's push back in Congress to the idea of preeemption without a federal standard. So, in other words, you can't replace something with nothing. This is sort of the the thing that we heard uh repeatedly. But I think there is uh quite a bit of interest in both the **House** and the **Senate** towards having again some sort of lightweight federal standard. But we're still in the early stages of those conversations and we're going to see what we can try and get done this year.

</details>

### 数据中心建设与能源挑战

**主持人**: 与此同时，有些人最初希望看到数据中心的创新和增长，现在却在抵制，说“不要建在我家后院”。对此你怎么看？这是一个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Meanwhile, you've got some people pushing back after wanting to see the innovation and growth of data centers. Now they're saying not in my backyard. What about that? Is that an issue?

</details>

**David**: 是的，我的意思是，我们最近收到了**伯尼·桑德斯**的一封信，要求停止所有数据中心，所有数据中心的开发。你知道，如果我们这样做，我们就会输掉AI竞赛。我的意思是，你确实需要这种基础设施。其他国家也在建设这种基础设施。中国正在建设，我认为他们每周都在启动一个新的核电站或燃煤电厂，很多电力都用于为他们的数据中心供电。所以，如果我们完全停止建设数据中心，我认为这将从根本上阻碍美国在AI竞赛中的发展。同时，也存在对可负担性的担忧，关于消费者是否会因为数据中心而支付更高的电费。**特朗普总统**一直非常明确，消费者不应该因为数据中心而支付更高的电费。就在上周，**微软**站出来承诺，其数据中心不会导致居民电费上涨。我认为你很可能会看到其他科技公司也站出来做出类似的承诺。事实上，当我与超大规模运营商和AI公司交谈时，他们从未计划从电网中大量取电。他们都将建立自己的发电设施作为其建设的一部分。而我们的能源部长**赖特部长**一直在做的，就是改革那些实际上让这些AI数据中心更难在电表后建立自己的发电设施的法规。所以，这基本上就是我们的愿景，而且我应该说，这实际上是**特朗普总统**自执政初期以来的愿景，他说让AI公司成为电力公司，让他们在建设新数据中心的同时建立自己的发电设施，这样做的结果是，我们获得了基础设施，而且居民电费不会上涨。是的，因为**Michael**，这场竞赛很快就从AI竞赛变成了**电力竞赛**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah, I mean we got a letter recently from **Bernie Sanders** saying stop all data centers, all data center development. And you know if we do that we will lose the AI race. I mean you do need this infrastructure. Uh other countries are building out this infrastructure. **China's** building out I think they're um spinning up a a new uh nuclear power plant or um or coal plant new energy every single week and a lot of that is going to power their data centers. So it would fundamentally I think uh the United States in the AI race if we just stopped building data centers altogether. At the same time, there are concerns about affordability, about um whether consumers would have to pay a higher electrical rate because of data centers. Uh **President Trump's** been really clear that consumers should not have to pay higher rates for electricity because of data centers. You saw just last week **Microsoft** stepped up and made a pledge that it will that its data centers will not cause residential rates to increase. I think you'll likely see other tech companies stepping up and making similar commitments. And in fact, when I've talked to the hyperscalers and when I've talked to the AI companies, it was never their plan to draw off the grid. They all are uh saw standing up their own power generation as part of their buildout. Um and what **Secretary Wright**, the our Secretary of Energy has been doing is trying to um is is reform the regulations that actually make it more difficult for these AI data centers to stand up their own power behind the meter. So that basically is is our vision is let and and I should say this is **President Trump's** vision really since the beginning of the administration is he said let the AI companies become power companies let them stand up their own power generation as they built you know side by side with these new data centers and the um the result of that is you know a we get this infrastructure b residential rates don't go up. Yeah, because Michael, this this race has fast become it's moves from an AI race to a **power race**.

</details>

**Michael**: 而且我认为我们看到的是，我们需要讲述一个好故事，说明这种建设最终将对美国纳税人产生积极影响。我认为有时，如果你在一个小社区，有人来建造数据中心，你必须明确指出，这最终将长期降低你的费率。总统上周一发布了一条推文，正如**David**所说，他非常明确地表示，如果你要建造数据中心，你必须自费，而**微软**已经站了出来，我们希望其他许多公司也能这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: And and I think what we're seeing is that um we we need to share a good story about how ultimately this buildout is going to be net positive for American rateayers. And I think sometimes if you know and if you're in a small community and someone shows up to build the data center, I mean, you have to make it clear that ultimately this something is going to actually lower your your rates long term. Um and and the president put out a tweet a truth last Monday where he was as as David said very clear that you know if you're going to build a data center you have to pay your own way for it and um **Microsoft** has stepped up and our our hope is that many others will do the same.

</details>

**主持人**: 但是一些公司，因为他们现在没有现金，正在借钱来建设数据中心，也有人担心银行会因此承担风险，因为支出又太多了。你对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But but some companies um because they don't have the cash right now are borrowing money right to to build out the data centers and there's also a worry that the banks will be left holding the bag for some of this because again the spending is is too much. your thoughts on that?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，显然存在这种担忧。我的意思是，你知道，我认为，与其说是银行，不如说你看到**甲骨文**正在进行巨额投资。你看到**黑石集团**正在进行巨额投资，还有房地产公司。最终，我认为这些都是非常精明的市场参与者，非常深厚的公司，他们这样做是因为他们看到了投资回报。我能再提一点关于数据中心的问题吗？关于电力，我实际上认为，如果我们允许数据中心建立自己的发电设施，它实际上会降低电费。它不仅不会增加居民电费，还会降低电费。它将通过两种方式实现这一点。一是数据中心在有多余电力时可以向电表输送或出售电力。这将有助于降低电费。其次，发电涉及大量的固定成本，并非全部都是可变成本。因此，当你能够将这些固定成本分摊到更大的供应量上时，你就会降低所有人的电表费率。所以存在巨大的规模经济。因此，电力方面的规模越大，就像大多数其他事物一样，价格就会下降。所以，我们正在进行的这种建设实际上是一件好事，因为它最终会降低消费者的价格。但我们必须确保这些新的数据中心不仅仅是接入电网并使用电力，它们必须回馈电网。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I think there there is obviously that concern. I mean, you you know, I I think it's it's um it's less I would say the banks are more you see **Oracle** making a huge investment. You see, uh **Blackstone** making huge investments, real estate companies. Um ultimately, I think these are very savvy market players, very deep companies, and they're doing this because they see an **ROI** there at the end of the the rainbow. Um can I make one other point about just the the data center? So, um, just on electricity, uh, I actually think that if we allow the data centers to stand up their own power generation, it will actually bring down rates. Not only will it not increase residential rates, it'll bring it down. And it'll do that in two ways. One is that the data centers can can give or sell power back to the meter when they have excess. So, that will help bring down rates. Second, there's a lot of fixed costs involved in power generation. It's not all variable. So when you're able to amortize those fixed costs over a greater supply, you bring down the meter rate for everybody. And so there's huge economies of scale. So the more scale you get in electricity, like most other things, the price comes down. That's what So it's actually a good thing that the uh that we have this buildout going on because it will ultimately reduce prices for consumers. But we do have to make sure that these new data centers aren't just plugging into the grid and using, they have to be contributing back.

</details>

**Michael**: 而且我认为本届政府所做出的政策改变非常棒，**拜登政府**的政策是，你不能在电表后进行能源发电。如果你想自己发电，你不能。你必须成为更大电网的一部分。所以我认为，**赖特部长**和**FK**已经改变了这项规定，允许这种情况发生。最终，我同意**David**的观点。我认为一旦发电规模更大，你就会以一种有利于纳税人的方式回馈电网。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: And I think what a great policy change has made under this administration, the the **B administration** had as a matter of policy had made it such that you couldn't do this behind the meter energy generation. Um, and if you wanted to bring your own power, you couldn't. You had to be part of the larger grid. So I think um that rule has has changed uh uh by by **Secretary Wright** and by **FK** to kind of allow this to happen. And ultimately I agree with David. I think once you have sort of greater scale in in the power generation, you'll be contributing back into the grid in a way that that benefits rateayers.

</details>

### AI的应用与科学突破

**主持人**: 让我们回到AI的用途以及它如何改变我们的生活。你之前提到了AI的所有用途及其影响。你认为目前AI最重要的用途是什么？它在哪里得到了最好的部署和实施？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Let's go back to the uses and how AI is changing our lives. You you mentioned earlier um all of the uses and and and the impact the AI is having. What do you see as the most important use and where AI is being deployed and implemented best right now?

</details>

**Michael**: 嗯，这很有趣。我认为它经历了一个演变过程。我们最初从像**ChatGPT**这样的AI聊天机器人开始，从某种意义上说，那就像是更好的网络搜索。它对于研究、提问和获得任何问题的答案都非常有用。然后我们看到模型加入了**思维链**，它们可以开始进行更深层次的推理。然后我们看到了**编码助手**。这确实是一个突破，我认为在过去几个月里，编码助手的质量有了真正的重大改进。如果你和软件开发人员交流，他们会觉得这确实是一个巨大的转变。我认为接下来它将走向知识工作者的工具。所以，那些一直输出代码的助手现在可以输出任何类型的文件格式。无论是**Excel模型**、**PowerPoint演示文稿**、网站，你都能想到，知识工作者现在将能够生成所有这些不同类型的东西，就像程序员一直使用AI生成代码一样。我认为这将是2026年你将看到的一大亮点，即知识工作者的生产力再次迎来繁荣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Well, it's interesting. I think it there's been an evolution. So I think we started with you know AI chat bots like **ChatGPT** and in a sense that was kind of like better web search. Um it was really great for research asking it questions and give you answers to anything. Then we saw um we saw models add **chain of thought** and they could start to do you know deeper reasoning. Then we saw **coding assistance**. This is really and and I think over the past few months there's been a real breakthrough. If you talk to people, software developers, it really seems like there's been, you know, a major shift in in just improvement in the quality of the coding assistants. And I think where that's going next is um tools for **knowledge workers**. So the same types of assistants that have been outputting code can now output any type of format. So whether it's like **Excel models**, **PowerPoints**, websites, you name it, knowledge workers are now going to be able to generate all these different types of things the same way that coders have been gen that software developers have been using AI generate code. I think that's one of the big things you're going to see in **2026** is again just this um this **productivity boom** for knowledge workers.

</details>

**Michael**: 所以我认为这是你正在看到的一个实际情况。另外，在垂直行业中也发生了很多事情。所以不同的行业正在受到AI的影响。在医疗保健领域，我认为有一个巨大的机会，可以改善或减少行政官僚主义，改进文件处理。还可以利用AI进行医学和科学研究，帮助寻找新的治疗方法。你已经看到用户讲述各种关于诊断的故事。他们能够将自己的病历输入**ChatGPT**或其他聊天引擎或聊天机器人，并获得惊人的结果。他们能够最终弄清楚自己到底出了什么问题，并能够将这些信息带给医生。医生也在使用它。所以我认为医疗领域是一个非常有趣的领域，但还有很多这样的例子，不同的行业正在受到影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: So I think that's like one of the things you're seeing on the ground. And then separately there's there's a bunch of things happening in industry verticals. So different industries being impacted by AI. So in **healthcare** I think there's a tremendous opportunity uh to improve um or to to reduce sort of administrative bureaucracy to uh to improve this um processing of paperwork that happens. also to use uh AI and medical and scientific research to help find new uh cures. You're already seeing users tell all sorts of stories about uh diagnosis. They've been able to put in their medical records into **chat GBT** or you know other chat engine or chat bots and get like remarkable results. They've been able to you know finally figure out what was you know what what was wrong with them and they've been able to take that to a doctor. You have doctors using it too. So medical I think is a really interesting area but there's a whole bunch of these um examples of different different industries are now being impacted.

</details>

**Michael**: 我认为我非常关注的一个领域是**AI用于科学**，回到**David**最初关于我们看到的这些**前沿模型**进展的观点。我认为非常早期的模型是从一般知识开始的，你必须回过头来理解为什么，问题是那些模型构建者可以用来开始训练模型的数据是什么。对于早期的模型，你可以直接抓取互联网，然后把所有东西都塞进一个模型进行训练，这就是你拥有第一阶段**大型语言模型**的方式。第二个阶段是编码，如果你考虑如何获得一个真正好的编码模型，你同样需要用现有代码来训练它，这又是相对容易获取的数据类型。你看到了编码模型取得了巨大的进步和飞跃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: The the one area I think a lot about is is **AI for science** and and back to to to David's initial point about the progress we've seen these **frontier models**. I think the very early ones sort of started with just general knowledge and you have to go back and understand like why and the question was what was the data available for those model builders to start training their models and for the early ones you could just scrape the internet and just kind of cram everything into a model and train it and and that's where you kind of had this this first phase of of **large language models** and the second one was coding and if you think about how do you get a really good coding model you again you have to trade it you have to train it on existing code and that's again something that is you know relative atively easier to to acquire than other types of data and you saw great progress and jumps in in the coding models.

**Michael**: 我认为第三个尚未真正触及的重大转变是**AI用于科学**的问题，政府本身正在大力推动。为什么科学发现与**大型语言模型**传统训练方式结合如此具有挑战性，是因为科学数据极其分散，并且其完成方式或格式不便于轻松应用于大型语言模型的训练运行。如果你考虑科学发现，它分散在许多不同的学科中。你有化学数据、数学数据、材料科学数据，所有这些都是不同类型和格式的。我们政府的努力，我们启动了一个名为“**创世纪任务**”的项目，这是我们试图在AI科学发现领域实现重大飞跃的尝试。我们能源部的国家实验室在过去50到60年里一直在进行令人难以置信的研究，所有这些数据都已准备好用于训练这些模型。所以我希望在接下来的一年里，我们将在科学发现领域看到更多工作，从而能够真正加速我们选择运行哪些实验、运行这些实验、回过头来找出我们做错了什么并再次运行的速度。这与人们围绕这些**AI实验室**的许多有趣想法联系在一起，你基本上可以输入论文或假设，最终这些实验室可以自己进行实验室实验并向前推进。所以这就是我所拥有的梦想，最终我们作为一个国家，可以在未来10年内，因为AI，将我们的**研发**产出几乎翻倍。

**Michael**: I think the the third big sort of shift that hasn't really been touched on yet which the government itself is trying to do a good uh push on is the **AI for science** question and why it's so challenging for scientific discovery to like tie in with the way that **LMS** are are traditionally trained is that the science data is extraordinarily fragmented and it's not done in a way or formatted in a way that um can easily be applied to a large language model sort of like training run and if you think about scientific discovery it's spread out across so many different disciplines. You have chemistry data, you have math data, you have material science data and all of that is is all types of different formats. And our effort in administration um we launched something called the **Genesis mission** which are is our attempt to sort of make these big bold leaps in **AI for scientific discovery**. and our national labs at the **Department of Energy** are have been doing incredible research over the last you know 50 60 years and all of that has is sitting and is ready to be used to be trained for for for these models. So my hope is that over the next year we're going to see a lot more work in this in scientific discovery to be able to actually accelerate how quickly we can choose which experiments to run, run those experiments, go back and figure out what we did wrong and run them again. And and this ties in with lots of interesting ideas that people have around some of these **AI labs** where you essentially have you can put in the the the thesis or the hypothesis and ultimately these labs can do lab experiment itself and move forward. So that's kind of the dream that I have that that ultimately we as a country can can almost double our our **R&D** output over the next 10 years because of AI.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，你期望或希望看到什么样的突破？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So so what kind of breakthroughs um would you expect or would you like to see?

</details>

**Michael**: 是的，我认为那些能产生巨大影响的突破首先是围绕**核聚变**的实验和训练运行，它们需要极大的计算量。如果我们能加快这些**核聚变模拟**的反馈循环，我们就能缩短核聚变实现的时间线。所以这可能是一个巨大的进步。**材料科学**也是一个非常重要的领域，你希望能够测试各种不同的分子以及它们如何相互作用。这对于我们在太空领域正在尝试做的所有大事都很重要，无论是我们的**月球基地**、抵达**火星**，还是将**核能**带入太空，先进的材料科学都至关重要。第三个是每个人都关心的问题，那就是**医疗保健**和**治疗方法**。你如何能更快地识别出解决特定健康挑战的最佳分子？你如何能更快地迭代到一个可以进入临床试验的阶段？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Yeah, I I think there um the ones that I think can make a big impact are uh first the the the the experimentation and training runs around **fusion** um are extraordinarily computationheavy and they themselves if we can if we can have a a a faster feedback loop on how we do these these simulations for **fusion** we can move the timelines in for **fusion**. So that could be a big a big step. **Material science** is also a very a very big area where you want to be able to test all types of of different molecules and how interact with each other. This is important for all the big things we're trying to do in space. Whether it's our **lunar base** or getting to **Mars** or bringing **nuclear energy** to space, having advanced material science is important. And the third is one that everyone always cares about is is **healthcare** and and **therapeutics**. How can you more quickly be able to identify the the best molecules to solve a particular particular health challenge? and how do you more quickly iterate to a point where you can move to a to a clinical trial

</details>

**主持人**: 在日常生活中，我认为汽车行业也是一个巨大的受益者。我认为这也是一个似乎在这方面投入很大的领域，你同意吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and on a everyday level I mean you also have the auto sector I think as a big beneficiary here I think that's one area that seems to be spending a lot on this as well you agree with that

</details>

**Michael**: 嗯，我的意思是像**自动驾驶**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: well I mean with like self-driving or

</details>

**主持人**: 我的意思是，**自动驾驶**肯定会非常庞大，感觉我们已经达到了一个新的拐点，质量已经达到了你现在开始看到**机器人出租车**（**Waymo**和**Tesla**）的程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I mean **self-driving** for sure is going to be huge it feels like we've hit some sort of new inflection point there where the quality's gotten to the point where you're starting to see **robo taxis** now **Whimo** and **Tesla**. Um

</details>

**David**: 那么，AI助手呢？我的意思是，这会成为一种普遍存在的东西吗？前几天有人告诉我，哦，在中国我们做得非常不同，因为你们用AI做研究，就像你说的，但我们用它作为我的AI助手，你知道，它们帮我付账单，打扫房子，给我妻子买生日礼物，为我做所有事情。我认为会的。我认为这可能会在今年发生。最近发布的产品，让所有人都为之疯狂的是**Claude Code**的最新迭代，它由**Anthropic**的**Opus 4.5模型**提供支持，这似乎是编码领域的一个真正突破。所以，软件开发人员对此印象深刻。但在**Claude Code**内部，他们引入了一个名为“**Co-work**”的新标签，作为一个非编码人员，或者作为一个寻求创建除代码之外的输出的人，你现在可以用它来创建各种其他类型的输出。就像我提到的，你可以制作电子表格或**PowerPoint演示文稿**之类的东西。你可以让它指向你的文件驱动器，它可以查看你已经完成的工作。所以，如果你喜欢某种特定格式的**PowerPoint演示文稿**，你只需将它指向你已经完成的工作，然后说我想制作一个关于这个主题的新演示文稿，但使用这种风格，它实际上会模仿你的风格和你已经完成的工作格式。人们对此印象深刻，你还可以让它指向你的电子邮件，让它分析你的电子邮件并从中提取信息。所以现在它非常基于任务。你，作为用户，必须为每个任务提供提示。但你可以看到，这是一个个人数字助手的开端，你可以将它连接到你的文件驱动器、你的电子邮件、你所有的**数据源**，它就可以开始为你完成任务，而且它理解你喜欢的工作格式和风格。所以，在我看来，我们只需要在这种工具之上再增加一层抽象，你就会拥有自己的**个人数字助手**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: what what about an **AI assistant**? I mean, is that going to be something that is sort of common place? I someone said to me the other day that oh, in China we're doing things so much differently because you're using AI for research as as you said, but we're using it as I have my **AI assistant** and I'm um you know, they're paying my bills and cleaning my house and buying my wife a birthday present and and doing everything for me. I I think so. I think that'll happen probably this year. So the the product that just came out recently that everyone's kind of going crazy over is the latest iteration of **flawed code** uh which is uh powered by uh **anthropics** uh **Opus 4.5 model** which seems to be a real breakthrough in in in coding and so again this is you know the software developers are really imp impressed with it but in inside of **cloud code** they had they introduced a new tab called **co-work** again you can as a non coder uh or as someone who is looking for um to create output other than code, you can now use it to uh to basically create all sorts of other kinds of outputs. Like I mentioned, you can do uh spreadsheets or **powerpoints**, things like that. And you can have it, you can point it to your file drive and it can look at the work you've already done. So if there's a particular type of format for a **PowerPoint** you like, you just point it to the work you've already done and say I want to do you know a new um you know presentation but using this style but on this topic and it'll actually emulate you know your style and and the work your format the work you've already done. And um people are very impressed with this and you can also point it at your email and have it analyze your email pull things out of it. So it right now it's very taskbased. You you the user have to prompt it for each task. But you can see there the beginning of a **personal digital assistant** where you connect it to your file drive to your email to all of your **data sources** and it can start to do tasks for you and again it understands the format and the style that you like to produce work in. So, it feels to me like we just need one more layer of abstraction on top of a tool like that and you'll have your own **personal digital assistant**

</details>

**David**: 而且，你知道，会有一个**语音界面**。你有没有看过电影《**她**》（Her），你知道，**华金·菲尼克斯**主演，**斯嘉丽·约翰逊**只是配音，但他通过耳机告诉她该做什么。我的意思是，我们离那种情况非常近了。我不是说AI会变得有感知力什么的，但，不，我认为在2026年，你可能会看到这些类型的工具，它们最初是编码助手，但现在变成了个人数字助手。这肯定会在今年发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: and um you know there'll be like a **voice interface**. You ever seen the movie **Her** you know with uh **walking Phoenix** and um I think **Scarlett Johansson** is just the voice but uh you know he's telling her what what to do through an earpiece. I mean we're very close to something like that. I mean, I'm not saying that, you know, the AI is going to become sensient or whatever, but um but no, we're like I think in **2026**, you could see that that these types of of tools again started as coding assistants, but now they become **personal digital assistants**. That could definitely happen this year.

**主持人**: **Michael**，人们对AI有什么不了解的地方？你认为我们最需要了解的，关于目前科学和AI领域正在进行的创新是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Michael, what what don't people understand about AI? What what do you think is most important for us to understand about the innovation underway right now with science and and AI?

</details>

**Michael**: 我认为有些人，我认为很容易低估这项技术将对如此多的行业和领域产生的长期影响。我认为，你知道，很容易很快地将AI仅仅视为一个复杂的聊天机器人，因为这是大多数人每天互动和接触到的东西。但是我认为对我来说，我认为长期的影响，而不是一直强调科学，我认为在科学发现和努力的速度和节奏上正在发生一个真正的根本性转变。我认为这将对我们作为一个国家在未来几年内广泛创新的方式产生巨大的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: I I think some people I I think it's easy to underestimate the the long-term impact this is going to have across so many industries and and domains. Um I think very much, you know, it's easy to to to quickly think about AI as a as just a sophisticated chatbot because that's what most people interact with every day and and that's what they they they touch and feel. Um, but I think that to me I think the long-term impacts and not to keep harping on the science, I think there is a there's a a real fundamental shift happening in the velocity and pace that we can test and uh and evaluate and execute scientific discovery and endeavors. And I think I think that's going to have huge repercussions for the way that we as a country innovate broadly speaking in the years ahead

### 中美AI竞赛与全球市场

**主持人**: 这就是我们关注中国正在做什么的原因。让我们谈谈中国以及它与美国的关系。我们赢了吗？这关乎芯片吗？这场竞赛具体是关于什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: which is why we're watching what China is doing. Let's talk a bit about China and where it is relative to the United States. Are we winning? Is it about chips? What's the race specifically really about?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，我认为总的来说我们领先于**中国**。堆栈有不同的层级。所以，你有模型，然后是芯片，然后是芯片制造设备。所以你沿着堆栈往下走。我会说，你在堆栈中越深，美国的优势就越大。我认为在模型方面，大多数人会说我们的模型可能领先中国模型大约6个月左右。看看芯片，可能领先2年。如果你去看**半导体制造设备**，可能领先5年。所以美国确实在这方面拥有显著优势。我认为中国只有一两个领域具有优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I I I think that in general we're ahead of **China**. There's different layers of the stack. So, you've got the the the models, then you've got the chips, and you know, then you've got the chipm equipment, you know. So, you go down the stack. I would say that the deeper in in the stack that you go, the greater the American advantage. Um I think on models most people would say that we're our models are maybe 6 months ahead or so plus or minus of the Chinese models. You look at chips maybe 2 years ahead. You go to the **semiconductor manufacturing equipment** it could be like 5 years. So the US does have sign significant advantages there. There's only maybe a couple of areas where I think China has has an advantage.

</details>

**David**: 一个是能源生产。如果你看看他们的电网，他们的电网在过去10年里大约翻了一番，而我们的只增长了大约2%到3%。在美国，能源生产在AI出现之前一直是一个相对沉寂的行业。这很大程度上与法规以及前一届政府对能源生产的厌恶有关。显然，**特朗普总统**对此有非常不同的看法。我认为他在这个问题上很有远见。回到10年前，他就在谈论“**钻啊，宝贝，钻啊**”，我认为他明白能源增长是经济增长的先决条件，它也绝对是AI基础设施增长的先决条件。所以，这是一个我们必须再次扩大能源生产的领域，我认为这是一个我们需要迎头赶上的领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Um one is on **energy production**. And if you look at the their grid, their grid has roughly doubled in the last 10 years, whereas ours has only grown by about 2 to 3%. **Energy production** in the US has been a relatively sleepy industry before AI came along. And a lot of that had to do with regulations and the antipathy of the previous administration towards energy production. Obviously, **President Trump** had a very different view on this. I think he was preient on this issue. you go back 10 years and he was talking about we got a **drill baby drill** and um and I think he understood that energy growth was the precondition for economic growth and it's definitely the pre precondition for this uh AI infrastructure growth. So this is an area where again we have to basically expand our energy production um and I and and and so I think that is an area where we need to catch up.

</details>

**David**: 另一个领域，我不知道这是否能完全称之为优势，但你可以争辩说**中国**在所谓的“**AI乐观主义**”方面占据优势。**斯坦福大学**对各国进行了一项民意调查，他们询问所有这些不同国家的公民，你们觉得AI的好处会更多还是危害会更多？如果你认为总体上好处多于危害，他们就称之为AI乐观主义。在中国，AI乐观主义达到了83%。所以83%的人口认为AI的好处多于危害。而美国这个数字只有39%。所以，出于某种原因，中国人对AI比美国人更乐观，你通常会看到这种情况，亚洲国家对AI乐观主义程度很高，而西方国家则较低。我认为这是一个有趣或开放的问题，关于为什么会这样。我认为有几个可能的解释。首先，媒体倾向于关注AI的“末日和厄运”故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: The other area where I would say, you know, I I don't know if I would call this an advantage exactly, but if you but you could argue that **China** has the edge in what is what's being um called **AI optimism**. So there was a a polling done by **Stanford** across countries and they asked the citizens of all these different countries uh do you feel that the benefits of AI will be more beneficial or more harmful? And if if you thought that it that overall be more beneficial than harmful they call that **AI optimism**. Well in China **AI optimism** was **83%**. So 83% of the population feels that it's being more beneficial than harmful. That number in the United States is only **39%**. So for some reason people in China are more optimistic about AI than in the United States and you generally you generally see this that uh Asian countries are very high on AI optimism in the western countries are lower and I think it's a interesting or open question about why this is. I think there's a few possible explanations for it. I I think that um first of all, the the media tends to focus on the doom and gloom stories with with AI,

</details>

**主持人**: 恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: the fear,

</details>

**David**: 恐惧。我们可以谈谈其中一些恐惧，以及我们是否认为它们是真实的。但我认为媒体对此负有很大责任。我认为**好莱坞**几十年来描绘AI的方式，无论是《**终结者**》还是《**2001太空漫游**》，都描绘了这种反乌托邦的未来景象。我认为这影响了人们的思维。坦率地说，我认为部分责任在于我们的科技领袖，他们并没有很好地描述AI的好处。事实上，当他们谈论AI将淘汰50%的知识工作者时，这听起来不像一个非常乌托邦的场景。对大多数人来说，那听起来是反乌托邦的。所以我确实认为，我们的一些科技领袖无意中助长了这种AI悲观主义。我认为这可能对美国不利的原因是，它再次助长了我们看到的这种监管狂潮，州一级有1200多项法案。而现在，我认为我们正在赢得这场AI竞赛。我们在芯片、模型等所有关键维度上都处于领先地位。但如果我们最终过度监管这项技术，把它扼杀，我们可能会自毁前程，输掉这场AI竞赛。所以我确实担心这个AI乐观主义的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: the fears. Um and we can talk about some of those fears and uh and and how, you know, whether we think they're they're real. Um but I think the media has a lot to do with it. I think that the the way that **Hollywood** has portrayed AI over the decades, you know, with whether it's the **Terminator** or **2001**, uh has you has portrayed this dystopian view of the future. And I think that plays into fuel's thinking. And then frankly, I would say that part of the the fault lies with our tech leaders who haven't necessarily done a great job describing the benefits of AI. In fact, when they're talking about, you know, AI eliminating **50% of knowledge workers**, that doesn't sound like a, you know, very utopian scenario. That sounds dystopian to most people. And so I do think that unintentionally some of our tech leaders have played into this um **AI pessimism**. And the reason why I think this could be a disadvantage for the United States is because again it's feeding into this regulatory frenzy we're seeing again **1,200 bills** at the state level. And right now I think you know we are winning this AI race. We're ahead in all the key dimensions chips models and so on. But we could shoot ourselves in the foot, you know, if we end up overregulating this thing to to death, we could actually cost ourselves this AI race. So, I do worry about this question of **AI optimism**,

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，这是一个很好的观点。如果美国在这方面不是第一，会发生什么，**Michael**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: right? It's a great point. And how what would happen if the US is not number one in this, Michael?

</details>

**Michael**: 是的，我认为我们需要成为第一，这就是我们提出计划的原因。我认为，当我思考中国问题以及我们如何赢得AI竞赛这个更大的问题时，我总是喜欢思考**采纳**这个问题。我认为有时人们过分强调排行榜，比如哪个**前沿模型**在某种指标上排名第一，但现实是，我们势均力敌，正如**David**所说，我们的前沿模型可能领先6到12个月。但我认为我们随着时间的推移和历史进程所看到的是，你不一定需要拥有世界上最好的模型或最好的技术才能在全球范围内普及。我们许多参与第一届**特朗普政府**的人都亲身经历了那个时代的**电信战争**，看到了**华为**在全球范围内的能力。当时，当**华为**首次开始其全球出口攻势时，他们肯定不是世界上最好的技术。他们肯定比**爱立信**和**诺基亚**逊色。但他们足够好，并且获得了足够的补贴，以至于他们成为了世界上许多地区的默认电信系统。我们从中吸取了很多教训，我们非常认真地对待这些教训。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Yeah, I I I think we we need to be and that's why we put put the plan out. I think you know when I think about the the China question and about the the sort of larger question of how do we win the AI race what always what I always like to think about is this question of **adoption** and I think sometimes there's this overemphasis on the leaderboard it's like which **frontier model** is number one on some sort sort of metric and the reality is we're neck and neck and as David said we're probably had you know six to 12 months on our frontier models but I think what we have seen over over time and over history is that um you don't necessarily need to have the very best model or very best piece of technology in the world for it to perforate globally. And a lot of us who were part of the first **Trump administration** saw this very firsthand with the **telecom wars** of that era of what **Huawei** was able to do globally. And at the time when when **Huawei** first started their their sort of global export push um they certainly were not the very best technology in the world. They were current they were certainly you know you know subpar compared to to **Ericen** and **Nokia**. that they were good enough and they were subsidized enough such that they became sort of the default telecom um system for a lot of the world and we've learned a lot of lessons from that and we take that very seriously.

</details>

**Michael**: 谈到AI，我们知道中国人有雄心出口他们的模型，让这些模型为全球南方和世界其他地区的所有不同用例提供动力。这就是为什么总统启动了名为“**美国AI出口计划**”的项目。我们的使命，我认为我们现在处于一个非常幸运的位置，与我们处理**华为**问题时相比，正如**David**所说，我们在堆栈的几乎每个部分都占据主导地位。我们拥有最好的模型。我们拥有各种应用程序。我们拥有最好的芯片。所以，我们现在处于强势地位，作为一个国家，我们有责任与世界各地的所有合作伙伴和盟友分享这项技术。确保世界上任何想要使用AI构建新应用程序的开发人员都在美国芯片之上微调美国模型。这不是一个难以实现的现实。我认为我们很容易就能做到这一点，仅仅因为我们拥有最好的技术。这是我们去年年底启动的一个项目，今年我们正在大力推动将其付诸实施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: When it comes to AI, we know there's ambition for the Chinese to export their models and have them be the models that are powering all these different use cases across across the global south and across the rest of the world. Um, that's why the president launched something called the **American AI export program** and our mission and I think we're in a very lucky position here compared to what we're dealing with with **Huawei** is as David said, we are dominant in almost every part of the stack. We have the very best models. We have the various applications. We have the very best chips. So, we are in a position of power now and is up to us as a country to share that technology with the world with all of our partners and allies. make sure that any developer anywhere in the world that wants to build a new application using AI is using is fine-tuning an American model on top of an American chip. And that isn't that isn't a a hard reality to see. That is something that I think we can very easily do just because we have the very best tech. That's a program that um we launched last late last year and we're doing a big push this year to get that get that out the door.

</details>

**主持人**: 你提到将AI出口到世界各地，这是一个重要的观点。中国是否正在告诉其公司现在不要使用美国芯片，不要使用美国AI，这是真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's an important point that you make in terms of exporting AI to the rest of the world. Is it true that China is telling its companies don't use American chips, don't use American AI right now?

</details>

**David**: 似乎是这样。我的意思是，中国正在开发自己的模型。显然，大约一年前，你看到了**DeepSeek**时刻，**DeepSeek**发布了一个强大的模型，我认为这在某种程度上让中国的AI崭露头角。我认为西方人当时并没有意识到中国在生产模型方面有多么出色，并且对我们相对地位存在一些自满情绪。两年前，人们并没有真正谈论全球竞争。根本没有讨论过。我记得当时**拜登政府**制定了这份长达100页的**拜登AI监管行政命令**。没有人谈论这是否会减缓我们，所有这些监管是否会减缓我们。与中国相比根本不在讨论范围之内。然后**DeepSeek**发布了，我认为我们确实意识到我们身处全球竞争中，我们必须赢，这就是为什么我们必须非常小心地进行监管，确保我们不会过度监管。但我认为中国肯定想竞争。最近有一些报道，我认为**彭博社**和**路透社**报道称，他们实际上不允许**英伟达**芯片进入他们的国家，我们认为这样做的原因是他们想实现芯片生产的本土化。他们想让**华为**成为他们的民族冠军，并通过排除竞争对手，有效地为**华为**创造市场补贴。所以，他们正在保护自己的市场，以扶持**华为**。我认为他们的计划是让**华为**首先主导中国的芯片市场，然后利用这一点扩大规模，然后试图接管世界其他地区。芯片生产是一个规模化业务。所以，你知道，如果他们能首先主导中国市场，那将为他们提供一个强大的平台，然后向世界其他地区扩张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: It it it seems so. Um I mean China is developing its own models. Obviously about a year ago you had the **Deepseek moment** where you you had a powerful model released by **Deep Seek** and I think that kind of put Chinese uh AI on the map in a way. I think people in the west didn't realize you in a way how good China was at producing models and there was a little bit of complacency uh towards our relative position. People weren't really talking about the global competition two years ago. It wasn't really discussed at all. Uh I remember when you know the **Biden administration** created this you know **100page Biden executive order** regulating AI. No one was talking about whether this might slow whether all this regulation would slow us down. Visa v China wasn't even part of the conversation. Then **Deepseek** launched and I think we did realize we're in a global competition and we have to win and that's why we have to actually be quite careful about how we regulate this and not make sure we're not overregulating it. But I think you know China definitely wants to compete. Um there have been some stories recently I think uh **Bloomberg** and **Reuters** reported that they actually are not allowing **Nvidia** chips into their country and the reason for that we think is that they want to indigenize chip production. They want to stand up **Huawei** as their national champion and effectively they're creating a market subsidy for **Huawei** by keeping out the competition. So, they're protecting their market to stand up **Huawei**. And I think their plan would be to have **Huawei** dominate chips in China first and then use that to scale up and then try to take over the rest of the world. Chip production is a scale up business. So, you know, if they can dominate the Chinese market first, that gives them a powerful platform to then proliferate to the rest of the world.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，**Michael**，我们在这方面进展如何？我的意思是，你们首先提出了AI行动计划，然后又提出了一个将AI出口到世界其他地区的计划。你能告诉我们在这方面我们进展如何吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, so where are we in that, Michael? I mean, first you all came up with the AI action plan, then came up with another plan in terms of exporting AI to the rest of the world. What can you tell us in terms of where we are in that?

</details>

**Michael**: 是的，所以这方面正在取得进展。我们去年年底结束了商务部的信息征询，该征询向业界发出，询问：“嘿，如果我们想出口美国AI堆栈，我们应该考虑什么？我们应该如何设计这些与世界分享的软件包？”商务部现在正在消化这些信息。很快就会发布一份征求建议书。届时，我们实际上希望公司能够联合起来组成**联盟**，并说：“看，这就是一个软件包的样子。”我认为，你知道，我总是试图提醒人们的是，世界各地AI的购买者在复杂程度上差异很大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: Yeah, so the the progress is is moving on that. We um we closed a request for information from the **commerce department** late last year, which went out to industry and said, "Hey, if we want to export the American AI stack, what should we be thinking about? How should we be designing these packages that we share with the world?" **Commerce** is now ingesting that that information. There'll be a request for proposals that comes out very shortly. And that's where we actually want companies to come together to form **consortia** and say like look this is what a package looks like. And I think what um you know what what people need to sort what I always try to remind people is that the the the the buyers of AI around the world um vary quite dramatically in their level of sophistication.

</details>

**Michael**: 所以在美国，如果你是一家非常，你知道，**财富50强**公司，并且你想部署AI，你有一个相当复杂的**首席信息官**或**首席技术官**部门，你会非常仔细地考虑你想购买哪个云，你想使用哪个潜在模型，你想在自己的数据上进行微调吗？你想构建自己的应用程序吗？你知道，你会去看看哪个应用程序？你可以测试各种东西。你喜欢去所有这些第三方并评估哪个是最好的。这是一个非常复杂的组合，关于你如何最终为你的特定公司创建最佳解决方案。对于世界上许多渴望为其人民使用AI或支持服务（无论是医疗保健、税收征集或其他任何服务）的国家来说，你知道，他们没有数十亿美元的IT预算，他们只是想弄清楚我可以在我的国家使用什么工具来为我的人民带来AI的好处。所以我们非常仔细地思考如何制定解决方案，你可以称之为“**交钥匙工程**”，或者你如何提供一个可以在一个国家轻松部署的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: So in the US, if you're a very sort of, you know, if you're a **Fortune50 company** and you want to deploy AI, you have a pretty sophisticated sort of **CIO** or **CTO** shop, you are thinking very carefully about like which cloud you want to buy, which potential model you want to use, do you want to fine-tune it on your own data? Do you want to build your own application? You know, what application you go and see? You can like test various things. You like go to all these third parties and evaluate which is best. And it's a very sort of complicated mix of how you end up creating something that's optimum for your particular company. for a lot of countries around the world that are aspiring to to use AI for their people or to support the services whether it be health care or um you know tax collection or whatever it may be um you know they don't have a a you know billion dollar **IT budget** you know they're just trying to figure out what is a tool that I can use in my country to deliver the benefits of AI to my people so we think very carefully around how can we craft solutions which you know **turn keys** could be one way to put it or how do you how do you provide a solution that can easily be deployed in a country.

**Michael**: 而在这个辩论中经常被卷入的问题是，你知道，美国将向世界各地发送多少芯片？我总是试图提醒人们的是，你知道，除了美国、中国和少数其他国家，世界上大多数国家都没有资金或愿望进行大规模训练运行或开发自己的**前沿模型**。世界上很少有国家会建造那种巨型训练中心。世界上大多数国家需要较小的数据中心，这些数据中心只拥有与推理相关的芯片，可以驱动并进行政府想要进行的特定运行的推理。所以我认为我们正在非常努力地做的是，创建这些**交钥匙式**、规模适中的AI解决方案，然后我们可以与我们的许多出口金融组织合作，比如**发展金融公司**或**进出口银行**，使这种特定堆栈的出口在那些不那么深入的国家更具吸引力和商业可行性。下个月我们将在**印度**参加**印度AI影响力峰会**。这是AI领域最大的全球聚会。我们将在那里分享更多关于这个项目进展的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: and what's often you know what often sort of gets caught up in this debate is this question of you know how many chips is the US going to be sending around the world and and what I always try to remind people is that you know outside of the US China and maybe a few other countries most countries around the world do not have the capital or the aspiration to do largecale training runs or development of their own **frontier models** there are very few countries around the world that are going to build sort of colossus style training centers most countries around the world need smaller data centers that just have **inference related chips** that can drive and and and do the you know do the inference on on the particular um runs that the government wants to have. So I think what we're working very hard to do is is is create sort of these these these **turnkey** manageablysized AI solutions that then we can partner with a lot of our export finance organizations like **Development Finance Corporation** or the **Export Import Bank** to make the export of that particular stack much more appealing and commercially viable in countries that are not extraordinarily deeped. Um so we're going to be in **India** next month for the **India** um **AI impact summit**. Um, this is sort of the largest global gathering for for AI folks. Um, and we're going to be sharing a lot more on on the progress of this uh of this program there.

**主持人**: 你想补充吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You want to weigh in?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，我只是想补充一点。我认为人们有时会问，你知道，你如何知道你是否赢得了AI竞赛，你知道，与中国，与其他国家。我认为有一个非常简单的答案，那就是**市场份额**。你知道，如果五年后我们环顾世界，看到到处都在使用美国芯片和模型，那意味着我们赢了。但如果五年后我们环顾世界，看到的是**华为**芯片和**DeepSeek**模型，那就会非常糟糕，对吧？那将是一个不好的迹象。那意味着我们输了。所以我确实认为美国技术的扩散或传播对于赢得这场AI竞赛至关重要。我们从**硅谷**知道，最终变得庞大的公司是那些创建生态系统的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I just just to build on that. I think people sometimes ask, you know, h how do you how will you know if if you've won the AI race, you know, with with with China with with other countries and I think there's a very simple answer to that which is **market share**. You know, if 5 years we look around the world and we see that it's American chips and models are being used everywhere, well that means we won. But if in 5 years we look around the world and it's **Huawei** chips and **Deepseek** models, then that would be very bad, right? That would be a bad sign. That means that we lost. So I do think that the proliferation or diffusion of American technology is really critical to winning this AI race. We know from **Silicon Valley** that the companies that end up becoming huge are the ones that create **ecosystems**.

</details>

**David**: 作为一个科技公司，你希望在你的应用商店里有最多的应用程序。你希望有最多的开发者在你的**API**之上编写代码。你希望成为一个**平台公司**。所以在所有这些技术竞赛中，最大的生态系统获胜。我们希望拥有最大的生态系统，这就是为什么我认为这个项目如此重要，我们希望创建最大的生态系统。现在，这不仅仅是为了美国受益，因为要拥有一个成功的生态系统，你必须为你的合作伙伴创造价值，这非常重要，就像**Michael**说的，不是每个国家都会在开发自己的芯片或开发自己的**前沿模型**方面处于领先地位，但他们可以利用这些工具来获取价值，将其应用于他们的业务，应用于他们的经济，提取价值，并成为这场技术革命的一部分。所以我认为，你知道，我们必须以这种合作伙伴的心态来思考，我确实认为这种心态在**硅谷**非常普遍。就像我提到的，我认为所有伟大的科技公司都以“我们如何让最多的人使用我们的技术堆栈”来思考，但这是一种对**华盛顿**官僚机构来说相当陌生的思维方式，后者更多地是一种“命令与控制”的心态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: It's the, you know, you you you as a technology company, you want to have the most apps in your **app store**. You want to have the most developers writing on top of your **API**. You want to be a **platform company**. And so in all these technology races, biggest ecosystem wins. And we want to have the so that's basically why I think this program is so important is we want to create the biggest ecosystem. Now this is not only about benefiting the US because in order to have a successful ecosystem you have to create value for your partners and that's really important like Michael's saying not every country is going to be on the cutting edge of developing its own chips or developing its own **frontier models** but they can use these tools to derive value to apply them to their businesses to their economies to extract value and be part of this technological revolution. So I think that you know we have to think in this with this **partner mindset** and I do think that this this type of mindset is actually very common to **Silicon Valley**. Like I mentioned I think every great technology company thinks in terms of how do we get the most people on top of our tech stack but it is a form of thinking that's pretty alien to the bureaucracy in **Washington** which has much more of a **command and control** type of mindset.

</details>

**David**: 当**特朗普总统**上任时，我举几个例子，那些摆在我们桌上的、由前任政府移交的法规，我们又看到了这份100页的**拜登AI行政命令**，都是新的法规，还有一份200页的，叫做**拜登扩散规则**，那是200页关于半导体出口的法规。所以我们正在将AI产业的模型和芯片变成一个高度管制的产业。这基本上就是**华盛顿**当时的方向。而**特朗普总统**上任第一周做的第一件事就是废除了所有这些不公正的法规，我认为这绝对是关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: and when **President Trump** came into office, just give a couple examples of this, the regulations that were sitting on our desk that had just been handed down by our predecessors, again, we had this **100page Biden executive order on AI** that was all this new regulation and there was a **200page** uh was called the **Biden diffusion rule**, which was **200 pages of regulations** uh on the export of semiconductors. So we were turning the the AI industry models and chips into a highly regulated industry. That was that was basically the direction that **Washington** was going in. And the first thing **President Trump** did his first week in office was rescend all of those unust regulations which I think was absolutely critical.

</details>

**David**: 你知道，真正让**硅谷**特别的是“**无许可创新**”这个概念。你知道，自从**惠普**85年前开始建设**硅谷**以来，这个想法一直是，只要几个创始人有一个好主意，他们就可以创办自己的公司，他们会得到一些天使投资人的种子资金。这些投资者认为他们可能会亏钱，但他们觉得有机会。所以，可能是车库里的两个人，也可能是宿舍里的辍学生，他们不需要去**华盛顿**获得他们想法的许可，这就是**无许可创新**，它让**硅谷**成为了世界的瑰宝，这就是为什么这么多国家元首来到这里总是问我们如何创建自己的**硅谷**。这不是我们**特朗普总统**上任时的方向，**拜登政府**留给我们的关于AI的300页新法规，本会把这种**无许可创新**的环境变成一个你必须去**华盛顿**获得想法批准的环境。我认为**特朗普总统**确实纠正了这一点，从那时起，我们一直在实施他的AI行动计划，该计划完全是关于**支持创新**、**支持基础设施**、**支持能源**和**支持出口**的，所以我认为这是一个彻底的改变，我认为仅仅在过去一年里，你就看到了它的成果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: You know the thing that really makes **Silicon Valley** special is this concept of **permissionless innovation**. you know, since um **Hulin** and **Packard** started 85 years ago, started building **Silicon Valley**, it's it the idea has always been that just a couple of founders kind of a great idea start their company, they get some angel investors to write, you know, a check for, you know, seed capital. Those investors think they're probably going to lose their money, but they figure there's a shot. and you know and it's so it could be the two guys in their garage or it could be the college dropout in the dorm room and they don't need to go to **Washington** to get permission for their idea right it's **permissionless innovation** that's what's has made **Silicon Valley** the crown jewel of the world it's why so many of the I think heads of state who are here are always asking how do we create our own **Silicon Valley** that was not the direction we were on when **President Trump** came into office the new **300 pages of regulations** concerning AI the **Biden administration** left us with would have changed this um environment of **permissionless innovation** to an environment of you have to go to **Washington** to get approval for your idea and I think that **President Trump** really corrected that and since then we've been implementing you know his **AI action plan** uh which is all about you know **pro innovation** **pro infrastructure** **pro energy** and **pro export** so it's been I think a total change and I think just in the past year you've seen the results of that

</details>

**Michael**: 我认为还需要补充一点。我们关于AI的国际议程一部分显然是出口，但另一部分是努力与所有合作伙伴和盟友分享，如何才能真正创建一个允许这项技术成功的监管环境。我们现在在**欧洲**，我认为我们许多曾尝试与欧洲科技公司合作的人都遇到了很多障碍和挫折，无论如何，**德拉吉报告**发布了，他可以说存在很多问题。但情况似乎从未真正改变。我认为所有这些，即我们美国监管结构的设计方式以及创业精神在美国蓬勃发展的方式，都是我们努力与世界各国分享的。我认为世界上大多数政策制定者的普遍膝跳反应是走向一个痴迷于**预防原则**的角落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: and I think what one thing to to add there Um part of the the international uh agenda that we have on AI is one obviously let's let's do the export but the other piece is trying to share with all of our partners and allies how you can actually create a regatory environment that allows this technology to succeed and here we are in **Europe** and I think many of us that sort of have you know tried to work with technology companies in **Europe** have have hit sort of a lot of roadblocks and a lot of stumbles and no matter you know the **drug reporting** came out and and he can say that there's a lot of issues But things don't ever seem to seem to really change. And I think all of that that the the the way that our regulatory structure is is designed in the US and the way that the entrepreneurial spirit thrives in the US is something that we try to share with countries all around the world. And I think the the the general um knee-jerk reaction for most policy makers around the world is one that moves to a corner that is obsessed with the **precautionary principle**.

</details>

**Michael**: 这个概念是，每当有新事物出现时，政策制定者的职责就是坐在一个房间里，把所有可能出错的事情都列出来，然后设计法规来确保这些错误的事情，这些假设性的错误事情不会发生。而实际上，我们在美国所做的，我们努力做的是坐在一个房间里，把我们可以创建哪些规则来真正释放创新列出来。我们应该移除哪些规则来允许更多的创新发生？我认为这种心态是我们不断努力在所有这些国际论坛上分享的。美国，你知道，已经对哪种监管结构有效和成功进行了**AB测试**。你知道，我们已经看到了**欧洲**在过去20年里是如何处理这个问题的，我们也看到了美国做了什么。所以我认为这个秘诀是显而易见的，但有时我们必须不断向我们的同行重复。我喜欢**德拉吉报告**，因为它非常清楚地指出了欧洲的公司，你知道，像**诺和诺德**是一家3500亿或4000亿美元的公司，而在美国，我们有万亿美元的公司，**英伟达**达到了5万亿美元。那么创新的路径是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael**: this concept that every time something new comes out, the role of the policy maker is to sort of like sit in a room and whiteboard everything that could go wrong and then design regulations to make sure those wrong things, these hypothetical wrong things don't happen. When in reality, what we do in the US, what we try to do is sit in a room and whiteboard what rules we can create to actually unlock innovation. What are the ones we should remove to allow more innovation to happen? And I think that mindset is something that we constantly try to share at all these international fora. The US has you know there has been an **AB test** on what regulatory structure works and what succeeds. You know we've seen how the how how **Europe** has approached this in the last 20 years and we've seen what the US has done. So I think the the recipe is kind of obvious but but sometimes we have to just keep repeating it to to our counterparts. And I love the **Draghy report** because it was so clearly uh identifying companies that are in **Europe** that you know like no **Novo Nordus** is like **350 billion** or **$400 billion** company and in America we've had companies of **trillion dollar companies** **Nvidia** hitting**$5 trillion**. So so what is the path to innovation?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，我认为部分原因在于，我认为这可能是美国心态和欧洲心态之间的区别，即最终美国的创新来自于私营部门。它来自于创业者、创始人、创新者，以及那些有想法的天才。我认为政府认为自己的角色，至少在正确思考这个问题时，是作为促成者，只是制定规则。也许设置一些护栏，但基本上是让创业者去创造，这就是你获得创新的方式。现在我不想过多批评我们的欧洲东道主，但你知道，当**欧盟**谈论AI领导力时，他们谈论的是监管者，他们认为他们的附加价值是，我们将向全世界展示AI的监管模式。所以，这有点像一种糟糕的“**主角综合症**”，你知道，监管者认为他们是主角。不，看，监管者是配角。主角永远是创业者。必须是创新者。这就是你释放创新的方式。当你开始把自己，我的意思是，监管者和政策制定者视为主角时，那不是一个很好的创新秘诀。我认为，关于欧洲AI问题，一个次要的观点是，你知道，对欧洲AI生态系统造成如此大损害的**欧盟AI法案**甚至在**ChatGPT**发明之前就通过了，这显示了这里的挑战。你相信你可以解决某种问题，或者你正在解决一些问题，但最终创新发展得如此之快，最终那条规则在当今**前沿模型**和**大型语言模型**的世界中毫无意义，他们不得不对其进行修改。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I I I think part of it is and I I I think this is the difference between maybe the American mindset and the European mindset towards this is that ultimately the innovation in the United States comes from the **private sector**. It comes from the entrepreneurs, the founders, the innovators, the geniuses with an idea. And I think that the government sees its role, at least when it's thinking properly about this, as being an enabler and as just setting the rules of the road. um and maybe putting in some guard rails, but basically it's letting the entrepreneurs cook and that's how you get innovation. And now I don't want to bash our European host too much, but you know the when when the uh when the **EU** talks about **AI leadership**, they're talking about the regulators and they think their value ad is well, we're going to we're going to show the whole world the regulatory model for AI. So, it's kind of a bad case of u **main character syndrome** where uh you know where like the regulators think they're the main characters in this. No, look, the regulators are the supporting players. The main characters always have to be the entrepreneurs. It's got to be the innovators. That's how you unlock innovation. When the when you start to see yourself, I mean, the the regulators and the policy makers as the as the main characters, that's not a great recipe for innovation. And I think just just a minor point on the on the AI stuff in **Europe** that you know the **EUAI act** which has been so detrimental to to the AI ecosystem here here in **Europe** was passed before **chat GPT** was even invented and that shows the challenge here. You're you're you're believing that you can solve some kind of problem or some you're solving something but the end of the day innovation is moving so much more quickly and ultimately that that rule makes no sense now in a world of of **frontier models** **large language models** and they have to sort of edit it.

### AI的风险与未来展望

**主持人**: 那么，在我提出问题之前，让我先反驳一下，请你指出所有这些中的任何风险、威胁或下行风险。我们应该担心AI使用的哪些方面？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, let me push back before we go and ask you to identify any risks or threats or downside risks in all of this. What should we be worried about if anything with regard to AI usage?

</details>

**David**: 嗯，我认为存在**奥威尔式**的AI场景，我认为我们应该对此感到担忧。再说一次，我倾向于认为这些场景是由**乔治·奥威尔**描述的，而不是由**詹姆斯·卡梅隆**和《**终结者**》描述的。具体来说，是政府对AI的滥用。我确实认为AI可以被用作一种工具，用于监视、审查，甚至可能对民众进行**洗脑**。这就是为什么本届政府对所谓的“**觉醒AI**”采取了如此坚定的立场，我几乎认为这个名字可能轻视了我们所谈论的问题的严重性。我们谈论的是AI内置了**政治偏见**。而且这种偏见可能非常微妙，以至于人们甚至不一定会随着时间的推移而注意到，但它对人们被允许学习、思考和了解什么，以及孩子们学习什么，都会产生巨大的影响。所以我认为确保AI在政治上是无偏见的非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I I think there are **Orwellian scenarios** uh of AI that I think we should be concerned about. And again, I I tend to think that those scenarios were described by **George Orwell**, not by, you know, **James Cameron** and the **Terminator**. And specifically, it's misuse of AI by government. I do think that AI could be used as a tool to um surveil, to censor, to even potentially **brainwash** the population. This is why the administration has taken such a firm stance against what it's called **woke AI**, which I almost think that that name maybe trivializes the magnitude of the problem we're talking about. We're talking about AI having a **political bias** built into it. Um, and it the bias can be so subtle that people don't even necessarily notice over time, but it has a huge impact on what people are allowed to learn and think and know and what you know children learn. And so I think it's very important that we try to make sure that AI was politically unbiased.

</details>

**David**: 在这方面，我们对**拜登AI行政命令**如此担忧的一点是，我们在第一周就废除了它，因为它有20页关于**DEI**的语言，它宣扬了AI模型需要内置**DEI层**的想法。你知道，这就是你最终看到**黑色乔治·华盛顿**的故事，**Gemini**的第一个版本发布时，它基本上是在改写历史，以服务于当前**DEI**的政治议程。你知道，那种偏见案例是如此荒谬，以至于所有人都嘲笑它。但它让你明白，如果你开始将偏见内置到AI中，会发生什么。你知道，那个所谓的“**信任与安全**”机制，最初被内置到社交媒体网站中，作为审查、去平台化和**影子禁令**的一种方式。你可以看到它被内置到AI模型中，作为一种非常严肃地控制公共话语的方式。我认为，你知道，**特朗普总统**再次完全阻止了这一点，你知道，废除了它。但我们还，**特朗普总统**还签署了一项行政命令，规定联邦政府不会采购有政治偏见的AI。所以，看，基于**第一修正案**，如果一家AI公司希望其AI在某个方向上存在偏见，他们可能拥有**第一修正案**的权利这样做。但我们作为联邦政府有权不购买该软件，我们已经表示我们不会。所以，我非常高兴在**特朗普总统**接下来的三年任期内，这种**奥威尔式AI**的想法不会成为问题。但我确实担心，在未来的某个时候，如果**华盛顿**出现不同的政权，你知道，如果联邦政府开始向AI公司施压，要求它们内置这种政治偏见，那将是对我们自由的非常严重的威胁。这是一个很好的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Um there just in this regard, one of the things that we were so concerned about with that **Biden executive order on AI** that we were sended in the first week is that it had 20 pages of language on **DEI** and it was promoting this idea that AI models need to build in a **DEI layer**. Well, you know, this is how you ended up with, you know, the the the **black George Washington** uh you know, story where that the first version of of uh **Gemini** came out and it was, you know, it was basically rewriting history to serve a current political agenda of **DEI**. And um you know that that was in a way that that that case of bias was so ludicrous that everyone kind of laughed at it. But it gives you a sense of what could happen if you start to build the the bias into AI and you know that same you know so-called **trust and safety apparatus** that was starting to be built into social media sites as a way to censor and deplatform and **shadowban**. You could see that being built into AI models as a way to control uh the the public discourse in in a very serious way. And I think that, you know, **President Trump** again just put a total halt to that, you know, rescended that. But it was also we also um **President Trump** signed an executive order saying that the federal government would not procure politically biased AI. So look, on a **first amendment basis**, if an AI company wants its AI to be biased in some direction, they probably have a **first amendment right** to do that. But we have as the federal government have the discretion not to buy that software and we've said that we won't. So, I feel very good that during **President Trump's** uh term in office for the next three years, this idea of **Orwellian AI** is not going to be a problem. But I do worry that at some point in the future, if you had a different regime in **Washington**, you know, if the federal government started to pressure AI companies to build in this political bias, that would be a very serious threat, I think, to to our freedoms. It's a it's a great point to make.

**主持人**: 在我们快速结束关于就业的话题之前，你们谁能解释一下**埃隆·马斯克**关于AI影响的说法？他说我们不需要工作了。你知道，AI会做所有事情。我只是想理解他说的是什么，他说我们要去度假了。工作会消失，AI会做所有事情。

</details>

**David**: 嗯，**埃隆**是我的朋友，我在这方面会稍微不同意他的观点，但让我解释一下。他关于**失业**的评论显然吸引了所有头条新闻，但同时他也说，在未来，物质将如此丰富，以至于每个人都会拥有他们想要的一切，而且将不再有金钱。所以人们忽略了故事的这一部分，他们只报道**埃隆**说每个人都会失业。不，我们谈论的是一个截然不同的未来。它可能是《**星际迷航**》中描述的未来，你知道，那里没有金钱，因为我们拥有一切。看，我认为，你知道，**埃隆**在方向上对未来是正确的。我认为我们正在走向一个物质极大丰富、每个人生活水平提高、生产力更高的世界。我认为这将导致工资上涨。我不认为它会让人人都失业。我不认为那会发生。但再说一次，时间线非常重要。你知道，一个没有金钱的世界，在未来5年内是不会发生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, **Elvon's** a friend of mine and um I'll I'll uh I I'll disagree with him slightly on this, but um but but let me just the his comment about the the **job loss** obviously is what gets all the headlines, but at the same time he's saying that he's also saying that in this future there's going to be so much **abundance** that everyone's going to have what they want and there's not going to be any money. So people people leave out that part of the story and they just report **Elon** says everyone's going to lose their jobs. No, we're talking about a radically different future. It could be the future. It's kind of described in **Star Trek**, you know, where like there is no money because we have everything. Look, I I think that, you know, **Elon** is directionally correct about the future. I think we are heading toward toward uh towards a world of much greater **abundance**, rising living standards for everybody, greater **productivity**. I think that will lead to rising wages. I don't think it's going to put everyone out of work. I don't think that's going to happen. Uh but again, the timelines matter a lot. And you know, getting to a world with no money is not something that's going to happen in the next 5 years.
