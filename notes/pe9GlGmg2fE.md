### 薯条的成本与定价

**Bart Hutchins**: 你们的顾客在意价格吗？噢，老天，他们当然在意。我一直在思考这个问题。现在是年底，我正在核算数字，这是有投资人的时候必须做的事。我专门研究了**薯条**的价格，我们以**牛脂薯条**闻名，被认为是华盛顿特区最好的薯条。目前菜单上的价格是 12 美元一份。我翻看了 2019 年的老菜单，薯条是一样的，我一直这么做。当时的价格是 9 美元。我心想，哇，涨得真厉害，12 美元一份薯条确实挺贵的。于是我开始研究商品成本和涉及的劳动力，我意识到，如果我想在现在的 12 美元薯条上获得与当年 9 美元时相同的利润率，现在的定价实际上应该是 25 美元。

**Bart Hutchins**: Do your customers care about price? Oh, boy. They do. I've been thinking about this a lot. So I was—you know, it's the end of the year, so I'm doing numbers and all those things you have to do when you have investors. And I was looking at the price of French fries specifically, and we've been noted for the French fries and the beef tallow fries and the best fries in D.C. and whatever. And I think they're on the menu right now for 12 bucks an order. And I was looking at an old menu of mine from restaurant, you know, in 2019, and they were all the same fries. I've been making the same fries forever. They were on the menu for nine bucks an order, and I was like, wow, you know, we've really gone up. 12 bucks is kind of expensive for an order of fries. Like, is there any room for this? And I started sort of digging into the price of goods and the labor involved and realized that, like, if I wanted the same sort of margins on that $9 order fries that I have on my now $12 order fries, they would actually be 25 bucks.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哇。所以商品成本基本上吞噬了利润。大家好，欢迎收看新一期的 **Odd Lots** 播客。我是 **Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Wow. So like, we've just sort of like the the cost of goods is like eviscerated sort of the margins on that. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是 **Tracy Alloway**。Joe，几周前我们在华盛顿特区参加会议，在那儿吃了一顿大餐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Alloway. Tracy, we were down in DC several weeks ago. We were at that iaff conference and, we had a great meal and we were in town.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。我们去了一家叫 **Butterworth's** 的地方，那里现在名气很大。它强调有机食材，还有一些罕见的肉类。我记得我们吃了**骨髓**，Tracy 你很爱吃那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We did indeed. So we had a good meal. Yeah, we went to a place called Butterworth's, which is getting a lot of buzz. Yeah, it's been getting a lot of buzz for a while and sort of serves, I don't want to say farm to table because that's not really it, but like an emphasis on organic tonic, maybe like rarer cuts of meat. I remember we had bone marrow, which you love.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我爱死骨髓了。我们还吃了非常有名的薯条，用牛脂炸的，没有**种子油**，非常时髦。我还记得有**鹅肝**。我喜欢做餐厅主题的节目，因为如果你想了解经济，无论是短期内的食品和劳动力成本，还是人们的消费意愿，餐厅都是一个完美的缩影。它结合了劳动力投入、租金和供应链问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I love bone marrow. We had really good fries, which famously. And we'll probably get beef tallow, no seed oils, very, very, very hip, very strong. So I'm pretty sure we had, something with foie gras, which I love. I love doing, restaurant episodes, period. Because if you want to understand the economy, both in the sort of short term like where we are on this, like with food costs and labor costs and, how, you know, free spending people are they're a great snapshot in any given time. They're just this perfect combination of labor cost inputs and rent, which is like the whole economy there. There's also the supply chain issue.

</details>

### “MAGA 餐厅”的标签

**Joe Weisenthal**: 还有一个有趣的文化元素。如今一切都具有文化和政治色彩，包括餐厅。Butterworth's 被描述为一种“**MAGA 聚点**”。在华盛顿，你似乎必须选择立场。我们的嘉宾就是这家餐厅的主厨兼老板 **Bart Hutchins**。Bart，感谢参加节目。到底什么是“MAGA 餐厅”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: There's also an interesting cultural element in this. And like everything is cultural and political nowadays, including the restaurant. Yes, because Butterworth's has been described as a sort of right wing. Yeah, MAGA hangout. So we should talk about that too. We're going to be speaking with Bart Hutchins. Bart, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. What does it mean? What's a maga restaurant?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 噢，天哪，从哪儿说起呢？在华盛顿，现在的流行文化就是政治。政客们在哪些餐厅吃饭，决定了这家餐厅的名声。我们开业两个月后，新政府就上台了，我们在国会山附近积累了一批追随者。现在它被称为 MAGA 餐厅，因为那些人确实在那儿。早期我们有很多来自政府部门的客户，比如 **Scott Batson**、**Marco Rubio**、**Steve Bannon** 等。如果我们在纽约华尔街附近开店，可能就会被称为“华尔街餐厅”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: Oh, God. Where do we start? In DC, the version of that now that sort of politics or pop culture is like what politicians are eating at these restaurants and that sort of becomes what you're known for. And so early on, we were on the hill. And so we developed a following among the new administration that came in like two months after we opened. And so now it is a Maga restaurant, because that's like an interesting way to talk about the restaurant. Because they're there. And so early on, we had a lot of customers from the administration from like Scott Batson to Marco Rubio, Steve Bannon, whatever it may be. But like if, if we did what we did it Butterworth's in New York, it would be like the Wall Street restaurant.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但这不完全是巧合吧？你的合伙人之一 **Raheem Kassam** 曾是 **Breitbart** 伦敦站的编辑，和 Steve Bannon 共事过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, it is not quite true that it's like, oh, you opened the restaurant before the new administration and they started, I mean, you're one of your co-owners. I think there's like, affiliated with Breitbart UK. I mean, there are Butterworth. Yeah, named after him. There are there are political routes to the restaurant. Right.

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 当然。我们有六位投资人，其中两位是坚定的传统自由派，几位是偏向 MAGA 的保守派。Raheem 确实和那届政府有很多联系。开业第一晚，我们有 60 个预订，其中大概 45 个都是 Raheem 带来的朋友。MAGA 这个标签就是这样产生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: Totally. I mean, this this is part of being in DC. We have six investors, I think two—the third one, I would have to ask because he's like a tech bro. But two of them are pretty solidly like classic libs. And a few of them are pretty, pretty like MAGA adjacent conservatives. I will say the one you're talking about, Raheem Kassam, he used to work with Steve Bannon, was the Breitbart editor in London. One of our investors, when we started, when we opened the place, you sort of invite all your friends and family, and that's how you sort of get the business going. And it turns out he was just way better at it than the rest of us. Right. So, like the first night we were open, there's like 60 reservations and I'm pretty sure like 45 of them were from Rahim. And so the MAGA thing did sort of generate in that way.

### 餐厅投资与经营逻辑

**Tracy Alloway**: 一般来说，投资餐厅生意有多难？尤其是在华盛顿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How difficult is it to get investors for a restaurant business in general, but also specifically in DC?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 这是一个糟糕的投资。如果你是为了财务回报，千万别投。但如果你是为了给自己找个地方，永远能有好的位子，能邀请朋友，能在晚宴上有谈资，那它是最好的投资之一。但作为商业投资，尤其是在疫情后，**利润率**简直是个笑话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: It's like it's a terrible investment, right? Like if you're if you're listening to this for financial advice, don't do it. If you're looking to sort of build for yourself a place to be to always have the good table, to invite your friends, to have something to talk about at dinner parties. It's one of the best investments, right? But as a, as a business investment, it's like the worst, especially post-Covid. Like the margins are joke.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谈谈菜单吧。你是如何构思整体菜单的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's talk about the menu. We I mean, the whole team came. Everyone loved the meal. Like, how do you go about the process of sort of conceptualizing the overall menu?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 我们的核心是与农民合作。我有一批合作了十年的农民，大多是宾夕法尼亚州的**阿米什人**（Amish）和门诺派教徒。他们不怎么用电子设备。每周一我会接到他们的电话，告诉我这周地里长出了什么，哪些动物要宰杀。菜单就基于这些食材。这导致我们无法每天提供相同的菜品。传统的餐饮业教条说“一致性”最重要，但那会让你依赖全球供应链。我们则是地里长出什么，我们就做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: So our specifically is working with farmers. So I have a host of farmers that I've been working with as a chef for I guess, a decade now. And most of them are the, the sort of Pennsylvania Amish and Mennonites. So, you know, the sort of not technologically plugged in folks. And so it's I get a call from them on Mondays, like, go, this is sort of what's coming out of the ground this week. These are which animals are being slaughtered? Which ones do you want? And then those products come in and the menu is based off of that, which sort of, doesn't really allow you to have the same dish on the menu every single day, which is a classic sort of trope of the restaurant industry.

</details>

### 汉堡难题与供应链

**Tracy Alloway**: 听说你们不供应**汉堡**，是因为不想让大家都只点汉堡吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Is it true that you don't serve burgers because you don't want everyone to just go into the restaurant and order a burger all the time?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: **汉堡难题**是我生存的痛苦之源。多年前我在附近开过一家餐厅，当时做了汉堡，结果它迅速成了“华尔街特区最好的汉堡”。问题在于，如果你把汉堡做得太好，你就只能卖出汉堡了。它太直观、太诱人，会统治整个菜单。如果你想卖骨髓、野禽或奇怪的蔬菜，你就不能提供汉堡，因为它会产生**挤出效应**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: The the burger conundrum is the bane of my existence. I had a restaurant three blocks from Butterworths years ago called Buca. And we did a burger because that was, you know, it's good money at the time. And it quickly became like one of those like, oh, this is the best burger in DC. The problem with the burger is not that it's it's bad economics or that it's a bad dish. The problem is, if you do it well, it's it's the only thing you become capable of selling. Because it's so self-explanatory and it's it's so desirable. If you want to be able to sell these weird vegetable, you can't have a burger because it just dominates the entire menu.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么供应链呢？这些食物是怎么运到餐厅的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: The supply chain. How did okay, so you talked to the farmers in Pennsylvania, etc.. How does it get there? What are the who are the entities that, sort of that actually deliver the food?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 我有点偏执，我尽量避开所谓的大型供应链。大多数农产品和肉类是由一个真正的阿米什人送来的，他戴着帽子留着胡子，早上七点出现。他是少数拥有餐厅钥匙盒密码的人之一。对于很多餐厅来说，他们使用 **Sysco** 或其他大型采购公司，那是标准化的商品。但如果你想突破这一点，你打交道的就是一个开着福特 F-150 皮卡拉着拖车的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: So I'm a psycho and I try to avoid the like quote unquote larger supply chain at all costs. So the, the, the actual way that the produce and most of the meat gets to the restaurant is a as a literal Amish, Amish guy with like a hat in the beard and everything shows up at seven. He's like one of the few people that has the key box code to the restaurant. For a lot of restaurants, it is sort of Cisco and a couple other really large companies that are that are doing this procurement. But if you if you want to break out of that, you're dealing with like a guy with a Ford F-150 in the, in a trailer.

</details>

### 厨师的艺术与劳动力竞争

**Tracy Alloway**: 厨师在做决定时，价格的影响有多大？如果食材非常贵，你还会买吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How much does price actually influence your decisions? So, you know, if a farmer comes in and says, I have the best gras in the world or something like that, but it's really, really expensive. Would you still buy it?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 厨师往往更像艺术家而不是经济学家。他们会为了更好的产品而牺牲自己的利润率。如果你在一家主厨挂名的餐厅吃饭，你得到的通常是不计成本的最好产品，因为如果其他厨师来吃饭，发现你用的是 Sysco 的劣质鹅肝，那会非常丢脸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: Chefs are not inclined to think about the price of goods because they want the best product. Like they'll sort of go they'll sort of stretch their own margins to get the better product. If you're if you're eating at a restaurant where, like, the chef is named on something, you're getting the the best product, no matter what it cost, because we're just psychotic and obsessive in that way. Because they tend to be more artists than like, economists, right?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 获得好厨师的竞争有多激烈？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How competitive are restaurants when it comes to getting the best chef?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 极其激烈。开业时，我会去我喜欢的餐厅后门，等员工出来抽烟，试图挖走他们。我们为了人才而争斗，甚至不同城市的厨师之间会因此结下世仇。如果你有一个手脚麻利的好**洗碗工**，我也会想办法把他挖过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: Extremely. It's like, when we were opening Butterworths I would go stand out back of restaurants that I liked, where the dumpsters were where people might take smoke breaks in hopes that I could talk to the cooks and steal them. So we, we trade talent, and sort of fight over talent in an extremely competitive way. Particularly if you have like, a really good, fast dishwasher and I can have one dishwasher instead of two, I'm going to take your dishwasher.

</details>

### 餐厅的氛围与设计

**Tracy Alloway**: 餐厅的“**氛围**”（Vibe）对整体业务有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How important is the, I guess, the vibe of the restaurant to the overall business?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 极其重要。现在我花在思考灯光、音量、座位间距上的时间，和思考食物的时间一样多。现在的竞争优势不仅仅是食物好，因为好厨师到处都有。你需要结合舒适的环境或特定的社交场景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: Massively important. Right? Like, the, the I think these days I spent as much time thinking about lighting and volume level and like, spacing out of seats and, and and whether or not you can hear the person you're talking to and that stuff, as I do about the food. You have to combine the best food with a comfortable place to hang out or with a specific social scene.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谈到灯光，你会为了**社交媒体**（Instagram/TikTok）的拍照效果而专门设计吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You mentioned lighting. How much of that? When you think about lighting, how much is it about the experience of the diners that night versus lighting for Instagram ability or TikTok or whatever it is?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 恰恰相反。我们的食物拍出来效果很差，这是一种反抗。我希望餐厅感觉更经典、更永恒。我的前老板有一条准则：如果灯光亮到无法私下做点亲密动作，那它就太亮了。我把这条告诉员工，他们永远不会忘记调暗灯光。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: What I'm actually trying to do is the exact opposite, which is like our food photographs, terribly. If you have photos on your phone from that night, they probably look awful. But it's a reaction to that thing which is like, I want to feel like something sort of more classic or more timeless than that. The rule of thumb, I work for this great restaurateur, his rule of thumb was, like, if it's if it's too bright to reasonably get away with giving a handjob, that it's too bright.

</details>

### 隐私与行政挑战

**Joe Weisenthal**: 如果有像 **Marco Rubio** 这样的名人进来，你会怎么处理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: One thing I wanted to ask is, you know, we talked about the clientele earlier and, you know, you got some well known people into the restaurant. If Steve Bannon comes in for the first time, what do you do?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 绝对不能公开。我最怕的就是人们发现名人在那儿，然后跑去打扰他们用餐，那样客户就再也不会来了。媒体帮我们宣传是好事，但我永远不会主动告诉媒体谁在那儿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: So it's it's actually the exact opposite. My big fear is if the people find out there they are, they'll start coming to interrupt her in the middle of dinner. And then that person's gone. So for me specifically, I would never, ever, in a million years be like, hey, Politico, by the way, like in the spotted, you know, Marco Rubio having dinner with his family, because then you'll just never see that customer again.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈谈**行政审批**和卫生检查吧。美剧《**大熊餐厅**》（The Bear）里的情节真实吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Health code violations and permitting and all that stuff. If you watch that show the bear. How real is it from your perspective?

</details>

**Bart Hutchins**: 《大熊餐厅》第一季那个 **Uber Eats** 的订单提示音，现在听了还会让我陷入狂怒。至于审批，简直是灾难。以前可能给点现金就能办成，现在办一个许可证要花八个月，这期间你还得付租金。这合法地阻止了新餐厅的开业。这无关左右翼，这只是官僚主义的低效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bart Hutchins**: The first season that Uber Eats episode, that ding that it makes when a new order comes in, it still sends me into like a blackout rage. With the the permitting and all that stuff. It took us almost eight months to get the single permit for that. Because you're paying rent that entire eight months. It is legitimately, stopping new restaurants from opening.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Bart Hutchins，非常精彩。感谢参加 Odd Lots。
