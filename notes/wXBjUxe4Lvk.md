title: 如何培养自信独立的孩子：应对焦虑时代的育儿挑战
summary: 本文探讨了在当今焦虑时代如何培养自信独立的孩子。作者Lenore Skenazy分享了她因倡导“放养式育儿”而被称作“美国最差妈妈”的经历，并深入分析了过度保护的育儿方式对儿童心理健康和发展造成的负面影响。文章揭示了媒体渲染恐惧、社会过度监管等因素如何导致儿童独立性下降，以及如何通过实际行动，如“放养式体验”作业和社区协作，帮助孩子重获自由，培养韧性与自主性，同时减轻父母的育儿负担。

### “美国最差妈妈”与“放养式育儿”的文化冲击

您在演讲开始时提到，在您让九岁的儿子独自乘坐纽约市地铁后，您曾被称为“**美国最差妈妈**”（America's Worst Mom: 一个讽刺性称号，指因允许孩子独立行动而受到公众批评的母亲），而您欣然接受了这个称号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You actually you start your talk by u mentioning that you have been called America's worst mom after you let your nine-year-old ride the New York City subway alone and you embraced that title. So</p>
</details>

虽然可能一开始并非如此，但当您回顾那一刻时，您认为是什么触动了文化神经？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> while maybe not initially um but so I mean when you look back at that moment what do you think um struck a cultural nerve?</p>
</details>

嗯，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, >> yeah.</p>
</details>

他现在已经27岁了，所以我思考这个问题已经有一段时间了。我认为有两件事触动了文化神经，因为我曾回顾自己更早的专栏文章，那时我让孩子们在没有我的情况下在院子里玩耍，我让他们独自乘坐电梯，我让他们（我的两个儿子）独自去男厕所，显然，没有人关心这些专栏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, that he's 27 now, so I've been thinking about it for a while. And I think, um, two things struck a nerve because I looked at older columns of mine where I had let my kids play in the courtyard without me. I let them take elevators without me. I let them go, they're two boys, let them go to the men's room without me, obviously, and nobody cared about any of those columns.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为，通过撰写我的孩子独自乘坐地铁的经历，这基本上就是地铁的问题。嘿，纽约市地铁的名声并不好，人们认为它是地狱，你为什么要让你的孩子独自下地狱呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think, um, by writing about my kid taking the subway by himself, uh, it was basically the subway. Hey, New York City subway does not have a great reputation and uh people think it's hell and why would you send your kid down to hell at least without you?</p>
</details>

然后，我认为这不仅仅是我在说孩子们需要独立，而是我真正地付诸实践，全力以赴，而且他喜欢这种体验，我认为这也很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then um I think it wasn't just me saying you know kids need independence. It was me actually doing it pedal to the metal and and the fact that he loved it I think was also um maybe just interesting.</p>
</details>

我们做这件事不是因为他应该做，他应该学习，他应该变得坚强。他只是想独自乘坐地铁，我们便让他去了。这就像是，哦，是的，孩子们有他们想独自做的事情，也许我们应该听从他们，看看会发生什么。所以，但我认为关键在于地铁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It wasn't something that we did because he should do it. He should learn. He should be tough toughened up. It was just he wanted to take the subway by himself and we let him. It's like, oh yeah, kids have things that they want to do on their own and maybe we should listen to them and see what happens. So, but I think it's the subway.</p>
</details>

是的。嗯，我的意思是，这么多年过去了，人们似乎仍然对此着迷和担忧，即让孩子们独自外出这个想法。那么，对于那些不熟悉您工作的人，您能否谈谈“**放养式育儿**”（Freerange Kids: 一种育儿理念，鼓励孩子在安全范围内独立探索和玩耍，减少成人干预）到底意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, I mean, and all these years later, it's still something that people are still, it seems like, obsessed with and concerned by this idea of letting kids go on their own. And so, could you, I guess, talk a little bit about this for those people who are new to your work? What exactly does freerange kids mean?</p>
</details>

我知道您会问这个问题，坦白说，我已经回答这个问题很久了，但我从来没有一个很好的解释。但它基本上是相信孩子们可以自己做一些事情，就像今天大多数父母，当然还有祖父母们小时候所记得的那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I knew you were going to ask and frankly I've been asked this for a while and I I never have a great pathy explanation but it is basically believing that kids can do some things on their own the way most of today's parents and certainly the grandparents remember as kids what what's strange uh about childhood today is the fact that kids do almost nothing on their own and I I have some statistics we did a a study with the Harris people the Harris pole people and they found that um the major Majority of kids aged 8 to 12 have um rarely or never walked around their own neighborhood without an adult.</p>
</details>

今天童年生活的奇怪之处在于，孩子们几乎什么都不能自己做。我有一些数据，我们与**哈里斯民意调查**（Harris Poll: 美国一家知名的市场研究和民意调查公司）的人合作进行了一项研究，他们发现，8到12岁的大多数孩子很少或从未在没有成年人的情况下在自己的社区里走动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More than 50% had never gone to another aisle at the grocery without an adult. Um 25% weren't allowed to play on their own front lawn.</p>
</details>

超过50%的孩子从未在没有成年人的情况下独自去杂货店的另一个货架。25%的孩子不被允许在自家前院玩耍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like why have a front lawn, you know, if kids aren't allowed there. So, uh, also there was this really amazing piece done in I I know it's the Daily Mail, uh, but nonetheless, the Daily Mail did an an incredible story, uh, several years back, and it was called How Children Lost the Right to Rome in four generations.</p>
</details>

所以，如果孩子们不被允许在前院玩，那为什么还要有前院呢？此外，几年前《**每日邮报**》（The Daily Mail: 英国一家主流报纸）刊登了一篇非常精彩的文章，题为《**四代人中儿童如何失去漫游的权利**》（How Children Lost the Right to Rome in Four Generations）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it interviewed, it had a map, but it interviewed a great grandpa, 88, how what had he done as a kid? He'd he'd gone six miles in any direction.</p>
</details>

文章采访了一位88岁的曾祖父，问他小时候都做了些什么？他可以朝任何方向走六英里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the grandpa, 66, had gone um about a mile to the fishing hole or and then the mother who was in her 40s had walked half a mile to school and her son who was eight was not allowed and I can't remember if it's not allowed off his block or not allowed off his yard.</p>
</details>

然后是66岁的祖父，他可以走大约一英里去钓鱼点。接着是40多岁的母亲，她可以步行半英里去学校。而她八岁的儿子却不被允许离开他的街区，或者是不被允许离开他的院子，我记不清具体是哪一个了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but the the map that showed this just showed really childhood shrinking and freerange kids is trying to make it easy, normal, and legal uh to to widen that again to trust kids with some independence and and that's what LetGrow, the nonprofit that grew out of Freerange Kids, is is working on.</p>
</details>

嗯，但那张地图清晰地展示了童年活动范围的不断缩小，“放养式育儿”正试图让孩子们重新获得一些独立性，使其变得容易、正常和合法，而这正是**LetGrow**（一个非营利组织，旨在推广儿童独立和自主玩耍的理念）这个从“放养式育儿”发展而来的非营利组织正在努力的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we'll we'll definitely talk more about some of the work you're doing with Let Grow, but before we get into that, I'd love to just keep going on this thread around how independence for children has has really begun to shrink.</p>
</details>

我们肯定会更多地谈论您在Let Grow所做的一些工作，但在那之前，我想继续探讨儿童独立性是如何真正开始萎缩的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why Why do you think modern parenting has become so focused on safety and control?</p>
</details>

您认为为什么现代育儿变得如此专注于安全和控制？

### 现代育儿：安全与控制的代价

这是我最喜欢的话题，但我们没有24小时，只有一小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This my favorite topic and we don't have 24 hours, we just have one.</p>
</details>

嗯，我想说这种变化真正开始于80年代并延续到90年代。当时有几件事发生了显著变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I would say that the change really began uh in earnest in the 80s and into the 90s. And a couple things changed back then that were significant.</p>
</details>

其一是我们在80年代有了有线电视，这意味着我们突然有了24小时新闻循环，这是以前从未有过的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One is that we got cable television in the 80s, which meant that we suddenly had a 24-hour news cycle, which had never been the case before.</p>
</details>

嗯，当然，如果你想让人们在所有这些时间里都盯着屏幕，你就必须找到非常引人注目，而且我会说非常令人不安的内容，正如我们后来从互联网中学到的那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and of course if you have to keep people glued to the screen for all those hours, you have to find very compelling and I would say very upsetting content as we've learned from later on with the internet.</p>
</details>

所以，那时我们开始对“**陌生人危险**”（stranger danger: 警告儿童提防陌生人的概念）产生某种痴迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's when we started to sort of um obsess about stranger danger and also there were two very high-profile kidnappings um in New York, my city in 1979.</p>
</details>

此外，1979年在纽约，我的城市发生了两起备受关注的绑架案。一个名叫**Eton Pates**的男孩在公交车站被带走，从此再也没有出现过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A boy named Eton Pates was taken from a bus stop um and never seen again.</p>
</details>

除了彻底的悲剧之外，这个案件的有趣之处在于，公众最初的普遍看法是某个失恋的女士看到了这个可爱的小孩，把他带回家当作自己的孩子抚养。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what was interesting about that case, aside from utter tragedy, is that the working assumption on the part of the public uh at the beginning was that some lovelororn lady had seen this cute little kid and taken him home to raise as her own.</p>
</details>

所以我们根本没有想到掠夺者。那时掠夺者就像狮子和猫头鹰一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we weren't thinking at all about predators. And predators then were like lions and owls.</p>
</details>

所以，只是随着警方和新闻逐渐透露消息，说也许不是一位女士，也许不是带回家抚养，人们才开始震惊于这种怪异、可怕、令人厌恶和不安的罪行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and so it was only gradually as word got out maybe from the police and from the news that well maybe it wasn't a lady, maybe it wasn't taken home to raise that people became became just shocked that there would be this weird and horrible and disgusting and upsetting crime.</p>
</details>

然后，1982年，当**Adam Walsh**在佛罗里达州一家**西尔斯**（Sears: 曾是美国最大的百货公司之一）商店外被带走时，关于他的迷你剧打破了所有收视纪录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when it happened to uh Adam Walsh was taken from outside of a Sears in Florida in 1982, there was a a miniseries done on him that broke all ratings records.</p>
</details>

你知道，新闻和媒体是为了赚钱，对吧？不仅仅是为了告知和帮助你，更是为了赚钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know the news and the media are there to make money, right? Not just to inform you and help you, but really to make money.</p>
</details>

当他们发现这种内容最能吸引观众时，他们就会说：“给我更多这样的内容。不要再绑架儿童了，给我更多类似这样的内容，因为人们对此的胃口是无止境的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when they saw that this is what really captivated audiences the most, they said, "Get me more of these. Don't get me Don't steal more children. get me more content like this because this the the appetite for this has been unending.</p>
</details>

我们之所以知道这一点，是因为直到今天，《**法律与秩序**》（Law and Order: 一部美国长寿犯罪剧集）已经播出了大约25或30年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we know that because to this day, Law and Order, I think, has been on for like 25 or 30 years.</p>
</details>

每天人们都在收看，只为看到最堕落和最令人不安的罪行。你知道，你吸入这些信息，渐渐地，你的肺里充满了这种绝望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And every day people are tuning in to see just the most depraved and upsetting crimes. And you know, you breathe these in and gradually your your lungs fill with this despair and what seemed to be, you know, almost unheard of in the Eton Page case in 1979 becomes something like the the same Harris poll interviewed parents and what was it?</p>
</details>

1979年Eton Pates案件中几乎闻所未闻的事情，现在变得像什么呢？同样的哈里斯民意调查采访了父母，结果是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was 50% of parents. No, when asked what would happen if there were two kids aged 10, 10, double digits playing at the park together, what is likely to happen? and 50% of the parents said they were likely to be kidnapped.</p>
</details>

50%的父母。不，当被问到如果有两个10岁的孩子在公园一起玩耍，可能会发生什么时，50%的父母说他们很可能会被绑架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, that's that's wildly out of whack with reality, thank God. But that's the result of this constant drum beat of terror and despair that we are marinating in thanks to the media.</p>
</details>

嗯，感谢上帝，这与现实严重脱节。但这正是我们因媒体而沉浸在这种持续的恐怖和绝望鼓点中的结果。

### 过度保护的隐性成本：儿童的焦虑与抑郁

那么，当我们思考这个问题时，现在每个人都决定让他们靠近，不要让他们自由漫游，正如您所说。这种过度保护的育儿方式对父母和孩子来说，有哪些隐性成本呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we think about this then now everyone has decided keep them close, don't let them roam as you know as you say. What are what are some of the hidden costs of of this of overprotective parenting for for both parents and kids?</p>
</details>

嗯，我们先谈谈孩子。嗯，我感到难过，因为我的TED演讲非常有趣，但现在我们变得非常沉重，但对孩子来说，悲伤的是他们感到悲伤。他们变得焦虑和抑郁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, let's talk about kids first. Um, and I feel bad because my TED talk was really funny and now we're getting really somber, but the sad thing for kids is that they are sad. They are getting anxious and depressed.</p>
</details>

我们都知道这一点，但人们认为这是自新冠疫情以来，或者自手机普及以来，或者自《**不让一个孩子掉队**》（No Child Left Behind: 美国一项联邦教育法案，旨在提高教育标准和问责制）以来，实际上这已经酝酿了几十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we all know this, but um people think it's since COVID or since phones or whatever, since No Child Left Behind, it's really been decades in the making.</p>
</details>

嗯，我的LetGrow联合创始人之一是**Peter Gray**，他是**波士顿学院**（Boston College: 美国一所私立研究型大学）的心理学教授。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, one of my LetGrow co-founders is a man named Peter Gray. Uh, he's a professor of psychology at Boston College.</p>
</details>

他进行了一项大型长期研究，两年前发表在《**儿科学杂志**》（Journal of Pediatrics: 一份同行评审的医学期刊）上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he did a a big long study that was published in the Journal of Pediatrics two years ago.</p>
</details>

研究表明，几十年来，从50年代到现在，随着孩子们的独立性、漫游能力、解决问题能力和独自玩耍能力下降，他们的焦虑和抑郁水平一直在上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it showed that over the decades, like from the 50s to now, as kids independence, ability to roam, problem solve, play on their own has gone down, their anxiety and depression have been going up.</p>
</details>

他认为这不仅仅是相关性，更是因果关系。你可以理解这一点，因为如果你在工作中一直被**微观管理**（micromanaged: 指上级对下属工作进行过度细致的监督和控制），有人总是在说“Whitney，你为什么不试试这种方式？”“Whitney，这很好，但也许你想考虑一下这个？”“Whitney，你能在今天下午5:02之前把这个给我吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he argues that it's not just correlation, it's causation. Then you could sort of understand that because if you were in a job and you were micromanaged all the time and somebody was saying Whitney why don't you try it this way Whitney that's good but maybe you want to think about this Whitney will you have this to me this is you know by 502 today you know nobody wants to be micromanaged and childhood has become micromanaged and</p>
</details>

没有人愿意被微观管理，而童年已经变得被微观管理了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the other thing Peter Gray explains which I think is really right is that um there's something called an internal locus of control versus external locus of control and what external is when somebody else is deciding how you spend your day and whether you're doing it good enough and gives you all this feedback and tells you what you're going to do next.</p>
</details>

Peter Gray解释的另一件事，我认为非常正确，那就是有一种叫做**内部控制点**（internal locus of control: 相信自己能掌控生活和结果）与**外部控制点**（external locus of control: 相信外部力量或命运决定结果）的概念。外部控制点是指当别人决定你如何度过一天，你做得是否足够好，给你所有这些反馈，并告诉你接下来要做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And internal is when you feel like, you know, I really feel like going and looking for bugs today or I just want to get better at my free throws or I'm going to go on my skateboard.</p>
</details>

而内部控制点是指当你觉得，你知道，我今天真的很想去捉虫，或者我只是想提高我的罚球命中率，或者我要去玩滑板。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you have an intrinsic, well, internal locus of control means an intrinsic so hard to say um desire to do something and you go and do it, you feel like you can handle things even if you fall off the skateboard. even if you don't find a bug, which would be odd.</p>
</details>

当你有一种内在的，嗯，内部控制点意味着一种内在的（很难说出口）做某事的渴望，并且你去做了，你会觉得你能处理好事情，即使你从滑板上摔下来。即使你没有找到虫子，这会很奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so when you have this feeling like I can handle things and people trust me and if things go wrong, I'm going to be able to figure out how to make them better. You feel great. You're on top of the world and we have taken most of that out of children's lives because we're so worried about them that we do everything with them and for them.</p>
</details>

嗯，所以当你有一种感觉，觉得自己能处理好事情，人们信任我，如果事情出了问题，我能想办法让它们变得更好。你会感觉很棒。你感觉自己处于世界的顶端，而我们已经从孩子们的生命中剥夺了大部分这种感觉，因为我们太担心他们了，以至于我们和他们一起做所有事情，为他们做所有事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, they're sort of they're, you know, they're like they're like in the passenger seat of their lives while we very smart, helpful people are driving them to something that's going to be really important for them, especially if they're trying to get into college.</p>
</details>

结果，他们就像坐在自己人生的副驾驶座上，而我们这些非常聪明、乐于助人的人正载着他们去往对他们来说非常重要的事情，尤其是如果他们想考大学的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I love in the in the talk, and I I promise we're gonna we are going to come away from some of the somber stuff to the light.</p>
</details>

我喜欢在演讲中，我保证我们会从一些沉重的话题转向轻松的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and in in the talk you say that um I did it myself are both uh childhood's magic um words and the original anxiety buster.</p>
</details>

嗯，在演讲中您说，“我做到了”既是童年的魔力词汇，也是最初的焦虑消除剂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. Could you say more about that? You know what role does does risktaking and and independence play in sort of raising resilient um children?</p>
</details>

是的。是的。您能多谈谈这一点吗？冒险和独立在培养有**韧性**（resilient: 指面对困难和逆境时能快速恢复和适应的能力）的孩子方面扮演着怎样的角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'd say it plays a huge role. And you probably remember this from your own childhood. Something that you did yourself that you thought was a little scary or you're still proud of to this day.</p>
</details>

我会说它扮演着巨大的角色。你可能从自己的童年经历中也记得这一点。你独自完成的某件事，你觉得有点吓人，但直到今天你仍然为此感到自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes I ask people, uh, what did you do as a kid that went really wrong? And I'll just tell you one quick story, which is I was at a an an education conference of some sort, and one of the ladies told me that when she was a kid, um, she and her friends were riding their bikes down this, I'm sure it seemed like an incredible mountain.</p>
</details>

有时我会问人们，嗯，你小时候做了什么真正出错的事情？我来给你们讲一个简短的故事，我当时在一个教育会议上，其中一位女士告诉我，她小时候，她和她的朋友们骑自行车下山，我敢肯定那座山在她看来是不可思议的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was probably just a little hill, but it was covered with um, pine needles.</p>
</details>

它可能只是一座小山，但上面覆盖着松针。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when she went down, you know, it was really slick and fast. And so she's going down and she's holding on to the handle brakes and she goes like this to to break because she's at the bottom and the handlebars came off the bike.</p>
</details>

当她骑下去的时候，你知道，非常滑，速度很快。所以她骑下去，紧握着手刹，她这样刹车，因为她已经到了底部，然后车把从自行车上脱落了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So suddenly it's like ah like a cartoon and she had a split second to decide what to do and she threw herself into a bush, right?</p>
</details>

所以突然间就像卡通片一样，她只有一瞬间来决定怎么办，她把自己扔进了一个灌木丛，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And she got all scraped off and it was okay and she put the handlebars back on. She kept doing it and I said, "Well, you know, well what did you tell your parents?" and she's like, "I didn't tell my parents."</p>
</details>

她全身擦伤，但没事，她把车把装了回去。她继续这样做，我说：“嗯，你知道，你告诉父母了吗？”她说：“我没告诉父母。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when other people in the audience started telling stories like this kid, this this one guy, I think it was a principal, got lost on like some family hike and he had to actually hitchhike back to where they were.</p>
</details>

然后当观众中的其他人开始讲述类似的故事时，比如这个孩子，这个人，我想他是一位校长，在一次家庭徒步旅行中迷路了，他不得不搭便车回到他们所在的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, he didn't tell his parents. And and some guy played Mumbly Peg, which is the stupidest game on earth, where you throw a knife at each other's feet.</p>
</details>

当然，他没有告诉他的父母。还有一个人玩“**Mumbly Peg**”（Mumbly Peg: 一种危险的儿童游戏，通常涉及用刀子在地上或脚边投掷），这是地球上最愚蠢的游戏，你把刀子扔向彼此的脚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, somebody's foot got hurt and they like hid the fact that they were taking him up to the bathroom to wash off his foot and get the blood down the drain and put on a band-aid.</p>

<p class="english-text">So their independence was just uh you know innately so important to them that they were treasuring it and protecting it and they were doing two things at once.</p>
</details>

所以他们的独立性对他们来说是如此重要，以至于他们珍惜并保护它，他们同时做了两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They were protecting their independence and they were saying to themselves, "Look what I can handle."</p>
</details>

他们保护着自己的独立性，同时对自己说：“看我能处理什么。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">And anxiety is the opposite of that. Anxiety is when you worry like, "Oh, you know, this seems hard. What if I mess up?</p>
</details>

而焦虑则与此相反。焦虑是你担心，“哦，你知道，这看起来很难。万一我搞砸了怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I mess up, it'll be terrible. I'll be embarrassed. And if I'm hurt, it will be forever, so I might as well not do it."</p>
</details>

如果我搞砸了，那会很糟糕。我会很尴尬。如果我受伤了，那将是永远的，所以我不如不做。”

<p class="english-text">I have to tell you, Nike just changed its slogan like last week. And while they're keeping just do it, they they added the new slogan, why do it?</p>
</details>

我必须告诉您，**耐克**（Nike: 著名的运动品牌）上周刚刚更改了口号。虽然他们保留了“Just Do It”，但他们又添加了新口号：“Why Do It?”（为什么要这样做？）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, why do it? And it's a recognition that kids are so afraid of messing up because they're watched all the time.</p>
</details>

就像，为什么要这样做？这表明孩子们因为一直被监视，所以非常害怕犯错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's high stakes. You're always being judged. You're always being protected, and you never have a chance to see how much you can do.</p>
</details>

所以，风险很高。你总是被评判。你总是被保护，你从未有机会看到自己能做多少。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, you finally just go, "Well, why do it?" You know, I'll look stupid. Maybe somebody puts my, you know, a real on Instagram.</p>
</details>

所以，你最终只会说：“好吧，为什么要这样做？”你知道，我会看起来很蠢。也许有人会把我的视频发到Instagram上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, maybe I feel bad about myself. Maybe I'll get hurt. And so if Nike is recognizing a pervasive passivity in kids even wanting to play, I mean Nike is about playing, right?</p>
</details>

嗯，也许我会对自己感觉不好。也许我会受伤。所以如果耐克都认识到孩子们普遍存在的被动性，甚至连玩耍的意愿都没有，我的意思是耐克是关于玩耍的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then something has gone arry. And so if you're asking what's the problem in in the culture, it's that we're taking the the childhood the child out of childhood and replacing it with adult oriented, adult-run activities and adult supervised activities to the point where kids are like, "Okay, it's yours. Tell me what to do. I'll do it."</p>
</details>

那么肯定出了问题。所以如果你问文化中存在什么问题，那就是我们正在将童年中的孩子抽离出来，取而代之的是成人主导、成人运营和成人监督的活动，以至于孩子们会说：“好吧，这是你的。告诉我该做什么。我会照做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But otherwise, why why do it?</p>
</details>

但除此之外，为什么要这样做呢？

### 培养自由的实用步骤与集体行动

好吧，我们现在已经为思考这个问题以及与自己、孩子和社区进行这些对话的重要性奠定了基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, okay, we've we've set the stage now for why this think thinking about this and having these conversations with yourself and your children, your community is really important.</p>
</details>

嗯，我们的会员观众非常渴望听到您分享我们如何实际做到这一点。所以，我将整合一些我们从会员那里收到的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and our member audience is so eager to hear you share more about how we actually do this.</p>
</details>

但在我们开始之前，您能否先给我们介绍一些简单的小步骤，说明人们如何在不感到鲁莽的情况下，实际开始给予孩子更多自由？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm going to integrate in some questions that we're getting from the members. But before we get there, if you could just um I guess start us off with your simple small steps for how people can practically begin to give their kids more freedom without feeling reckless.</p>
</details>

是的。嗯，首先，给予孩子一些自由并非鲁莽。我会说，不给予他们一些自由才是鲁莽的，原因我们已经讨论过了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um first of all, it's not reckless to give your kids some freedom. I would argue that it's reckless not to give them some freedom for the reasons we've already discussed.</p>
</details>

但我承认，在这样的文化中这很难，比如有些学校不让孩子在放学时下车，除非有家长在场陪他们回家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I recognize that it is hard in a culture that says like there are there are schools that won't let the kids get off the bus at the end of the day unless a parent is there to walk them home.</p>
</details>

可能只有两个街区，或者两户人家那么远。我当时正在一个演讲中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it could be two blocks, it could be two houses. I was I was actually giving a talk in</p>
</details>

我完全不记得我在哪里了。嗯，但听众告诉我，他们学校的校车会在每个人的家门口停下，把他们送到车道尽头，但你仍然必须走出家门去接孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I have no idea where I was. Um, but the audience members told me that their school, the bus stops at each person's house and drops them off at the end of the driveway and you still have to come out of your house to get the kid.</p>
</details>

你不能从窗户挥手。你必须下来接他们。所以，这是一种文化，它要求对孩子进行超乎寻常的安全和监督，以及，你知道，帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can't wave from the window. You have to come down and get them. So, this is a culture that is demanding a level of safety and supervision and uh, you know, help for the kids that is just off the charts.</p>
</details>

所以，我并不责怪父母成为“**直升机父母**”（helicopters: 指过度介入孩子生活，像直升机一样盘旋在孩子头顶的父母），因为文化正在推荐，有时甚至要求这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't blame parents for being helicopters because the the culture is recommending it and sometimes often enough demanding it.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，**斯凯奇**（Sketchers: 著名的鞋类品牌）的儿童鞋现在鞋垫下面有一个孔，可以放置追踪设备。我的意思是，持续的监督已经变得如此常态化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, Sketchers shoes for kids, they now have a hole in underneath the insole where you can put a tracking device. I mean, that's how normalized constant supervision has become.</p>
</details>

但对抗它的方式，最简单的改变任何事情的方式，就是集体行动。如果我们都害怕把孩子送出去，你知道，其他父母会怎么想？是不是太严厉了？是不是太早了？我的孩子是不是太迷糊了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the way to fight it is the easiest way to to change anything is collectively. if we're all afraid to send our kids outside, you know, what is the what are the other parents going to think? Is it too tough? Is it too soon? Is my kid too spacey?</p>
</details>

就是要让每个人同时这样做。所以这就是LetGrow，这个从“放养式育儿”发展而来的非营利组织，建议学校给孩子们一项叫做“**Let Grow体验**”（Let Grow Experience: LetGrow组织推广的一项作业，鼓励孩子在没有父母监督下独立完成新任务）的家庭作业的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is to have everybody doing it at once. And so that's why LetGrow, the nonprofit that grew out of Free Range Kids, recommends that schools give kids a homework assignment called the Let Grow Experience.</p>
</details>

它是免费的，每个孩子都会得到这样的作业：“回家在父母允许但没有父母在场的情况下，独自做一些新事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's free where every kid gets the homework that says, "Go home and do something new on your own with your parents' permission, but without your parents."</p>
</details>

然后我们列出了一长串清单，你可以爬树，你可以做煎饼，你可以走到商店，不管是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we give a list of giant, you know, giant, you can climb a tree, you can make pancakes, you can walk to the store, whatever it is.</p>
</details>

嗯，但如果每个人都在做，所有的三年级学生都在，你知道，自己去上吉他课，或者为晚餐买牛奶，你就不是那个让他们做这些事的“疯狂妈妈”了，所有的孩子都在互相交谈，所有的父母也在互相交谈，你便重新规范了放手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but if everybody is doing it, all the third graders are, you know, getting themselves to their guitar lessons or picking up the milk for dinner, you're not the crazy mom letting them do it and all the kids are talking to each other and all the parents are talking to each other and you've renormalized letting go.</p>
</details>

但是，放手不仅仅是好事，因为，好吧，他们获得了一些独立性，也许他们不那么焦虑了。放手真的很重要，因为它会重塑你，作为父母的你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, but letting go is not just good because, okay, they're getting a little independence, maybe they're less anxious. Letting go is really important because it rewires you, the parent,</p>
</details>

因为当你看到你的孩子从那个差事回来，他们带回了牛奶，或者我今天刚和一位女士谈过，我刚才在和谁说话来着，我快疯了，但是，哦，她让她的孩子去杂货店买晚餐的东西，他出来了，他六岁，他出来时只带了饼干，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because when you see your kid come back from that errand and they got the milk or I was just talking to a lady today, who was I talking to right before you, I'm losing my mind, but oh, she let her kid go into the grocery and get the things for dinner and he came out, he was six, he came out with only cookies, right?</p>
</details>

我当时想，我同意这一点。我认为那会是一顿很棒的晚餐。但是，嗯，她有点失望，但也非常自豪，因为他进去了，然后出来了，他说：“我想我找回的零钱正好，对吧？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was like, I I agree with that. I think that makes a great dinner. But um she was a little disappointed but also so proud because he'd gone in and he came out and he said, "I think I got the exact change, didn't I?"</p>
</details>

然后他们检查零钱。你，作为父母，就像**格林奇**（Grinch: 动画片《圣诞怪杰》中的角色，心胸狭窄），当你看到孩子独自完成某件事时，你的心会变大三倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then they're looking over the change. And you you the parent, you're it's like the Grinch. Your heart grows three sizes when you see your kid do something on their own.</p>
</details>

这是唯一的解决方案。你几乎必须在完全准备好之前，就让孩子稍微放手，因为当他们回家时，你就会准备好，而且他们会回家的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the only solution. You almost have to let your kid go a little before you're totally ready because you will be ready when they come home and they will come home.</p>
</details>

而且如果他们搞砸了，那也没关系，因为那时你就会意识到，他迷路了一点也没关系，或者他只买了饼干也没关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and if they screwed up, that's okay, too, because then you realize like it's okay he got a little lost or he only bought the cookies and that's okay, too.</p>
</details>

你只需要意识到这种程度的监督和过度警惕是新的，也是不必要的。它不仅是孩子的负担，也是你的负担，因为它让你的父母工作变得每时每刻都要盯着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you just have to realize that this level of um supervision and hypervigilance is new and unnecessary. And it's not only a burden to a kid, it's a burden to you because it has made your job as a parent watching every single second.</p>
</details>

你知道，你不能让他们去买香蕉。这对任何父母来说都要求太高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you can't send them to get the bananas. That's that's too much to ask of any parent.</p>
</details>

你知道，出生率正在下降。我认为一个未被提及的原因，甚至可能是潜意识的原因，是养育孩子变得如此令人疲惫。你没有一点时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, the the the the birth rates are going down. And I think maybe one unspoken reason, maybe even subconscious reason, is that it's becoming such a drag.</p>
</details>

今天的父母花在孩子身上的时间比我们父母花在我们身上的时间多得多，因为他们认为他们必须在场，为每一次报名操心，观看每一次玩耍，在每一次派对上吃每一片披萨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have zero time. Parents today are spending way more time with their kids than our parents spent with us because they think they have to be there to knit every signups and to watch every playd date and to eat every piece of pizza at every party.</p>
</details>

但是您刚才也提到了一个观点，就是让其他人参与进来。您谈到Let Grow如何为学校提供一项作业，鼓励孩子们更加独立。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But one thing you touched on just now as well is this this idea of getting other people involved. You talk about with Let Grow how you have this assignment for schools where they can have encourage children to to um be more independent.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以我们有一个来自Lorie C.的问题。她作为一名家长，无法影响孩子班级里发生的事情。她问，对于那些想给孩子更多自由，但可能受到其他家长或家庭成员评判的父母，您有什么建议？他们如何帮助其他人也加入到这个旅程中来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so we have a question actually from from Lorie C. You know if she just as a single as a parent and not somebody who can influence what's happening in her act classroom in her child's classroom. She says what advice do you have for parents who want to give their kids more freedom but maybe feel judged by other parents or or family members? How can they help bring other people along on this journey? the family members a little harder.</p>
</details>

家庭成员会稍微困难一些。但是，嗯，我会说找一个朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um but uh I would say find a friend.</p>
</details>

我听说有些父母，比如，你知道，两个女人坐在**星巴克**（Starbucks: 著名的咖啡连锁店），然后她们让孩子去购物中心的另一头，给他们10美元，让他们去一元店买东西，或者去取干洗的衣服。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I've heard of parents who like, you know, two women go and sit at Starbucks and they send their kids to the other end of the strip mall and here's $10. Go buy something at the the dollar store or go pick up the dry cleaning. We'll be here.</p>
</details>

我们会在这里。这对你的孩子和你来说都容易得多。你因为和朋友聊天而分心，而你的孩子有伴一起做事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really much easier for your kid and for you. You're distracted because you're talking to your friend and your kid has somebody to do something with.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，和朋友一起做任何事都更有趣。所以，我会说找几个人想和你一起练习这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, everything's more fun with a friend. So, I'd say find a couple of people who want to practice this with you.</p>
</details>

嗯，LetGrow的所有东西都是免费的。所以，我要说的是，我们有“**四周培养一个Let Grow孩子**”（Four Weeks to a Let Grow Kid: LetGrow组织提供的一个四周计划，旨在帮助孩子逐步培养独立性）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, all the stuff at LetGrow is free. So, I'm gonna It's let Grow. I'm just going to say that we have the four weeks to a Let Grow Kid.</p>
</details>

第一周是让孩子开始自己做一些你一直在为他们做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's like the first week is like have kids start doing stuff for themselves that you've been doing for them.</p>
</details>

你知道，无论是系鞋带，还是出门，或者让他们自己烤饼干，自己从烤箱里拿出来。想象一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, whether that's tying their shoes or getting them out the door or let them bake cookies and they take them out of the oven themselves. Imagine that.</p>
</details>

然后下一周是关于在社区里走动。然后是和朋友一起做一些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the next week is getting around the neighborhood. And then there's like do something with a friend.</p>
</details>

我不知道第四周是什么，但你会找到的。还有一件事是有人曾经向我推荐的，有两件很酷的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I have no idea what the fourth week is, but you'll find it out. And and the another thing that somebody once recommended to me, there's two cool things.</p>
</details>

嗯，一个是“**自由玩耍星期五**”（Free Play Fridays: 一项社区活动，鼓励孩子们在周五下午在没有成人监督的情况下自由玩耍），我最近听说一个孩子在他的社区组织了“自由玩耍星期五”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, one is free play Fridays, and I actually just heard of a kid who organized a free play Friday in his neighborhood.</p>
</details>

他四处走动，把明信片放进每个人的邮箱里，上面写着周五下午，比如3点到6点，或者3点到5点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He went around, he put postcards in everybody's um mailbox, and it said Friday afternoon, like at 3:00, 3 to 6, or 3:00 to 5:00.</p>
</details>

所有孩子，没有大人，不要来。大人们，在**Locust Park**之类的公园见面，我们看看会发生什么。我们只是玩耍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how about all the kids, no grown-ups, don't come. Grown-ups, meet at Locust Park or whatever and we'll just see what happens. We'll just play.</p>
</details>

他不知道是否会有人来。我真希望我能记住他在哪里。嗯，总之，令他高兴和惊讶的是，有20个孩子出现了，妈妈们发来了照片，看起来就像，你知道，像《**花生漫画**》（Peanuts: 查尔斯·舒尔茨创作的著名漫画系列）里的那群孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he didn't know if anybody was gonna come. And I wish I could remember where he was. Um anyways, uh to his delight and surprise, 20 kids showed up and the mom sent photos and it just looked like, you know, it looked like the Peanuts gang.</p>
</details>

嗯，你知道，除了露西是个混蛋之外，但就是孩子们在公园里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know, minus Lucy being a jerk, but but it was just kids in the park.</p>
</details>

有些孩子在玩球，有些孩子在做其他事情。这真是太棒了。我的意思是，它既能让孩子感到满足，也能让你的心充满喜悦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of them were playing with a ball and some of them were doing whatever. And it's just so great. I mean, it fills your heart as much as it's fulfilling for kids.</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个主意。“自由玩耍星期五”。你知道，使用邮件列表，使用**Next Door**（一个社区社交网络平台），使用**Facebook**（著名的社交媒体平台），然后说：“我们周五都把孩子送到公园怎么样？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's one idea. Free play Fridays. Just, you know, use a list serve, use Next Door, use Facebook and say, "How about we all send our our kids to the park on Fridays?"</p>
</details>

选择星期五是因为它连接着周末，也许他们会在周末的剩余时间里自己再做一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Fridays because it leads into the weekend and maybe they'll do it again on their own um for the rest of the weekend.</p>
</details>

另一件事是加利福尼亚州的一位妈妈创办了一个她称之为“**友谊俱乐部**”（friendship club: 一种非正式的儿童社交组织，旨在促进孩子间的自发玩耍和互动）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other thing is this one mom in California started what she called a friendship club and that was she found her son had like three or four friends in the neighborhood and she contacted them and she said how about we form a friendship club which in my day would have just been called normal life where if my kid I mean really all of this stuff is just like aren't we all just trying to recreate our childhoods but anyway um if my kid knocks on your door and your kid is free you know is is you know Cynthia home or is you know Oliver home? Yes.</p>
</details>

她发现她的儿子在社区里有三四个朋友，她联系了他们，她说我们组建一个友谊俱乐部怎么样？这在我那个年代就叫做正常生活。我的意思是，所有这些事情都像是我们都在试图重现我们的童年，但无论如何，如果我的孩子敲你的门，你的孩子有空，你知道，Cynthia在家吗？或者Oliver在家吗？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Then they come in, they don't have to organize a playd date beforehand.</p>
</details>

好的。然后他们进来，他们不必事先安排玩耍时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're not going to see this as an imposition. I'm not using you as a babysitter. Or maybe I am, but you can do the same with me.</p>
</details>

你不会觉得这是一种强加。我不是把你当保姆。或者也许我是，但你也可以对我这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so then the kid has like three or four doors that he can knock on anytime uh you know, any time of day, I would say.</p>
</details>

所以孩子就有三四个门可以随时敲，嗯，我的意思是，一天中的任何时候都可以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they can go play outside, they can play in the lawn, the front lawn, the back lawn, they can go to the park.</p>
</details>

他们可以出去玩，可以在草坪上玩，前院，后院，他们可以去公园。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that just sort of renits the neighborhood, too. And I also think one of the things Peter Gray always says is that kids are not attracted just because there's a sidewalk and a tree outside.</p>
</details>

这也会重新连接社区。我还认为Peter Gray总是说的一点是，孩子们不仅仅因为外面有路边和树木而被吸引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're attracted by other kids. And once you have some kids playing in the neighborhood, and I've seen this, then other kids start joining them.</p>
</details>

他们被其他孩子吸引。一旦社区里有一些孩子在玩耍，我见过这种情况，其他孩子就会开始加入他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once you have a couple kids walking to school, other kids start joining them. So you just want to sort of recede the neighborhood with kids.</p>
</details>

一旦有几个孩子步行上学，其他孩子就会开始加入他们。所以你只需要用孩子来“重新播种”社区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um you do that with a little bit of planning with the other parents.</p>
</details>

嗯，你和其他父母一起稍微计划一下就能做到。

### 社区与政策支持：共同构建儿童友好的环境

我喜欢所有这些想法。我们还有很多关于社区中不同人群以及他们如何参与其中的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love all of these ideas. And we have so many other questions about different people within the community and how they can be involved in this.</p>
</details>

所以有几位会员好奇祖父母如何提供支持。那么，Richard R，例如，您有什么建议，如何建设性地帮助我们的孩子让他们的孩子成长，而又不冒着损害他们对我们作为照护者的信任的风险？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a few members who are curious about how grandparents can support. So um Richard R, for instance, uh do you have any suggestions on how to constructively help our children let their own children grow without risking undermining their trust in us as caregivers?</p>
</details>

我理解祖父母的心情，因为我们很多人都能回忆起这种“放养式童年”，然后我们看到孩子们的生活被安排得满满当当。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel for grandparents because a lot of us can remember uh this freerange childhood and then we see the kids scheduled within an inch of their lives.</p>
</details>

我会说，也许你只是，你知道，碰巧留下**Peter Gray**关于自由玩耍对孩子多么具有塑造性的一段精彩TEDx演讲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say maybe you just, you know, happen to leave the, you know, Peter Gray had a great TED X talk about how free play is just so formative for kids.</p>
</details>

所以，也许如果你能帮助父母看到，而不是说教他们，这种自由时间并非愚蠢的浪费时间，不是下棋、足球和学校等重要时间之间的间隙时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so maybe if you help the parents see without lecturing them, let like this free time is not stupid wasted time, interstitial time between the important time of, you know, chess, soccer, and school.</p>

而是他们学习如何交朋友、如何妥协、如何解释一个想法、如何发挥创造力的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's when they're learning how to make a friend, how to compromise, how to explain an idea, how to be creative.</p>
</details>

如果，你知道，父母非常关心孩子生活的方方面面。如果他们看到自由玩耍，无人监督的自由玩耍实际上是具有教育意义的，并且能让他们的孩子领先，那么这就会成为一种“说他们的语言”的方式。

<p class="english-text">And so I think just giving everybody the benefit of the doubt as opposed to thinking the worst about them that you know any guy at the park is a predator, any kid at the park alone is, you know, um somebody who's neglected by a terrible parent.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，仅仅是给予每个人信任，而不是总是往最坏处想，认为公园里的任何人都可能是掠夺者，任何独自在公园里的孩子都是，你知道，嗯，被一个糟糕的父母忽视的孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like just giving people the benefit of the doubt is just a great way to live.</p>

仅仅是给予人们信任，就是一种很棒的生活方式。

<p class="english-text">And and it actually, you know, weirdly enough, there was a study done of people who tell their kids, you know, the world is doggy dog place and don't be a psy and everybody's going to try to take advantage of you versus, you know, most people are decent and you can trust and default to trust.</p>
</details>

而且，你知道，奇怪的是，有一项研究针对那些告诉孩子“世界是个弱肉强食的地方，不要傻，每个人都会试图占你便宜”的父母，与那些告诉孩子“大多数人都是正派的，你可以信任，并且默认信任”的父母。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And somehow they studied these two different groups of kids for years like into their middle age and they found that the ones the parents who raised the kids saying like everybody's bad, beware, you know, don't let your guard down were doing it out of love.</p>
</details>

他们以某种方式研究了这两组孩子多年，直到他们中年，他们发现那些父母告诉孩子“每个人都很坏，要小心，不要放松警惕”的人，是出于爱。

<details>

<p class="english-text">They thought that they were protecting their kids, but in fact, those kids in middle age had worse relationships, worse health, and less professional success.</p>

他们认为自己在保护孩子，但事实上，那些孩子在中年时人际关系更差，健康状况更糟，职业成就也更低。

所以，我不太确定为什么，但你最好还是默认选择信任。

<p class="english-text">Well, it's I mean, it's I I think so interesting to think about the the role that communities are playing in all of this.</p>
</details>

嗯，我的意思是，我认为思考社区在这一切中所扮演的角色非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and we have a a question from um from Amy S. who talks about a a four and a six-year-old child children she has and and how she lets her children roam outside of of of her home and often you know gets reactions from from neighbors and is soon would like to see them go to the park two blocks away by themselves and her question is um what whether you have thoughts on how a strategy a good strategy for um a safe solo crosswalk um especially for kids on scooters but I guess this is a question both for how parents can help their kids cross safely, but also what can communities um implement to to make this a better experience for everyone?</p>
</details>

我们有一个来自Amy S.的问题，她谈到她有两个孩子，一个四岁一个六岁，她如何让孩子们在家外自由玩耍，并且经常会收到邻居的反应，她很快希望看到他们自己去两个街区外的公园。她的问题是，嗯，您对如何制定一个好的策略，让孩子安全独自过马路有什么想法，特别是对于骑滑板车的孩子？但我想这既是关于父母如何帮助孩子安全过马路的问题，也是关于社区可以实施什么来让每个人都有更好的体验的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, first of all, I mean, cars have existed for a long time. And boy, in kindergarten, we were taught, you know, the the the school felt it incumbent upon itself to teach look left, look right, look left again.</p>
</details>

是的。嗯，首先，我的意思是，汽车已经存在很长时间了。而且，天哪，在幼儿园时，我们被教导，你知道，学校认为自己有责任教导“向左看，向右看，再向左看”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have no idea why we had to look left and right and left again. Why don't just look left and right and go?</p>

我不知道为什么我们必须向左看、向右看、再向左看。为什么不直接向左看、向右看然后走呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I would teach them that because Mrs. Tixinsky taught me that and so far I'm alive.</p>

但我会教他们那样做，因为Tixinsky夫人就是那样教我的，而且到目前为止我还活着。

<p class="english-text">Um, crosswalks are good if you can convince a neighborhood to put one in.</p>

<p class="english-text">But you can't let perfect be the enemy of the good, I guess, which is that if you have two kids together and they're holding hands and they're both looking left, right, left, and there's no cars coming, they're listening for it and they're looking for it.</p>

他们是人类。他们可以过马路。

嗯，LetGrow做的一件事是，如果你访问我们的网站LetGrow.org。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, one thing that LetGrow has done is that if you go to our site, letGGrow.org.</p>
</details>

我希望我随身带着它，但我们有一张小卡片。这不是它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wish I had it with me, but we have a little um a little card. This isn't it.</p>
</details>

上面写着孩子们可以随身携带。这是LetGrow许可证。上面写着：“我没有迷路或被忽视。我的父母知道我在这里。如果你不相信我，你知道，你可以打电话给我妈妈。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it says it kids can carry it with them. And it's the LetGrow license. It says, "I am not lost or neglected. My parents know I'm out here. If you don't believe me, you know, you can call my mom."</p>
</details>

我们以前更激进的卡片上写着：“打电话给我的律师。”这有点过分了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's some other our our old more um aggressive card used to say, "Call my lawyer. which a little much.</p>
</details>

嗯，但总之，它只是说，而且它说：“我知道我能和人交谈。我不能和任何人走开。我正在和你交谈，我很感谢你关心我是否安全，所以你才和我说话。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but anyways, it just says and it says, "I know I can talk to I can talk to people. I can't go off with anyone. I'm talking to you and I'm grateful that you care, that I'm safe and that's why you're talking to me."</p>
</details>

所以它有点把对方从“你妈妈在哪里？”变成了“谢谢你的关心。这就是重点。你是一个社区里的成年人。你为我担心。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it sort of flips the person from like, "Where's your mom?" to, "Thank you for caring. This is the whole point. You're an adult in the neighborhood. You're worried for me."</p>
</details>

我假设社区里的大多数成年人都是这样，他们在关心我，而不是，你知道，他们想把我妈妈送进监狱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what I assume of most adults in the neighborhood that they're looking out for me as opposed to, you know, they want to throw my mom in jail.</p>
</details>

所以，另一件事是回到尝试创造某种集体行动，无论是通过学校，还是你把纸条放进每个人的邮箱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and the other thing is going back to trying to create some some kind of collective thing either v via the school or you put the notes in everybody's um mailbox.</p>
</details>

让我们举办“自由玩耍星期五”，然后所有孩子都习惯来公园，并习惯两边都看，父母也习惯了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's have free play Fridays and then all the kids get used to coming to the park and looking both ways and the parents get used to it too.</p>

<p class="english-text">It is cars are my least favorite thing. I'm terrified of cars, but I live in a world where there are cars.</p>

所以，你知道，当你教过你的孩子，并且你观察过他们几次，你知道，非常，你知道，比如退后一步，因为一个街区外有辆车，他们想等它完全开过去，你看到他们很认真，我会说到了五岁，嗯，你就可以开始信任他们了。

<p class="english-text">And so, you know, when you've taught your kid and you've watched them a couple times, you know, very, you know, like step back because there's a car a block away and they want to wait for it to get all the way across the street and you see that they're conscientious, I'd say by age five, um, you can start trusting them.</p>

嗯，我喜欢卡片的想法，感觉这是一个非常聪明简单的方法来帮助这个过程，对每个人都适用。

### 培养自信独立孩子的希望

自信、独立的孩子，尽管世界上发生着所有这些事情？嗯，我认为人们正在认识到，我的意思是，我们在这里交谈的事实，我的意思是，我尝试了17年才得到TED演讲的机会，现在是第17年，这种信息得到了合法性的认可，这给了我很大的希望。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> confident independent kids despite all the things going on in the Well, I think the fact that people are recognizing I mean really the the fact that we're talking here I mean I've been trying to get a TED talk for 17 years here it is year 17 and legitimacy shines on this message that gives me a lot of hope.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，**TED**（TED: 著名的非营利组织，以其“TED演讲”而闻名）邀请我演讲，然后我今天又来了，这表明在我开始写博客“放养式育儿”的最初几年，我曾被某个组织评为“美国最具争议的博主”，或者可能是“妈妈博主”，你知道，我得到了“美国最差妈妈”的绰号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the fact that uh you know, Ted invited me to speak and then here I am again today is that for a couple years at the beginning of when I was starting my blog, the the freerange kids blog, I was voted by some organization the most controversial blogger in America or maybe mommy blogger and you know I got this nickname America's worst mom and I think that people are coming to see that like there's something to you know trusting your kids to do more on their own that is um It's not crazy.</p>
</details>

我认为人们开始看到，信任孩子让他们自己做更多事情，这并非疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's actually organic. It's what they were, that's why they want to explore.</p>
