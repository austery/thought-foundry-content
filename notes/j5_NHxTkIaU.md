title: 美国政府重开与“大空头”退隐：市场动荡背后的多重信号
---
### 开盘观察：市场普跌，政府重开未能提振信心

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是11月13日，星期四。就在我准备直播前的五分钟，市场突然转跌。盘前市场本来基本上是绿色的，但现在标普500指数下跌了0.32%，拖累了几乎所有板块。CoreWeave、Iren、英伟达、PayPal都转为下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Thursday, November 13th. We are live and I am happy to be here. Thank you all for being here. We got some red like literally five minutes before before I was ready to go live. I mean like it was it was pretty much green in the pre-markets and then I mean you got the S&P 500 right there 68121 down.32% and that's causing everything to pretty much go red with it. CoreWeave down, Iren down, Nvidia just went red, PayPal went red. We were green. We were trying. We were really trying, but um yeah, we ended up going red.</p>
</details>

今天有很多事情要讨论，包括今早发布的一系列财报。昨天其实是个不错的交易日，虽然大盘整体平淡偏红，但标普500指数收绿。这很重要，因为它显示出资金从科技股轮动到其他板块的“广度交易”正在展开，我认为这相对是看涨的信号。但如你所见，今天盘前市场有些疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of things to talk about. Bunch of things to get through. We got a bunch of earnings this morning that we'll talk about. So, we'll get into those earnings. Yesterday, we actually had a really good day. broader markets were relatively flat to red, but uh the S&P 500 was actually green yesterday, which was important because it showed this broad broadening trade start to really play out uh as money rotated from tech into other sectors, which I think is relatively bullish. But as you can see, we are a bit red in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

### 美国政府重开与特朗普的新口号

一个重大消息是，美国政府现已重新开放。特朗普总统昨天签署了一项法案，正式恢复政府运作。我们将讨论政府开门的影响，以及这是否会开启**圣诞老人行情**（Santa Claus rally: 指股市通常在12月最后一周至次年1月前两个交易日上涨的趋势），或者至少为年底的反弹创造条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government is now reopen and that is a very big deal. Trump did sign a bill yesterday to reopen the government officially. Uh and we'll talk about the implications of what it means for the government being open. Is this the start of the Santa Claus rally or does it at least create a framework for an end of year rally? We'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

今天收盘后，我们将与Chris进行“宏观星期四”的讨论。我知道过去几周因为财报季我们没能进行，但他今天会来，我们将深入探讨宏观经济的现状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to have macro Thursday with Chris today on the market close. I know we haven't been able to do it for the past couple weeks because we've had a lot of earnings, but uh he'll be on and we'll get through all of our thoughts on what's going on in the macro.</p>
</details>

我们先从政府停摆正式结束开始。这是特朗普昨天的讲话，我希望大家注意他在谈论停摆结束时使用的措辞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we'll start off with uh this government shutdown officially ending. Here is Trump yesterday talking about the government shutdown being over. And I I want people to pay attention to the choice of words that he uses as he's talking about the shutdown officially being done.</p>
</details>

> 随着我的签署，联邦政府现在将恢复正常运作。我的政府和国会的合作伙伴将继续努力，降低生活成本，恢复公共安全，发展我们的经济，让所有美国人都能再次负担得起美国。成本已经大幅下降，能源价格大幅下降，汽油价格从4.7美元降至每加仑2.50美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> With my signature, the federal government will now resume normal operations and my administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy, and make America affordable again for all Americans. Again, costs are way down. Energy is way down. Gasoline is at $2.50 a gallon versus $4.7.</p>
</details>

在接下来的四分钟里，他一直在谈论“可负担性”。请注意，他没有说“让美国再次伟大”，而是说“让美国再次负担得起”。我认为这是本届政府开始积极采取的一种策略，试图围绕“可负担性”来构建叙事。他在那次会议上没有回答任何问题，只是花了大约11分钟谈论这个概念，并指责民主党造成了政府停摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> He goes on for the next four minutes to talk about affordability. I mean, notice what he said. We are not going to make America great again. We are going to make America affordable again. I think this is the role that the administration is starting to take a more active pursuit on in terms of figuring out how they can frame the narrative around affordability. Uh he didn't take any questions during that uh meeting. It was it was about 11 minutes of him talking about the concept of affordability, blaming the Democrats for the shutdown.</p>
</details>

### 数据迷雾：政府停摆后遗症影响美联储决策

新闻秘书Carolyn Levit昨天表示，政府停摆将使第四季度GDP减少两个百分点，这意味着我们可能只能得到1.5%的增长，而不是3.5%，这对市场显然不是好消息。她还说，10月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 居民消费价格指数，衡量消费者购买的商品和服务价格变化的指标）和就业数据将不会公布。所以，那些说今天有CPI数据的人，我们今天没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh which Carolyn Levit the press secretary yesterday said it will take away two points from the Q4 GDP which means instead of getting 3.5% we might get 1.5% which is obviously not the best for the markets if the growth is not that strong. Uh and then she said October CPI and jobs numbers are not going to be coming out. So for those saying that we have CPI data today, we do not have CPI data today.</p>
</details>

新闻秘书昨天表示，由于政府停摆，获取CPI数据或就业数据的能力，不仅是10月份，未来也受到了损害。

> 停摆可能导致第四季度经济增长减少整整两个百分点。民主党的停摆使得经济学家、投资者和美联储的政策制定者极难获得关键的政府数据。民主党可能已经永久性地损害了联邦统计系统，10月份的CPI和就业报告可能永远不会发布，所有发布的经济数据都将受到永久性损害，使我们的美联储决策者在关键时期如同盲人摸象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are not getting CPI data because the press secretary yesterday said that based on the shutdown, the ability to get any of that CPI data or jobs data, not only for October but in the future, has now been compromised. >> Shutdown could end up decreasing fourth quarter economic growth by two whole percentage points. The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economics uh economists, investors, and policy makers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data. The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released, and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policy makers at the Fed flying lines at a critical period.</p>
</details>

所以，我们得不到10月份的数据，这对市场显然不是好事。正如特朗普所说，他们想“让美国再次负担得起”。这显然是他的演讲撰稿人写的，他们注意到了全国民众对“可负担性”这个概念的关注。我从未听过特朗普说这样的话，但这似乎成了新的叙事。这也与我们昨天得到的报道一致，即特朗普计划在未来几个月内举行大量竞选集会，谈论经济和可负担性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're not getting October data, which obviously isn't the best for markets. And then, as you can see, based on what Trump said, uh, we want to make America affordable again. I mean, that was obviously written by his speech writers, they are noticing the temperature of the country that is really focused on this concept of affordability. I've never heard Trump say, "We're going to make America affordable again." But that seems to be the new narrative. That also is consistent with the reporting that we had yesterday that Trump is planning to do a lot of these campaign rallies over the next couple of months speaking about the economy and affordability.</p>
</details>

这对投资者意味着什么？我认为有几点。第一，特朗普昨天再次确认的2000美元股息可能真的会实现，即使不是以刺激支票的形式，也可能是以税收返还的形式，针对收入低于某个水平的人群。这显然会刺激整体经济和市场。政府也看到了将资金投入生态系统的必要性，特别是如果他们认为可负担性是个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what does this mean for investors? Well, I think it means a couple things. Number one, the implications of that $2,000 dividend, which Trump reconfirmed yesterday, might be very real, even if it's in the form of not a stem check, but a form of a tax rebate uh for people that are making under 100,000. That could be obviously stimulative to the broader economy and to the market, but there is a necessity that the administration is seeing that they need to be able to put that money out there into the ecosystem, especially if they think affordability is an issue.</p>
</details>

第二是关税问题。特朗普几天前确认将大幅降低关税。他们可能认为需求正在下降，需要降低关税来降低价格，或者他们认为价格太高，影响了需求，所以需要降低关税。问题是这对股市经济学意味着什么？我认为目前与过去几个月的情况没有太大不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is this tariff argument. So Trump did confirm a couple days ago, we watched that clip of him saying that tariffs are going to come down substantially. The scent also started to uh confirm that as well on coffee, bananas, etc. They might be thinking that either demand's going down and they need to reduce tariffs to reduce prices or they may be thinking that prices are getting too high, which could also be affecting demand and that's why tariffs need to be coming down. The question is what does this mean for the economics of the stock market? And I think right now it doesn't mean anything that's too different from what we've been seeing over the past couple of months.</p>
</details>

即使停摆结束，美联储降息的概率仍然处于最低点。我刚看了最新的数据，现在几乎是五五开，53.4%。昨天还是65%。这是在几位美联储主席表示不支持降息之后。虽然不是多数，但已经接近多数了。美联储主席柯林斯昨天表示，她认为目前的政策限制性还不够。如果他们12月不降息，我认为我们会遇到一些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Fed rate cut probabilities, even with this shutdown ending, are still the lowest they've been. Wow. I'm just looking at the updated one. It's legitimately a cost right now. 53.4%. 53. It was 65 yesterday. This is after a couple of Fed presidents came out and said that um they don't support a rate cut. It's not a majority of the Fed, but it's it's a decent chunk of it's it's enough to get close to a majority. The Fed President Collins yesterday came out yesterday and said, "Hey, like I think we are not restrictive enough." And so that I mean, I don't know, man. If they don't want to give us this rate cut in December, I think we're going to have some issues, but that is something we're gonna have to keep up with.</p>
</details>

美联储内部将不得不应对这些细微的差别。希望最终能在12月降息，但目前看来有点黯淡。根据我们看到的新概率，现在真的是五五开。政府对可负担性的关注也强化了这一点，即劳动力市场可能在挣扎，通胀可能在上升。人们肯定感觉不到物价在下降。希望美联储能以更积极、更具建设性的方式，通过降息来应对，但这还需要一个半月的时间才能知道结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's the internal nuances that the Fed is going to have to grapple with over the coming months. And you know, hopefully that goes in the direction of a rate cut in December. But as of now, it is looking a little bleak. I mean, it's literally 50/50 based on these new probabilities that we're seeing right here. And the administration's f focus on affordability is only kind of reinforcing that point that the labor market could be struggling. Inflation could be inching higher. People definitely are not feeling that prices are coming down. And hopefully the Fed reacts to that in a more positive way or in a more constructive way with rate cuts, but obviously it's going to take another month and a half to figure out how that played out.</p>

### “大空头”退隐：Michael Burry关闭基金，转向内容创作

昨晚爆出的真正大新闻是关于Michael Burry在Palantir上的看跌期权有了更多信息。他澄清了具体的数字，并且他的基金似乎不再存在了。所以我们有很多要谈的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then the really big news that broke as of last night is a bit more information on this put that Michael Burry put on Palantir. He ended up clarifying exactly what the numbers look like and also uh there's an update on his fund which seems to not exist anymore. So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. Thank you everybody for being here and let's officially get into it.</p>
</details>

他昨天澄清了很多事情，我认为这很重要。他说他在8月和9月左右以1.84美元的价格购买了5万份Palantir的看跌期权。他花了920万美元，而不是9.12亿美元。为什么媒体报道的是9.12亿？我昨晚算了一下，据我理解，如果你用5万份看跌期权乘以每份合约100股，得到500万股。然后乘以当时Palantir的股价18.2美元，你就会得到9.12亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so he clarified a lot yesterday and uh I think it was really important that he clarified, but here's what he said. He bought 50,000 puts on Palantir for a $1.84 around September and uh August. He spent $9.2 million, not $912 million. Why did the media report 912? I was doing some math on this last night and from my understanding if you take 50,000 which is the the the amount of puts you he bought on Palantir. Multiply that by a 100 shares per contract because one contract is 100 shares. You get 5 million shares, right? And then you multiply that by the stock price of Palantir at the time which is 18.2, you get 912 million, right?</p>
</details>

我认为媒体一直报道的名义价值是，如果你行使所有这些看跌期权并乘以当时的股价，就会得到那个数字。但这并不是描述他实际押注的正确计算方式。媒体需要更好地沟通这个名义价值，因为他并没有在Palantir的看跌期权上下注十亿美元。他下的赌注，可能纽约市街边的对冲基金在Palantir上的看跌期权都比Burry多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the notional value that the media kept reporting was if you were to exercise all those puts and multiply them by the current price of the stock, that's where you get 912. it was not the right way to calculate that to be able to describe the actual bet that he took uh or like you know the notional value just needed to be better communicated by the media because he was not taking a billion dollar bet on Palantir puts. He was taking a bet like there's hedge funds down the street in New York City that probably have more puts on Palantir than Burry has.</p>
</details>

所以，他因做空Palantir和英伟达而备受关注，但对于英伟达，他只有1万份看跌期权。所以，这不是对Palantir和英伟达的十亿美元赌注，而是不到2000万美元的赌注。顺便说一句，根据我们看到的报道，他似乎已经卖掉了大部分，或者至少卖掉了一半，在过去几周的下跌后，基本持平或略有盈利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the fact that he's been getting all this attention on being short Palantir and Nvidia and for Nvidia it's 10,000 puts. So, it's it's not the sort of billion dollar bet on Palantir and Nvidia. It's less than a $20 million bet. And by the way, based on reporting that we're looking at, seems like he sold most of them or at least he sold half of them for about break even or a slight profit after the dip over the past couple of weeks.</p>
</details>

这就引出了一个问题，他为什么要披露这些？他为什么要公布出来？似乎原因是他将在11月25日做一些新的事情。这是他昨天更新的个人简介：“Unchained博客将于11月25日上线。”看起来他正在放弃资金管理，转而成为一名内容创作者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, then begs the question, why is he disclosing it, right? Why is he putting this out? And it seems like for the reason that he is doing something new on November 25th, this was his updated bio yesterday. Uh, now Unchained blog launches November 25th. It seems like he's giving up money management to become a content creator. That's what I think is happening.</p>
</details>

我们如何得到更多证实呢？如果你看看这封正在疯传的信，据我了解，这封信是真的，特别是因为Burry甚至发推文附上了他在美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的Scion资产管理公司的注册状态截图。你可以看到，这是Burry的推文，上面写着：“注册状态：已终止。生效日期：2025年11月10日。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and how do we have more confirmation on that? Well, if you take a look at this letter that's been going viral, and from my understanding, this letter is real, especially because Burry even tweeted a picture of his SEC registration status for Scion Asset Management. As you can see right there, this is from Burry's tweet. It says, "Registration status terminated. Effective date 11/10/2025."</p>
</details>

然后，这封信流传开来，信中写道：“亲爱的投资者，我怀着沉重的心情，将清算基金并返还资本，但在年底前会保留一小部分用于审计和税务。我对证券价值的估计现在以及一段时间以来都与市场不同步。我衷心感谢，也深表歉意，祝愿你们未来的投资顺利。此致，Michael Burry。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you have this letter that's going around that says, "Dear investors, with a heavy heart, I will liquidate the funds and return capital, but for a small audit tax hold back by year's end, my estimation of value in securities is not now and has not been for some time in sync with the markets. With heartfelt thanks, but also with apologies, I wish you well in your future investments. Sincerely, Michael Burry."</p>
</details>

当我看到这封信时，我以为是假的，但现在看到他在SEC的注册状态被终止，而且Burry自己也发了这张图，感觉他真的不干资金管理了。那么问题来了，他11月25日要做什么？如果他真的要开一个博客，那也行。但我好奇这个博客是关于什么的。因为如果博客是关于AI是假的，或者如何找到下一个大泡沫之类的，他并没有把自己的钱投进去，至少不是从机构管理资金的角度。也许他个人资金在做空所有AI相关的东西，但如果只是在Palantir上投了1000万美元，那就算不上大空头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I thought this was fake when I saw this letter going around, but now that I see his registration statement with the SEC being terminated again, Burry tweeted this picture, it it feels very real that he's done managing money. So then the question becomes, what is he doing on November 25th? And if he's really starting a blog, that's fine. But I wonder what the blog is about. Because if the blog is about how AI is fake or how to find the next big bubble or whatever, he's not putting his money where his mouth is. At least not from a institutional perspective of managing money. Maybe his personal money is short everything AI. Uh but again, if it's only like $10 million on Palantir, it's just not a big short.</p>
</details>

### 财报季观察：迪士尼、思科等公司喜忧参半

迪士尼也发布了财报，表现平平。我不会说这是最好的。他们每股收益（EPS）超出预期9%，为1.11美元，预期为1.02美元；但营收未达预期1%，为224亿美元，预期为227亿美元。具体来看，Disney+和Hulu的订阅用户总数为1.96亿，其中Disney+为1.32亿。他们宣布了每股1.5美元的现金股息，并预计2026和2027财年调整后每股收益将实现两位数增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's what we had for Disney also had earnings. It was okay. I wouldn't say it was the best. They beat EPS by 9% 1.11 versus 1.02 missed revenue by 1%. 22.4 versus 22.7 billion. In terms of the specifics on their numbers, um they had Disney Plus and Hulu subscriptions 196 million subscribers. Disney Plus was 132 million. They gave a cash dividend of 1.50 a share. And they're expecting doubledigit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2026 and 2027.</p>
</details>

我从2023年起就对迪士尼持看空态度，但我记得几年前谈论它时，我最大的担忧是，我觉得他们不再令人兴奋了。主题公园业务是资本密集型的，而且与Netflix相比，他们的知识产权（IP）已经不那么有趣了。他们的IP是永恒的，但我的孩子的孩子真的还会关心米老鼠吗？所以，我一直对这个品牌持怀疑态度。它是一家品质优良的企业，只是过去五年里没什么作为，但数字在持续增长。迪士尼股价目前下跌了约5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, I I I wouldn't say I've been bearish Disney since like 2023, but I remember talking about it years ago, and my biggest concern Disney's right here down 5% was just I just don't think they're exciting anymore. The parks business is capital intensive, and the IP is just not interesting compared to what Netflix is doing. The IP is timeless. It's just are my kids kids really going to care about Mickey Mouse, you know? So, it's like I've always kind of felt iffy on the brand. It's a amazing quality business. business just over the past five years it hasn't done much but the numbers continue to grow stock right here is down about 5% for what we have on Disney.</p>
</details>

思科也加入了这场派对。思科股价上涨了6%。思科的股价通常不会有这样的波动。它昨天上涨了3%，今天又上涨了6%，总共上涨了9%。这可是思科，它通常不会在一天内上涨9%，但它做到了。他们的财报很好，网络和AI方面的需求大幅增加。所以，华尔街显然在奖励它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cisco joining the party. I mean Cisco up 6% right here. Cisco does not move the way that it's moving right here. It was up 3% yesterday, up 6% today. So up 9% again. This is Cisco. CIS Cisco doesn't move 9% in a day, but it did. And so uh they had a good earnings. They are seeing a lot more demand for networking and AI. So obviously, you know, the streets were boarding it.</p>
</details>

### 数据中心板块回调：Oracle债务引发的连锁反应

数据中心相关的交易也受到了冲击。Nebius昨天收盘价高于94美元，现在是91.60美元，随着大盘下跌，许多数据中心概念股也随之下跌。CoreWeave下跌约1%，Iren下跌约4.3%。所以今天将是重要的一天，看这些股票能否反弹，还是会成为“下落的飞刀”。如果它们继续下跌，我认为会出现一些非常有吸引力的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The data center trade obviously is getting hit as well. Nebius did close above 94 yesterday. It's at 91.60 as the broader market takes a hit. A lot of these data center plays are going to take a hit as well. CoreWeave right here down about 1%. Iren down about 4.3%. So, today's going to be an important day to see can these guys kind of rebound? Is there any level of rebound or are they falling knives? And if they are falling knives, then I think there's going to be some very attractive opportunities if they continue to get hit.</p>
</details>

我认为这些数据中心概念股确实需要一次回调。很多股票涨得太疯狂了，而且很多甚至还没有真正证明它们的商业模式，它们只是做了一个转型。这包括Nebius，当然也包括CoreWeave，尽管Nebius的财报非常出色，并且他们确实证明了自己在做什么。但即使Nebius跌到75美元，它今年迄今的涨幅仍有150%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really do think these data center plays deserve a correction. A lot of them are running like crazy and a lot of them haven't even really proven their business models. they've just made a pivot and that includes a Nebius and of course even though Nebius has phenomenal earnings and you know they've definitely proved out what they're doing but you know Nebius even if it goes down to 75 will be up 150% year to date.</p>
</details>

Oracle发行了价值400亿美元的债务，我认为这吓到了数据中心交易市场的投资者。如果你看看Oracle的**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swaps: 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者转移信用风险），它们的趋势比Oracle的股价还要高，也就是说，更多的投资者在购买针对Oracle破产或其债券违约的保护，而不是押注Oracle的股票本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oracle issuing $40 billion worth of debt, I think, has spooked the market for the data center trade. If you look at Oracle's credit default swaps, they are trending higher than Oracle stock price, aka more investors are buying protection on Oracle going bankrupt or at least their their bonds uh defaulting, which is unlikely, but nonetheless, you know, that's the reason for protection. Uh versus betting on Oracle stock itself.</p>
</details>

> 微软、亚马逊和谷歌拥有所有客户，手头有现金，并且有巨大的现金流。所以当他们建立一个数据中心时，它已经提前三年售罄了。他们两周前告诉我们，仅在过去90天里，他们就看到了客户对AI需求的积极拐点。这是健康、负责任的投资。不负责任的投资是当你开始借钱为初创公司提供容量时，这就是Oracle所做的。Oracle最初在财报中告诉我们，他们刚刚从几家公司赢得了3000亿美元的积压订单。第二天，我们发现只有OpenAI。随后我们发现，OpenAI承诺了1.4万亿美元，但无意履行这些义务。它认为这是一种灵活的安排。

<details>

So when they build a data center they're it's already sold three years in advance. So and they just told us two weeks ago that just over the last 90 days they've seen a positive inflection point in demand for AI from their customers which is everybody. So that's healthy responsible investment. The irresponsible investment as you've been talking about is when you start borrowing to provide capacity for startups and that's what Oracle did. Oracle originally told us on their earnings, oh, we just won $300 billion of backlog from several companies. The next day, we found out it was only OpenAI. Then we subsequently found out that OpenAI has committed $1.4 trillion and has no intention of living up to those obligations. it considers it a flexible arrangement that they can</p>

我认为这就是为什么市场在打击Nebius、CoreWeave以及所有这些其他公司。基于Oracle即将到期的债务问题，这些数据中心概念股正在持续受到冲击。

### 市场展望：圣诞老人行情会到来吗？

你认为我们不会有圣诞老人行情吗？我认为圣诞老人真的能从烟囱下来，吃掉饼干喝掉牛奶的概率已经下降了。顺便说一下，京东的每股收益超预期27%，营收超预期2%。

<p class="english-text">Do you think we don't get a Santa Claus rally? I think that the ability for Santa Claus to actually come down the chimney and eat the cookies and drink the milk has in terms of probabilities gone down. JD by the way beating 27% % on EPS beating 2% on revenue.</p>
</details>

我是否仍然认为你应该为圣诞老人准备好饼干和牛奶？是的。也就是说，你应该继续留在市场里。但我认为他一定会吃饼干和牛奶吗？嗯，这很大程度上取决于你如何烤饼干。而鲍威尔（JPOW）烤的这些饼干，味道好的概率并不高。也就是说，我们获得降息的可能性不大。

<p class="english-text">Do I still think you should leave the cookies and milk out for Santa Claus? Yes. Aka, you should still be in the market. But do I think he's definitely going to eat the cookies and milk? Well, I mean, a big portion of that depends on how you cook the cookies. And JPOW is not cooking these cookies with a high probability of the cookies tasting good. aka us getting a rate cut.</p>

### 内部政治分歧与医疗保健僵局

政府停摆结束了。我从民主党，至少是民主党更左翼那里听到的一件事是，与共和党一起投票的八名民主党人完全是无缘无故地投了票。他们认为之所以如此，是因为在过去43天里，头号问题是医疗保健，正如议长迈克·约翰逊所说。他们不保证会以任何有意义的方式再次对医疗保健进行投票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the shutdown is over. One of the things I've heard from the Democratic party or at least the the the further left wing of the Democratic party uh is that the eight Democrats that voted with the Republicans completely voted for no reason with the Republicans. And the reason for why those uh why that's the case or at least why they think that's the case is over the past 43 days the number one issue was healthcare as Mike Johnson was talking about um they are not guaranteeing that health care is going to be voted on again in any meaningful way.</p>
</details>

你刚听到迈克·约翰逊基本上说，我们不会回到几年前在医疗保健上做的那种补贴，而从他的角度看，这正是民主党想要的。所以，像查克·舒默、佩洛西以及所有在众议院和参议院投了反对票的民主党人都非常生气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You just heard Mike Johnson basically say we are not going back to the types of subsidies we were doing years ago on healthcare which is what from his perspective the Democrats want. So the Chuck Schumers of the world, the Pelosis, all those other people that voted, I mean, all the Democrats that voted against this in the House and the Senate, they are really pissed off.</p>
</details>

因此，这也回到了圣诞老人行情的问题上，这是我们不能忽视的。说到底，面对一个将在两个月后再次重新谈判的政府停摆，以及12月将进行的可能不会有任何进展的医疗保健投票，我们真的能迎来圣诞老人行情吗？话虽如此，我们昨天也讨论了牛市的理由。所以有很多值得看涨的地方，这就是为什么我认为你应该保持净多头。但是，如果我们现在要为圣诞老人行情设定一个概率，我真的认为是50/50。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that also going back to this Santa Claus rally is something we can't ignore. I mean, at the end of the day, do we really get a Santa Claus rally in the face of a government shutdown that will be renegotiated again in two months with a healthc are vote happening in December that potentially might not lead to any progress. Having said that, we talked about the bull case yesterday. So, there's plenty of things to be bullish about, which is why I think you stay net long. But if we're, you know, putting a probability on the Santa Claus rally right now, I really do think it's 50/50.</p>

### 半导体行业深度分析：AMD与英伟达的未来

**Jose:** 他们给出的财务数据简直是疯了。他们提到在未来三到五年内，每股收益将超过20美元。这有点道理，因为我们还记得Sam Altman的OpenAI和AMD的交易，其中最后一档股票价格大约是600美元。如果你给出20美元的每股收益，而半导体股票通常的市盈率在30左右，那就能在未来五年内得到600美元的股价。所以，似乎双方都同意这支股票在未来五年内可能达到600美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jose:** Uh I I mean, just the financial numbers that they gave were insane. just the uh by within the next three to five years the $20 at least they they mentioned over $20 of earnings per share uh within the next three to five years. So uh I mean if it it kind of makes sense because I I don't know if we remember the Sam Altman Open AAI and AMD deal where um AMD um the last trench of of stock price that they would give would be at roughly a $600 stock price. Now, if you kind of give a $20 earnings per share and the typical PE ratio semiconductor stocks is usually around 30, that would give you that stock price of of $600 within the next five years. So, it seems like both parties are agreeing that this stock within the at least the next five years could see $600 and we now have that financial number with historical PE ratios to kind of correlate together.</p>
</details>

**Jose:** 对我来说，第二个最大的收获是，他们预计将获得超过50%的服务器CPU市场份额。而且预计随着AI GPU的发展，这个份额还会继续增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Jose:** So, um AMD, I think that was the biggest takeaway. The second biggest takeaway was for me was they expect um to get over 50% of server CPU market share. Um and that's expected to continue to grow with AI GPUs as well.</p>

如果AMD在未来5年内将增长35%，这对我来说似乎非常惊人。这是否意味着在你看来，英伟达在未来5年内至少会增长35%？

<details>

<p class="english-text">topline revenue growth of 35% over the next 5 years. Here's the big question. If if if AMD is going to grow 35% over the next 5 years, which I thought I didn't know they were going to put out those numbers, that seems to me like it's pretty damn incredible. Does that mean Nvidia is going to grow at least 35% in your opinion over the next 5 years?</p>
</details>

**Jose:** 我不这么认为。原因是，幸运的是，AMD有机会从一个较小的基数开始。我仍然相信英伟达的增长速度会超过整个市场。请记住，那是35%的复合年增长率。所以可能某一年会增长100%，另一年可能只有15%左右。但总的来说，未来三到五年的复合年增长率将是35%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jose:** I don't think so. Um the reason being is luckily for AMD has the opportunity from starting from a small base. I do believe still Nvidia will grow at a faster rate than the overall market. Remember that was 35% compounded annual growth rate. So maybe one year might be like 100% and another year might be like 15% or whatever. But overall the the compounded annual growth rate within the next three to five years is going to be 35.</p>

### 宏观风险：劳动力市场疲软与通胀担忧再起

明尼苏达联储的卡什卡利（Kashkari）正在讲话。根据我看到的引述，他说：“通货膨胀率在3%仍然太高。”难道所有这些联储主席都聚在一个房间里，商量好要进行媒体闪电战，宣称他们不想降息吗？因为感觉就是这样。

<p class="english-text">Um, you got low of days, folks. I think we're getting some Fed speak that's causing this low of day. Kashkari, our boy from the Minnesota Fed, he Fed, he's speaking right now. And based on the quotes I'm seeing, Inflation is still too high at 3%. Did all these Fed presidents get in a room and disagree to go on a media blitz talking about how they don't want to do a rate cut? Cuz that's what it feels like.</p>

尽管如此，瑞银集团（UBS）仍然相当看好市场。

> **UBS分析师：** 我们的基本预测是到2026年6月，标普500指数达到7300点。我们认为最高可能达到8000点。但实际上，你面临的情况是，财政责任是本届政府的一个关键原则。下周将有一位新的商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）主席得到确认。我们将拥有鼓励增长的监管，结合这种技术创新和新的财政理念，这可能真正帮助美国成为世界技术领导者，同时巩固我们的资产负债表，并拥有一个更好的国债前景。

<p class="english-text">>> So, our our base case is 7,300 by by June of 2026. We could see it go as high as 8,000, but really you have a situation where you have um fiscal responsibility as a key key tenant of this administration. Next week, there's there there's a news story that people aren't focusing on. There's a new CFTC chair that is being confirmed next week. And the idea that we're going to have regulation that that encourages growth in the context of this technological innovation and fiscal ideas that are on the table that are new, that this could really help America become the technology leader of the world and also shore up our balance sheet and have a much better treasury picture going forward.</p>

</details>

> **UBS分析师：** 是的，我认为它可能会变得泡沫化，但我不认为我们已经到了那个地步。因为请记住，在今年这次反弹的过程中，我们受到了对关税担忧的限制。这些担忧在一定程度上已经消失了，而且我认为我们还没有完全消化一个新的财政图景对这个国家意味着什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Well, yeah, I think that it could get frothy, but I don't think we're there yet because remember during the course of this rally this year, we've had the restraints of fears about tariffs. those those fears have gone away to a certain extent and I don't think that we fully have processed what it's going to mean to have a new fiscal picture for this country.</p>
