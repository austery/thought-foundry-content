title: AT&T CEO John Stankey 谈电信行业未来、AI驱动与领导力
---
### 欢迎来到AT&T

主持人: 大家好，欢迎收看“In Good Company”节目，今天我们从纽约现场直播。我抵达纽约后做的第一件事，就是把手机里的**SIM卡**（Subscriber Identity Module: 用户身份模块）换成了AT&T的SIM卡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everybody and welcome to In Good Company, and today we are live from New York. Now, the first thing I did when I arrived was to change my SIM card in my phone to an AT&T SIM card.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 谢谢你这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for that.</p>
</details>

主持人: 因此，能和整个**AT&T**（American Telephone and Telegraph Company: 美国电话电报公司）的首席执行官坐在这里，感觉很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so therefore, it's kind of fun to be here with the CEO of the whole company, AT&T.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 很高兴能和你在一起，也谢谢你把SIM卡换成AT&T的。AT&T，美国电话电报公司，你知道，它是由**亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔**（Alexander Graham Bell）在1877年创立的。这真是一段漫长的历史，对吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's good to be with you, and thank you for changing your SIM card to an AT&T SIM card. Now, AT&T, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, founded by Alexander Graham Bell going back to like 1877. That's quite a history, right?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我们明年就将迎来150周年，所以这是一个大日子。

<p class="english-text">We're just about on year 150 next year. So, it's a big deal.</p>

### 电信行业的变革与竞争

主持人: 电信行业一直都引人入胜，那么目前这个行业里最吸引你的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, telecom industry has always been fascinating and interesting, but what's interesting for you in the industry right now?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我认为在美国有两件事非常重要，因为在旨在放松对各种通信形式管制的**电信法**（Telecom Act）出台之后，我们现在正看到技术真正实现这一目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's two things that are really important in the United States because of what came after the telecom act which was an attempt to deregulate all the various forms of communication. We're now seeing technology actually achieve that.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 无线、固定和卫星之间存在真正的**互模竞争**（intermodal competition: 不同通信技术之间的竞争）。因此，美国正在进行一场资产重组。过去，公司可能专注于某一种技术分支，但现在，关键在于你是否能提供一个网络，让客户接入互联网，并且无论他们需要无线、固定连接还是通过卫星，你都能做到。这种资产重组非常有趣，因为它将重新调整市场中的赢家和输家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's real intermodal competition between wireless and fixed and satellite. And as a result of that, there's a reordering of assets going on in the United States. And where we used to have companies that focus maybe in one technology branch or another, it's now just about can you deliver a network that gets customers on the internet and can you do it whether they need to be on wireless or a fixed connection or through satellite and that reordering of assets is pretty interesting because I think it's going to readjust the winners and losers in the market and that's</p>
</details>

主持人: 但是数据流量正在爆炸式增长，我们使用得越来越多，然而电信行业却明显落后于“七巨头”（Magnificent Seven）和大型科技股。这是为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But data traffic is exploding, right? We are using it more and more and more, yet the telecom sector is kind of certainly lagging the, you know, the the Magnificent Seven and the big tech stocks. Why, why is that?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，这显然是高利润产品带来的附加值。当有人能够占据主导市场地位时，他们往往能获得更好的利润，而“七巨头”在各自的领域都做到了这一点。就我们而言，我们身处一个竞争激烈的行业，因此我们的增长往往与**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值）持平或略高于GDP。我们目前还未能像他们那样获得主导地位和高利润。话虽如此，这个行业的下一个令人兴奋的部分是，**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）将推动数据和使用需求的又一个增长周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's uh clearly the value add on the high margin products. When somebody can carve out a dominant market position, they tend to drive better margins than the Magnificent Seven have managed to do that in each of their segments. In our case, we're pretty competitive industry and as a result of that, we tend to grow at GDP or GDP a little bit plus and um our ability to kind of carve that same uh dominant position at large margins just hasn't arrived at this point. Having said that, the next exciting part about the industry is the fact that AI is going to drive another growth cycle in data and usage demand.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我们认为这将是未来业务增长的独特机会，并且如果你在当前这个变革周期中进行正确投资，它将带来持续稳定的现金流改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we think that's going to be a unique opportunity for growth in our business moving forward. And it's going to allow for that consistent uh steady improvement of cash flows if you invest correctly during this change cycle that's occurring right now.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，我们应该如何看待数据爆炸式增长与基础设施提供商之间的关系呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so how should we look at the relationship between the explosive growth in data and the providers of the infrastructure?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我认为多年来人们一直在问，随着消费的持续增长，你是否能够实现盈利性增长？这种情况已经持续了几十年。我想说的是，过去几年的数据表明，尽管消费者对使用更多数据有着永不满足的需求，但通过技术更有效地运营我们的业务，以及我们为产品增加价值和差异化定价的能力，我们正在业务中获得稳健的回报。我确实预计这种情况会继续下去，特别是随着我们看到客户从一家公司购买跨多个网络的服务，以及我们更高效、更有效地从每个家庭中实现盈利的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think what um you know for many years people are saying are you going to be able to profitably grow as consumption continues to grow and that's really been going on for decades and I would say that the data points over the last number of years have shown that despite the fact that consumers have an insatiable demand to use more and more data by the virtue of technology operating our business more effectively the ability for us to add value into products and price differently we are driving solid returns in our business And I do expect that's going to continue moving forward, especially as we see more convergence of customers buying services from one company across multiple networks and your ability to be even more efficient and more effective at monetizing that household.</p>
</details>

### AT&T的战略调整：剥离内容，聚焦连接

主持人: 回到2016年，你收购了**华纳传媒**（Warner Media: 曾属于AT&T的媒体和娱乐公司）。当时人们认为，我们需要将内容和分发结合起来。但后来人们意识到，这并不是一个特别好的主意。回顾那段经历，你从中吸取了哪些教训？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if we go back some years to um 2016, you you bought Warner Media. At that stage, one thought, okay, we need to combine content and distribution. And then um one realized that uh you know that that wasn't a particularly good idea. But when you look back and that at that what what was the learnings from that in a way?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 有好几点。首先，我想说，当你考虑改变一个传统商业模式并对其进行重新定位时，你最好能够大力投资以实现这一目标。我认为其中一个教训是，媒体业正在经历自身的重新定位和商业模式所需的再造。当然，正如我们刚才讨论的，电信业也面临同样的情况。在当今的竞争环境中，如果你不积极投资以在一个领域获胜，就很难成功。而在任何公司的公开资产负债表上，试图同时在两个行业中重新定位，可能需要比公开市场愿意提供的更多现金和耐心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's there's several. Um one is I would tell you uh when you think about changing a traditional business model and having to reposition it, you best be in a position to invest heavily to make that happen. And and I think one of the learnings was media was going through its own uh repositioning and the re-engineering that was necessary in the business model. And certainly as we just discussed, telecommunications was seeing the same thing. And in today's competitive environment, if you're not investing aggressively to kind of win in a space, it's really hard to be successful. And on anybody's uh public balance sheet, trying to reposition in two industries at the same time probably requires more cash and more patience than what the public markets are willing to offer.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你们决定剥离内容业务。你们是如何做出这个决定的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You decided to divest the content business. Uh how did you come up with that?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这是必要的。为了让我们在核心**连接业务**（connectivity: 提供网络连接服务）上做到真正出色，鉴于我们刚才讨论的行业现状——再投资、重新定位、互模竞争，我们必须加大投资。我们必须在自己所做的事情上做得更好。我认为今天，我们对客户的了解是，他们对不够出色的产品容忍度很低。互联网无疑向我们所有人展示了这一点。随着事情变得更加动态，转换成本降低，客户会选择最好的产品和最好的交易。我们必须对业务进行再投资才能实现这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was necessary. It was uh in order for us to be really good at our core business, which was connectivity. Um given what was going on in the industry that we just discussed, reinvestment, repositioning, interotal competition, we had to step up our investments. We had to get better at what we were doing. And I think today, one thing we know about customers is they have a low tolerance for less than a great product. And that's certainly something the internet has shown us all. And as things have become much more dynamic and switching costs are lower, customers are going to go where they get the best best product and the best deal. We had to reinvest in our business to make that happen.</p>
</details>

主持人: 客户现在有多不宽容？因为我不知道自己有多不宽容，但我知道如果我无法在某个时间段内联系上，我会非常不宽容。客户现在能接受的时间延迟是多久？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How intolerant are customers now? Because I don't know how into I know exactly how intolerant I am if I don't get in touch, you know, within whatever. Just how what's the what's what's kind of the time lag that customers are accepting now?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的，我认为这取决于产品。我认为我们的产品，你知道，幸运的是被视为人们生活中的必需品。它对他们来说非常重要，坦率地说，他们每个月都会投入相当多的钱。所以我们不是那种5美元的订阅服务。你知道，我们是那种他们需要非常仔细考虑才能建立关系的服务。所以，如果我们向他们表明我们了解他们，并且在绝大多数时间里我们都提供了好的产品，他们可能会对我们的失误更宽容一些。但坦率地说，这个行业过去存在的很多转换惯性现在已经不存在了。你一开始就提到，你来到这个城市，把一张新的**SIM卡**（Subscriber Identity Module: 用户身份模块）插到手机里，然后你就接入了我们的网络。如果你对我们明天的服务不满意，你可能会去别人的地方买一张SIM卡，然后插到手机里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it depends on the product. I think our product, you know, fortunately is viewed as a staple in somebody's life. It's so critical to them and frankly they invest a fair amount every month. So we're not the $5 subscription. You know, we are the one where they have to give some very careful thought to having a relationship. So maybe they're a bit more tolerant of our our missteps if we demonstrate to them that we understand who they are and we give them a good product the vast majority of the time. But uh frankly the you know what used to be in this industry where there's a lot of switching inertia is not the case anymore. You started this out by talking about the fact that you showed up in town and you popped a new SIM card in your phone and you were on our network. And if you're upset about what happens tomorrow with our services, you may go get a SIM card from somebody else and pop it in your phone.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么当你打电话时，你的接受度是怎样的？你接受多长时间才能连接到对方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you when you have a telephone and you make a call, what what is your acceptance? you know, how long do you accept it to take before you're connected to the other end?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，就我而言，我的标准非常高。如果不是即时连接，我就会打电话给某人。今天早上我在纽约很远的地方，我对看到的一些**吞吐量**（throughput: 数据传输速率）特性不太满意，我就打电话给某人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, in my case, I have very high standards and if I that's what I assume if it's not happening instantaneously. I'm on the phone with somebody. I was in a far part of New York this morning where I wasn't particularly happy with what I was seeing with some of my throughput characteristics and I I was back on the phone with somebody.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你已经在AT&T工作了40年。你的第一部电话是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you've been at AT&T for 40 years. What was your first telephone?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我上大学时的第一部电话，我排了大约5个小时的队才买到一部**公主电话**（princess phone: 一种小型、时尚的固定电话），放在我的宿舍里。我的第一部无线电话，嗯，那是一部车载设备，放在汽车后备箱里，然后放在汽车中控台上。当时我觉得那是我生活中最好的东西了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My very first telephone when I went to college and I stood in line for about 5 hours to get a princess phone to put in my dorm room. My first wireless phone uh was a uh it was an oy car mounted device that went in the trunk of the car and and sat on the console of the car and uh I thought that was the best thing since sliced bread when it showed up in my life.</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it was right.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的，确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it was.</p>
</details>

### AT&T的未来定位：不仅仅是公用事业

主持人: 真是漫长的旅程。你认为AT&T会成为除了纯粹的通信公用事业之外的任何东西吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, what a journey. Uh, do you think AT&T would be anything else but a pure communication utility?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 首先，我并不认为我们是公用事业公司。我认为我们是一家**网络公司**（networking company: 提供网络基础设施和服务的公司），而且我认为我们做了一些非常复杂的网络工作。我们必须为许多相当复杂的客户，比如大型企业，定制我们的服务。我确实相信，我们有机会在核心连接业务的基础上，通过在这些网络之上提供增值服务，稍微向左右扩展。随着我们完成向**软件驱动网络**（software-driven network: 通过软件而非硬件控制和管理网络）的迁移，我们能够在网络之上构建**垂直产品**（verticals: 针对特定行业或客户群的专业产品或服务）和软件驱动产品的能力将大大增强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do I I first of all I don't think about us as a utility. I think about us as a networking company and I think we do some pretty sophisticated networking. It has to customize what we do for a lot of fairly complex customers like large enterprises. And I do believe that we have an opportunity to move a little bit right and left of our core connectivity business with a combination of value added services on top of those networks. And um as we complete our migration into a softwaredriven network, our ability to begin building verticals and products that are software driven on top of our network gets a lot better.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 所以，这些可能包括我们能否开始提供软件驱动的增强安全服务，这些服务建立在网络之上，使我们能够横向扩展到连接之上的安全领域。当我们考虑AI驱动的性能和工作负载时，有很多事情我们可以做，以确保我们在不同的网络结构中提供比特级别的服务质量，我认为这将是我们能够带来的增量收入机会。我们正在与行业内的参与者合作，使我们能够将安全和隐私服务推向市场，让父母能够管理他们与孩子之间的关系，以及他们的孩子如何看待内容，并对这些事情有深入的了解。这些都是建立在核心网络之上的扩展，我确实相信，因此我们可以更快地增加收入和业务增长机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so those would be things like can we begin to offer enhanced security services that are software driven on top of the network that allows us to move maybe laterally into security on top of connectivity. M we have a lot of things when you think about AI driving performance and workload. There are things that we can do to ensure that we're delivering quality of service at a bit level across different network fabrics that I think will be incremental opportunities for revenue that we can bring in. We're starting to work with players in the industry that allow us to do things like bring security and privacy services into the market that allow parents to manage their relationship of with their children and how their children see content and have insights to those things. Those are all extensions that are built on top of the core network and I do believe we can grow revenues and opportunities to grow the business a little bit faster as a result of that.</p>
</details>

### 北美市场策略与欧洲电信困境

主持人: 你们一直专注于北美市场，而你们的一些竞争对手则在全球范围内多元化发展。你们坚持留在北美的考虑是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've stayed in North America whilst you compete with some folks who are more kind of diversified globally. What are the what's the thinking behind staying here?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这是一个很好的问题。我想说，在我职业生涯的某个阶段，我曾渴望超越北美，并为此做了很多工作。我认为那是在一个时期，也许在许多国家，围绕外国所有权的一些灵活性开始显现。我想说，过去几年这种情况已经逆转了。我看到更多的**巴尔干化**（balkanization: 指一个地区分裂成许多较小的、敌对的实体）正在发生，许多国家对关键资产的外国所有权变得更加敏感。此外，如果你环顾世界，看看电信领域在哪里能获得有竞争力的回报，美国遥遥领先于其他任何地方。他们在电信政策和方法上做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a really good question. I would tell you at one point in my career there was a desire to move beyond North America and did a lot of work around that and I think that was at a time where maybe um in many countries there was some flexibility around foreign ownership starting to to manifest itself. Um I would say the last couple years that has reversed itself. I see more of a balkcanization going on where many countries are becoming much more sensitive around foreign ownership of critical assets. Um in addition, if you just kind of go around the world and say where are competitive returns achieved in telecommunications, the United States stands above every place else. They've gotten policy and approach to telecom, right?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 真的很难找到另一个市场，能像美国一样获得同样好的回报，而实际上我们在美国有更多的有机增长机会。这就是为什么我们大力投资**光纤**（fiber: 光纤电缆，用于高速数据传输）建设，扩大我们的覆盖范围，并开始在我们传统运营的一些市场之外进行建设，因为我们认为我们可以在这里获得更好的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's really hard to find another market to go into to say I can go and get as good a return in that particular country as I can in the United States when in fact we have more organic growth opportunities in the US. That's why we're investing so heavily in fiber and building our footprint and starting to build outside of some of the traditional markets that we've operated in because we think we can get better returns here.</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，这是一个非常大的市场，对吧？你看欧洲，他们的竞争政策是每个国家应该有三家运营商，而欧洲有近30个国家。所以运营商很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you are it's it's it's a very big market, right? So you look at Europe, you have there's been a competition policy that you should have three players in each country and you got like close to 30 countries. So that's uh that's a lot of operators. Uh</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 实际上，欧洲很少有大规模的国家只有三家运营商。其中许多国家有四家，正在向三家过渡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's actually very few countries of scale in the in in Europe that have three players. Many of them have four moving to three.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。而且那里的一些动态也有些不同，比如漫游的实现方式，以及国家和欧盟之间有两层监管。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And uh you also have some dynamics there that are a little bit different on on how roaming gets done and two layers of regulation between the country and the EU.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么当你身在纽约，看向欧洲时，你对欧洲电信市场有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you sit here, you know, we are in New York and you look to Europe, what are your what are your reflections when you look at the European telecom market?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 坦率地说，我觉得很遗憾。我认为你拥有一套发达的经济体，但在许多情况下，它们基本上是第三世界的通信基础设施。挪威可能不是这样，但欧洲有些地方的服务明显落后于目前大多数其他发达国家。我的感觉是，与欧洲政策制定者交流后，他们也明白这一点，这就是为什么现在有向三家运营商结构转变的趋势，这旨在鼓励更多对基础设施的投资。我相信如果他们在这方面取得进展并迅速行动，你实际上会看到一个再投资周期，这将显著改善欧洲的服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think it's sad. Uh candidly, I think you have a developed uh set of economies that are basically on third world communications infrastructure in many instances. Maybe not the case in Norway, but there are parts of Europe where services are are clearly a step behind much of the rest of the developed world right now. My sense is in talking to policy makers in Europe, they they get that and that's why there is this move to maybe go to a three-player structure that inense more investment in infrastructure. And I believe if they move forward on that and they do it quickly that you can fact see a reinvestment cycle that will improve services in Europe uh pretty significantly.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么你说你认为情况不太好，是因为技术产品，还是因为运营商的盈利能力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you say you think it's uh it's not so great that's because of the technical offering or is it because of profitability of the players or</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 运营商没有获得资本回报，因此他们不愿意再投资于基础设施和网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Players aren't getting return on capital therefore they don't want to reinvest in capital in their infrastructure and networks.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我们如何判断欧洲运营商落后于美国？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do we see that European players are behind the US?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我会去看客户在数据质量、吞吐量和服务进步方面获得了什么，以及**最先进的5G**（state-of-the-art 5G）是否可用，以及这些网络的性能是否与你在亚洲或美国看到的一致。我在欧洲各地旅行时，情况并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would just go look at what uh customers get in terms of data quality throughput and the advance of services what's available in terms of you know is state-of-the-art 5G and are is the performance of those networks what you would see in Asia or in the US in consistently as I move through Europe that's not the case</p>
</details>

### 光纤、5G/6G与AI的协同作用

主持人: 谈谈你们的光纤建设，为什么它如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me about your fiber buildouts, why why is that so good?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look.</p>
</details>

主持人: 为什么它比建设移动基站更好？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is it better than putting up mobile towers?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 当你考虑运营网络时，我不想区分无线或固定。我的信念是，一切都是**光纤**（fiber: 光纤电缆，用于高速数据传输）网络，只是末端连接了不同的接入技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fiber, when you think about running networks, I don't like to think about wireless or fixed. My belief is everything's a fiber network with different access technology hanging on the end of it.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 有时是蜂窝基站，就像你刚才说的。有时是墙上的插孔，可以直接插入无线路由器之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes it's a cell tower, as you just said. Sometimes it's a jack on the wall that something plugs directly into like a wireless router.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 有时是硬连接到**超大规模计算环境**（hyperscaler's environment: 大型云计算服务提供商的数据中心环境）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes it's a hardwired connection into a hyperscaler's environment.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 但这一切都始于光纤。特别是，为什么光纤在AI世界中如此关键，是因为今天大多数高带宽网络，尤其是消费者领域，都是**不对称带宽**（asymmetrical bandwidth: 下行带宽大于上行带宽）构建的，即下行带宽多于上行带宽。AI将推动的一个变化是更多的**上行流量**（upstream traffic: 从用户端上传到网络的流量），以及需要进入超大规模计算环境以访问**大型语言模型**（LLM: Large Language Models）进行数据和信息处理的需求。在AI世界中，这将需要更多的上行带宽。因此，需要更多的**对称网络**（symmetrical networks: 上行和下行带宽相等的网络），而光纤就是对称的。所以，你越快将数据流量传输到光纤上，你拥有的容量就越大，不仅是下行，还有上行，并且你管理数据性能的能力也越强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it all starts with fiber. And in particular, why fiber is so critical moving forward in the AI world is most high bandwidth networks today especially for the consumer space have been built asymmetrical more downstream bandwidth than upstream bandwidth one of the things that AI is going to drive is more upstream traffic and the requirements to move into a hyperscalers environment to get to large language models to do the processing of data and information in an AI world is going to require a lot more upstream bandwidth. So more symmetrical networks, fiber is symmetrical. And so the faster you get a bit of traffic onto fiber, the more capacity you have, not only down but up, and the more ability you have to manage the performance of that bit.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么当你看到**5G**（第五代移动通信技术）和**6G**（第六代移动通信技术）时，你认为它们不是光纤的竞争对手。你认为它们只是光纤的馈入？

<p class="english-text">So when you look at 5G and 6G, you don't think that's a competition to fiber. You think it's just a feed into your fiber?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的，我不认为它们是竞争对手。我认为它们只是另一种接入技术，在某些情况下，5G和6G是在广域网中让用户接入高带宽网络的最佳方式。但有时，根据所需的性能，其他接入技术，如Wi-Fi或实际硬连接到网络，也是必要的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I don't think it's competition. And I think it's just another access technology where in some cases 5G and 6G are the best way in a wide area network to get somebody on a high bandwidth network. But there are times where other access technologies like Wi-Fi or being actually hardwired into the network are necessary depending on the performance that's required.</p>

主持人: 你们最近购买了一些**频谱频率**（spectrum frequencies: 用于无线通信的电磁波频率）。这将如何让你们受益？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You bought some um spectrum frequencies uh lately. How is that going to benefit you?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，这正是我们刚才讨论的。如果你相信工作负载会增加，这些将极大地提高我们无线网络的**吞吐量**（throughput: 数据传输速率），从而使一些应用得以出现。特别是，我们购买的一些频谱是**低频段频谱**（lowband spectrum: 频率较低的无线频谱，覆盖范围广），它的设计方式是有效地确保网络中有一个更强大的上行通道。所以，在频谱上使用的两种技术类型——**TDD**（Time Division Duplexing: 时分双工）和**FDD**（Frequency Division Duplexing: 频分双工）——TDD频谱，也就是低频段频谱，允许你更积极地设计上行通道，我们认为这非常符合AI未来对移动网络的需求。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, it's going right at what we just talked about where if you believe workloads are going to increase, these are going to dramatically improve our throughput on our wireless network that will enable some of these applications to pop up. And in particular, some of the spectrum we bought was lowband spectrum that the way it can be engineered is effectively making sure there's a more robust upstream channel into the network. Um so the difference between the two types of technology that's used on spectrum TDD and FDD the TDD spectrum that uh that lowband spectrum has allows you to engineer the upstream more aggressively and we think that plays very well into what the future of AI is going to require of mobile networks.</p>

### 网络安全：挑战与机遇

主持人: 那网络安全呢？网络安全对你们来说是收入机会吗？是好消息还是坏消息？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about cyber? Is cyber close to revenue opportunity for you? Is it good or bad news?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这件事让我夜不能寐。没有多少事情能让我夜不能寐。所以，我认为现在构建安全网络，并在我们所处的**地缘政治环境**（geopolitical environment: 国际政治局势）中做到这一点，是一个真正的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a it's a thing that keeps me up at night. There's not many things that keep me up at night. Um, so I I think the notion of building secure networks right now and doing it in the geopolitical environment we're operating in is a real challenge and we spend a significant amount of money within our business to make sure we offer secure networks.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 话虽如此，我对运营大型公共网络的担忧，全球每家公司的每位CEO和CIO都有同感。因此，正如我之前所说，我们有机会扩展我们的基本连接服务，以帮助人们更有效地管理他们的网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, my my concerns about running a large public network are shared by every CEO and every CIO at every company uh around the globe. And so there is an opportunity for us, as I said earlier, to extend our basic connectivity services to help folks manage their networks more effectively.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 由于我们进行网络监控，寻找行为模式和变化，并日复一日地积极追捕坏人，我们可以将这些扩展到我们的一些客户网络上。我认为，我们扩展到其他基于软件的产品和服务，为我们创造了新的收入增长机会。所以，我将其视为两方面：它是一项成本，因为我们必须确保有效运营业务；但这项成本是所有企业都在承受的，我们可以帮助他们更高效地做到这一点，并可能因此获得报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since we do things like monitoring our network, looking for patterns and changes in behavior and and trying to hunt the bad guys actively day in and day out, we can extend that onto some of our customers networks. And that's where us extending into other products and services that are softwarebased, I think, opens up an opportunity for us to grow new revenues as well. So, I see it as both. It's a cost because we've got to make sure we run our business effectively, but that cost is something that every business out there is enduring and we can help them do it more efficiently and probably get renumerated for it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，追捕坏人涉及哪些方面？武器是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, hunting the bad guys, what does that involve? What are the what are the weapons?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这取决于具体情况。你知道，这是一场有点不平衡的战斗，对吧？我们是一家特定的营利性公司，经常与**国家级行为者**（nation state actors: 由国家支持或代表国家利益的黑客组织）作战，他们没有预算，不需要报告**损益表**（P&L: Profit and Loss Statement: 利润和损失表），也不用担心**资产负债表**（balance sheet: 反映公司财务状况的报表）。他们会投入无数的金钱和创造力，试图找出如何渗透并击败我们。所以这需要大量的协作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Depends on the day of the week. Uh, and you know, it's it's a little bit of a an imbalanced fight, right? We're a where a particular for-profit company that's often times fighting nation state actors that have no budget and they don't have a P&L they have to report on or a balance sheet they have to worry about and they'll invest, you know, untold amounts of money and creativity to try to figure out how they infiltrate and beat that down. So it requires a tremendous amount of collaboration.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这不仅需要我们公司内部的协作，还需要与政府实体、行业合作伙伴分享我们的见解和知识。我认为只有通过这种协作，你才能对抗那些会花费数十亿美元的人，因为破解你的代码符合国家利益。如果所有志同道合的人不互相帮助，那么你将面临非常困难的局面。其次，这要求你真正与那些在研发前沿的人合作，特别是在美国，有一些公司和实体在这方面非常擅长。与他们保持同步，了解下一步会发生什么，下一个攻击向量会是什么，以及如何在这方面保持领先，也至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It requires collaboration not only within our company but with government entities our partners in the industry where we're sharing our insights and knowledge. I think it's only through that collaboration that you can counter somebody who's going to spend literally billions and billions of dollars because it's in a nation state interest to figure out how to crack the code on on compromising you. And uh if you don't have everybody helping each other um that are you that are aligned in a common way then you're going to have a very difficult time. Second thing is it requires you to really work out with those that are on the leading edge on research and development and there are especially in the United States some companies and some entities that are really really good at this kind of thing and staying in tune with them to understand what's next what's coming around the corner what the next type of vectors of attack are going to be and how do you think about getting ahead of the curve on those things is pretty critical as well.</p>

### 卫星通信与AI对数据流量的影响

主持人: 卫星如何融入这里的竞争格局？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do um satellites fit into the competitive landscape here?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 卫星在很大程度上，我认为，首先，看到**LEO星座**（LEO constellations: 低地球轨道卫星群）带来的创新将是令人惊叹和鼓舞的。我认为它们将改变我们生活中的许多事情，我对这种即将到来的创新感到兴奋。我认为我们将真正看到“永远在线”连接的曙光，这对我们的业务有利。我认为我们处于一个有利位置，因为我们已经与客户建立了优先关系来管理他们的连接。我们是一个自然的场所，可以将卫星作为他们连接关系的额外附加服务进行整合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Satellites for the most part I think are, you know, they're first of all, it's going to be amazingly encouraging to see the innovation that LEO constellations bring. I think they're going to change a lot of things in our lives and uh I'm excited about that innovation that's going to come forward. I think we're going to see truly the dawn of always on connectivity and that's going to be good for our business. I I think we're in a position since we already have a preferred relationship with customers to manage their connectivity. were a natural place to integrate satellite as an additional add-on to their connectivity relationships.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么我们什么时候能看到这种情况开始生效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when when will we see this kicking in?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我认为你会在2026年看到很多，明年，我认为你将开始看到真正的终端用户服务出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you're going to see a lot in 2026, next year, I think you're going to start seeing real enduser services coming about. And uh</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么我将如何从中受益呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how am I going how am I going to benefit from that?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，如果你是AT&T的客户，你应该期望有一个选择，例如，如果你有一天要离开网络覆盖范围，也许要去大峡谷漂流，但你希望保持连接，你将能够购买一张日票以保持网络连接。或者，如果你的生活方式要求你始终拥有这种备份，也许你周末划船出海，或者你的工作要求你在农村地区进行石油钻探。你可以购买订阅服务并一直拥有它。但我认为卫星更多是补充性的，而不是直接竞争性的。会有一些重叠。例如，在某些情况下，**物联网**（IoT: Internet of Things）的某些安排，LEO将是更好的处理方式，这可能会取代**陆地无线网络**（terrestrial wireless network）过去所做的工作。但在许多情况下，它将是美国已经强大、高带宽网络的补充和附加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you should expect if you're a customer of AT&T that you'll have an option to, for example, if you're uh at a day where you're going to drive off the network, maybe into the Grand Canyon to go rafting and you want to stay connected, that you'll be able to buy a day pass to stay on the network as a result of that. Or if you're somebody who has a lifestyle that requires you to always have that kind of backup, maybe you boat on the weekends and you go offshore, um maybe you have a job that requires you to be in rural places for oil drilling. You can buy a subscription and have it all the time. Uh but I think satellite is more complimentary than directly competitive. There'll be some overlap. Internet of things, for example, in some cases, LEO will be a better way to handle IoT type arrangements that may supplant what a terrestrial wireless network used to do. But in many instances, it's going to be complimementaryary and add-on to what are always already robust high bandwidth networks in the United States.</p>
</details>

主持人: John，我们再多花点时间谈谈AI。你认为它将如何增加数据量？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">John, let's spend a bit more time on on AI. How do you think that will increase data volumes?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我认为有几件事会推动它。我最兴奋的一点是，如果你环顾你的房子、汽车或工作场所，现在到处都是**传感器**（sensors: 用于检测和响应物理输入的设备）。通常这些传感器是摄像头。当然，过去推动网络流量增长的一件事是，当我们在每部手机上都安装了摄像头时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a couple things that will drive it. The one that I'm probably most excited about is if you kind of look around your house or your car or your workplace, there's sensors everywhere today. And often times those sensors are cameras. Um, certainly one of the things that drove volume on the network in the past was when we put phones, we put cameras on every phone.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 正是人们通过视频或拍照捕捉到的所有内容，以及想要将其发送出去的需求，推动了网络上大量的流量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it was all the content that people picked up on either video or taking pictures and wanting to ship it around that drove a lot of traffic on the network.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 当你开始思考现在所有捕捉视频的传感器，并思考AI在处理视频和从中获取洞察方面的能力时，我认为这是一个巨大的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you start to think about all the sensors that are capturing video right now and you think about how capable AI is in processing video and taking insights from it, I think that's one of the huge opportunities.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 所以当我们谈论上行带宽的重要性时，这是我相信我们应该投资上行带宽的原因之一，因为如果所有这些传感器都在那里捕捉视频，它必须传输到某个地方进行处理和分析。而这种将数据传输回网络、传输到**超大规模计算器**（hyperscaler: 提供大规模云计算服务的公司）的**大型语言模型**（LLM: Large Language Models）进行处理的上行能力，我认为是我们将看到流量大幅增长的领域之一。最终，一旦从中得出结论或推断，它必须迅速传递回消费点，以便人们做出决策或对其进行操作。我认为这给高性能网络带来了巨大的压力，而这正是我们正在努力建设的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we talk about the importance of upstream bandwidth, this is one of the reasons I believe we should be investing in that upstream bandwidth is because if all those sensors are out there picking up the video, it's got to get someplace to be processed and analyzed. And that upstream capability to get it back up into the network, get it back up into the hyperscaler LLM to be processed is, I think, one of the places we're going to see large upticks in traffic. And then ultimately once it's a conclusion or an inference is driven from it that has to be delivered back to the point of consumption quickly for somebody to make a decision or do something with it. I think that puts a tremendous amount of uh lean on high performing networks and that's really what we're attempting to build in this</p>
</details>

主持人: 一个愚蠢的问题，但现在通过你们网络的流量中，有多少是图片或视频？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stupid question, but how much of the traffic through your networks would now be pictures or video?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 就今天的实际百分比而言，视频（包括下行和上行）占网络总流量的80%以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of the actual percentage today, video in total both downstream and upstream drives over 80% of the total traffic on the network today.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 其中大部分是基于娱乐的视频。当你想到无线领域的4G革命时，它实际上是围绕消费者为了娱乐和消遣而消费视频展开的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And much of that's entertainmentbased video when you think about kind of in the wireless space the 4G revolution was really geared off of consumers consuming video for pleasure and entertainment.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这就是推动网络上大量工作负载的原因。我认为在6G和AI世界的早期，我们可能会看到企业应用推动网络需求的更多增长，但视频仍然会是非常重要的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's what drove massive amounts of workloads onto the networks. I think in the 6G and AI world early on, we're probably going to see enterprise applications drive more of that increase in demand on the network, but video is still going to be a really important part.</p>
</details>

主持人: 从5G到6G最大的变化是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the biggest uh change from 5G to 6G?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，你知道，我认为你将看到的是，6G将非常面向企业，而不是面向消费者。它将允许在AI世界中进行网络管理，达到所需的往返**延迟**（latency: 数据传输的延迟时间）和性能。我认为它将增加额外的安全层，这些安全层在无线网络中通常不可用，但它们能很好地适应我们今天看到的威胁。而且我认为它将能够扩展以连接更多设备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, I think what you're going to see is that, uh, 6G is going to be very enterpriseoriented as opposed to consumer oriented. It's going to allow for the kind of management of networks in the in the types of roundtrip latency and performance that are necessary in an AI world. I think it's going to add in additional layers of security that have not typically been available in wireless networks that um are well tuned to the threats that we see today. And I think it will be scalable for the number of devices that are going to be connected. Um we're</p>

<p class="english-text">Are we going to feel any difference?</p>

John Stankey: 作为消费者，我认为你不会必然感觉到网络本身有什么不同，但如果你是企业用户，使用无线网络，你将能够操作和实现的应用将有所不同，而且会更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh as a consumer I don't think you're going to necessarily feel the network per se being different but the applications that you'll be able to operate and and achieve if you're for example an enterprise using a wireless network those applications will be different and better</p>
</details>

主持人: 你们能提供这种容量的增长吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you deliver that increase in capacity?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我们能提供吗？是的，我认为我们可以。我认为美国在向运营商提供足够数量的**授权频谱**（license spectrum: 经过许可才能使用的无线电频谱）方面有点落后。在特朗普政府早期，大约9个月内完成的工作可能比前四年完成的还要多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we deliver it, yes, I think we can. I think the United States in particular was running a little bit behind on getting the right amount of license spectrum available to operators Early on in the Trump administration, there's been probably more work done in, you know, a 9-month period of time than what was done in the previous four years.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 有一个路线图，说明如何将更多频谱推向市场，以确保这些工作负载能够得到处理。基于已经采取的行动以及即将到来的**频谱拍卖**（spectrum auctions: 政府出售无线电频谱使用权的拍卖）路径，我对美国能够跟上全球其他主要参与者感到好多了。18个月前我可能不会这么说。

### AI应用与数据中心投资

</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我们公司内部可以做的事情让我非常兴奋，我们已经在证明这些事情。我们在客户销售、服务和支持方面做了很多工作，这极大地改善了我们的客户服务，降低了运营成本，帮助我们在某些地方减少了**客户流失**（churn: 客户停止使用某项服务）。我认为大多数公司都有机会追逐这些基础性的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, there's there's things that we can do inside our business that I get really excited about that we're already proving in. Um we've done a lot in customer sales, service and support that has um dramatically improved our customer service, lowered our operating costs, helping us reduce churn in places. Um those kind of meat and potato things I think most corporations are going to have an opportunity to chase.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我看到我们在定价方面有很多很好的机会。当你思考AI模型能做什么，以及它们如何告知特定区域的竞争情况时，与我们过去使用的更**静态模型**（static models: 价格相对固定不变的模型）相比，**动态定价模型**（dynamic models of pricing: 根据实时市场条件调整价格的模型）会更加出色。所以，我对此非常兴奋。还有我们如何设计网络。本周早些时候我正在审查一系列项目，关于我们现在如何能够实时查看城市中任何给定时刻的流量流动。如果正在举行马拉松，人们穿梭于城市的不同区域，产生不同的需求，我们可以调整网络以动态地实时跟随这种需求。AI正在推动很多这样的事情，这改变了我们的工程实践和部署实践。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I see some great opportunities for us and how we do pricing. Um, when you think about what AI models can do and how they inform what's going on competitively in a particular area, much more dynamic models of pricing as compared to what have been more static models that we've used. So, I'm really excited about that. How we engineer networks. Um, we were just I was going through a set of projects earlier this week about our ability now to literally look at how traffic is moving in any given moment in a city. If a marathon is underway and and traffic people are snaking through a city with different demands at different parts of the city, we can tune the network to follow that demand and do it dynamically in real time. Uh and AI is driving a lot of that and that changes our engineering practices and our deployment practices.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么你们如何处理网络？假设现在有马拉松，对吧？有5万人正在跑步。你们如何处理网络？AI知道马拉松的精确路线。它会查看并拍摄特定地点的手机数量。它评估它们的移动方向。它知道路线。它知道如何倾斜和移动**蜂窝基站**（cell sites: 移动通信基站）并重新定向它们。所以当负载到达某个地方时，蜂窝基站已经调整好，以适应这些负载将要到达的位置。它是动态地进行这些操作，实时跟踪。我认为这些事情将极大地提高服务水平。我们过去也做过一些这样的事情，但那是劳动密集型的。我们过去有人坐在键盘前进行调整。现在如果它动态发生，我们就能更高效地完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what do you do with the network? So let's say now you have the marathon, right? You got uh 50,000 people running a bus there.

It evaluates where they're moving. It knows the route. It knows how it needs to tilt and move cell sites and redirect them. So when the loads get someplace, the cell towers are already tuned and adjusted to where those loads are going to be. And it's doing it dynamically, literally following things. And that's those kinds of things I think are going to help service levels tremend tremendously. We used to do some of that stuff. It was labor intensive. We used to have people sitting around at keyboards adjusting. Now if it dynamically occurs, we're more efficient at getting it done.</p>

主持人: 现在那里有泡沫吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is there a bubble in there now?</p>
</details>

主持人: 你不认为这些会实现吗？

John Stankey: 嗯，我认为至少在美国，会有一个限制因素，那就是有多少电力可用来启动所有这些设备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think there's going to be a limiting factor at least in the US around how much power is available to turn it all up.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我认为这将成为一个自然的限制因素，而且除非我们国家的**电力基础设施**（power infrastructure: 供电系统）进入不同的增长曲线，否则很难实现所有已经发布的公告。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But with the speed of uh technology development you need to depreciate these assets over a relatively short time frame right?</p>

### 建立AI文化与领导力

主持人: 你们如何在AT&T内部建立AI文化？你们如何让员工进行实验和采纳？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you um build an AI culture within AT&T? How do you get people to experiment and adopt?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，你知道，我会在三年后，也许在我们经历完这一切之后，再来谈这个问题。但改变文化是你在一家公司，尤其是一家老牌公司，所做的最困难的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know, I will um I'll weigh in on that three years from now, maybe after we get through it, but it's changing culture is the hardest thing you do in a company, especially an established company.</p>
</details>

主持人: 为什么这么困难？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is it so difficult?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 因为是人。我认为，你知道，人们通常有自己的动机，他们会考虑“这对我有什么好处？”“这符合我的最佳利益吗？”以及“我该如何处理这个问题？”你必须设法让13万人都以共同的方式看待某件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're people. And I think uh you know people generally have their own motivations and they have it's what's in it for me and what's in my best interest and how do I process on this and somehow you got to get 130,000 people viewing something in a common fashion.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，这很难做到。我们正在尝试几种不同的方法。我们正在使用激励措施，给予人们动力，让他们愿意接受和使用它，因为这符合他们的自身利益，这与他们的薪酬或他们面临的目标有关。我们正在使用一些结构，将工作组从日常业务（**BAU**：Business As Usual）中分离出来。我们会把人拉出来说：“你要负责一个现场运营。你将以不同的方式被衡量。你将通过创新来改进它，你不会被我们今天所做的事情所束缚。”我们正在以这种方式测试流程。我们建立了一个**卓越中心**（center of excellence: 集中专业知识和资源的部门），在那里，公司中的任何人都可以获得AI专业知识，他们作为公司内部的顾问，帮助人们推进他们想要的项目，我们不试图在太多地方建立这种专业知识，以免其被稀释。我们还在寻找合作伙伴，将他们引入公司，他们希望构建下一个基于AI的平台，并且需要非常严苛的测试案例来做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um that's that's a hard thing to do. What what we're doing is trying a couple different approaches. We're using incentives uh and and giving people motivation to want to embrace it and use it where it's in their self-interest to do that because of how they get paid or the objectives they have in front of them. We're using structures where we're separating work groups from kind of the BAU construct. Our business as usual will pull people out and say you're going to run a site operation. You're going to be measured differently. You're going to try to make this better by inventing the new and you're not encumbered by what we're doing today. And we're testing processes that way. We've built a center of excellence where they're available, the expertise in AI is available to anybody in the company and they work out as consultants in the company to adopt projects that people want to carry forward where we're not trying to build that expertise in too many places where it gets diluted. And we're finding partners to bring into the company that want to build the next platform that's an AI based platform and need really hard test cases to do that.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 所以他们来到AT&T说：“让我为你构建未来的财务部门。”我们将协作完成。我们将免费为你完成，只要我们构建的产品可以在其他公司使用并进一步销售。所以我们正在使用各种不同的方式来实现它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they come into AT&T and say let me build you the finance department of the future and we'll do that collaboratively. We'll do that gratus with you as long as the product that we build we can go out and then use in other companies and and sell it further. And so we're using a variety of different ways to get it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你想改变或转移AT&T文化的哪一部分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which part of the AT&T culture are you trying to shift or move?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，你知道，我们的文化中有很多非常好的东西。如果没有做对一些事情，你不可能存在150年。我们有很多员工对公司的使命非常投入，那就是让人们保持连接。我们以奇迹般的方式做到了这一点。这是我们工作的一个非常重要的组成部分。我们需要更敏捷，需要更注重市场。我们需要确保公司里的每个人都在这里，是因为他们致力于这项使命。他们不是因为对养老金计划或其他某种结构有一种盲目的忠诚感，认为“我想工作30年，因为那里有我工作30年的理由”。而是“我真的想在这里，因为我信仰公司的使命”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, we're we have a lot of things that are really good in our culture. We don't you don't stay for 150 years without doing something right and we have a lot of employees that are incredibly committed to the mission of the business, which is to keep people connected. Uh, and we've we do that in ways that are in fact miraculous on Sundays. And that's that's a really important fabric of what we do. We need to be a bit more agile and we need to be a bit more market focused. And we need to make sure that everybody who works at our company is there because they're committed to the mission. They're not there because they feel like there's a blind sense of loyalty to a pension plan or or some other construct that um I I want to work 30 years because there's something there for me to work 30 years. It's I really want to be here because I believe in the mission of the company.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但我是说，你已经在那里工作了将近40年。所以你某种程度上代表了AT&T的文化。你是AT&T先生，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I mean, you've been there for nearly 40 years. So you kind of you epitomize the AT&T culture. I you are Mr. AT&T, right?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我从没把自己看作AT&T先生，但我想有时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I I don't I've never thought of myself as Mr. AT&T, but I I think sometimes</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，我是说，你是在这种文化中长大的。那么你如何改变你所属于的文化呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, you brought up with a culture you So, how can you change a culture which you are part of?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我想你可以去查阅研究，有些人会告诉你，如果你要演变和改变一种文化，有时内部的颠覆者可能比外部的颠覆者更有效。而这正是我现在面临的考验。我能否建立一种更**市场导向文化**（market-based culture: 以市场需求为导向的企业文化），更专注于客户和客户需求，并从市场反向影响公司，而不是那种建立在“我们会告诉消费者他们需要什么”的基础上的文化。我们会告诉消费者下一轮技术是什么，然后将其推向市场，而不是真正理解市场需求，然后设计公司来匹配这些需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you can go and look at research and some would tell you that if you're going to evolve and change a culture, sometimes it's the disruptor from within that can be the most effective as opposed to the disruptor from outside. And really that's the test that's in front of me right now. Can I build a more market-based culture that's more focused on the customer and the customer need and it works from the market back into the company as opposed to one that is been really built on we'll tell consumers what they need. We'll tell consumers what the next round of technology is and then we'll take that out to the market as opposed to really understanding what the needs of the market are and then engineering the company to match those moving forward.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么当你接任CEO时，你的首要任务是什么？你想要改变什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you took over as CEO, what were your priorities? What did you want to change?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，首先，显然是要让公司更加专注，我们讨论过围绕资产基础做出一些决策并进行投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, it was obviously to get the company much more focused, which we talked about around making some decisions on the asset base and investing.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah,</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这是为了使其更具成本效益，从而产生足够的现金，使我们能够在行业投资方面处于领先地位。这意味着我们必须从业务中削减大量成本。我们必须摆脱许多遗留产品和服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was to make it a lot more cost-effective where we generated the kind of cash that we could be leading our industry in investment. That meant we had to get a lot of cost out of the business. We had to get out of a lot of the legacy products and services we have.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我们一直在积极推进这项工作。我们还没有完成。我们还有几年的工作要做，但这帮助我们改善了现金流，使我们能够以目前的水平进行再投资。这样做是为了成为光纤建设的领导者，并拥有最强大和最有能力的网络基础设施。所以我们一直在行业顶端进行投资，然后推动这种文化变革，使我们更加**客户中心**（customer-centric: 以客户为中心）和以客户为导向，提升我们的服务水平，支持客户，包括保证我们向客户提供的服务类型，这是我们未来服务差异化的另一个方面。所有这些事情必须同时进行，这确实是一个5年的旅程，还有几年才能达到我们需要的状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we've been aggressively moving through that. We're not done. We've got another couple years of work to do there, but that's helped us get cash flows improved where we can reinvest at the levels we're doing. And doing that is to be the leader in building fiber and having the most robust and capable network infrastructure. So we've invested at the top of the industry and then working this cultural change that is a change in us being much more customer centric and customer focused and elevating our game and supportive customers including guaranteeing what kind of service we'll provide to our customers as the other aspect of differentiating our services moving forward and all those things have to come together at the same time and it's really been a bit of a 5-year journey that has a few more years left to go before we get to where we need to be.</p>
</details>

主持人: 改变全球文化需要多长时间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How long time does it take to change global culture?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我认为这是永无止境的。我认为你永远不会达到一个可以说“我可以停在这里”的地步，即使你拥有一家富有成效和成功的公司，你知道，它也必须不断演变和改变。现在，我们现在需要达到的速度和节奏可能高于平均水平。它可能高于我们在一段时间内需要改变的平均水平。但如果你说“我已经做对了，我不需要担心它再次演变”，我认为这可能就是走向灭亡的秘诀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's I think it's never ending. I I think you you never get to a place where you say I can stay here and even if you have a productive and successful company, you know, it's going to have to evolve and change a little bit. Now maybe the rate and pace that we have to achieve right now is higher than the average. It's maybe above average and what we need to change in the period of time. But if you ever say that I've got it right and I don't need to worry about it ever evolving again, I think that's probably a a recipe for extinction.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但你不认为所需的变革速度只会加速吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But don't you think the speed of required change is just going to accelerate going forward?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的，毫无疑问，我们都在经历着巨大的变化。如果你认为AI，例如，如果互联网的曙光以及它如何改变我们的商业模式和运营方式花了我们25年才走到今天，那么AI可能只需要一半的时间就能做到同样的事情。所以，我认为这将要求每个人调整和改变他们的个人工作习惯，工作如何安排，以及你如何思考应对市场。所以，我确实相信它会越来越快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Could Yeah, there's no doubt the level of change we're all seeing. If you think that AI, for example, if if we took us 25 years to get to where we are on the dawn of the internet and how it's changed our business models and how we operate, AI will probably do the same in half the amount of time. So, I think that will require adjustment and change to everybody's personal work habits, how how work is arranged, how you think about attacking markets. So, I do believe it'll get faster and faster.</p>

### 领导力风格与个人反思

主持人: 人们会如何评价你的领导风格？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would people characterize your leadership style?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我想他们可能会说我非常直接。我很冷静。他们会说，我有一个老板曾说你有点像一瓶好酒。你想买它，珍藏它，然后打开它，欣赏它的复杂性和它能做到的事情，但这需要一点时间才能达到。我认为人们会随着时间的推移看到，我是一个非常可靠的伙伴。我是一个值得信赖的伙伴。我是一个不仅对公司，而且对那些希望提升自己、提高对业务贡献和绩效的个人都非常投入的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">U I think what they would probably say is I'm pretty direct. Um I'm pretty clinical. Um they would uh people I've had one boss who said you're a bit like a fine wine. Um you want to buy it, hold it, and then open it and appreciate it for its complexity and what it's able to do, but it takes a little bit of time to get there. I think people see over time that um I can be a pretty reliable partner. Um I can be a trustworthy partner. I can be somebody who uh is incredibly not only committed to the company but committed to the individuals who want to see themselves step up and raise the bar on their contributions and performance to the business. And if that</p>
</details>

主持人: 你认为你受到的尊重多于喜爱吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think you are respected more than loved?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我不知道人们是否会用“喜爱”来形容我。我认为，总的来说，我的目标是受到尊重。我认为今天任何一位CEO，因为我们正在讨论的一些事情，变革的速度和节奏，以及摆在特别是老牌商业模式面前的挑战，有很多艰难的决定需要做出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I I don't know that people use the term loved to describe me. I think uh generally speaking my goal is to be respected. I think any CEO today because of some of the things we're talking about the rate and pace of change the challenges that are in front of especially established business models there's a lot of hard decisions to be made.</p>
</details>

主持人: 绝对如此，生活不是一场人气竞赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely life life is not a popularity contest</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 这些艰难的决定通常会在某些地方造成一些附带损害，希望随着时间的推移，投资者、客户、员工能够整体看待这些事情，并说“我尊重所做的一切，那是必要的”。但你不会总是在做出这些决定的时候就知道这一点，这有时需要几年时间才能形成这种视角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And those hard decisions are usually have some collateral damage in places and over time hopefully investors customers employees on par look at those things and say I respect what was done and it was necessary but you don't always know that at the moment when those decisions are being made, that's sometimes perspective that takes a few years to to develop.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你随着年龄增长成为一个更好的领导者了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you become a better leader with age?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，在某些方面，我随着年龄增长成为了一个更好的领导者。当然，经验很重要。嗯，我想告诉你，我认为任何不理解这些工作需要体力的人。嗯，当你50岁时，你能做的比60岁时多得多，即使你认真保持良好体形并注意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, in ways I become a better leader with age. Certainly seasoning is important. Um, I would tell you I think anybody who doesn't understand that these jobs have a physical demand that's necessary. Uh, that physical demand, you can do a lot more when you're 50 than you can when you're 60. Even if you are serious about keeping yourself in good shape and you pay attention. Well,</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，你身体很好。你多大了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're in good shape. How old are you?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我62岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm 62.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。嗯，你看起来很年轻，而且，你知道，嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, you you come across as very young and uh you know uh</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我50岁的时候更好。尼古拉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was even better when I was 50. Nikolai.</p>
</details>

主持人: 这有点好笑，因为我们采访的很多人都说他们随着年龄增长成为了更好的领导者。所以你不得不开始思考，或者说好奇，当他们年轻的时候，有多少糟糕的领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of funny because um a lot of the people we interview they they say they're better leaders uh you know with age. So you have to start to think uh or wonder you know how many bad leaders there are when they're you know all these young people.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的。我认为每个人都声称自己变得更好了。这是情境性的，我认为这其中存在一种平衡，因为我也相信当你进入这样的工作时，你进入它的那一天，你就会因为工作的要求而开始与业务的现实疏远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think everybody claims they get better. It's situational and I I think there's a balance because I also believe when you come into a job like this, the day you enter it, you begin distancing yourself from the reality of the business because of the demands of it,</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 你必须花在公司外的时间，你必须与其他利益相关者做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The time you have to spend outside the company, what you have to do with other stakeholders.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 所以，就你对公司的亲密程度而言，你永远不会像你刚进入公司的那一天那么好。我不太相信**帝国CEO模式**（Imperial CEO model: 指CEO权力过大，公司决策高度集中于一人），因为我认为，让一个更紧密地与业务发展保持一致的人，有其优点。而且我也认为公司是活生生的有机体。如果一个人长期处于顶端，人们就会发展出强大的肌肉来响应那一个人，而他们周围所有较小的肌肉就会萎缩。有时这种变化正是促使你平衡所有肌肉和技能发展的原因。这对一个大型组织来说是健康的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're never going to be as good as the day you walked into it in terms of your intimacy with the company. And it's I'm not really a big believer in the Imperial CEO model for that reason because I think uh getting somebody who's more uh closely aligned to what's going on in the business um has its merits. And I also think companies are living breathing organisms. If there's one person at the top for a long period of time, people develop their big muscles to respond to that one person and they let all the smaller muscles around them kind of atrophy. And sometimes that change is what drives you to balance out the development of all your muscles and all your skills. And that's a healthy thing for a large organization.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你是相信你的**直觉**（gut feel: 直觉判断），还是非常依赖数据？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you trust your gut feel or are you very data driven?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 两者兼而有之。我用我的直觉来提出**假设**（hypotheses: 假说）。通常我会尝试通过引入数据来验证这些假设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's both. I'm I use uh I have some guts that I usually use for hypotheses. Typically I try to validate those hypotheses by bringing data</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 来确定我是否正确。你知道，直觉是否正确？这是一个包罗万象的过程。但我认为成为一个好的领导者的一部分是能够评估周围发生的事情，并看到不相关但相关的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To um determine whether or not I was right about them. You know, is the intuition correct? And it's a it's kind of a catchall process with it. But I think part of being a good leader is being able to evaluate what's going on around you and see unrelated but associated signals</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 然后测试这些假设，出去，检查它们，用数据来支持它们，然后根据它们采取行动。这显然是我风格的一个要素。我想说我有时会有点挑衅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then test those hypotheses, go out, check them, bring data to them, and then act upon them. And that's clearly an element of kind of my my style. I would say I try to be a little bit provocative at times.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我今天早上听到了这样一句话：我们相信上帝，其余的人都需要提供数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I heard this thing this morning in God we trust and the rest of you need to bring some data.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 是的，百分之百。**信任与验证**（trust and verify: 既要信任也要核实）是另一种看待它的方式。我经常被问到这个问题：“你信任我们吗？”当然我信任你。但我的工作一部分是验证是否存在更好的做事方式，或者我们是否以一种严谨的方式呈现数据，从而确切了解我们的运营情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, 100%. And it's trust and verify is another way to to look at it. And I I get asked this a lot. Do you trust us? And of course I trust you. But part of my job is to verify that there isn't a better way to do something or that that we're, you know, actually representing data in a clinical fashion that we know exactly what's going on in our operation.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你喜欢压力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you enjoy pressure?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我不一定靠它茁壮成长。我不会出去说：“天哪，我希望我今天压力很大，一切都会到来。”但我认为我明白它是我工作中任何给定日子的一个要素和一部分。我确实相信，如果运用得当，它可以成为团队和组织的动力。所以有时制造**建设性压力**（constructive pressure: 旨在促进改进的积极压力）是推动组织前进的必要工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I don't necessarily thrive on it. I don't go out and say, "Gee, I would I hope my day is really stressful today and it's all going to come." But I I think I understand it's an element and part of my job in any given day. Um I do believe that if it's applied in the right fashion, it can be a motivating force for teams and for organizations. And so sometimes creating constructive pressure uh is a necessary tool to get an organization to move.</p>

<p class="english-text">Why do you think why do you think nature is soothing and relaxing?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，因为我们，我的生活不是日复一日地在大自然中。我在建筑物里，我在会议中，我在大都市区，我在机场进进出出。当你进入一个能闻到松树味，看到水，周围没有开发的环境时，我认为它只是重置了你所处的环境。它以不同的方式刺激身体。

<p class="english-text">Um because we're we're not my life I'm not in nature day in and day out. I'm you know I'm in buildings and I'm in meetings and I'm in metropolitan areas and I'm flying in and out of airports and when you get into an environment where you're smelling pine trees and you're looking at water and it's not developed around you, I think it just resets um kind of the environment you're in.

主持人: 你读什么书？

<p class="english-text">What do you read?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 嗯，我的床边有一堆书，大概那么高，我想每周有三本书会送到办公室，而其中的艺术在于从送来的三本书中找出哪一本是你真正应该坚持阅读的。所以，嗯，我对送来的书非常谨慎。我可能对商业书籍的兴趣少了一些，除非它是对我有帮助的新兴技术领域。嗯，我也会听取别人的推荐，阅读人生故事，无论是鼓舞人心的领导者，还是自传，或者对某人伟大成就的回顾，这些都让我感到非常满意。

<p class="english-text">Uh there's a stack of books on the side of my bed that's about that high and they come in I think three come into the office a week and part of the art is to figure out of the three that come in which one is the one that you should really hang on to and read. So um I'm very careful about what comes in. I I've probably oriented a little less to business books unless it's an emerging area of technology that's helpful to me. Um, and I take recommendations from people on life stories, either inspiring leaders or autobiographies or kind of uh retrospectives on somebody's great accomplishments that I take a lot of satisfaction in. And then</p>

<p class="english-text">You have to say that as an American. No,</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 不，你不需要。但我认为作为CEO，我喜欢他的一点是，他当时处于一个非常孤独的时期，需要做出一些非常艰难的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You don't have to. But I think you what I like about it as a CEO is he he was in a very lonely period of time for him to make some really hard decisions.</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我不知道他是否能确信这些决定会产生某种结果，因为它们可能会根据走向而带来灾难性的后果。阅读他是如何经历这一切以及他所经历的过程，我觉得很有趣，也很令人安心。

<p class="english-text">That I don't know that he could necessarily go and be confident that those decisions were going to be have a certain outcome that could have been incredibly cataclysmic depending on which way they went. Uh and reading about how he went through that and and the process he went through I find interesting and reassuring.</p>

主持人: 他雇佣了一些竞争对手，对吧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">What kind of music do you play?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 我什么都听。我以前从不听乡村音乐，直到我搬到德克萨斯州，我的孩子们都是乡村音乐的狂热爱好者。

John Stankey: 嗯哼。我仍然听很多我年轻时听的专辑导向摇滚乐。我今天也听流行音乐。当我需要平静下来时，我会在家里打开钢琴，听我们的自动演奏钢琴播放古典音乐，等我退休后，我希望能自己演奏，但现在我只能让它为我演奏。所以，我几乎什么都听。

<p class="english-text">Uhhuh. I still listen to a lot of album oriented rock from my youth. I listen to pop music today. I when I need to calm down a little bit, I'll play the I'll turn the piano on in the house and listen to classical music on our player piano, which when I retire, I hope to be able to play myself, but right now I have to let it play for me.

### 对年轻人的建议

主持人: 听起来不错。John，最后一个问题。你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sounds good. John, last question. What What is your advice to young people?</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 尤其是在现在，我对年轻人的建议是，你需要深思熟虑你的**学习过程**（process to learn: 学习的方法和步骤）。嗯，你知道，我们可以在一个经过五六年开发的**课程**（curriculum: 教学计划）的大学里，在课堂环境中获得相关学习，这种观念正在迅速消退。嗯，当你考虑到我们所有人，包括年轻人，每天触手可及的资源，我们可以从中学习，当你考虑到技术发展有多快，商业模式发展有多快，正如我们讨论过的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Especially now, my advice to young people is you need to think deliberately about what your process is to learn. Um, you know, this the notion that we can go to a university on a curriculum that's developed over five or six years and have relevant learning in a classroom environment, I think, is fading pretty quickly. Um, when you think about the resources that are available to all of us, including young individuals that are at our fingertips every day that we can go to school on, and you think about how fast technolog is moving, how fast business models are moving, as we've discussed,</p>
</details>

John Stankey: 你必须把你的职业生涯看作是四五年一个章节。每隔四五年，你都必须建立一个新的工作，一个新的基础，一套新的技能，一种新的方法。而你一生中（可能长达80或90年）唯一能做到这一点的方式是，如果你真的非常擅长成为自己教育的**院长**（dean of your own education: 成为自己学习的主导者），并且拥有一个过程，一个纪律，让你每天都在思考那些学习时刻是什么，以及你用来学习和掌握新技能的日常习惯。如果你在年轻时和职业生涯早期培养了这些能力，它们将为你的一生和职业生涯服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to think about your career in chapters that are four or five years. And every four or five years, you're going to have to build a a new gig, a new foundation, a new set of skills, a new approach. And the only way you're going to be able to do that over the course of a life that may be 80 or 90 years is if you are really really good about being the dean of your own education and having a process, a discipline under which every day in your life you think about what those learning moments are and the routines that you use to learn and carry forward on new skills. And if you develop those capabilities early in your life and your career, they will serve you for your entire life and career.</p>

John Stankey: 今天我们拥有无限量的信息。赢家是那些能找出如何消化信息的人。而AI现在只会提高这方面的赌注，因为它不仅让我们能够更快地合成更多信息，而且它总是可供我们学习。那些掌握这一点的人，最终可能会脱颖而出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have an unlimited amount of information available to us today. The winner is the person who figures out how to digest it. And AI is only up the stakes on that now because it's allowed us to not only synthesize more information quickly, but it's always available to us to learn from. And people who master that are going to probably be the ones who come out on top over time.</p>
