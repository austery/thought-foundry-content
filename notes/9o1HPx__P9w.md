### 恢复对政府的信任：联邦制与州权

主持人宣布提问环节开始，并向两位州长提出了第一个问题：“民主党和共和党州长可以如何携手合作，以恢复公众对政府的信任？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, first question. We ready? Good morning, everyone. Morning. It's great to be in this hall. It's about the size of Delaware. What can what can Democratic and Republican governors do together to restore trust in government?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 谢谢你的提问。我认为首先，对联邦政府的信任问题在于，我们的开国元勋从未设想联邦政府会主导我们生活的每一个部分。他们构想了**联邦制**（Federalism: 一种政府组织形式，权力在中央政府和地方政府之间分配），即各州更贴近人民。各州知道如何教育我们的孩子，我们专注于教育、基础设施、经济和医疗保健。当采取“一刀切”的方式时，就会出现问题。我们知道特拉华州与俄克拉荷马州不同，我们的开国元勋也知道新罕布什尔州与弗吉尼亚州不同。我认为，如果我们回归**州权**（States' rights: 各州拥有独立于联邦政府的特定权利和权力）以及将各州视为“**民主的50个实验室**”（50 laboratories of democracy: 指各州可以尝试不同的政策，作为全国性政策的试验田），我们将比自上而下的方法做得更好。其他国家有所不同，联邦政府创建了这些下级行政区划，但在美国并非如此，是各州创建了联邦政府。国会目前的批准率约为15%，而各州才是关键所在，那里是思想和创新的源泉。我认为我们越是回归这一点，人民就会越幸福。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, thank you for that. Um, you know, I think first off that trust in the federal government, uh, our founding fathers never envisioned the federal government to dominate every single part of our lives. They thought about this idea of federalism, that the states are closer to the people. Uh, that the states know how to educate our kids. We we we're focused on education. We're focused on infrastructure. We're focused on the economy and healthcare. And when you have a one-sizefits-all, it is a problem. And so we know that Delaware is different than Oklahoma. Our founding fathers knew that New Hampshire was different than Virginia. And I think if we get back to states rights and having the states, this 50 laboratories of democracy, I think we're going to be much better off than a top-down approach. Other countries were a little bit different where the federal government created these subdivisions, but it wasn't that way in the US. The states created the federal government. Congress has about a 15% approval rating right now and states are where it's at. That's where the ideas, the innovation comes. I think the more we get back to that, I think the people are happier.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 你说得对，凯文。各州就是这样。十年前，我是一名六年级和七年级的数学老师。我最终竞选公职，我竞选了县级职位。我是一个相当进步的民主党人，我很快意识到，无论是**MAGA共和党人**（MAGA Republicans: 指支持“让美国再次伟大”运动的共和党人）、**伯尼民主党人**（Bernie Democrats: 指支持伯尼·桑德斯进步政策的民主党人），还是介于两者之间的几乎所有人，如果我能确保他们的地下室没有污水，并降低他们的污水处理费，他们都会支持我。如果我们能迅速响应911报警电话，让合格、训练有素、对所服务社区有认同感的警察迅速到达人们的家门口，我认为我们恢复政府信任的方式就是为人民提供服务。如果你去全国50个州的政府，无论是民主党还是共和党州长，我们预算的大部分都集中在四件事上：教育、医疗、交通和监禁。我向你保证，如果我们50个州都能出色地完成这四件事，提供服务，并可能稍微降低你的税单，使其负担得起，我认为我们就会获得支持，并赢回美国人民。这就是我们赢得人民信任的方式。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, Delaware, I know Oklahoma. That's right, Kevin. Uh, states, right? So, 10 years ago, I was a sixth and seventh grade math teacher. Uh, and I ended up running for teachers in the crowd. Not not enough of us go into go into these uh go into this business politics and I ran for office. I ran for county office and it's I'm a pretty progressive Democrat and I realized pretty quickly the MAGA Republicans, the Bernie Democrats and pretty much everyone in between would support me if I kept sewage out of their basement and kept their sewer fees low. If we answer 911 calls quickly, police qualified, well-trained with with a sense of the community they're serving showed up quickly at people's door. I think the way we restore trust in government is we deliver for people. If you if you go to 50 governments, if you go to 50 governors across this country, Democrat, Republican, the bulk of our budget is four things. It's education, it's medication, it's transportation, and it's incarceration. And I assure you, if all 50 of of us can do those four things with excellence, deliver, and maybe reduce your tax bill a little bit so that it's affordable, I think we will get support and we will win back the American people. That's the way we win the trust of our people.</p>
</details>

### 信息两极分化下的治理挑战

主持人提出了第二个问题：“现在连信息都两极分化了。当人们可能不认同我们的现实或你的现实时，你如何治理？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. Okay. Second question. Even information is now polarized. How do you govern when people may not share our reality or your reality?</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 哇，你给我出了个简单的题目。好吧，你让我先回答这个问题，是吗？我的妻子是一名急诊室医生，我们经常开玩笑说，当有人来到她的急诊室时，没有所谓的“另类现实”。如果数据显示有人无法呼吸，她不会让护士或者说：“嘿，你正在呼吸，对吧？”现实就是现实。没有人能通过播放TikTok视频来说：“哦，你的脚没有掉下来。”如果它真的在掉下来，我希望她急诊室里那种对数据和真相的理解，也能存在于我的世界里。我希望我们能审视疫苗等数据，并以此作为制定国家政策的依据，因为那是黑白分明的。我希望我们生活在一个社交媒体网红无法改变数据真实含义的世界。我认为我们俩都强烈感受到的一件事是，如今有多少美国人生活在**回音室效应**（Echo chambers: 指人们只接触与自己观点相似的信息，导致信念被放大和强化）中。他们看同一个电视台，听同样的话，这些信息只是在肯定他们，让他们感到安心。我们需要尽一切努力打破这些模式。没有这一点，我们将很难共同建设民主。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. You give me the easy ones. Okay. You make me start on this one, huh? Um, my wife is an emergency room physician and we often joke that when someone comes into her emergency room, there is no alternative reality. If someone cannot breathe and the data shows someone cannot breathe, she doesn't have a nurse or she doesn't say, "Hey, you you're breathing, right? There's a reality. Someone can't show a Tik Tok video to say, "Oh, your foot is not falling off." If it's actually falling off, I wish that that same sense of data and truth that she has in her emergency room, I had in my world. I wish that we looked at the data on vaccines, for example, and use that, it's black and white, and use that to make policy for our country. I wish we lived in a world where one social media influencer can't change the course of what data actually says. Uh, I think one thing that we both get a palpable sense of is how many Americans today are in echo chambers. They watch the same TV station, hear the same thing that gives them a pat on the back and reassures them. We need to do everything we can to to break those patterns. It's going to be hard for us to build a democracy together without that.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 是的，说得很好。我认为现实是，我们并非都想法一致，对吧？特拉华州，就像我之前说的，和我们州不同。我认为我们所有美国人都应该问自己这个问题。因为有人在看这个，房间里可能也有人仅仅因为我是共和党人就讨厌我。也有人因为马特是民主党人就讨厌他。我们被社交媒体和媒体推向两极，被逼到各自的角落。但我认识马特，我认识他的妻子劳伦，他有三个孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Very good. Well, you know, and and I think the the reality is we don't all think the same, right? Delaware, like I said before, is different than than than our state. And I want I think we all should ask ourselves this question as Americans. Uh because there's people watching this, there's probably people in this room that hate me just because I'm a Republican. There's people watching this that hate Matt just because he's a Democrat. that we're polarized, that we're driven to our corners by social media and the media. And I know Matt. I know his wife Lauren. He has three children.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 我已经快赶上凯文·斯蒂特了，他有六个孩子。
**Kevin:** 说得对。
**Matt:** 你还没完呢。
**Kevin:** 别告诉我妻子。是的，我们刚刚一起去了瑞士，研究那里的教育模式，并带回了关于职场学习和**学徒制**（Apprenticeships: 一种结合在职培训和课堂教学的技能培养模式）的理念。但关键是，我知道他关心特拉华州的公民，我知道他热衷于教育，并致力于为特拉华州的人民提供更好的生活，就像我在俄克拉荷马州所做的一样。所以，我认为我们的工作不是改变每个人的观点。我认为我们需要领导，我们需要问自己这个问题，我们不能仅仅被两极分化的政治所驱动。当你展现出彼此的人性，当你花时间与想法不同的人相处，以及当我们能够辩论政策但仍然彼此喜欢，并且可能在如何领导事物上存在意见分歧时，这会让人耳目一新。这就是为什么我们喜欢一起做这类事情，展示一个共和党人和一个民主党人实际上彼此喜欢，我们可以意见不合，但不必以不愉快的方式进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're I'm halfway to Kevin Stit. He's got six. That's right. You're not done yet. Don't tell my wife. Yeah. we just went to Switzerland together to study education and their model there and bring back these ideas about uh workplace uh workforce learning and and apprenticeships and um but the thing is I know that he cares about Delaware citizens and I know he cares passionately about education and giving people in Delaware a better life just like I do in Oklahoma. So I think that uh it's not our job to change everybody's point of view. I think we need to lead and we need to ask ourselves this question and we need to not just be so driven by polarized politics and and when you bring the humanity out in each other and when you spend time with people that think differently and this idea that we can debate policy and we can still like each other and we may have a difference of opinion on how to how to lead things. Um it's so refreshing and that's why we love doing these type of things together. uh showing that there's a Republican and a Democrat that actually like each other and we can disagree but we don't have to do it disagreeable.</p>
</details>

### 州级创新与可负担性议程

主持人问凯文：“凯文，你的州做了什么值得其他州学习的事情？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. All right, Kevin, what's something your state has done that other states can learn from?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 是的，我认为这与当前的政府停摆和**SNAP福利**（SNAP benefits: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program，补充营养援助计划，为低收入个人和家庭提供食品援助）问题非常相关，这些问题确实影响着我们所有的州。我知道州长们都在通电话，讨论“你们在做什么？我们如何满足州内最弱势群体的需求？”因此，我们设立了一个“成为邻居”的倡议，实际上我在2019年首次当选时就启动了，我创建了beaneighbor.org。因为我不相信华盛顿特区或俄克拉荷马城能够通过一项法律来解决一些社会问题。这需要邻里互助，需要教会和非营利组织。所以我们的“成为邻居”理念是，如果你有需求，你可以访问我们设立的这个网站，它会连接所有的非营利组织、教会社区和州级资源。这是我非常自豪的一件事。此外，在政策上我们有时会变得有点“怪异”，比如“**仪表后**”（Behind the meter: 指电表后的能源管理和发电，通常涉及分布式能源）。我们认为我们需要赢得能源竞赛，我们在俄克拉荷马州通过了相关的法案，以及我从商界带到州政府的财政责任理念。我相信我们作为州长的工作是成为我们州的首席执行官。我管理着400亿美元的预算，拥有3万名州政府雇员。我只想为俄克拉荷马州人民提供更好的服务。我认为有时我们选出的人没有这种专注，他们更多地是在玩弄政治，而不是真正为人民服务。你刚才也说得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, you know, I I think it's very topical right now with the government shutdown and SNAP benefits uh are really affecting all of our states. I know governors, we've been on the phone, we've talked, what are you doing? How are we going to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our state? And so we set up and really I did this back in 2019 when I was first elected, but I put up a be a neighbor be a neighbor.org because I don't believe that you can pass a law in Washington DC or Oklahoma City that can fix some of these social issues. It takes neighbors walking with neighbors. It takes churches and nonprofits. And so our be a neighbor concept is if you have a need, you can go to this uh website that we've set up and it connects all of the nonprofits, the church communities, the state resources. And so that's something that I'm really proud of. Also uh behind the we get a little wonky on policy behind the meter. this idea that we need to win uh the energy race that we passed in Oklahoma, the fiscal responsibility that that uh that we've done as as coming from a business world that I brought to uh state government. I believe that our job as governors is is to be the CEO of our state. Uh I've got a $40 billion budget, 30,000 state employees. I just want to deliver better services for Oklahomaans. And uh and I think that sometimes we elect people that that don't have that focus. They're more playing politics and actually delivering for the people. And you said that great while ago, too.</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 是的，这很棒。我知道俄克拉荷马州有很多《**塔拉迪加之夜**》（Talladega Nights: 一部2006年的美国喜剧电影）的粉丝。我非常喜欢**瑞奇·鲍比**（Ricky Bobby: 电影《塔拉迪加之夜》中的主角），他说：“如果你不是第一，你就是最后。”我恰好来自第一个州（特拉华州）。所以，我只想提一下。我们现在认真地在做的是，我们正努力将可负担性置于我们所有工作的核心。我认为在当今的经济中，亿万富翁有更大的机会积累财富，而工薪阶层却受到挤压，因为公立学校似乎运转不佳，能源价格飞涨，医疗保健似乎背负着20世纪的问题，而且成本似乎永无止境。所以我们有一个可负担性议程。我们正在建设一所医学院，以便我们州能有更多的医疗服务提供者。我们州以前从未有过医学院。我们正在努力简化许可流程，我认为这一点我们是认同的。摆脱前总统——我喜欢他——所说的“**官僚主义废话**”（Bureaucratic malarkey: 指不必要的、繁琐的官僚程序），对吧？消除所有阻碍我们建造人民急需的住房以降低租金的摩擦。我们还在努力开发新的能源，这是我们经济迫切需要的，这样人们才能负担得起电费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No. So, that's great. I I I know in Oklahoma I know in Oklahoma there are a lot of a lot of Tallaladega Knight fans. And uh you know, I'm a big fan of There are in Delaware, too. I'm a big fan of Ricky Bobby who says I love Ricky Bobby. Yeah. Who says if you're not first, you're last. I happen to be from the first state. So, just want to put that out. And we're we're what we're trying to do what we're trying to do on a serious note is we're trying to uh put affordability at the center of everything we do. What's happening I believe now in today's economy is you have billionaires with greater opportunity to build their wealth than working people who are getting squeezed by public schools that don't seem to be working by energy prices that are skyrocketing by health care that seems saddled with 20th century problems and and costs that seem to have no end. So we have an affordability agenda. We're working on building a medical school so that the medical providers will be available in our state. There's never been a medical school in our state. We're working on we're working on streamlining permitting something on in which I think we agree. Getting rid of what what the former president someone I like called bureaucratic malarkey, right? Getting rid of all all the friction that prevents us from building the housing that our people desperately need to bring down rents. Uh, and we're working on building new energy sources, something that desperately needed for our economy and so people can afford their power bills.</p>

### 修复美国政治文化：团队合作与诚信

主持人问：“如果能修复美国政治文化的一个方面，那会是什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Excellent. If you could fix one aspect of American political culture, what would that be?</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 十五年前，我是一名外交官。我曾作为美国外交官，在伊拉克摩苏尔随军驻扎了12个月，参与**伊拉克自由行动**（Operation Iraqi Freedom: 2003年美国及其盟友对伊拉克发动的军事行动）。我不是士兵，但我与1万名士兵一起住在一个基地里。令人惊奇的是，那个基地里有来自美国各个角落的士兵。我去伊拉克时，以为会了解伊拉克和阿拉伯文化，我确实了解了，但我更多地了解了美国。那里有一个团队。我每周两三次离开基地，去与伊拉克人会面，以建立持久和平。我们与会见的伊拉克人并非总能达成一致，但美国团队是一个团结的团队。我常常想，在特拉华州，当我们谈论住房、医疗保健、教育，当我们谈论发展经济时，为什么会有如此巨大的分歧？我们如何建立同样的团队合作精神？我们正处于人类有史以来最伟大的自治实验之中。这个实验已经进行了近250年。我认为作为美国人，我们需要找到一种方式，一起坐在舞台上，一起分享食物，理解我们不能仅仅将所有精力都投入到互相攻击上。在俄克拉荷马州和特拉华州都有可以抓住的机会，如果我们能找到合作的方式，人们就会意识到这些机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One, uh, 15 years ago, I was a diplomat. I was a US diplomat embedded with the army for 12 months in Mosul, Iraq. lived. I wasn't a soldier, but I lived on a base with 10,000 soldiers during Operation Iraqi Freedom. And what was amazing is there were soldiers on that base from every corner of America. As I went to Iraq, I thought I was going to learn about Iraq and and Arab culture, which I did, but I learned a lot I learned a lot more about America. And there was a team there. I left the base two or three times a week to go and meet with Iraqis to build a lasting peace. And we weren't always on the same page with the Iraqis we were meeting with, but the American team was a singular team. I often wonder in Delaware, how come when we're talking about housing or healthcare, education, we're talking about growing our economy, there are incredible divisions. How do we build that same sense of teamwork? Uh we're in the midst of the greatest human experiment and self-government that's ever occurred. We're in almost year 250 of this experiment. I think we need to find a way as Americans to sit on stage together to to break bread with each other to understand that we can't just channel all of our energies into knocking each other down. There are opportunities to be made in Oklahoma and in Delaware that people will realize if we do find a way to work together.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 你知道吗？州长，我想要改变的一件事就是，在政治中注入更多的诚信。我的意思是，对我来说，诚信就是做正确的事，仅仅因为它是正确的，即使这需要付出代价。我认为政客们尤其如此，这就是为什么人们讨厌政客，因为他们能看穿他们。他们没有做正确的事，只是盲目地追随某些“团队”。要么是你的阵营，要么是我的阵营。你是民主党人，你是共和党人，然后你盲目地追随。让我们直言不讳。我们不要被逼到角落里。大多数美国人，你有10%在极右翼，10%在极左翼。但大多数美国人就在中间，他们带着孩子去上钢琴课和足球训练。他们希望孩子过上最好的生活。他们想要最好的教育，最好的医疗保健系统。所以，我认为我们越能像这样交流，我们越能作为美国人团结起来，停止如此两极分化，真正辩论思想，我认为我们就会变得更好。我还非常欣赏林肯总统。在内战即将结束时，他发表了第二次就职演说，他谈到了“**恶意不存，仁爱待众**”（Malice toward none, with charity for all: 亚伯拉罕·林肯第二次就职演说中的名言，呼吁在内战后实现和解与团结）。当时有人想惩罚对方。就像我们今天一样，我们有一个钟摆，根据谁执政而从一边摆向另一边。我们必须停止这种现象。我认为美国人不喜欢这样。你不能将**美国联邦司法部**（Department of Justice: 美国联邦政府的法律部门，负责执法和司法管理）武器化。你不能仅仅因为政治原因而取消商业交易。我们必须允许美国人创新，满足美国人的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. You know what? The one thing I would change, Governor, is is just inject more integrity into politics. And what I mean by that, you know, to me, integrity is is doing what's right just because it's right, even when it's costly. And and I think politicians especially, that's why people hate politicians is because they can see right through them. They're not doing what's right. out there blindly following uh some uh you know teams. It's either your skins or shirts. You're Democrat, you're Republican, and and uh and and you blindly are following things. Let's call a spade a spade. And let's not be driven to the corners. Most of America, you've got 10% on the far right, 10% on the far left. But most Americans are right there and they're taking their kids to piano lessons and soccer practice. They want the best life for their for their for their kids. They want the best education, the best health care system. And so I think the more that we can talk like this, that we can come together uh as Americans and stop being so polarized and really debate the ideas, I think the better off we'll be. Um I also uh I'm a huge fan of of President Lincoln and and at the end of Civil War, uh it was almost over and and he was doing his second inaugural address and he talks about a malice towards none and and and a charity for all. And there was people that wanted to, you know, punish the other side. And and much like we are today, we've got a pendulum swinging from one side to another depending on who's in office. And we've got to stop that. Uh I don't think Americans like it. Uh you can't weaponize the Department of Justice. You can't cancel uh business deals based on politics one side or the other. We've got to allow Americans to innovate and meet the needs of Americans. Right.</p>

### 人工智能、教育与劳动力发展

主持人提出了下一个问题：“随着**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，指机器模拟人类智能过程的技术）对教育的影响，社区公立学校会发生什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, next question. Uh, with AI's influence on education, what happens to the neighborhood public schools?</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 你知道，这很有趣。有人说，民主党和共和党唯一能达成一致的事情就是社交媒体需要退出课堂。我们需要让孩子们远离社交媒体。我教书的第一年，参加了一个名为“**美国为全民而教计划**”（Teach for America: 一个非营利组织，招募应届大学毕业生到低收入社区任教）的项目，在华盛顿特区。当时我们学校没有电脑，在华盛顿特区的阿纳科斯蒂亚区教书。所以我们开始了一项任务，去和附近的商家、大学谈，争取到任何能得到的电脑。几个月内，每个教室都有了两三台电脑。我们把它们插上电源，孩子们看到我们带来了**万维网**（Worldwide Web: 全球互联计算机网络系统）时，脸上都亮了起来，他们突然有了前所未有的机会，可以在学校围墙之外探索和学习。我认为人工智能同样带来了巨大的机遇。我认为我们可以在学校中取消标准化考试。如果你看看人工智能的工具，我们现在可以使用现代技术，在日常基础上对学生进行更好、更全面的评估。我作为六年级数学老师时遇到的最大问题之一是，有些学生只有四年级、五年级的技能，而另一些学生则拥有七年级、八年级的技能。利用技术，我们可以以前所未有的方式提供相关的教育。但也有威胁。我们需要确保我们控制技术，而不是让技术控制我们。最重要的是，它不应该由万亿美元的公司驱动。我们的孩子需要的是由我们的孩子、家庭和老师来决定需求是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's interesting. I it it's been said that the one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on is social media needs to get out of the classroom. We need kids off social media. Uh, my first year teaching, I was in a program called Teach for America in Washington DC. TFA in the house and I had uh we had no computers in our school teach in the Anacostia section of Washington DC. Uh and so we went on a mission to go talk to businesses nearby universities get any computers we can but by within a few months we had two three computers in every classroom. We plugged them into the wall and saw kids faces light up as we brought something called the worldwide web where they suddenly had opportunities to explore and learn outside the walls of our school like never ever before. I think AI similarly presents incredible opportunities. Uh I think we can eliminate standardized testing in our school. If you look at the tools that AI has, we have better, more thorough assessments of students on a day-to-day basis using modern technology than would otherwise. One of the biggest problems I had as a sixth grade math teachers is some students walked in with fourth grade, fifth grade skills and other students walked in with seventh grade, eighth grade skills. Using technology, we can deliver education like never before that's relevant. But there are threats. We need to make sure we control the technology and the technology doesn't control us. And most importantly, it's not driven by trillion dollar companies. What our kids need that our kids, families, and teachers drive what the needs are. So good.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 你知道，我们正努力在俄克拉荷马州的学校实施一项技术。回到你的观点，让我惊讶的是，我观察到一位六年级老师在教他们的班级，但这个六年级学生阅读水平远低于年级水平，远远落后。我当时想：“你为什么要教？你为什么要继续给这个孩子六年级的材料？”她说：“嗯，我是一名六年级老师，我该怎么办？”有了人工智能，我们可以回去教那个孩子一年级的语音学或二年级的知识，我们可以把他们提升到年级水平。我们可以利用技术造福我们的学生，帮助他们，并成为我们老师的工具。所以，我们正在拥抱它。我认为我们需要拥抱它。在劳动力和教育方面，我认为我们需要考虑的是让企业更多地参与进来。我们刚从瑞士回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So good. You know, one of the one of the technologies that we're trying to implement in uh in schools in Oklahoma. And back to your point, what amazed me is is I I I observed a sixth grade teacher uh teaching their class, but this sixth grade student wasn't reading at grade level and was way behind. And I was like,"Wh are you teaching? Why are you continuing to give this kid sixth grade material?" And she's like, "Well, I'm a sixth grade teacher. What am I supposed to do?" And with AI, we can go back and teach first grade phonics to that kid or second grade and we can bring them up to grade level. We can use technology to benefit uh the the our students and get them and help and be a tool for our teachers. So, we're embracing it. I think we need to embrace it. um on workforce and education. I think that uh the the thing that we need to think about is get businesses more involved. We just got back from Switzerland</p>
</details>

**Matt:** 瑞士的理念是义务教育在某个年级结束，然后每个孩子都会签订一份合同。我们看到他们签订合同，然后他们实际上开始工作，因为他们认为职场教育就是教育。所以这些孩子，他们有渗透性。他们也可以去工作，获得认证，但如果他们愿意，他们也可以继续上大学。所以这不像我们在美国认为的那样是死胡同，认为如果你上职业学校，你就是一个没有前途的人，对吧？我们希望他们都上大学。在德国、瑞士不是那样的。我认为我们需要重新塑造自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and this idea in Switzerland that compulsory education ends in nth grade and then every single kid like signs a contract. It was amazing for us to see they sign a contract and they actually start going to work because they think workplace education is education. And so these kids, it's permeability. They can also go work. they get a accreditation, but then they can go on to college if they want to. And so it's not a dead end like we think of it here in the US that oh, if you're going to a vocational school, you've got a you're a dead-end person, right? We want them all going to college. It's not that way in Germany, Switzerland. And I think we need to reinvent ourselves.</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 而且他们也在赚钱。
**Matt:** 太棒了。孩子们赚了1000瑞士法郎，也就是15岁时，我不知道，大约13400美元。这是一个很棒的模式，我们正把它带回俄克拉荷马州和特拉华州，让更多的孩子参与到劳动力市场中。
**Kevin:** 说得对。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And they were making money, too. It was amazing. The kids were making a,000 Swiss Franks, which is at 15, which is, I don't know, 13,400 US. Uh, but it was a great model and we're bringing that back to Oklahoma and Delaware to get more kids more engaged in the workforce. That's right.</p>

<p class="english-text">All right, last one. Kevin, what gives you hope for American democracy?</p>
</details>

**Kevin:** 你知道，作为**全国州长协会**（National Governors Association: 一个由美国各州和领地州长组成的无党派组织）的主席，我们俩都在这个两党合作的州长团体中。我是今年的主席。我的倡议是“重燃**美国梦**”（American Dream: 指通过努力工作和决心，每个人都能在美国获得成功和繁荣的信念）。美国梦是这个国家独有的理念，其他国家都想来这里，因为这个理念是你可以成为任何你下定决心要成为的人。这与你的父母是谁无关，与你贫富无关，通过教育系统，通过自由市场，你可以实现你的美国梦。梦想和人一样多。也许你想执教女儿的足球队，或者你想创办一个非营利组织，或者你想创业。无论是什么，你都有自由去做。只要美国梦还活着，我认为美国民主就值得为之奋斗。我们必须为之奋斗。我们不能教导我们的孩子，人人都能获得平等的结果，但我们希望有平等的机会去追逐那些梦想。我对此充满热情，这就是为什么我认为教育如此重要，它能给予孩子们这些机会，让他们接触到一切可能性，因为上帝独特地创造了每个人，赋予他们伟大的技能、渴望和能力，并给予每个人独特的能力，我们希望帮助下一代找到这些。我认为这就是美国的伟大之处，我们是不同的。特拉华州与俄克拉荷马州不同。但它仍然值得为之奋斗，这就是为什么我们在这里展示我们确实相处融洽。我们确实彼此喜欢，我们可以领导我们的州。也许方式略有不同。但它仍然是美国，我们仍然在为它奋斗。

<p class="english-text">You know, as the chair, we're both in the National Governor Association. It's the bipartisan group of all the governors. I'm the chair this year. And my initiative is reigniting the American dream. And the American dream uh is this idea that is so unique to our country and other countries all want to come here because the idea is that you can be anything that you set your mind to. It doesn't matter who your parents are. Doesn't matter uh if you were rich or poor through an education system, through free markets, you can achieve your American dream. And there's as many dreams as there are people. And it may be that you want to coach your daughter's soccer team or you want to start a nonprofit or you want to start a business. Uh whatever it is, you have the freedom to do that. And as long as the American dream is alive, I think the American democracy is worth fighting for. And we need to fight for that. And we need to not teach our children that there's such things as, you know, equal outcomes for everyone, but we want equal opportunities to go chase those dreams. And I just am so passionate about that's why I think education is so important to giving those kids those opportunities and exposed them with what's possible because God has uniquely created everybody differently with great skills and desires and abilities and given them everybody an individual ability that we want to help that next generation find. And and I think that's the greatness of America is we're different. Delaware is different than Oklahoma. Uh but it is worth fighting for and that's why we're up here demonstrating that we do get along. We do like each other and we can lead our states. Uh maybe a little differently. Uh but it's still it's still America and we're still fighting for it.</p>

**Matt:** 是的，我称之为……请为他鼓掌。凯文，我称之为多元、公平和包容的美国。所以不要使用首字母缩写。听着，我必须坦率地说，我来这里本来没打算说这个，但上周二的选举给了我对美国民主一些希望。我认为在这个房间里，我实际上是少数派。听着，我是一个《**辛普森一家**》（The Simpsons: 一部美国动画情景喜剧）的忠实粉丝。我最喜欢《辛普森一家》的一集是辛普森一家去做电击疗法。你知道，如果你对你所爱的人有同理心，你就会关心他们。他们互相电击了几分钟，直到斯普林菲尔德的所有电力都中断了。我觉得当我看着华盛顿的时候，现在很多事情就是这样。我们不确定我们是否能飞到这里。也许现在发生的事情，我们就能顺利离开。我们的人民真的吃不上饭，或者无法获得SNAP福利。听着，我们作为州长，作为人类，作为美国人，坐在一起，这里有一个机会。去和那些不同意你观点的人交谈。不是为了和他们争论，而是真正倾听他们，同情他们，理解他们的立场。这就是我作为一名老师必须做的事情。这也是许多美国人正在做的事情，这就是我们最终对这个伟大的自治实验未来250年抱有希望的方式。非常感谢。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. I I I call that I call give him a round of applause for that. I call that Kevin a a diverse, equitable, and inclusive America. So don't use the don't use the initials. Don't make them don't make them use the initials. Listen. I got to be frank. I didn't really come here to say this, but last Tuesday's election gave me a little bit of hope for American democracy. Um, I think I'm outnumbered in this room, actually. Listen, uh, I'm a big Simpsons fan. And there's one of my favorite episodes of the Simpsons is when the Simpsons go to electroshock therapy. You know, if you feel empathy for the ones you love, you're going to care for them. And and they shock each other for a few minutes till all the power goes down in Springfield. And I feel like when I look at Washington, that's a lot of what's happening right now. The point I wasn't we weren't sure if we were going to be able to fly here. Uh maybe with what's going on, we'll be able to get out no problem. Our people literally aren't aren't able to eat or haven't been able to get SNAP benefits. Um listen, there is an opportunity here for us as governors sitting together as human beings, as Americans. Go and talk to someone who disagrees with you. Not to argue with them, but actually to listen to them, empathize with them, understand the position that they come from. That's what I had to do as a teacher. That's what many Americans do and that's how we ultimately have hope for the next 250 years of this great experiment in self-governance. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>
