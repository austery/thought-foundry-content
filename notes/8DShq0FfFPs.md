### 明尼阿波利斯抗议事件

**Tracy Mumford**: 在明尼阿波利斯，一名联邦探员在试图拘捕一名男子时开枪将其打伤，引发了这座本已高度紧张的城市当晚的激烈抗议。抗议者在事发现场与执法人员发生冲突，投掷雪球和烟花。联邦探员则使用了催泪瓦斯和化学制剂进行回应。

**Tracy Mumford**: In Minneapolis, a federal agent shot and injured a man while trying to detain him, touching off a tense night of protests in a city that's already been on edge. The protesters clashed with law enforcement at the scene of the shooting, throwing snowballs and fireworks. Federal agents responded with canisters of gas and chemical agents.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “这已经完全变成了一场非法集会。早就越过了界限，人们需要离开。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "It has absolutely become an unlawful assembly. It is well past the line and people need to leave."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 随着冲突升级，该市的警察局长和市长召开了新闻发布会，敦促示威者离开。“今晚，任何被激怒的人，请停下。这样做无济于事。回家吧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: As the clashes escalated, the city's police chief and mayor went live with a press conference urging demonstrators to walk away. "For anyone that is taking the bait tonight, stop. That is not helpful. Go home."

**Tracy Mumford**: **美国国土安全部**表示，昨日的枪击事件发生在晚上7点左右，当时联邦探员正在进行一次交通拦截，试图逮捕一名来自**委内瑞拉**的非法入境者。**DHS**发言人称，该男子试图逃跑，随后袭击了追赶他的警官。她还表示，另外两人也加入了袭击，使用了扫帚和雪铲。此时，该探员开枪击中了该男子的腿部。**《纽约时报》**未能立即核实联邦政府的说法。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Department of Homeland Security said yesterday's shooting happened around 700 p.m. during a traffic stop in which federal agents were trying to arrest a man from Venezuela who was in the country illegally. A DHS spokeswoman said he fled and then assaulted the officer who chased after him. She said two other people also jumped in to attack the officer using a broom and a snow shovel. At that point, the agent fired his gun, striking the man in the leg. The Times couldn't immediately verify the federal government's account of what happened.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “此时此刻，我们还有很多未知。但我可以肯定地告诉你，这种情况是不可持续的。”在新闻发布会上，市长重申了他上周在**Renee Good**被一名**ICE**官员杀害后提出的呼吁：他希望联邦部队撤离该市。“我的担忧是，又会发生一起枪击事件。又会有人受伤或死亡。人们感到害怕。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "There's still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable." At the press conference, the mayor repeated the call he made last week after Renee Good was killed by an ICE officer. That he wants the federal deployment in the city to end. "My concern is that yet another shooting will take place. Yet another person will be injured or killed. People are scared."

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天，一名法官拒绝立即就**明尼苏达**官员提起的一项试图阻止大量探员涌入该州的诉讼作出裁决。她已要求**司法部**在周一之前作出回应。

**Tracy Mumford**: Yesterday, a judge declined to rule immediately on a lawsuit that Minnesota officials filed trying to block a surge of agents to the state. She's given the Justice Department until Monday to respond.

### 参议院就委内瑞拉战争权力投票

**Tracy Mumford**: 在参议院的投票中，赞成票为50票，反对票为50票，参议院陷入均势，副总统投下关键一票，并维持了程序性命令。昨天在参议院，共和党人否决了一项旨在限制**特朗普**总统战争权力的措施，该措施要求他获得国会批准才能进行任何未来的军事行动。该决议上周曾获得少数几位共和党参议员的支持而得以推进，但在**特朗普**和白宫的压力攻势下，其中两位参议员——密苏里州的**Josh Holly**和印第安纳州的**Todd Young**——退缩了，导致该努力失败。**Holly**表示，在**国务卿 Marco Rubio**向他保证国会将收到未来军事行动的通知后，他改变了主意。到目前为止，这些通知仅在行动执行后才发出，包括对船只的数十次致命打击以及抓捕**委内瑞拉**总统**Nicholas Maduro**的突袭行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: On this vote. The yays are 50, the nays are 50, the Senate being equally divided, the vice president votes, and the point of order is sustained. In the Senate yesterday, Republicans blocked a measure that would have reigned in President Trump's war powers by forcing him to get congressional approval for any future military action in Venezuela. The resolution had moved forward last week with the support of a handful of GOP senators, but after a pressure campaign from Trump and the White House, two of them, Josh Holly of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, backed down, sinking the effort. Holly said he changed his mind after Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured him that Congress would be notified about any future military actions. So far, those notifications have come only after operations have been carried out, including dozens of deadly strikes on boats and the raid to capture Venezuela's President Nicholas Maduro.

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们面临的问题是，宪法赋予我们发动战争、宣战的权力。但如果我们直到所有人都死了才意识到这是一场战争，那投票决定发动战争是不是有点晚了？”参议员**Rand Paul**是少数几位与民主党人一起支持该法案的共和党人之一，他批评了这次投票，称政府一直在误导议员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "The problem we have is the Constitution gives us the power to initiate war, to declare war. But if we don't know if it's a war until after all the people die, wouldn't it then be a little bit late to vote on initiating the war?" Senator Ran Paul, one of just three Republicans who did stick with Democrats in supporting the bill, criticized the vote, saying the administration has been misleading lawmakers.

### 美国出售委内瑞拉石油

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，美国已开始出售数百万桶**委内瑞拉**石油。据知情人士透露，这些石油自美国开始对进出委内瑞拉的油轮实施海上封锁以来一直滞留在该国。此次封锁已将**委内瑞拉**的经济推向崩溃边缘，而此次销售将有助于避免该国作为主要收入来源的石油产业彻底崩溃。预计大部分石油最终将进入美国的炼油厂。**白宫**发言人表示，美国的参与将使美国人和**委内瑞拉**人双方受益。目前尚不清楚政府正在利用何种法律授权来促成这些交易。

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, the US has started selling millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil. According to people familiar with the deal, the oil has been stuck in the country since the US started a naval blockade against tankers going in or out. that had pushed Venezuela's economy to the brink, and the sales now will head off the complete collapse of the oil industry there, which is the country's main source of revenue. Much of the oil is expected to eventually end up in US refineries. And a White House spokeswoman said that the US's involvement will benefit both Americans and Venezuelans. It's unclear what legal authority the administration is using to broker any deals.

### 伊朗停止镇压抗议

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于**特朗普**政府的另外两则更新。首先，“我们已从对方非常重要的消息源获悉，杀戮已经停止，处决不会发生。”**特朗普**表示，在威胁要攻击**伊朗**以迫使其结束对反政府示威者的血腥镇压几天后，**伊朗**似乎已停止杀害抗议者。**五角大楼**已将另一艘军舰调往该地区，让远程轰炸机进入戒备状态，并开始从一个美国军事基地疏散部分人员。但一位美国军方官员称**特朗普**的最新声明是缓和紧张局势的“下车点”。尽管如此，消息人士称，总统尚未排除对**伊朗**使用军事力量，包括从网络攻击到打击其安全部队的任何行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two other updates on the Trump administration. First, "we have been informed by very important sources on the other side, and they've said the killing is stopped and the executions won't take place." Trump said that Iran appears to have stopped killing protesters days after he threatened to attack the country if it didn't end its bloody crackdown on anti-government demonstrators. The Pentagon had moved another warship into the region, put long range bombers on alert, and started evacuating some personnel from an American military base. But a US military official called Trump's latest statements an offramp from those escalating tensions. Still, sources say the president has not ruled out using military force against Iran, including anything from a cyber attack to a strike against the country's security forces.

### FBI搜查记者住所

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天，**FBI**探员在一项涉及泄露机密信息的调查中，搜查了一名记者的住所，这是一个极其罕见的举动。这位记者是**《华盛顿邮报》**的**Hannah Ntonson**，她的笔记本电脑、手机和智能手表被没收。一位官员告诉**《纽约时报》**，**Nathansson**曾与一名被调查涉嫌窃取机密文件的政府承包商进行过信息往来。**《华盛顿邮报》**的执行主编表示，该报社和**Nathansson**并非调查的焦点，但**FBI**的搜查“引发了关于我们工作受宪法保护的深刻问题和担忧”。根据法律，在大多数情况下禁止对记者工作进行搜查令，而**司法部**的规定称，政府通常应在没收记者材料之前尝试与其进行协商。**Nathansson**在过去一年里收集了数百份关于政府被该行政部门大力改革的联邦工作人员的第一手叙述。此次对其设备的搜查引发了**司法部**可能已获取该名单的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And in an extremely rare move, FBI agents searched the home of a reporter yesterday as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. The journalist, Hannah Ntonson, who works at the Washington Post, had laptops, a phone, and a smartwatch seized. An official told the Times that Nathansson had been messaging with a government contractor who's been under investigation for allegedly taking home classified documents. The executive editor of the Post said the paper and Nathansson are not the focus of the inquiry, but that the FBI search quote raises profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work. By law, search warrants for reporter work are prohibited in most cases, and Justice Department regulations say that the government should generally try to negotiate with the journalists first before seizing their materials. Nathansson had spent the last year collecting hundreds of firstperson accounts from federal workers about the administration's aggressive overhaul of the government. The seizure of her devices raises the possibility that the Justice Department now has access to that list of names.

### 波音飞机事故调查

**Tracy Mumford**: 一份来自调查**UPS**货运飞机去年11月致命坠毁事件的联邦监管机构的新报告称，**波音**公司多年来一直知晓飞机的缺陷。这架喷气式飞机刚从**路易斯维尔**起飞，其中一台发动机就起火了，飞机随后坠入附近的商业区，爆炸成巨大的火球，造成15人死亡。事故的官方原因尚未确定，但**美国国家运输安全委员会**表示，固定发动机的组件裂缝可能导致了事故。根据**NTSB**的说法，同一部件在其他飞机上至少有四次以类似方式断裂过。**波音**公司此前曾告知飞机所有者，该问题不会影响飞行安全。在回应新报告时，**波音**公司的一位代表表示，该公司支持**NTSB**的调查，但没有直接回应调查结果。近年来，在发生一系列致命坠机事故后，该公司的飞机和质量控制流程一直受到严格审查。

**Tracy Mumford**: A new report from federal regulators investigating the deadly crash of a UPS cargo plane back in November says that Boeing knew about flaws in the plane for years. The jet had just taken off from Louisville when one of its engines caught fire and the plane plummeted into nearby businesses, exploding in a massive fireball and killing 15 people. An official cause of the crash hasn't been determined yet, but the National Transportation Safety Board says that cracks in the assembly holding the engine in place could have contributed to the crash. According to the NTSB, that same part had fractured in a similar way at least four other times on other planes. Boeing had previously told aircraft owners that the issue would not affect flight safety. In response to the new report, a Boeing representative said the company supports the NTSB's investigation, but did not directly address the findings. The company's planes and quality control process have come under intense scrutiny in recent years after a series of deadly crashes.

### SpaceX载人返回

**Tracy Mumford**: **SpaceX**的“龙”飞船，我们看到溅落。最后，“**SpaceX**的‘龙’飞船，我们收到两个曲线信号。溅落，名字已切断。”一艘载有四名宇航员从**国际空间站**返回的**SpaceX**“龙”飞船昨晚深夜在**圣迭戈**附近太平洋海域成功溅落。**SpaceX**的“龙”飞船，“很高兴回家。非常感谢将我们送往那里并带回来的团队。”机组人员的返回比预期提前。**NASA**上周表示，机上的一个医疗问题导致他们加快了行程。他们没有提供细节，但这是25年来首次有宇航员因医疗原因离开**国际空间站**。其中两名机组人员来自**NASA**，一名来自**日本宇宙航空研究开发机构**，另一名来自**俄罗斯**。在直播报道他们被帮助走出“龙”飞船时，所有四名宇航员看起来状态良好。他们的返回导致**国际空间站**人员略有不足，但仅为几周。另有四名宇航员定于下月中旬发射。

**Tracy Mumford**: Dragon SpaceX, we see splash down. And finally, SpaceX Dragon, we copy two curves. Splash down and names are cut. A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts back from the International Space Station splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near San Diego in the middle of the night last night. SpaceX Dragon, it's so good to be home. With deep gratitude to the teams who got us there and back. The crew's return came earlier than expected. NASA said last week that a medical issue on board led them to speed things up. They didn't offer any details, but it's the first time in 25 years that an astronaut has left the ISS for a medical reason. Two of the crew are from NASA. One is from the Japanese space agency and the other from Russia's. During live coverage of them being helped out of the capsule, all four astronauts appeared to be in good shape. Their return has left the ISS slightly understaffed, but only for a few weeks. Four more astronauts are scheduled to launch in the middle of next month.
