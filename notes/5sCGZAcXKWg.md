title: 凯文·哈特深度访谈：成功没有捷径，唯有13年的坚持与无畏提问
---

### 承认无知：开启成长的大门

你不能害怕说出自己的无知，那会阻碍你前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can't be afraid to verbalize your ignorance. That's holding you back.</p>
</details>

主持人：给我举个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give me an example.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我可以给你举好几个，比如投资。就像你告诉我，如果我现在把钱投到这里，我就能获得30倍、20倍的回报。这是什么？一个骗局？我一眼就能看穿骗局。去找别的傻瓜吧，因为这事在我这儿行不通，伙计。但是，当你说：“我不懂那是什么意思。投资到底是怎么运作的？我不知道从哪里开始。”现在，你就参与到了正确的对话中，获得了正确的机会，但你是通过在其中扮演“傻瓜”的角色才到达那里的。现在看看我能做到什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can give you several like investing. Like you're telling me that if I put this money in here right now, I get 30x, 20x. What the a scam? I know a scam. When I see one, go find you another idiot cuz it ain't happening over here, buddy. But when you go, you say, "I don't know what that means. How does investing really work? I don't know where to get it." Now you're a part of the right conversations. You're part of the right opportunities, but you get there by being the dummy in them. And now look at what I'm able to do.</p>
</details>

### 十三年的坚持：永不言弃的家庭信条

主持人：凯文，太棒了，我喜欢这个观点。从你第一次表演单口喜剧到你迎来自己的高光时刻，花了13年。你为什么没有放弃？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kevin, I love it. I love it. Kevin, it took 13 years from where you did your first stand up to you having your moment. But why didn't you quit?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：因为我妈妈从我哥哥那里吸取了惨痛的教训，并把这些教训传给了我。让我们回到过去。我在北费城长大，我哥哥贩毒，我爸爸总是进出监狱。我妈妈不愿让同样的事情发生在我身上。所以，我们达成了一个协议。我必须在一定时间内让喜剧事业有所成就。在我看来，这并不难，因为我别无选择。我必须想办法成功。于是，我每天开车从费城到纽约，直到凌晨4点才回家，一个周末要做25到28场演出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because of the lessons that my mom gave from being very scarred from my brother. So, let's go back. I grew up in North Philadelphia. My brother sold the drugs. My dad was always in jail, out of jail. My mom wasn't going to let that happen with me. So, we had an agreement. I had a certain amount of time to make comedy work. And in my mind, it wasn't going to be hard because there was no other option. I would figure it out. So, I was driving from Philadelphia to New York every day. I wasn't coming home until 4:00 a.m. where I was doing 25 to 28 sets a weekend.</p>
</details>

我为此奋斗了很长很长时间。挣扎的日子里，你会问自己“我到底在做什么？我能付得起房租吗？”但妈妈给我上的最重要一课就是：你不准放弃。没有多少人愿意熬过13年的艰难岁月。大多数人在第二年就选择退出，想去找个快速回报的出路。但如果你不断放弃旧事，又开始你认为更好的新事，那只是一个循环。你永远无法完成任何事情。你必须选择一件你想做的事，并坚持到底。我选择了单口喜剧，并决定要完成它。因为如果我专注并把它做好，它就会为我打开大门，让我去做所有其他我想做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I worked at for a very, very long time. And the struggle left you with days of what am I doing? Can I pay my rent? This man, but my mom's biggest lesson was you're not quitting. And not many people are going to do the 13 years of hard. Most people opt out at year two and want to go find a quick return. Well, you keep quitting to start something else that you think is the idea. It's just a cycle. You're never completing anything. You got to make a choice of the thing you're going to do and finish. I made the choice that standup comedy was what I was going to finish. Because if I focused and did it well, that would open up the doors for me to do everything else that I want to do.</p>
</details>

### 拥抱失败：成功与失败相辅相成

主持人：但人们说，人生不可能拥有一切。代价是什么？你在心理健康方面挣扎过吗？对于年轻人来说，成为一个好男人需要什么，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they say that you can't have everything in life. So, what is the cost? Have you struggled with your mental health? What advice have you got for young men in terms of like what it takes to be a good man?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：现在发生了一件很奇怪的事，关于“好男人”的定义变得非常模糊。似乎在今天这个时代，越来越多的男人愿意表达和交流，但又害怕事后被评判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a weird thing that's happening where the definition of a good man is so foggy. It seems that in this time today more men are being forward wanting to express and talk but the fear of being judged after.</p>
</details>

主持人：你有那种恐惧吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you have that fear?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我是一个非常有驱动力的人，我的动力来自于构思。我喜欢这样一个事实：你可以有各种想法，如果你热爱这些想法，你就会充满活力地将它们变为更宏大的现实。对我来说，这就像是大脑真正的燃料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am a very driven individual and I'm driven off of ideiation. I I like the fact that you can have thoughts and if you're in love with the thoughts that you're having, you can be energized to bring those thoughts like into a bigger reality. That's like that's the real fuel to the brain for me.</p>
</details>

主持人：你认为这真的是你最核心的动力吗？因为那像是一个过程，但其结果是各种形式的成功，比如物质上的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think at the at the very core of you that's what's motivating you because that's like a process but the the outcome of that is success in all its forms. It's material success.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：或者是失败。我的意思是，没有失败就没有成功，它们是相辅相成的。失败会带来宝贵的教训和调整。因为你犯过的错，或者因为你不知道用某种方式处理问题而现在知道了，你会变得更加敏锐。所以我拥抱失败这个概念，就像我拥抱成功的喜悦一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or failure. I mean like there is no success without failure. They go hand in hand. And with the failure comes amazing lessons, adjustments and you get sharper because of the stuff that you've done wrong or that you didn't know to approach a certain way that you now know how to approach. So I embrace the concept of failure just as much as I embrace the win of success.</p>
</details>

### 从叛逆少年到职业觉醒

主持人：如果我在你10岁或15岁时遇到你，你和现在有多像？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Had I met you at 10 years old or 15 years old, how similar would you have looked in?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：一点也不像。那时候我没有动力去做我不想做的事情。我不是个好学生，对学校、学校带来的机会、以及我妈妈逼我做的那些我不想做的课外活动都有些敷衍。和朋友们出去玩才是正经事，那是一种奢侈，一种乐趣。但我妈很严厉，所以我没有那种奢侈。正因如此，我才更渴望那些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not even close. Not motivated to do the things that I didn't want to do. Uh not a good student, kind of blowing off school, the opportunities that come with school, the extracurricular activities that I didn't want to do that I was doing that my mom made me do. Hanging out was the thing. Hanging out was the luxury. It was the fun. And it's it wasn't available. My mom was strict. So, I didn't have the luxury of doing all those things, which is why I wanted them more.</p>
</details>

我父亲，亨利·威瑟斯彭，在大多数人眼里是个失败者。你知道，他一生中并没有做正确的事。帮派、犯罪、毒品，不停地进出监狱。我们成长的环境对任何人来说都不是最好的，但对生活在其中的人来说，却是一个了不起的环境，因为那是我们所知道的一切，而常态就是低谷。我妈妈则努力追求更高层次的生活。她追求教育、学位，想拿硕士学位。我妈妈总是想变得更好，总是想更多地教育自己，因为她觉得这是唯一没人能控制、只属于她自己的最大力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And your father, Henry Witherspoon, Spoon G's, my guy. Uh, you know, a mess up in the eyes of most, but my my dad, you know, he didn't necessarily do the right things in life. Um, gang, crime, all of the stuff. Jail, in jail, out of jail, drugs. Uh I mean that that environment that we were raised in is not like you know the the best environment for for anyone but it's a it's an amazing environment for those that live in it because it's all we know and the normaly is the low. My mom strive for the higher side of it. My mom was education uh degree, trying to get another degree, trying to get a master's, trying to My mom was like always wanting to get better, always wanting to educate herself more because she felt that it was the biggest strength that nobody could control but her.</p>
</details>

主持人：你小时候是怎么理解这一切的？一个孩子如何理解父亲的来来去去、进监狱、吸毒？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did you understand that as a kid? Like how does a kid understand the the dad coming and going being in jail drugs?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：你是环境的产物，在那种环境下，那就是常态。所以当你问我怎么理解时，嗯，我们那里没人有爸爸。我所有的朋友，我们的爸爸都是想见就见。我们爱他，因为我们认为那就应该是那样的。我并没有见过很多家庭，父亲和母亲坐在一起吃晚饭，聊天，家庭和睦。我只有几个那样的例子。因为那是常态，所以它从未影响到我。我从未被我们家的困境所困扰。我爸妈只是合不来，关系破裂了。好吧，事实就是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You are a product of your environment and in that environment that's the norm. So when you so when you say like how did you understand that? Well, nobody had a dad. Right. Like all all my friends, our dads, like we see him when we see him and we love him because that's what we that's what we thought that it should be. It's not like I'm going over a volume of homes where I'm seeing the father sit with the family and the mom and they're doing dinner and they're having conversations and they're, you know, it's this happy household. I I I only had a couple of examples like that. So, because that is the norm, I never it never affected me, right? Like I was never taken back by the obstacles of our household. My mom and dad just didn't get along and it didn't work. All right. It is what it is.</p>
</details>

### 母亲的智慧：圣经里的房租和有始有终的功课

凯文·哈特：我妈妈教给我的其中一课，百分之百可以从一本圣经里看到。这是我能讲的最好的故事。我付不起房租，我需要帮助。她说：“除非你开始读圣经，否则我不会帮你。”我说：“妈妈，我在读圣经。”我当时在撒谎，纯粹是撒谎。我真的在读，拜托了妈妈，这是真的。妈妈，他们要把我赶出去了。你读圣经了吗？读了。等你读了圣经再来跟我谈。她这样持续了一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, one of those lessons that your mother was trying to lay down can be seen in a Bible thousand%. Best story ever. Best story um that I'm able to tell. Checks, man. I couldn't pay my rent. I cannot pay my rent. I needed help. And she was like, "Well, I'm not helping you until you start reading the Bible." And I was like, "Mom, I'm reading the Bible." I was lying. Just lying. I'm reading it. Come on, Mom. This is real. Mom, they're going to kick me out. Are you reading your Bible? Yes. When you read your Bible, then talk to me. And she did this for like a while.</p>
</details>

有一天，我独自一人，心想，我该怎么办？我说，让我拿起这本圣经吧。我打开圣经，然后我的房租支票，好几个月的房租支票掉了出来。我当时就想，你知道吗？这太神奇了。然后我真的不得不打开圣经开始阅读。但那是她的一种方式，首先她知道我在撒谎，其次，她给了我人生中最棒的一课。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one day I was like, you know what, man? I was I was by myself and I was like, what am I going to do? I said, let me get this Bible. I read the Bible. And I opened up the Bible and like my checks, rent, like multiple months of rent checks had fell out. And I was like, you know what? It's pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. And then I had to actually open a Bible and and start reading the Bible. But that was her way of of course knowing that I'm lying first of all and b giving me like one of the best lessons ever.</p>
</details>

她撒下的那些智慧种子在某个时刻开始发芽，其中“做事不能半途而废”的理念对我产生了最深远的影响。在我年少时，我开始了很多事情但都没有完成。那是我和我妈妈之间的斗争。“不，你必须完成它。”她会逼我完成。“不，我想放弃。”“不，你必须完成它。”所以，我最终带着一肚子怨气做了很多事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know somewhere along the lines the gyms that she dropped started to click and the idea of not starting things that I'm not going to finish. That's what really resonated with me the most. So, like I started a lot of stuff that I didn't complete in the younger years. That was me and my mom's battle. No, you're gonna finish it. And she would make me finish it. No, I want to quit. No, you're going to finish it. So, I ended up doing a lot of things with an attitude, which is why I have to ask it.</p>
</details>

随着年龄的增长，你开始意识到，为什么一开始要投入时间去做一件你不想坚持到底的事情呢？为什么？或者仅仅因为遇到了一点困难，为什么你就那么轻易地放弃？为什么“放弃”这个念头这么快就出现在你脑海里，而你又对放弃的结果如此心安理得？我不应该这样，这不该是我的座右铭。所以，我们不能停下。如果我们开始了一件事，就要坚持到底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then, as I got older, you realize, well, why are you putting time into something in the beginning that you don't want to see through? Why? or just because you have like a rough moment or a rough patch, why is it so easy for you to quit? Why why is the idea of quit so quick to you to come up with and why are you so comfortable with the results of that? I shouldn't be and that shouldn't be my like motto. So, we don't stop. If we start something, we see it the entire way through.</p>
</details>

### “傻瓜时刻”：人生的转折点

主持人：是什么改变了你？是什么让你突然开始更认真地对待机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was it that changed in you? Like what happened that made you suddenly start to take opportunities more seriously?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我记得我最大的“傻瓜时刻”。我们逃学去过我们的“高年级日”，去了东海岸的六旗大冒险主题公园。活动结束了，我们坐在一起吃饭聊天，我所有的朋友都在谈论他们要去哪所大学，他们已经被录取了，收到了录取通知书。我当时就想，你们是什么时候做这些的？大家什么时候申请的？你们什么时候考的**SAT**（Scholastic Assessment Test: 学术能力评估测试，俗称“美国高考”）？我考了，但我为了能来这里逃学，就草草了事。等等，你们怎么都已经知道要去哪里了？我一无所知，毫无头绪。我所有的朋友都进入了人生的下一个阶段。他们让我一个人当傻瓜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you saw the opportunity, you blew it off. I remember the my big dummy moment. We hookie school to go and have our senior day. We go to Great Adventure theme park on the east coast and there was a moment where we're done and we're talking. like eating and hanging out and all my friends were talking about the college that they were going to go to and they had already been accepted. They had already had letters and stuff. When did y'all do this? When did everybody apply? When did you guys take the SAT? I just I took mine, but I rushed it because I wanted to get here. I wanted a hookie. Wait. How do you guys know where you going already? I had no knowledge, no idea. All my friends have went on to the next stage. They let me be the dummy by myself.</p>
</details>

就在那时，我恍然大悟：没有人比你自己更关心你。没有人会给你通往成功的路线图。你必须自己去寻找信息，去发现它。你必须想要得到它，想要去做。有了正确的帮助和知识，可以更好地为你定位。但最终，你必须自己想去做。而我当时什么都不想做，这让我在早期就陷入了一个非常糟糕的境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's when it dawned on me that like nobody cares about you more than you should care about yourself. And nobody is giving you the road map to like the wins. You have to go find that information. You got to go discover it. You got to you got to want to get it. You got to want to do it. And with the right help, the right world of knowledge, it can better help position you. But ultimately, you have to want to you got to want to do it. and me and just not wanting to do stuff kind of put me in a really messed up position early on.</p>
</details>

### 从球鞋销售到喜剧舞台

凯文·哈特：我的顿悟时刻就是，看看不努力给我带来了什么。我感觉自己就像个不知道人生想做什么的傻瓜。现在我在社区大学上学，当救生员，后来又去了一家叫City Sports的运动鞋店工作。我记得刚开始在鞋店工作时，我心想：“哦，这太酷了。这就是我想做的事。”我为自己找到一份工作而兴奋不已。我会永远做这个，并且要做到最高级别，这样我就能拥有一份事业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My light bulb moment was look at what not applying myself got me. I feel like the dummy that doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. And now I'm at community college. I'm working as a lifeguard. I eventually went to go work for City Sports, which is a a sneaker store. And I remember when I started working at the sneaker store. Talked about this for years, too. I was like, "Oh man, this is this is cool. This is what I want to do. I got the thing that I want to do." I was so excited that I went and got a job, found a job. I'll do this forever and I'm going to make it to the highest level so I can have a career.</p>
</details>

我在运动鞋销售领域如鱼得水。我没有大学学位，但在个性和销售方面，我游刃有余。就是这个了，这是我的使命。就在那时，通过朋友们的建议，真正的希望之光出现了。“你应该去做单口喜剧，因为你很搞笑。”“你应该试试单口喜剧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was flourishing in the space of sneaker sales, right? Education and college degree I don't have. But in the space of personality and sale, I was able to maneuver. This is it. This is my calling. That's where the real beacon of light presented itself through ideas of my friends. You should do standup because you're funny. You should try standup.</p>

主持人：你记得他们说这话时你在哪里吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you remember where you were when they said that?</p>

凯文·哈特：在我的工作场所。我每天都在工作，就在店里。

<p class="english-text">And someone a colleague of yours that works.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：是的，和我一起工作的同事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alice colleague of mine that I work with.</p>
</details>

主持人：当她那么说时，你脑子里在想什么？是点燃了已经存在的火花，还是从无到有地点燃了火焰？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did your brain think when she said that? Was it was it just blowing on a fire that was kind of already there or was it lighting the fire?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：不，我认为是火焰被点燃了。在那个想法出现之前，我从未想过要从事单口喜剧。我一直很搞笑，但我从没想过“我得想办法成为一名喜剧演员”。那从来不是我的想法。我知道我很有趣，很会娱乐大家，能让人发笑。我喜欢成为众人瞩目的焦点，喜欢舞台和灯光，但那并不是我的目标。这个想法被提出来后，我去了业余表演之夜，就在那时，我坠入了爱河。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I think it the the fire was lit. Like I I never thought about pursuing standup comedy prior to like the idea came up. I was always funny, but I wasn't like man I got to figure out how to become a comedian. That was never a thought. I knew that I was very funny. I knew that I was entertaining. I knew that I can make people laugh. I love being the center of attention. I love the idea of a stage and a light, but that wasn't the thing. It was presented and then I went and did the amate and that's when I fell in love.</p>

### 笑声的魔力与事业的起点

主持人：你为什么喜欢舞台和灯光，为什么喜欢表演？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why did you like the stage and the light and and why did you like performing?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：笑声。没有什么比笑声更美妙了。站在舞台上，灯光明亮，你能从你的表演中获得的唯一积极能量就是笑声。听到人们大笑，我心想：“哦，天哪，这种感觉不一样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The laugh. Why? There's nothing better than to laugh. There's nothing better than being on stage having the bright light. And the only energy of good that you're able to take away from what you're doing is the laugh. Ha. Hearing people laugh, I was like, "Oh that feels different."</p>

主持人：为什么？

</details>

凯文·哈特：我觉得我在做一件好事。如果我能让人们感觉更好，能点亮他们的一天，那就是在做好事。这意味着我像是某种牧羊人。我有责任让人们感觉更好。哦，我的天。这意味着如果成功，我可以把人们带到一个目的地，大家可以分享一个时刻，一阵欢笑，并且都与我有关。哦，我的天，这可以走向全球，可以变得更大。这一切都始于笑声，始于舞台。

I am responsible for making people feel better. Oh my god. That means in success I can bring people to one destination and everybody can share a moment and a laugh and all relate that it came from me. Oh my god, this can get global. This can get bigger. Well, this is starting to change now. Oh wow. Wait, this has opened up doors for me to do this or that or this or that. It all started with the laugh. It all started with the stage.</p>

### 职业生涯曲线图：从默默无闻到商业帝国

主持人：如果你的职业生涯是一张图表，你会怎么画？这里是18岁，你现在46岁。这个轴是成功，这个轴是年龄。你能画一条线来展示……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you draw me a picture? If your career was a graph? Okay. So, I'm going to say here is 18 years old and you're 46 now. This is the axis of this graph and on this axis we have let's say success and on this axis we have age. Can you draw me a p a line that shows how how</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：成功和年龄？好的。对我来说，成功，也就是知道自己想做什么，从这里开始。然后是想办法赚钱，靠讲笑话养活自己。我们在这里停滞了一段时间，一条平线。我能让人笑，能进一些喜剧俱乐部，但报酬只有食物。但后来奇怪的事情发生了，你开始发现，哦等等，这里有机会了。我周末可以赚钱，每个场子能赚20到25美元。所以，我不再只做一个场子，我一个周末能做到25到28场。

<details>

Like, I'm I mean, I'm making people laugh. I'm I'm getting in some comedy clubs, but you only get paid with food. But then something weird happens where you start figuring out, oh wait, here's kind of where the spots come in. I can make money on the weekends and I can get 20 to $25 a spot. So rather than doing one spot, I would do, let's just say in a weekend, I got to the point where I was doing 25 to 28 sets.</p>

凯文·哈特：我开始每周赚500美元，400美元。我每天从费城开车到纽约。因为这样，你就有机会参加喜剧节了。好的，现在曲线开始向上，因为我参加了喜剧节。天哪，我参加了喜剧节。就在那时，业界注意到了我。“这个新人是谁？这个充满活力的人是谁？”于是我开始参加各种会议，然后我得到了一个“持有协议”。曲线再往上一点。我想是ABC电视台，他们给了我大概25万美元。他们把你“持有”，希望你能带来点什么。结果什么也没发生。所以我们又回到了平线。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I started making 500 $500 a week. $400 a week. So, I was driving from Philadelphia to New York every day. But because of that, now you got to get into a comedy festival. All right. So, now let's start to go here because we did these spots for a while. But then I got in a comedy festival. Oh I got in a comedy festival. But that's when the industry saw me. Who's this new guy? Who's this guy with all this energy? This guy here, he's got something. All right. So, I started meetings, general meetings, and now I get a holding deal. So, let's go up a little bit. I think it was ABC. They gave me like 250 grand. So, they're holding you in hopes they get something. Nothing happens. So, we're flatlining here.</p>
</details>

现在，我只是等着电话响。如果我想创造自己的东西呢？创作一个节目。哦天哪，节目被选中了。我再创作一个，他们决定做。天哪，这里面有规律。我可以随心所欲地做。我可以像在纽约跑场子一样对待这件事。我走了，搬到洛杉矶去。没计划，什么都没有。平线。我到了那里，但情况很奇怪，我不喜欢这里的工作，接不到活。我决定上路巡演，我要成为头牌艺人。我演了很长很长时间，直到我能卖光喜剧俱乐部的票。

<p class="english-text">Now, I'm just waiting for the phone to ring. That's how this works. What if I want to create my own thing? Create a show. Oh my god. Show gets picked up. I create something else. They decide to do it. Oh there's a pattern. I can do that as much as I want. I can treat that just how I was treating the spots and stuff in New York. I'm out. I'm moving to LA. No plan, no nothing. Flatline. I'm here. I just did it. I just came and moved out. man. This is weird. I don't like this work. I'm not getting no work, man. This is is real stagnant. I'm going on the road. I want to I want to work the road. I'm going to be a headliner. I worked that for a very long time. Right. Very, very long time to the point where now I'm selling out comedy clubs.</p>
</details>

卖光喜剧俱乐部后，我们从俱乐部转向剧院。然后曲线再次上升。剧院也很快卖光了。天哪。我们从剧院转向体育馆。威尔·派克，他说：“我有一本书想拍成电影，叫《像男人一样思考》，史蒂夫·哈维写的。我觉得你太搞笑了，我一直在关注你的巡演。我想让你当主角。”我们拍了这部电影，《像男人一样思考》票房达到了九千多万美元。然后威尔说：“嘿，伙计，跟你合作很愉快。我们再做点别的吧。我有一部电影叫《一路前行》，你和艾斯·库伯会很棒。”砰！《一路前行》票房一亿四千万。电影一部接一部地火了，《中央情报局》，我和巨石强森。一切发生得太快了。

<p class="english-text">After I started selling out comedy clubs, my person at the time was like, "Yo, we can probably do theaters. You're adding a lot of shows." The next stage of success, right, was let's go from comedy clubs to theaters. All right. Boom. Let's go here. Then let's go up again. Theaters start selling out real quick. Oh, Let's go from theaters, right, to like arenas. Oh Will Packer, he was like, "I got this book that I want to make a movie. It's called Think Like a Man. Steve Harvey wrote it. I think you're funny as hell. I've been tracking you on tour. I want you to be the star." We film it. Think Like a Man comes out. Think Like a Man did 90 something million dollars in the box office. And Will says, "Hey man, working with you is great. Let's do something else. I got this movie called Ride Along. You and Ice Cube would be great." Boom. Ride Along does 140. Like the movies just started to pow, get hard, central intelligence, me and the rock. I mean, it just happened so fast.</p>
</details>

电影成功的同时，我想，我应该如何创造自己的机会来源？人们不断给我带来机会，我如何创造自己的机会？我要开一家制作公司。我需要开始开发项目。然后我说，让我们成立Heartbeat Ventures，做一个**VC**（Venture Capital: 风险投资）吧。天哪，我创造了很多东西。嘿，我周围的这些实体，都是因为我的名气。我的名气让我能进入这些房间，建立关系，为自己创造交易和长期收入的机会。我如何获得更多这样的机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now because the movies are working, I'm like, this is so cool. But while this is happening, I should figure out like how to kind of create my own source of like opportunity. Like people keep bringing opportunities to me. How do I create my own source of opportunity? I'm gonna start a a production company. I need to start developing. But now I'm like, I created that. Let's create something else. So then I say, let's go like Heartbeat Ventures and let's do a VC. Oh man, I'm creating a bunch of stuff. Hey, these entities around me, it's all happening because my likeness. My likeness allows me to get in these rooms and start relationships and put myself in a position to make deals and create long-term revenue. How do I get more of that?</p>
</details>

就像纳斯卡赛车，人们会依附于他们认为表现最好的赛车。我就是一辆赛车。我应该有品牌合作。大通银行、DraftKings、Fablettics。我应该有自己的品牌和业务，为长期收入创造更多机会。比如Gran Coramino龙舌兰酒。现在，我掌握了商业、控制权和所有权的概念，并将其与凯文的驱动力、娱乐性和知名度结合起来。利用这些优势进入我可能不那么知名或强大的领域，但一旦我融入这些环境，我就可以为他们带来价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Like NASCAR, people attach themselves to the car they think is doing the best. I'm a car. I should have brand partnerships. Chase, DraftKings, Fablettics. I should have my own brands and businesses that I'm building where more opportunity for long-term revenue can present itself. Grand Cormino, wine, spirits. Now, oh wow, I've grabbed this concept of business control ownership and mirrored it with Kevin's drive and entertainment and visibility. Leverage that to get me into the rooms where I may not be as visible or as strong, but once I'm embedded into these environments, I can bring them value.</p>
</details>

现在，我回顾过去，回到我不太专注、不思考生活、不思考事物如何关联的时候。我现在能够运用我妈妈教给我的那些课程。所有美好的事情都在它们该发生的时候发生。但现在，我的心态已经足够沉稳和成熟，我明白，我不想开始一件我不会完成的事情。所以，如果我要把自己置于做这些事情的位置，我如何确保我的合作伙伴知道我愿意付出我的全部？我如何展示我不会放弃？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now I go way back here to when I was like not really focusing, not thinking about life, not thinking about how things connect. I'm now able to tap into the lessons that my mom gave. And I'm like, all good things that happen happen when they're supposed to. But now I'm poised and polished enough with a mindset that understands, well, I don't want to start something that I'm not going to finish. So, if I'm going to put myself in position to do these things, how do I make sure that my partners know I'm willing to give my all? How do I show that I'm not going to quit?</p>
</details>

回到过去，我妈妈最大的教训是，你不准放弃。如果你开始了，你就要完成它。所以，我如何让我现在的合作伙伴，那些我说服他们与我合作的人，如何让Netflix确信，当你得到我时，你得到的是100%的我，我永远不会放弃。我将完成所有的事情。这就是我的图表。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Which back here, my mom's biggest lesson was, you're not quitting. If you start it, you're going to finish it. So, how do I make my partners that I'm now saying you should work with me? How do I make Netflix secure and knowing that when you get me, you get 100% of me and I'm never going to quit. I'm going to finish it all. That's my graph.</p>
</details>

### 在无人相信时，如何坚持下去？

主持人：我对图表有些疑问。我好奇的是你18岁时最初那段停滞期。因为我的很多听众，可能大部分人，都在他们的职业生涯中处于某种停滞时刻。他们可能喜欢自己做的事，但那并不能支付账单。没人相信他们。当你回顾人生的这个阶段时，那是一个怎样的时期，你是如何度过的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've got some questions about the graph. So, I guess the parts that I'm curious about are this initial period when you're 18 where like nothing's really happening because so many of my listeners, probably most of them are in some pursuit or sort of professional endeavor in their life in this kind of stagnant moment where maybe they enjoy it, but like it ain't paying the bills. No one believes in them. Maybe some of their friends are rolling their eyes when they tell them what they're doing. When you look back on this season of life, like what is that season and how do you how'd you get through it?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：当我说我要成为一名喜剧演员时，没人相信我有趣。他们会说：“你很有趣，但不是喜剧演员那种有趣。”我的朋友们会说：“是啊，你说你要上台是什么意思？”“我的意思是我要上台，我要成为一名喜剧演员。”“天哪，怎么做？像艾迪·墨菲那样吗？”“是的，我要成为一名喜剧演员。”“是啊，但你永远成不了艾迪·墨菲。”“我知道，但我的意思是，我要去做。我要成为一个明星。”“不，我不知道，伙计。关于明星这事我不太确定。我觉得你疯了。”没有人像你一样对你为自己做的决定有信心。所以，如果你在初期阶段等待别人的认同，那可能来，也可能不来。如果它不来，那不应该阻止你坚持下去。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nobody believed that I was funny when I said I was going to be a comedian. Like they were like, "You funny but not comedian funny." Like my friends were, "Yeah, what do you mean you gonna get on stage? What do you mean I'm going to get on stage? I'm going be a comedian." G like how? Like Eddie Murphy. Like I'm going be a comedian. Yeah, but you're never going to be Eddie Murphy. Yeah, I know. But I'm I'm saying like I'm going to do it. Like I'm going to be I'm be a star. No, I don't know, man. I don't know about the whole star thing. I think you're tripping. Nobody has the confidence in the decisions that you're making for yourself like you do. So if you're waiting for that to connect in the beginning stages, it may or may not. If it doesn't, it shouldn't prevent you from like following through on whatever the the line of like go is for you.</p>

钱从来不会来得很快。我们今天所处的时代，这一代人找到了我们前所未见的创业赚钱方式。社交媒体这台机器，以及这一代人如何利用它来寻找收入和所有权，是令人难以置信的。那在我的时代是不存在的。我们只有挣扎，而挣扎让你日复一日地坐在客厅里想：“这到底是怎么回事？”

That didn't exist. We didn't have the like in in my time. We didn't have that. We just had the struggle and the struggle left you with days of like literally sitting in the living room going, "What the heck man?"</p>

### 见证别人的高光时刻，耐心等待自己的机会

凯文·哈特：我记得有一次在BET喜剧奖颁奖典礼上，我只是个观众。那时我虽然有过一些机会，但都不太成功。我记得卡特·威廉姆斯在台上的表演，他穿着一套豹纹西装，彻底引爆了全场。观众疯狂起立鼓掌。我记得当时坐在观众席里，心想，就是这个。就是那种感觉，那种反应，那种呐喊，那个时刻。我必须耐心等待，因为我的时刻终将到来。我见证了他的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember being at the the BET Comedy Awards and I'm in I'm in attendance and this is like you know I'd had a couple of shots at some things but they just you know it wasn't the things weren't sticking like the the the pilots I thought were going to hit weren't going to hit the the things that I thought were going to happen, they just weren't. And I remember Cat Williams set during the BET Comedy Awards, he had like a leopard suit, destroyed, destroyed the Comedy Awards, destroyed this moment. And audience goes crazy, stands up. I remember being in the audience and I was like, that's it. I say like that's the that's the thing. that thing, that reaction, that roar, that moment. I got to be patient because my moment is going to come. I witnessed his moment.</p>
</details>

在那一刻，我的收获是，他为那个时刻做好了准备。他的素材、笑话，一切都恰到好处。我不是以嫉妒或愤怒的心情观看，而是想，就是这样。你不知道那个时刻何时会到来，但我坚持做这件事，因为我知道那个时刻会来。当我在那个时刻，如果我能把它做得完美，一切都会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in that moment, my takeaway was that he was ready for the moment. his material, the the jokes, everything, it all hit. And I didn't watch it in a in a manner of like jealous or angry. I was like that that's it. You don't know when the moment is presenting itself, but I'm staying with the thing because I know that the moment is going to come. And when I'm in the moment, if I knock that moment out the park, all things will change. But you may not know it. You may not know when the moment comes.</p>

凯文·哈特：沙克的全明星喜剧秀。我压轴出场，表演了我有史以来最好的段子之一。演出结束时，我说了晚安，然后他们做了一个慢动作的离场镜头。我走着，观众起立，疯狂欢呼。我记得当时观众席里明星云集。而就在那个时刻，卡特也在观众席里。他只是作为粉丝在那里看演出。我迎来了一个时刻，那个时刻像把我从大炮里发射了出去。如果我没有为那个时刻做好准备，我就不会知道后来发生的一切。

It's a slow motion thing and it's like I'm I'm walking, the crowd stands up and they're going crazy. By the way, I don't know the slow motion walkoff is going to happen in the edit of the special, but I remember in real time crowds standing up, stars were there. Everybody was there, right? And in that moment, Cat was in the audience. The Shacks Allstar Comedy Jam and Cat was watching the show. He was just there as a fan, but at this time everything big is happening. And I had a moment and that was the moment that then took me and shot me out the cannon. And if I wasn't prepared for the moment and I wouldn't have known all the things to come.</p>

### 十三年的训练：为何多数人半途而废

主持人：从你第一次做单口喜剧到迎来你的高光时刻，大约花了12、13年。我觉得这很神奇，因为大多数人不愿意为了一件事坚持13年而看不到结果。如果有人告诉你需要13年才能成功，几乎没人会参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So about 12, 13 years from the moment you did your first sort of standup event to you having your moment. And I find that fascinating cuz those 13 years most people aren't willing to do something for 13 years without their moment showing up. If they told you that it would take 13 years for you to have your moment, almost nobody would take part.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：没人会。而那13年就是你的训练。斯库特·布劳恩有一次告诉我，让他与众不同的是他愿意在一件事情上付出的努力。他说，如果他们为能打中棒球界最好投手投出的快球的人提供一百万美元，每个人都会去尝试，因为每个人都想要那一百万美元。第一天，排队打球的人会人山人海。人们会上前，三振出局，然后他们会说：“该死，结束了。”没有多少人会在失败后重新排队再试一次。他说：“我会一直排队。你会发现队伍会越来越短，因为有太多人退出，选择不再等待和做这件难事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nobody. No. and those 13 years of your training. I mean, so Scooter Braun told me one time, he was like, what makes him different is the work that he's willing to do in something. And he was like, you know, if they were giving out like a million dollars for somebody that can hit a fast ball pitch, you know, from a from the best pitcher in baseball, right? And this thing will basically require everybody everybody's going to go and try to hit this because everybody wants the million dollars. So the first day of the announcement, the line to hit this pitch is going to be droves, right? Like I mean millions of people, who knows how many people would be in this line and people would go up and strike out and after that they would go, "Damn, it's over." like I missed. Not many people would like miss and then go stand back in line to go hit the ball again. He was like, I'm going to keep getting in line. What you'll find is that the line will get smaller and smaller because of how many people are dropping out and optioning not to wait and do the hard thing again.</p>
</details>

这个比喻和这种理解方式，与生活非常契合。没有多少人愿意熬过13年的艰难困苦。大多数人在第二年、也许第三年就退出了，因为没钱或其他原因。他们会想：“我需要找点别的事情做。”到了第六年：“去他的，这太蠢了。我到底在做什么？”他们会去找捷径或快速回报，因为对大多数人来说，归根结底就是钱。钱在哪里？我怎么赚钱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That comparison and that world of understanding is like something that equates to life very well, right? Not many people are going to wait through the 13 years of like hardship. Most people opt out at year two, maybe three, no money, whatever. I need to figure something else out. Year six, screw this man. Stupid. What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Right? I'm going to go find the quick avenue or the quick return because money is the that's what it boils down to for most people. Where's the money? Where am I making the money?</p>

### 专注的力量：T型人才的成功之道

主持人：我注意到很多年轻创业者，尤其是那些不成功的，他们会同时做17件事。他们认为做更多的事情会增加成功的概率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I notice this a lot with young entrepreneurs, especially those that aren't having success. They start one thing. Well, they when they come and tell you what they do, they tell you 17 things. And they think that more doing more things is increasing the probability of success.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：百分之百，但事实恰恰相反。你应该把你100%的精力和专注投入到你真正想做的那件事情上，去完成它。之后，你才能剖析它，吸取好的、坏的经验，然后要么重新开始改进它，要么决定去做别的事情。但前提是你完成了。我做出的选择是，单口喜剧是我要完成的事情。我选择成为一名优秀的喜剧演员和头牌艺人，如果我专注并把它做好，那就会为我打开大门，让我去做所有其他我想做的事情。如果我没有这个基础，我怎么能指望进入其他领域呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">100% where it's the opposite. It's the it's the thing that you actually thought of that you are going to put 100% of your mind and focus into to complete. And then after that, you're able to pick it apart and take the good, the bad, the whatever and either restart that thing again to improve it or make a decision to do something else. But you finished. I made the choice that standup comedy was what I was going to finish. I made a choice that becoming a good comic and a good headliner, if I focused and did it well, that would open up the doors for me to do everything else that I want to do. If I don't have that, how do I expect to get in?</p>
</details>

主持人：我曾和Snapchat的埃文聊过，他谈到了T型人才。就是你对很多事情有广泛的了解，但在某一个特定领域有非常深入的专长。那个专长就像一个螺丝，能让你进入各个行业。对我来说，最初是市场营销，我利用那份深厚的专业知识创办了这家媒体公司。我能进入股市，也是因为他们非常需要了解市场营销。正是那份在一个领域的深厚专长，成了我在所有这些有趣的场合中的筹码。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I was speaking to Evan at Snapchat and he was talking about T-shaped people. So you have like a broad understanding of of a lot of things, but then you're like really deep on one particular thing. And that one particular thing is almost I guess you could see as like screw that gets you into the industries. So for me, mine would have originally been marketing, but I was able to use that like deep expertise to then launch this media business cuz it's still the same game of marketing that I did for for 15 years. I was able to go into like the stock market because they really needed to understand marketing. And it was that deep expertise in one thing that was my leverage in all of these really interesting rooms.</p>

### 揭开帷幕：富人的金钱游戏

主持人：在你从一个普通背景的孩子成长起来的过程中，你并不知道所有这些富人都在幕后玩着金钱游戏。我以前以为赚钱的方式就是在麦当劳工作，努力工作，也许能成为经理。然后，大概27岁时，我坐在一个亿万富翁的厨房里，看着他在打电话，他和他的朋友在公司**IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股）前交易了五千万，这样他们就能拿到更好的价格。我当时想，天哪。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Coming from a kid that came from a very normal background, was was born in Africa, moved to the UK, mother's Nigerian, dad's English, and didn't know that all these like rich people were back here playing money games. I thought the way you make money is you like work in McDonald's, you like work really hard, you might become manager, D. And then at like I'm going to say 27 being sat in a billionaire's kitchen and watching him on the phone and he's calling his boy and they're doing 50 million just before the IPO happens so that they get a better price and I'm thinking hell.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我意识到一件事，当你看看那些最大的投资者，你会发现他们都在一起。他们中没有一个人是单独投资新事物的。他们都觉得：“有你一起更好，所以和我一起做吧。”“那加里呢？”“对，也叫上加里，看看能不能让他加入。”你会发现，这10个人，每个人都可以轻易地单干，但他们不相信单打独斗，而是选择联合这台由卓越头脑组成的机器，去创造另一个伟大的机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's all it the the the thing that I've realized right when you look at your biggest investors right you'll find that they're all together. None of them are investing in the new thing alone. They all are like, "Well, it's better with you, so do it with me." Well, what about Gary? Yeah, call Gary, too. Let's see if we can get him in here. You'll find that this group of 10 people all who could easily do something on their own do not believe in the struggles of self when you can combine this machine of great minds to provide another great opportunity and in success.</p>

这整个风险投资、公司创建的业务，无论是科技、生活方式还是健康领域，都不重要。你会注意到，那些从底层做起的人，现在正经营着今天的新公司。而他们手下的人才，将是明天经营公司的头脑。这不像火箭科学。一旦你进入了幕后，你就会恍然大悟：“哦，原来如此。”

And now the source of personnel that's underneath it will be the minds running the company of tomorrow. It's not like rocket science. Once you're behind the curtain once you go, "Oh shit."</p>

### 敢于提问：从投资小白到商业巨擘

凯文·哈特：我曾经坚信没人能骗走我的钱。你要把钱放到哪里去？不，我的钱就放在床底下。我才不干呢。你想让我给你钱，然后你告诉我你能把那钱变成什么？好吧，去找别的傻瓜吧，这事在我这儿行不通。我来自一个“万物皆骗局”的世界。但当你开始问：“股市到底是怎么运作的？”或者“投资到底是怎么回事？”或者“你说的睡觉也能赚钱是什么意思？”你不能害怕说出你的无知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was a firm believer that nobody's stealing my money and giving you nothing. Yeah. You going to go and put it where? Yeah. No, my money going to stay right here under my bed. I'm not doing that. So give you you want me to give you money and you telling me you going to get you going to take that money and then that money is going to turn into what? Yeah. Okay. Go find you another idiot cuz it ain't happening over here, buddy. I come from the world of everything is a scam. But when you go, you say, "Well, how does the stock market really work?" Or, "How does investing really work?" Or, "What do you mean you make money while you sleeping?" What does that mean? you you can't be afraid to like verbalize your ignorance.</p>
</details>

更大的问题是，很多人因为没有安全感，对自己不懂的事情保持沉默，好像总有一天会有人走过来说：“嘿，你看起来需要了解这个。”这种事永远不会发生。你永远不会碰巧遇到一个人，随机谈论你希望了解更多知识的那些事情。信息不是免费的，但它是可以获得的。获取它并不难，难的是那些因为没有安全感而不敢说出“我不知道从哪里获取”的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and the bigger problem, which I'm sure a lot of your viewers have, is like insecurely like just being quiet about the stuff that they don't know as if you're going to figure it out because someday, one day, somebody's going to go, "Hey, you look like you need to know." It'll never happen that way. It's never going to happen. You're never going to run into a person who's randomly going to talk about the things that you wish you had more knowledge in. It will never happen. And what you'll find is that information is not free, but it's available. It's not actually hard to obtain. It's only hard to people that are very insecure about just verbalizing I don't know where to get it.</p>

### 去情绪化：商业决策中的铁律

主持人：你是如何建立一个依赖于人的帝国的，尤其是当你天生不具备那些信息，可能还有信任问题时？你将不得不信任很多人来管理你的财富、你的生意和你孩子的遗产。我听过太多“我信了一个人，结果失去了一切”的故事。

<p class="english-text">How does one build an empire that relies on people when they naturally don't come from a place of that information? So they they might have trust issues like you were referring to these kind of trust issues like wait a minute, you're trying to steal my money. You're going to have to be trusting a lot of other people with your wealth, with your business, and with your with your children's inheritance. And I hear so many of these stories of I trusted a guy and I lost everything.</p>

凯文·哈特：在商业中，你会发现情绪可能是你最糟糕的资产。在商业中带有情绪，对生意本身毫无益处。我越是能够将自己的情绪从“想要”的世界中剥离出来，并理解我所做的一切都是为了让公司处于更有利的位置，以及为了那些辛勤工作帮助公司走到今天的人们，我就越成功。我对他们也负有责任。

<p class="english-text">But in business, what you'll find is that the emotions can be your like can be your worst asset. Having emotions in business attached to business can be everything but beneficial to the business. So the more that I was able to detach my emotions from the world of want and understand that the things that I'm doing are to better position the business and the people that have worked so hard to help this business get to where it is today. I have a service to them as well.</p>

我曾经因为无知而相信别人，结果被利用。我的无知不代表我懒惰，而是代表我相信你。我不知道要去二次确认，或者雇人去二次确认，去给我看那些细则。但后来我学会了去除情绪。我会找人看看这份文件，只是为了确保它就是它所说的那样。对方可能会说：“我不会骗你的。”“我知道，但这只是出于商业的最佳利益，为了确保我自己的团队看过，并且能确认你刚才说的话，确保我正确理解了。”这不针对你，这只是我现在处理商业事务的一种做法。它从来都不是私人的。

<p class="english-text">My ignorance doesn't mean that I'm lazy. My ignorance means that I believe you. And I don't know to second guessess or second check or to hire or onboard people to second guess to second check to show me fine print fine line because it's impossible. go back to the emotions and why I say emotions had to be removed. I'm going to have somebody look at this just so I know that it is what it is. I wouldn't lie to you. I know. But it's in the best nature of business just for me to make sure that my eyes that I have lay eyes on it and they can just say what you just said but just make sure I understand it correctly. Yeah. But you don't have to do that. It's nothing against you. It's just a practice that I have within the way that I now approach business and anything that you do. It's never personal.</p>

### 雄心的代价与幸福的真谛

主持人：但代价是什么呢？他们说人生不可能拥有一切，尤其是在同一时间。这种追求的代价是什么？

<p class="english-text">What's the cost though? Because you know, you're incredibly successful. You've got all this empire of companies and businesses and ventures you've started.

<p class="english-text">If your life ended now, God forbid. Do do you think if you if you found out today that it was ending, you would reflect on it and say, do you know, I think I might have had things in the wrong order, would there be any mis prioritization in hindsight if today was the day?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：如果生命今天结束，我可以安然地翘起二郎腿，坦然接受。是时候了。我做得很好。我尽了最大努力去施展自己。我尽力把我爱的人放在一个更好的位置，让他们能看到更多，做更多。我的姓氏和家族名声今天比昨天更响亮。我能够更好地看待和理解这个世界，因为我有幸旅行并遇到了那么多人。我是一个正能量的源泉，通过我所做的一切将人们更紧密地联系在一起。所以，一切都是相连的。我没问题。如果它停止了，就停止了。我不能接受的是，当我拥有健康的身体、敏锐的头脑时，却浪费时间。

<p class="english-text">If life ended today, I could cross my legs comfortably and be okay. That it's that it's time. I did it correctly. I made sure that I applied myself to the best of my ability. I tried my best to put those that I loved in a better position so that they could see more and do more. My last name and my family name is much stronger today than it was yesterday. The idea of the world is something that I was able to see and understand better because I was blessed and fortunate enough to travel and meet so many people are made to like we're here to embrace, we're here to love, we're here to like share. I was an energy source of good to bring people closer together through all things that I've done. So, it all connects. And I'm okay. I'm okay with if it stopped, it stopped. What I'm what I'm not okay with is while I have the bandwidth of good health, great mind, strong like mind concept and I can I can go I can do it. I can get there. I'm not okay with wasting that time.</p>

### 成为一个好男人的现代挑战

主持人：成为一个男人是件令人困惑的事。我认为对许多人来说，现在比以往任何时候都更困惑。我们经常谈论男性气概危机，男性的男性朋友比以往任何时候都少。

<p class="english-text">What about being a man? It's it's confusing. I think it's more confusing than ever for many to be a man. And we often talk about this masculinity crisis where men have less men male friends than ever before.</p>

主持人：对于年轻人来说，成为一个好男人需要什么，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What advice have you got for for young men on in terms of like what it takes to be a a good man?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我认为今天“好男人”的定义非常模糊。我是在领导力或领袖精神的基础上被抚养长大的。我父亲晚年充满了责任感。他会说：“我知道我没做什么。我知道我犯了什么错，也知道我本应做得更好。我无法改变那些事，但我希望能努力成为最好的祖父。”他在那一刻的责任感，是我对我父亲记忆最深、也最爱的一点。因为他的领导力，或者说缺乏领导力，让我能够说，我不想那样做，我想这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I think the definition of a of a good man is so foggy today. I was raised on a foundation of a leader or leadership. And I think, you know, rest in peace to my dad. It's messed up of a road that my dad had. My dad's like later years were driven from accountability. I'm aware of what I didn't do. I'm aware of the mistakes that I made and I'm aware of what I should have did much better. I can't change those things, but I would love to try to be the best grandfather or grandparent that I can be. His accountability in that moment is what I remember the most about my father and love the most. Because leadership or lack thereof put me in a position to say I don't want to do that. I want to do this.</p>
</details>

现在我有了两个儿子。我想确保我给儿子们树立的男人榜样是领导力、责任感和担当。我不反对情绪，但我也深知每个人都有自己的问题。你觉得全世界最重的担子在你肩上，但可能还不及别人担子的零头。分享你的情绪、有机会表达或卸下它们非常重要，但你也要知道，在一个弱肉强食的世界里，软弱有时会被利用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now I got two boys. I want to make sure that my example of man to my to my sons, it's leadership, responsibility, it's accountability, emotions. I'm not against emotions, but but I am also I am a student of everybody has problems. Nobody there's not a shortage of problems. So the weight of the world that you feel is the heaviest for you may not come close to what the weight of the world is for you. And I think in sharing your emotions and having an opportunity to voice or offload them extremely important but you also in a world where you know weakness can at some point in time be taken advantage of. Right?</p>

### 终极建议：走出你的舒适区

主持人：我们有一个结束传统，上一位嘉宾会为下一位留下一个问题。留给你的问题是：成年后得到的哪条建议对你的人生产生了最重大的影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kevin, we have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves a question for the next, not knowing who they're leaving it for. The question left for you is, what is the advice you got as an adult that had the most significant impact on your life?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我得说最好的建议来自克里斯·洛克。在我喜剧生涯的早期，他告诉我：“你不能只想让你街区的人笑。世界比你的街区或社区大得多。走出国门，想办法让全世界都笑，喜剧才会变得更好。”在那之前，我的素材非常具体，比如“你们街区的药店太疯狂了”。但不是每个人都能感同身受。如何拓宽它？如何让它开放，让你无论走到世界何处，人们都能笑，而你永远不必调整你的素材？走出国门。用更宏大的方式思考你的技艺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to go to best the best piece of advice came from Chris Rock where Chris Rock told me early in my comedy career. He says his exact word is you don't just want to make people laugh. the world is so much bigger than your block or your neighborhood. He said, "Get out the country. Get out the country and figure out a way to make the world laugh and comedy will be so much better." At that point, I was very like specific in my material. 15, you know, we got these the this drugstore is crazy. YOU EVER HAD A GUY IN THE DRUGSTORE IN YOUR BLOCK? AND IT'S LIKE, WELL, everybody doesn't relate or can't relate. How do you broaden it? How do you how do you open it up so that you're never changing your material or who you are? Everywhere you go in the world, people can laugh and you never have to adjust. Get out the country. Get bigger in the way you're thinking about your craft.</p>

### 学会“关机”：在高压下保持理智

主持人：你有没有为自己的心理健康挣扎过？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you struggled with your mental health?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：没有。我的问题更多是压力，而不是挣扎。我知道我做得太多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. No. I think I told you my issue is like more more stress. It's not a struggle. It's like I know I do too much.</p>

主持人：那是什么症状？你感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the symptom of that? How do you feel? Like</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：你必须关机。我现在越来越擅长的是，在一天中的某个时刻，我就关机了，不碰手机。我知道我答应了他们要打电话，就告诉他们我明天或后天再打。但一天中总有一个时刻，我会觉得：“好了，今天就到这里了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to like you have to shut down. So like what I'm getting better at is in a day there's time I just don't I'm off the phone. I got it. I know I told him I would do calls. Just tell them I'll start that tomorrow or the day after. But like there's a there's a time where I get to a point in the day where I'm like, "Okay, that oh that's it for me. You're done."</p>
</details>

主持人：所以你一遍又一遍地把自己推到极限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're pushing yourself right up to the edge over and over and over and over again.</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我每天都会到一个临界点，而我关机的时间线越来越早。以前是深夜还在打电话解决问题。现在我意识到，那不健康。健康的一面来自于片刻的宁静。你需要一些安静。独自一人在车里开车，不开音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I get to a a point in a day and that timeline of when I'm shutting off has gotten earlier and earlier, whereas before it was, you know, we hours of the night and I'm still on the phone figuring it out. and all day you just been racing and racing and racing. So I think the older that I've gotten. I've realized more and more that's not healthy. The healthy side comes with silence for a sec. Like you need you need some you need some silence. A ride in a car by yourself, no music.</p>

<p class="english-text">What happens next for you? We sit here in 10 years time, it all went well. What happened?</p>
</details>

凯文·哈特：我想，十年后，如果我能坐在一个只有30人的喜剧俱乐部的凳子上，表演段子，享受我的手艺，无论我当时住在哪里，在那些小小的、不起眼的喜剧俱乐部里，也许一周两次。然后我打高尔夫，花时间和我的孩子，希望还有他们的孩子在一起，我成了一个祖父，我们能一起翻看相册，回忆往事。而“邮箱里的钱”来自于我建立的、能自行运作的事业。那就是我版本的成功。

Uh, and I spend time with my kids and hopefully their kids and I'm a grandpop and we're able to like look through photo albums of remember when and mailbox money is attached to things that I've built that are operating and functioning on its own. That's that's my version of success.</p>
