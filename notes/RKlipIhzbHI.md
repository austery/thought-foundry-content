### 特朗普的格陵兰主张

**>>**: 这些照片从一月份开始流传，说实话，它们让很多人停下了脚步。照片显示来自法国、德国和**丹麦**等国的士兵正在**格陵兰**登陆执行任务。表面上看，这似乎是**北约**团结的展示。但与此同时，**美国**总统**唐纳德·特朗普**坚持认为，**格陵兰**——这个丹麦的半自治领土——必须属于**美国**，并且人们确实担心这可能不仅仅是口头威胁，**美国**人可能会真的采取军事行动。在他最近在**达沃斯**的演讲中，总统似乎排除了这种可能性。
“我们可能得不到任何东西，除非我决定使用过度的力量和武力，否则我们将是不可阻挡的。但我不会那样做。”
但有些人听起来更像是含蓄的威胁，而不是保证。现在，特朗普说他与**北约**秘书长达成了协议框架。目前尚不清楚这具体涉及什么，盟友们仍然感到不安。**美国**入侵**格陵兰**曾是不可想象的。现在，**北约**国家必须在一个被自己成员国威胁的世界中航行。那么问题来了，世界上最强大的联盟之一能否经受住这场风暴？今天我们将深入探讨这场危机。对**北约**来说，真正面临风险的是什么？这对全球安全意味着什么？但首先，**北约**的基础是集体安全理念。根据**《北大西洋公约》第五条**，对一个成员国的攻击被视为对所有成员国的攻击，旨在威慑外部威胁。但如果威胁来自内部呢？如果一个**北约**国家攻击另一个国家呢？这是《The Rundown》。

**>>**: Photos like these started circulating in January and honestly, they stopped a lot of people in their tracks. They show soldiers from countries including France, Germany and Denmark landing in Greenland for a mission. On the surface, it looked like a show of NATO unity. But at the same time, US President Donald Trump was insisting that Greenland, the semi-autonomous Danish territory, must belong to the US, and there were real fears that this might go beyond rhetoric, that the Americans might actually take military action. In his recent speech at Davos, the president appeared to rule that out.
"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that."
But some heard it less as reassurance and more like a veiled threat. Now, Trump says he's got the framework of a deal with NATO secretary general. It's not clear yet what that involves, and allies remain rattled. A US invasion of Greenland would once have seemed unimaginable. Now NATO countries have to navigate a world in which they've been threatened by one of their own members. So the question is, can one of the world's more powerful alliances be able to weather the storm? Today we are digging into the crisis. What is really at stake for NATO, and what could it mean for global security? But first, NATO is grounded in the idea of collective security. According to Article 5, an attack on one of its 32 members is considered an attack on all that is intended to deter outside threats. But what happens if the threat comes from the inside? What if one NATO country attacks another? This is The Rundown.

### 北约的内部困境

**>>**: 在最近的一次新闻发布会上，波兰总理**唐纳德·图斯克**发出了严厉警告：一个**北约**成员国试图吞并另一个**北约**成员国的领土将是一场政治灾难。这将是我们所知的世界末日，它保证了一个基于**北约**团结的世界。多亏了**唐纳德·特朗普**对**加拿大**和**格陵兰**的威胁，**北约**现在正处于完全未知的领域。在本期《TVO》节目中，今天的系列节目将揭示，**北约**的建立是为了实现什么，以及如果一个成员国攻击另一个成员国，成员国将面临怎样的艰难抉择。
“如果某些国家不配合**格陵兰**问题，我可能会对它们征收关税，因为我们需要**格陵兰**来保障国家安全。所以我可能会这么做。”
关于**北约**在此事中的作用，这个问题有点棘手。
“我们还没有谈论**格陵兰**的资金问题。我可能会谈谈。但现在，无论他们是否喜欢，我们都要在**格陵兰**问题上采取行动。”
**北约**不擅长应对的是一个成员国攻击另一个成员国的情况。**北约**是北大西洋国家、北美和欧洲国家之间的一项军事联盟。它基于集体防御的理念。攻击一个成员国就是攻击所有成员国。因此，如果任何一个**北约**成员国遭到攻击，其他所有成员国都应前来援助。这就是为什么成员资格如此令人向往。这就是为什么**乌克兰**如此努力地争取成为**北约**的一部分，因为这种安全保障是坚不可摧的。但**北约**的整个理念是，威胁来自外部，大家联合起来对抗的是组织外部的敌人。

**>>**: At a recent news conference, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk issued a stark warning: an attempt to take over part of a NATO member state by another NATO member state would be a political disaster. It would be the end of the world as we know it, which guaranteed a world based on NATO solidarity. Thanks to Donald Trump's threats against Canada and Greenland, NATO is now in completely uncharted territory. In this episode of TVO, today's series unravelled, experts walk us through what NATO was set up to achieve and the impossible choices member countries would have to face if one of their own attacked.
"I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that."
The question of NATO's role in this is it's tricky in a way.
"We're not talking about money for Greenland yet. I might talk about that. But right now we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not."
What NATO isn't built to deal with is when one member attacks another member. NATO is a military alliance among North Atlantic states, North America and European states. That is based on the idea of collective defence. An attack on one is an attack on all. So if any of those NATO member states are attacked, then every other member is supposed to come to their defence. It's why membership is so desired. It's why Ukraine has worked so hard to try to make the case that it should be part of NATO, because that security guarantee is ironclad. But the whole idea of NATO is that the threat is outside that that attack, that everybody is in an alliance together against is external to the organisation.

**>>**: “**加拿大**将是我们第51个州的一个非常认真的竞争者。当你去掉那条人为划定的界线时，我希望看到**加拿大**成为我们的第51个州。”
**>>**: 一个**北约**国家攻击另一个国家，这种想法不在考虑之列。正是这种潜在的假设——你不必担心其他成员国——使得**北约**如此成功。我们曾经历过一个非常奇怪的**北约**情况，**北约**秘书长在椭圆形办公室会见了**特朗普**总统。
**>>**: “你对**格陵兰**被吞并的可能性以及如何实现这一目标的愿景是什么？嗯，我认为这会发生的。”
**>>**: “我之前并没有多想，但我现在正与一位可能发挥关键作用的人在一起。你知道，马克，我们为此需要国际安全，而不仅仅是‘国际安全’。”
**>>**: “当涉及到**格陵兰**时。是的。我们不会加入**美国**。我将把这个讨论排除在外，因为我不想在此指导**北约**。”
**>>**: “特朗普总统曾随口说过，出于安全原因，**格陵兰**确实应该属于我们，而且它将会是我们的。然后他转向**北约**秘书长说，你知道，我们可能需要**北约**在这方面提供帮助。这是一个令人震惊的时刻，因为你会问，这到底是怎么运作的？他为什么会这么说，这表明我们现在身处一个多么不同的世界。几个月前，如果**北约**秘书长处于这种情况，而总统对他说了这样的话，那将是头条新闻很长一段时间。而这却转瞬即逝。”
**>>**: “自特朗普开始发出这些威胁以来，不仅针对**加拿大**，也针对**丹麦**（当然，**丹麦**对**格陵兰**负有责任），我们看到的是非常、非常谨慎的外交。”
**>>**: **北约**在思维方式、军事准备方面，都未能充分应对一个国家入侵另一个国家或试图吞并另一个国家的情况。
**>>**: “我不在**布鲁塞尔**的**北约**总部走廊里，所以我不知道那里发生了什么，但我的同事们在那里需要考虑的是，他们可能想向**美国**施加多大的压力来停止这种言论，因为取决于他们施加的压力，了解**唐纳德·特朗普**是谁——他是一个喜欢别人告诉他不能做什么、不能说什么的恶霸。如果你过多地反击他，他就会带着他的玩具回家。”
**>>**: “**北约**盟友如何看待彼此？如果**美国**对我们进行某种吞并行为，欧洲国家会来支持我们吗？他们会因为担心自己相对于**俄罗斯**的安全而不愿意来援助我们吗？如果**美国**真的对**格陵兰**采取某种行动，我们会去援助**丹麦**吗？这些都是**北约**及其成员国面临的重大未知数。”

**>>**: Canada is going to be a very serious contender to be our 51st state. When you get rid of that artificially drawn line, I'd like to see Canada become our 51st state.
**>>**: The idea that one state within NATO will attack another is not part of the thinking. It's what has made NATO so successful is that underlying assumption that you didn't have to worry about the other members. We had a really odd NATO situation where the head of NATO met with President Trump in the Oval Office.
**>>**: What is your vision for the potential annexation of Greenland and getting them potentially to. Well, I think it will happen.
**>>**: And I'm just thinking I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man that could be very instrumental. You know, Mark, we need that for international security, not just Security International.
**>>**: When it comes to Greenland. Yes. We're not joining the US. I would leave that outside for me, this discussion, because I don't want to direct NATO in that.
**>>**: President Trump kind of said in passing, for security reasons, Greenland really should be ours and it will be ours. And he turned to the head of NATO and said, and, you know, we might need NATO's help on that. And it's kind of a mind blowing moment because you say, how does that even work? And why would he even say that shows you what a different world we're in now. A few months ago had the head of NATO been in that situation, and a president said that to him it would have been headline news for ages. And it just went by in a flash.
**>>**: What we've seen since Trump has started making these threats, not just against Canada, but also against Denmark, who of course is responsible for Greenland is some very, very careful diplomacy.
**>>**: NATO is not equipped, not in its thinking, not in its military preparedness to deal with one state invading another or seeking to annex another.
**>>**: I'm not in the corridors of NATO headquarters in Brussels, so I don't know what's going on in there, but what my colleagues who are there will be needing to consider is the amount of pressure they might want to bring on the United States to cease the rhetoric, because depending on the pressure they apply, knowing who Donald Trump is, which is a bully who does not like people telling him he cannot do what he would like to do and cannot say what he would like to say. If you press him back too much, he'll just take his toys and go home.
**>>**: How NATO allies think about each other. Would European states come to support us if the US did something towards annexation with us? Would they be so worried about their own security vis a vis Russia that they're unwilling to come to our assistance? Would we go to Denmark's assistance if, in fact, the US does something to make some kind of move against Greenland? Those are all big unknowns for NATO and for member states of NATO.

### 协议框架与盟友担忧

**>>**: 在**达沃斯**，总理**马克·卡尼**重申了**加拿大**对**格陵兰**和**丹麦**的支持，以及对**《北大西洋公约》第五条**的支持。
“我们对**北约**第五条的承诺坚定不移。”
但他同时也承认了其他事情。
“我认为我们显然正面临**北约**的一次考验。”
这是该联盟自近80年前成立以来面临的最严峻的考验吗？**特朗普**的威胁如何影响了北极地区的安全未来？我询问了**渥太华大学**公共与国际事务研究生院院长**罗兰·帕里斯**。**卡尔顿大学**诺曼·帕特森国际事务学院国际关系副教授**斯蒂芬妮·卡尔文**，以及《环球邮报》**渥太华**分社社长**罗伯特·费夫**。很高兴三位来到节目。罗伯特，我想先问你。正如我们提到的，**特朗普**总统上周宣布，他和**北约**秘书长**马克·鲁特**达成了一项关于未来协议的“框架”。很多人想知道这项协议具体包含什么。你能帮我们稍微解释一下吗？我们对此了解多少？
**>>**: 嗯，这和我们之前与**格陵兰**达成的协议一样，即**丹麦**和**格陵兰**仍然是**北约**的一部分。它们保持独立。**美国**人不会购买或接管**格陵兰**。但你可能会看到**美国**在现有基地上增加投资。更重要的是，我认为这将成为大陆防御导弹防御系统的一部分，**加拿大**也将参与其中。所以这曾是很多虚张声势，它动摇了**北约**联盟。它动摇了欧洲。它动摇了**加拿大**，正如他一贯所为。他是个破坏者。每当他把注意力转向任何问题时，最终，幸运的是，**北约**的欧洲成员国以及**加拿大**都站出来对抗了那个恶霸，而他退缩了。

**>>**: At Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney reiterated Canada's support for Greenland and Denmark and for Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.
"Our commitment to NATO's Article 5 is unwavering."
But he also acknowledged something else.
"I think we're clearly NATO is experiencing a test right now."
Is this the most critical test the alliance has faced since it was established almost 80 years ago? And how have Trump's threats affected the future of security in the Arctic? I asked Roland Paris, director of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa. Stephanie Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, and Robert Fife, the Globe and Mail's Ottawa bureau chief. Great to have you all three on the program. I want to start with you, Robert. As we mentioned, President Trump announced last week that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had reached a quote unquote, framework for a future deal. A lot of questions as to what that deal actually encompasses. Can you help us understand a little bit? What do we know about it?
**>>**: Well, it's the same deal we've we've already had with with Greenland, which is that Denmark and Greenland remain part of NATO. They remain independent. They don't. The Americans are not going to buy or take over Greenland. But you will probably see more US investment on base base. They already have there. And more significantly, I think it's going to be part of a continental defence missile shield, which Canada is going to participate in as well. So it was a lot of bluster, got it shook up the NATO alliance. It shook up Europe. It shook up Canada, as he always does. He's a wrecking ball. And whenever he turns his attention to any issue, at the end of the day, fortunately, the European members of NATO as well as Canada stood up to the bully and he backed down.

**>>**: “罗兰，我想让你来谈谈特朗普。你认为特朗普抵达欧洲后，他的任务为何改变了？这似乎与我们最初的预期有所不同。但它为何改变了呢？”
**>>**: “嗯，我不认为他的任务改变了。我认为他调整了他的策略，我猜是因为他学到了，并且看到了对他在**格陵兰**问题上的压力存在实际的阻力，真正的阻力正在形成。我说他的任务没有改变，是因为我不认为他会放弃争取**格陵兰**的尝试。你知道，这和**明尼阿波利斯**的‘冰’（注：此处原文可能为口误，或指代特定事件，翻译时保留原意或根据上下文推测，此处暂不翻译具体词汇，仅保留上下文）所发生的事情有相似之处。在**明尼阿波利斯**街头发生了一起可怕的杀人事件。突然间，关于**美国**‘冰’的讨论发生了转变。特朗普的一些最亲密的盟友开始表达他们的担忧。他达到了一个点，面临真正的阻力，然后他进行了调整。他改变了他的措辞。他改变了将要负责的官员。他进行了一次战术上的后退。我不认为这丝毫改变了他的任务，他的任务仍然是——将**美国**转变为一个更具帝国主义色彩的力量，利用其力量榨取让步，并将盟友视为非盟友，而是客户或从属国家，它们的存在是为了被剥削，它们的资源是为了被榨取。这一点从未改变。”
**>>**: “斯蒂芬妮，罗兰提到了阻力。总统正面临许多人的阻力，其中就包括**丹麦**总理，她坚持认为**美国**在**格陵兰**军事基地的主权仍然是一条‘红线’。为什么？”
**>>**: “嗯，我认为，就像我们**加拿大人**不愿意放弃任何主权来满足**特朗普**总统的愿望一样，**丹麦**也感受到了同样的看法。事实上，我看到很多评论。**格陵兰**和**丹麦**之间长期以来一直存在很多紧张关系。**格陵兰**有一个独立运动，奇怪的是，这反而将双方团结起来，因为他们都担心自己的主权。所以，就像我们不愿意放弃，我不知道，**巴芬岛**或类似的东西一样。我认为这就是**丹麦**的立场。而且，在**北约**秘书长**马克·鲁特**与**特朗普**总统的讨论之后，**丹麦**方面确实有很多不满，他们说，听着，有这个宣布，我们没有被咨询，这是我们的领土。所以我想，是的，有这个协议。但我想说的是，第一，显然**丹麦**仍然关心，并且有明显的既得利益。第二，**特朗普**总统，你知道，对他来说，协议不是协议，对吧？协议只是他情绪的波动。我认为，你知道，这一切在很大程度上取决于，你知道，他对国内或国际上各种事情的态度，这真的取决于谁是最后一个和他待在房间里的人。对吧？所以我认为总有竞争去争取。而且，你知道，是的，这个协议被宣布了。但我们本周末看到，例如，在**特朗普**的社交媒体平台**Truth Social**上，他发布了他在北极与企鹅合影的照片，这很有趣，因为北极根本没有企鹅。对吧？但就这样了。所以我的意思是，我认为这还没有结束。我仍然认为会有紧张局势。在很大程度上，我们本周确实看到了一些**北约**秘书长的担忧。你知道，当他向**欧洲议会**发表演讲时，他基本上表示，我们必须让**美国**留在**北约**，并且需要就**格陵兰**问题达成某种协议。所以我只是认为这还没有结束。我认为这将是继续主导2026年的一件事。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Well, Roland, I want to bring you in here talking about Trump. Why do you think Trump's mission changed when he landed in Europe? A bit of a departure from what we thought we were going to get. But why did it change?
**>>**: Well, I don't think his mission has changed. I think that he adjusted his tactics, and my guess is because he learned and he saw that there was actual resistance, real resistance building to his pressure on Greenland. And I say his mission hasn't changed because I don't think he's going to give up his attempts to secure Greenland. You know, there's a parallel here to what's happened with the the role of ice in Minneapolis. So you have a kind of horrendous killing of somebody on the street in Minneapolis. Suddenly there is a shift in the discussion about ice in the United States. Some of Trump's closest allies start expressing their concerns. He hits a point where he is facing real resistance, and he adjusts. He changes his language. He changes the officials who are going to be responsible. He makes a tactical backstep. I don't think it changes at all what his mission is, and his mission remains the the, the transformation of the United States into much more of an imperial power, using its power to extract concessions and his treatment of allies as not allies, but as clients or as as subservient countries that are there to be exploited and for their resources to be extracted. That hasn't changed.
**>>**: Stephanie Roland mentioned resistance. The president is facing resistance from a number of people, Denmark's prime minister being one, insisting that American sovereignty over military bases in Greenland remains a, quote, red line. Why?
**>>**: Well, I think in the same way that we Canadians would not want to give up any of our sovereignty to accommodate the wishes of President Trump, Denmark has felt the same way. In fact, I've seen a lot of commentary. There's been a lot of tension between Greenland and Denmark for some time. Greenland. There is an independence movement there, and strangely enough, this has actually brought the two sides together as they have been concerned about their sovereignty. So in the same way that we are, you know, would would not want to give up, I don't know, Baffin Island or anything like that there. I think this is where Denmark is. And there was a lot of resentment, actually, after the discussion between Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, and President Trump by Denmark, who said, look, it's there's been this announcement, we haven't been consulted and this is our territory. So this I guess, yes, there is this deal. But what I would suggest is one is obviously Denmark is still concerned and they have an obvious vested interest. Secondly, President Trump, you know, a deal is not a deal to him, right? A deal is just his mood swinging. And I think that, you know, a lot of this depends on, you know, his attitude towards various things going on, whether domestically or internationally, really depends on who is the last person in the room with him. Right. So I think there's this always competition to get there. And, you know, yes, there was this deal announced. But we did see this weekend, for example, on Truth Social, which is the Trump social media platform, that he was posting pictures of him being in the Arctic with penguins, which is interesting because there are no penguins in the Arctic. Right? But there we go. So I mean, like, I don't think this is over yet. I still think that there is going to be tension. And to a large extent, we did see some of the concerns by the secretary general of NATO this week. You know, when he spoke to Parliament, the European Parliament, and basically expressed that, look, we have to keep the United States in NATO and that there is going to have to be some kind of deal arranged over, over Greenland. So I just don't think this is over yet. And I think this is going to be something that really does continue to dominate 2026.

### 卡尼的达沃斯演讲

**>>**: 好的。我想播放一段**马克·卡尼**在**达沃斯**演讲的短片。我们来听听。
“我们知道，基于规则的国际秩序的故事部分是虚假的，最强者会在方便时豁免自己，贸易规则的执行是不对称的。我们也知道，国际法的适用有不同的严谨程度，取决于被告或受害者的身份。在一个大国竞争的世界里，夹在中间的国家有选择：互相竞争以获得青睐，或者联合起来创造一个有影响力的第三条道路。”
**>>**: 正如我们所知，那次演讲获得了现场观众难得的掌声。罗伯特，我想知道，你认为卡尼为什么决定在那个场合打破基于规则的国际秩序？
**>>**: 嗯，我的意思是，你必须看看参加**达沃斯**的与会者，不仅有世界领导人，还有欧洲、亚洲和**美国**非常重要的商界人士。这是一个好机会，因为他既对世界领导人讲话，也对全球的企业领导人讲话，这是一个真正引起共鸣的信息。我的意思是，他获得了起立鼓掌，我认为在某些方面这几乎是一次丘吉尔式的演讲，他阐述了**美国**以及在某种程度上**中国**是如何利用其经济实力来欺凌其他国家的。他说的很对，像欧洲、**加拿大**、**日本**和**韩国**这样的国家需要联合起来，才能在**美国**改变其‘美国优先’政策以及利用关税和经济一体化来欺凌他人的行为面前站出来。**中国**也在做同样的事情。这是一个非常重要的信息。它确实明显地惹恼了**特朗普**总统。你知道，他被**卡尼**总理抢了风头。而且，你知道，他威胁要征收100%的关税。然后，你知道，昨晚他让他的财政部长出来说，卡尼给总统打了电话，并就他在**达沃斯**所说的话进行了激烈的撤回。而总理在周二早上出来说，这绝对不是真的。我告诉总统，我坚持我所说的每一个字。然后他们继续谈论贸易问题。所以，即将到来的谈判。所以，你知道，它击中了要害。而总统的小脾气表明，它确实击中了要害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: All right. I want to play a short snippet of Mark Carney's speech in Davos. Let's have a listen.
"We knew the story of the international rules based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour, depending on the identity of the accused or the victim. In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice, compete with each other for favour or to combine to create a third path with impact."
**>>**: As we know, that speech got a rare applause from the crowd there. Robert, I want to know why do you think Carney decided that this was the stage sort of break down the international rules based order?
**>>**: Well, I mean, you have to look at the participants who go to Davos, not only world leaders, but also very significant members of the business community in Europe and Asia and in the United States. It was a good opportunity because he was speaking to both world leaders, but also corporate leaders in the world, and it was a message that really hit home. I mean, he got a standing ovation, for which I think in some ways was almost a Churchillian speech, the way he framed what the United States and to some extent China as well, have been, have been using their economic might to be able to bully other countries. And he's quite right that countries like Europe and Canada and Japan and South Korea need to band together to be able to stand up to the United States in the change in its its American first policy and its use of tariffs and economic integration to try to bully people. China is doing the same thing. It was a very important message. It really obviously it upset President Trump. You know, he was upstaged by Prime Minister Carney. And, you know, he's threatening 100% tariffs. And and then, you know, last night he's got his Treasury secretary out saying that Carney called the president and back pedalled aggressively back on what he said in Davos. And the Prime Minister on. Tuesday morning came out and said, absolutely not true. I, I told the president I stand by exactly what I said. And then they went on to talk about the trade stuff. So the negotiations that are upcoming. So, you know, it hit the mark. And the little tantrum from the president showed that it did hit the mark.

### 联盟的未来与美国角色

**>>**: 罗兰，我们知道这里有框架，但还不清楚**格陵兰**的争斗接下来会走向何方。除非你知道。但请帮助我们稍微理解一下，**北约**能挺过这次危机吗？这个联盟在这一切之后将走向何方，是否存在一些严肃的问题？你有什么看法？
**>>**: 你知道，目前很难说。我不认为会有那么一刻，会宣布‘**北约**结束了’。**北约**可以存在于纸面上，但它实际依赖的信任可能会消失。这就是军事联盟的本质。使它们有效的，是一种理念，一套理念，一种信念，即如果任何成员国受到攻击，所有成员国都会前来保卫彼此。你知道，**特朗普**对是否会在**北约**国家受到攻击时前来支持它们表示怀疑，这只是一方面。我记得他被具体问及**波兰**时，他说这取决于具体情况，而他威胁要对另一个**北约**成员国动用军事力量，这是完全不同的性质。这显然削弱了信任，但也削弱了**北约**作为一个组织的威慑作用，因为如果对手对**北约**是否会回应其成员国之一的攻击产生怀疑，那么，你知道，这可能会鼓励他们去试探这种决心是否仍然存在。而且，展望未来几年，如果**乌克兰**的战争至少暂时告一段落，**俄罗斯**就有机会重建其力量并看向别处。我将非常担心**波罗的海国家**的前景，我认为**北约**能够传达它仍然是一个基于决心和信任的联盟将非常重要。我们将看看在**特朗普**之后这是否可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Roland, as we know we have the framework here, but it's still unclear where the fight over Greenland is going to be heading next. Unless you do know. But help us understand a little bit, you know, will NATO survive this? Are there some serious questions about sort of where this alliance moves after all of this? But what are your thoughts?
**>>**: You know, it is hard to know at this point. I don't think there's going to be a moment when, you know, there's a declaration NATO is over. NATO can exist on paper, and the trust that it actually relies upon can be gone. And that's the thing about military alliances. What what makes them effective is, is an idea, a set of ideas, a belief that all of the members will come to each other's defence if any of them is attacked. And, you know, it was one thing for Trump to raise doubts about whether he would come to the support of NATO countries if they were attacked. I think he he was asked specifically about Poland, and he said it would depend on the circumstances, a very different thing for him to threaten military force against another NATO member. And that obviously weakens the trust, but it also weakens the deterrent effect of NATO as an organisation, because if there are doubts by an adversary about whether NATO would respond to an attack on any one of its members, then it, you know, it potentially invites them to test whether whether that resolve still exists. And and so looking a few years down the line, if the war in Ukraine comes to at least temporary conclusion, Russia has an opportunity to rebuild its forces and think, look elsewhere. I would be very concerned about the Baltic countries going forward, and I think it would be very important for NATO to be able to communicate that it continues to be an alliance based on resolve and trust among its members. And we'll see whether that's possible beyond Trump.

**>>**: “罗伯特，这说明了联盟的未来如何？并希望接续罗兰刚才所说的。”
**>>**: “嗯，你看，我的意思是，**美国国会**对**北约**有相当广泛的支持。他们明白这个联盟对**美国**的重要性。**美国**不能单打独斗。我的意思是，他们显然是世界上主要的、最大的军事强国，但在全球舞台上，联盟和盟友是绝对重要的。我认为**国会**已经认识到这一点，当然**美国军方**也认识到这一点。我认为**美国社会**的广泛阶层也是如此。但在由**特朗普**及其‘让美国再次伟大’（MAGA）的追随者领导的**共和党**中，存在一个反对派。即使**特朗普**在下次竞选活动中被我们摆脱，假设**民主党**获胜，这仍然会是一个问题，你知道，**美国**将不得不应对，**北约**也将不得不应对一段时间，因为**特朗普**总统给**北约**联盟造成了巨大的损害，并削弱了对机构的信心。即使他明天消失或去世，**美国社会**中仍有一部分人不想单打独斗。这将在可预见的未来成为**北约**的挑战。”
**>>**: “斯蒂芬妮，你来做最后的30秒发言。”
**>>**: “是的，总是‘无聊’地与其他发言者达成一致意见，但这确实是真的。我的意思是，存在对‘僵尸**北约**’的担忧，对吧？但同时，我认为，你知道，我将尝试从中找到积极的一面，那就是**美国**目前在欧洲有大约8万名士兵驻扎在几个军事基地。这些基地用于**美国**在全球范围内的军事行动。对吧？而且在**特朗普**政府的领导下，**美国**显然非常随意地卷入了世界各地的许多冲突。它将需要继续拥有这些军事基地。所以我不一定认为撤军是必要的。但说到罗伯特的一个好观点。你知道，**JD·万斯**去年在**慕尼黑安全会议**上发表了一个非常严肃的演讲，他说基本上是‘欧洲，你们完了。你们对我们来说，你们基本上完了。我们要继续前进了。’介于此和**美国**国家安全战略之间，即使**美国**继续在欧洲和**北约**保持存在，我们至少在未来三年内仍将经历一段艰难时期。”

**>>**: Robert, what does this say about the future of the Alliance and hopefully pick up on what Roland said there?
**>>**: Well, look, I mean, the there is a pretty widespread support in the US Congress for NATO. They understand the importance of this alliance to the United States. The United States can't go it alone. I mean, they obviously the world's major world's biggest military power, but alliances and allies are absolutely important in in the global sphere. And I think there is a realization in Congress that certainly there's a realization of that in the US military. And I think broad sections of American society. But there is an element in the Republican Party led by Trump and the MAGA crowd that are opposed to that. And this is something that even in Trump, if we manage to get rid of him in the next election campaign and say the Democrats win, this is still going to be a problem that the, you know, the US is going to be grappling with, NATO is going to be grappling with for some time because President Trump has left an enormous amount of damage to the NATO alliance and undermined confidence in the institutions. And it's even if he goes away or drops dead tomorrow that there is a segment of American society that do not want to go it alone. And that is going to be a challenge for NATO in the foreseeable future.
**>>**: Stephanie, you get the last 30s.
**>>**: Yeah, it's always boring to have the radical agreement with the other speakers, but it is true. I mean, there is the concern about a zombie NATO, right? But at the same time, I think, you know, like, I'll try to put the silver lining on this, which is that the United States has something like 80,000 troops in Europe right now in several military bases. Those bases are used for American operations worldwide. Right. And the US clearly is very randomly under the Trump administration, getting itself involved in a lot of conflicts worldwide. And it will need to continue to have those military bases. So I don't necessarily think that a withdrawal is necessary. But to Robert's good point. You know, JD Vance last year gave a very serious speech at the Munich Security conference where he's basically like Europe, you're dead. You're you're you're you're kind of dead to us. And we're moving on. And between that and the US national security strategy, even if the US continues to have a presence in Europe and NATO, we are still going to be in a rough ride for the next three years at least.
