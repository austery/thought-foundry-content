### 水危机与疏散

**主持人**: 一月初，卡斯瓦坎原住民社区宣布进入紧急状态。他们的供水系统失效了。其护理站被生活污水淹没。位于詹姆斯湾西海岸的该原住民社区居民被疏散到尼亚加拉瀑布、蒂明斯和金斯顿等地。其他人则选择留下来。自那时以来，情况只会变得更糟。检测结果显示，社区的水被隐孢子虫污染，这是一种引起胃肠道疾病的寄生虫。现场的医务人员现也已被疏散。我们将了解地面情况的最新动态以及如何让社区恢复安全。然后，我们将视角转向阿达瓦帕斯卡特原住民社区，一个也面临过诸多严峻挑战的地方。例如住房不足、青少年自杀以及缺乏清洁饮用水。朱诺奖提名的音乐家 Adrien Sutherland 来自阿达瓦帕斯卡特。他经常被问及为何选择留下。我们与他谈论了他的新回忆录，以及他与土地和社区的联系。欢迎来到“The Rundown”。

**Host**: In early January, Cassuan First Nation declared a state of emergency. Its water system had failed. Its nursing station was flooded with raw sewage. Residents of the First Nation, located on the west coast of James Bay, were evacuated to places like Niagara Falls, Timmans, and Kingston. Others have chosen to remain. Since then, the situation has only gotten worse. Test results show water in the community is contaminated with cryptosperidium, a parasite that causes gastrointestinal illness. Medical staff who were on site have now also been evacuated. We'll get an update on what's happening on the ground and what it will take to make the community safe. Then we're going to zoom out to Adawapascat First Nation, a place that has also faced its share of significant challenges. Things like inadequate housing, youth suicide and a lack of clean drinking water. Juno nominated musician Adrien Sutherland is from Adawapascal. He's often asked why he chooses to stay. We talked to him about his new memoir and his connection with the land and his community. Welcome to the rundown.

**主持人**: 冰冻的水管、疏散、现在又被寄生虫污染的水。卡斯瓦坎原住民社区正处于一场严重危机的困境中。那么，社区是如何应对的，现在需要做些什么？卡斯瓦坎原住民社区的执行董事 Tyson Wesley 现在加入我们的节目。Tyson，你怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Frozen pipes, evacuations, now water contaminated by a parasite. Cases First Nation is in the grips of a severe crisis. So, how is the community responding and what needs to happen now? Tyson Wesley is the executive director of Casseswan First Nation and he joins me now on the program. Tyson, how are you doing?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 我很好，谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: I'm pretty good, thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 谢谢。我们感谢您在目前的情况下抽出宝贵时间。当然，正如我们所知，这已经过去一个多月了，自宣布地方紧急状态以来。卡斯瓦坎的最新情况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Thank you. We appreciate your time under the circumstances, of course. Um, as we know, it's been just over a month uh since a local state of emergency was called. What's the latest update on the situation in Kashwan?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 我们有 1700 人被疏散到安大略省的五个地点。金斯顿、尼亚加拉瀑布、科克伦、卡普斯·加辛，以及蒂蒙斯。所以，我们还有不到 300 人留在社区。到目前为止，我们已经在诊所方面取得了一些进展，诊所曾有污水倒灌进地下室。所以那里已经完全清理完毕，我们所有的诊所工作人员都已将设备搬回了护理站。然而，随着隐孢子虫的检测结果出来，护理站的工作人员不得不离开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Well, we have 1,700 people that have been evacuated over five sites in Ontario. Kingston, Niagara Falls, Cochran, Capis Gasing, and uh Timonss. So, and we have 300 less than 300 people still in the community. Uh so far, we've kind of uh made some progress with u the clinic that had sewage backing into the basement. So that's been completely uh remediated and all our uh clinic staff kind of moved all the equipment back into the nursing station. However, the as the test results came in for crypto, the nursing staff had to leave.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，关于这种寄生虫引起的疾病，嗯，人们病情相当严重。他们可能会病上几周。有多严重？请给我们一个大概的了解，针对那些身体非常健康的人，也包括那些有合并症的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh in terms of the illness for for for people who hear this parasite, um people have become quite ill. They can be ill for a couple of weeks. how serious uh give us a sense uh for people who are quite healthy but also people who have cororidities as well.

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 是的。嗯，症状范围很广，从严重的脱水，嗯，水样腹泻、呕吐、恶心，嗯，人们会经历腹胀、胃痛。所以，嗯，这些症状因人而异。有些人感染隐孢子虫两周后仍然出现症状，而且情况因人而异。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Yeah. Um a lot the r the symptoms range from um like real like dehydration um a watery uh diarrhea vomiting nausea um people experienced bloating um sore stomachs. So um these symptoms kind of vary like between people. Some people are still experiencing symptoms after uh two weeks of um contracting uh crypto and it's it's kind of varies from person.

</details>

**主持人**: 根据最后报告，大约有 60 多人报告感觉不适。嗯，我明白这些数字可能被低估了。嗯，我们有关于这些数字的最新消息吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: At last reports there were about just north of 60 people uh who uh reported uh feeling ill. Um I understand those numbers probably under reportported as well. Uh do we have any updates on those figures?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 我认为我们有大约 73 例确诊病例，其中约有 19 例未检测，但他们认为自己感染了隐孢子虫。但是，我们得到的数字是较低的。我被告知这是底线，而上限可能高得多，因为检测不是即时的。而且，如果一个人感染了隐孢子虫或被确诊为隐孢子虫，他们不会为同一家庭的家庭成员进行检测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: I think we're at about 73 confirmed cases um with crypto with about 19 that are kind of not been tested, but they believe that they do have cryp crypto. Uh but uh the numbers that we're kind of having are kind of the lower end. Uh that's the floor I'm being told and the ceiling is probably much higher since testing wasn't immediate. And um if one person gets crypto and or gets diagnosed with crypto uh tested confirmed they don't test for the their family members in the same household.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。您提到了成员们被疏散到的地点。我想拉出一张地图来向大家展示，正如您所说，有些人搬到了卡普斯·加辛和蒂蒙斯，但当然，有些人远至金斯顿和尼亚加拉瀑布。请帮助我们理解，这些地点是如何确定的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. You had mentioned uh the locations uh that uh members have been evacuated to. Just want to pull up a map just to show people how far as you mentioned some have moved to uh have been evacuated to Capus Casing and Timmans but of course some as far as Kingston and Niagara Falls. Help us understand how are those locations determined?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 嗯，地点是根据他们接待居民的能力来确定的，但同时也要评估他们的医疗设施，看他们是否能够满足涌入该地区的大量人口的需求。所以，他们会对此进行评估。我们这样做是因为，如果我们把人送过去，他们是否需要等很久才能看病等等？所以，这是他们真正确定的一个因素。嗯，但是，是的，这是他们在疏散我们的人员之前会评估的一系列事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Uh it's um the locations are determined by their capacity to accommodate um accommodate people but at the same time there is an assessment of their health facilities um if they're able to uh meet demands uh for an excessive amount of people entering the area. So um they do an assessment on those. we it's like um if we send our people there, are they going to be waiting long to get um long for hospital visits and whatnot? So, that's one thing that they really determine. Um but um yeah, it's it's it's a bunch of stuff that they kind of assess prior to uh evacuating our people there. So,

</details>

**主持人**: 请帮助我们理解，正如您所提到的，大约有 300 人，几个家庭仍然留在卡斯瓦坎。请帮助我们理解，他们为什么还留在那儿？他们如何获得清洁饮用水，或者在医疗问题方面，下一个可能的去处是哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: help us understand there, as you mentioned, there's about 300 uh people, several families who are still uh in Cesawan. help us understand why are they still there? How are they uh able to access u clean drinking water or how in terms of concerns if there are medical issues uh where is the next uh possible place that they could go?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 是的。嗯，那些留下的人是我们的工作人员，他们还在照看大家的家，照看宠物，比如我们社区有很多狗，所以我们在喂养它们。但另一件事是，多年来我们已经被疏散过很多次了，有些人已经厌倦了被疏散，所以决定留下来，在家中感到舒适。我们现在有明确的指导方针，尽量避免使用水，不要饮用它，以确保遵守公共卫生部门制定的规定。我想正如我所说，我认为这是社区正在发生的疏散疲劳。嗯，正如我所说，护士们已经被撤离，现在社区里没有医务人员可以治疗任何人。然而，由于冬季道路目前是开放的，他们可以前往大约一小时外的福特·奥尔巴尼的医疗设施。我们一直在努力与 ISC 合作，试图修建一条更短的冬季道路到福特·奥尔巴尼，这将使时间缩短一半，但我们还没有收到任何回复。我想谈谈疏散人员的后勤问题。嗯，你们听说了哪些因为离家很远而遇到的困难？我们谈论的是各种各样的人群，当我们谈论长者时，我们也谈论正在完成学业的学生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Yeah. Um those people that are staying behind as our crews that are still kind of like uh watching people's homes, watching um pets, like we have a high number of dogs in the in the community, so we're helping feed them. And but the other thing is we've been evacuated for so many times over the years and some people are just fed up with being evacuated and decided to stay to be in their comfort at home. We do have set guidelines right now to kind of avoid the use of water to do not consume it uh to make sure that follow the rules that public health has kind of set up. Uh I think as I said I think they're just evacuation fatigue that's happening in the community. Uh as I said the nurses have been pulled out and right now there is no medical staff that can um treat anybody uh in the community. However uh since the winter road is open at the moment uh they can access um uh health facilities in Fort Albany which is about an hour away. We've been we've been trying to work with ISC to kind of build a shorter uh winter road to Fort Albany, which would cut the time in half, but we haven't received any response yet. I I want to talk a little bit about the logistics for the people who have had to evacuate. Um what are some of the difficulties that you're hearing from being so far away from home? We're talking we're talking a wide range of of demographics and when we talk about you know elders, but we're also talking about students who are in the midst of of finishing class as well.

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 是的，嗯，这对我们的人民来说非常困难，非常困难，因为他们被疏散到这些接待社区。我知道教育是我们社区的一件大事，我们正在努力为我们的学生提供便利，以确保他们仍然在学习。我认为教育部门正在设立家庭作业包，以继续学业。但是，这种情况对我们的学生来说确实非常困难，他们仍然无法获得所需的教育水平。所以这是非常困难和令人疲惫的。我们听到人们说他们累了。他们因为要处理社区里这些持续不断的紧急状态而感到筋疲力尽。所以，这令人沮丧，我知道，我们的人民已经厌倦了。我能听出你声音中的疲惫，而且我知道 Tyson，你对此并不陌生。2005 年，也就是不久前，发生了一次大肠杆菌疏散事件，你也经历过。我知道你现在是以官方身份发言，但我不得不问，你心理上怎么样？你知道，要处理这件事，同时还要向我们解释一些以前就上过头条的事情，不幸的是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Yeah, it's uh um it's it's been very difficult, very difficult on our people to be evacuated u in these host communities and I know education is a big thing in our community and we're trying to make accommodations to our to our uh students to make sure that they're still kind of um doing their schoolwork. I think there's uh homework packages that are being set up by the education authority to kind of um just the continuation of a school. Uh but however, this situation is is really difficult uh for our students to kind of um still get the level of education that they require. So it is it is difficult and exhausting. And uh what we've been hearing with people is they're they're tired. they're exhausted from having to deal with these constant uh states of emergencies for our community. So, it is it is frustrating and I know um our people are are just tired of it. I can hear it in your voice and I know Tyson, you are no stranger to this. 2005 is not that uh long ago when uh an evacuation for E.coli happened that uh you had to experience as well. I know you're speaking here as an official, but I do have to ask, how are you doing uh psychologically, you know, with having to deal with this, but also, you know, having to explain uh to us something that has been in the headlines before, uh unfortunately.

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 是的。我曾在 2005 年在社区里。我记得在脏水里洗澡，嗯，我的表弟们出现了皮肤问题等等。我确实记得，这在我脑海里仍然很清晰，我知道社区里的人们也一样。再次经历这样的事情确实很难。我本人也感染了隐孢子虫。嗯，我已经病了两个多星期了，尽管症状在慢慢消退，但仍然存在，这令人沮丧。所以，嗯，但这只是让我想起了 2005 年发生的事情，现在又发生了，这确实令人沮丧。嗯，是的，这简直是世代创伤。我记得我们的一位顾问说，他记得用瓶装水给他的孩子洗澡，现在他的孩子不得不给他的孙子做同样的事情。所以，看到这种情况再次发生，并且再次出现，这确实令人非常情绪化，我认为本可以避免。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: Yeah. Uh I was in the community back in 2005. I I remember showering in brown water, >> uh having to kind of uh my little cousins having skin issues and whatnot. And I do remember that it's it's not it's still fresh in my mind and I know even with the community it's still fresh in their mind and having to to to experience something again is is quite difficult to really uh to uh to go through I guess. Uh I did contract crypto myself. Um, I've been sick for the past like probably over two weeks now and it's it's been frustrating to to still have these symptoms even though they're kind of going away slowly. So, um, but uh it just brings back memories of what happened in 2005 and now that it's happening again, it's it's it's kind of uh frustrating and um yeah, it's it's it's quite uh it seems um generational trauma at this point. Um, I remember one of our adviserss speaking um I think he remembers bathing his children in um in in a in a bucket with with bottled water and now that now his ch his child has to do that to his grandson. So, it's it's it's kind of uh really emotional to kind of see that happen again and kind of um reoccurring again which I think could have been avoidable.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，让我们来谈谈解决方案。嗯，长期来看，什么能解决这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk about that in terms of um solutions. Uh what would solve this in the long term?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 我认为，嗯，就像现在，我们正处于水危机之中，一旦一切结束，比如到了三月，我们回家了，我们的社区就必须再次准备疏散，因为每年的洪水和相关的风险。我们的人民一直处于这种循环中，这种情况一直在发生，我们必须在几个月后再次经历，这令人沮丧。长期的解决方案是搬迁我们的社区，并加快这些进程。Tyson，我们联系了加拿大原住民服务部，希望就这场危机发表声明，发言人 Eric 发来了一份声明，其中部分内容是：加拿大原住民服务部 (ISC) 继续与卡斯瓦坎原住民社区、省级合作伙伴、米什卡瓦委员会、温尼巴戈地区卫生局和尼沙纳布·阿斯基民族密切合作，以应对社区持续的紧急状态。部长 G. Masti 已与 Wesley酋长以及 National Chief Woodhouse Nepanak 就社区的紧急状态和疏散声明进行了直接沟通。ISC 正在与领导层和卫生合作伙伴一起努力，确保社区成员在此极其困难时期获得必要的支持。您如何看待搬迁社区的进展？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: I think uh like like right now we are u in the midst of a water crisis and and once it just say everything is finished by March we go home and our community has to prepare again uh to evacuate because of the flooding that happens every year and the risks associated with that. our people are in this loop uh that's that's always happening and we have to do it again in a few months and it it is frustrating. The long-term solution would be to relocate our community and to expedite these processes. Tyson, we did reach out to Indigenous Services Canada for a statement on the crisis and spokesperson Eric had sent out one and it reads in part, Indigenous Services Canada ISC continues to work closely with Kashawuan First Nation, provincial partners, Mishkawa Council, Wnebago Area Health Authority and Nishanab Aski Nation in response to the community's ongoing state of emergency. Minister G Masti has been in contact with Chief Wesley directly and with National Chief Woodhouse Nepanak regarding the community's declaration of emergency and evacuation. ISC is working alongside leadership and health partners to make sure that community members have access to the necessary supports during this extremely difficult time. How do you look at the the progress on potentially relocating your community?

</details>

**Tyson Wesley**: 进展一直很缓慢。嗯，我认为我们本应该进展得更快，并且已经搬迁了社区。然而，我们仍然需要经历土地的增加，我们需要从政府那里获得土地来搬迁社区，并且，我不知道，我可以说减少这些研究，我知道我们可以做到，但这些程序必须加快，以确保这不会成为我们每年都做的事情。我很抱歉，这只是令人沮丧。我们已经处理这个问题超过 18 年了，政府花费的用于疏散我们社区的钱肯定是一笔巨款。那么，政府的想法是继续这种支出，每年疏散我们是否更便宜，而不是搬迁我们？Tyson，我们得说到这里了。感谢您在目前的情况下抽出时间。我们感受到了您的沮丧。我们祝您和您的社区一切顺利，希望事情能得到解决。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyson Wesley**: The progress has been slow. Well, I think we should have been definitely further ahead and in and moving the community. However, like we still have to go through uh additions to reserve land where we've where we need to kind of get land from the government to kind of move the community there and and just um I don't know I would say reducing these these studies like um um I know we can do it but uh it's just these processes have to be expediated and u just to make sure that this is not a annual thing that we and do like I'm sorry it's just just frustrating like um uh we've been dealing with this for over 18 years and the money the amount of money that the government has spent um evacuating our community must must amount to a large amount of money. So So is is the government's idea to to continue on this this spending dur is it cheaper for them to evacuate us every year and and not move us? Tyson, uh, we're going to have to leave it there. We appreciate you taking the time under the circumstances. Uh, we sense your frustration. Uh, we wish, uh, you and your your community, uh, well, and hope things, uh, do get fixed. Thank you so much.

### 文化传承与个人成长

**主持人**: 朱诺奖提名的音乐家 Adrien Sutherland 出生并成长于阿达瓦帕斯卡特原住民社区，现在他也在那里抚养家人。他的新书《我们手中的劳作》(The Work of Our Hands)，是对现实世界的沉思，探讨了选择艰难道路的挑战与回报。走出阴影，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Juno nominated musician Adrien Sutherland was born and raised in Adawapiscat First Nation, and now he's raising his family there. His new book, The Work of Our Hands, a cremeditation on the real world, explores the challenges and rewards of choosing the hard path. Walking out from the shadows,

</details>

**主持人**: Adrian，非常感谢您抽出时间与我们交谈。这是一本很棒的书。我觉得有趣的是，它读起来像一本回忆录，但也像一次冥想。我很想知道，您在开始写这本书时是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Adrian, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us. A lovely book. What I found interesting is it reads like a memoir but also reads like a meditation. I'm curious what did you have in mind when you started to write it?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 很明显，我希望以一种更具哲学性或学习性的方式来写，而不是像 Leon 那样试图说教。所以我想确保我们能够以那种方式来分享我的故事和我的旅程。您书中的第一个场景描绘了一个相当严重的事件，我很想知道您能否告诉我们那个场景发生了什么。那是我生命中一段非常艰难的时期，我知道那是我一切真正改变的起点，事情发生了一个重大的转折点。所以，我想，那晚开始，它引发了一系列其他事件，最终把我带到了戒毒所。当然，我认为我触及了他们所说的“人生低谷”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: It was clear earlier on that I wanted to write it in a way that was uh more of a a philosophy or or learning and not so much Leon trying to lecture people. So I wanted to uh to ensure that we were able to do it that in that sort of way to sort of sharing my stories and and my journey. The first scene in your book uh depicts quite a serious event and I'm curious if you can tell us what happened in that in that scenario. It was a time in my life where it was I found very difficult and I knew that uh that's where everything kind of really changed for me and things kind of was a a major turning point in my life. So, and it started, I think, uh, it started that night and that sort of set off, you know, a sequence a sequence of other events that kind of led me to rehab. Certainly, I think I hit what they call rock bottom

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 那是一个可怕的时刻，对我来说，它真的让我开始思考我的生活，以及想要变得更好。所以，嗯，当我们回顾一下，看看成长过程中可能有多么困难，你知道，我父亲的去世，嗯，我的家里有酗酒问题，只是很多很多苦难和损失。嗯，与我的兄弟姐妹分离等等，还有被拒绝，我认为是因为我的混血身份。嗯，感受到那种拒绝，你知道，来自我的外祖父母和祖父母，特别是我的祖父。这并不容易。我发现这真的很难，而且我在很小的年纪就感受到了。嗯，这对我来说很难处理，尤其是在我年轻的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: and uh that was a scary moment and for me it it really got me thinking about uh my life and and and wanting to get better. So, um, so when we back up and we look at how difficult things might have been growing up, you know, the loss of my father and, um, I had alcoholism, uh, in my home, just a lot of a lot of hardships and loss. Um, being separated from my siblings and and things like that and and also being rejected, I think because of my mixed ethnicity. Uh, feeling that rejection, you know, come from my maternal and paternal grandparents, my grandfather particularly. It wasn't easy. I found it really difficult and I felt it, you know, at a young age. Um, and it was it was hard for me to uh to kind of process that, especially uh in my younger years.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们因为你的音乐而认识你。嗯，人们知道，嗯，通过这本书，你所经历的挑战。我想知道你是否能联系起来。音乐是如何在你度过那些艰难时期的时候成为你的避难所的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: People know you for your music. Uh people know that uh through this book, the challenge that you go through. Wonder if you can help connect that. How has music been a refuge for you through some of those hard times?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 当他之前谈到人生低谷并想结束自己的生命时，我当时确实感到我失控了。我失去了一切的控制。那是一种可怕的感觉，完全失去了对自己的控制，也吓坏了我关心的人。然后，从那里开始进入戒毒所，嗯，你知道，理解我身上发生了什么，并学习如何应对所有这些事情，并在戒毒所里重新发现音乐，并能够将其用作一种工具来释放某些东西。嗯，嗯，比如能够释放，你知道，艺术对于找到一个地方让那些情感和感受得以存在，你知道，然后释放并将其带入世界，确实很有好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: When he talked about hitting rock bottom earlier and wanting to take my own life, what I certainly felt in that moment was I had no control. Uh I lost control of everything. And that that was a scary feeling to to have that complete loss of control over over yourself and scaring the people around me that I cared about. And then moving forward into rehab from there and and uh you know understanding what was going on with me and learning about that and how to cope with all those things and rediscovering music while in rehab and being able to use that as a tool to kind of um you know let go of certain things. um um like to be able to release, you know, kind of saying art is really uh good for being able to uh find a place for those emotions and those feelings to kind of live, you know, and let go and put them out into the world.

</details>

**主持人**: 那段旅程的一部分还包括体验汗屋。您描述了您的第一次经历，当时您并不打算参加禁食。嗯，您去那里是为了帮忙。这些仪式对像您这样的人有什么意义，也对克里族人有什么意义？嗯，能够在一个汗屋里占据那个空间，在精神上，这对您意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Part of that journey is also uh experiencing the sweat lodge. You describe your first experience where you weren't planning to take part in a in a fast. Uh you were there to help. What do those rituals mean for for someone like you, but also for CRE people uh to to be able to take that space in in a sweat lodge and and and spiritually? What does that mean for you?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 嗯，我认为，是的，我参加的第一次禁食，我的意思是，我一直都知道这些事情，因为我的家人就在周围，我见过它们，我当然在成长过程中听了很多关于它们的事情，但由于我个人遇到的问题，我从未真正想过要去那些地方。直到我戒毒成功，然后我去了法国河的仪式，就在穆斯河工厂以西，穆斯河工厂社区。我在那里第一次参加了一个仪式，和我哥哥一起，他总是邀请我，你知道，当他来的时候。他说，“你需要来。”我总是说，“是的，下次我会的。”但总之，我去了那年，我并没有真正打算参与正在发生的任何事情，但我只是想更多地了解它。所以，我去了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Well, I think yeah, the first fast I ever went to, I mean, I was always aware of those things because uh my family was around them and I I've seen them and I've, you know, certainly heard a lot about them growing up, but never really felt that I wanted to be in those places because uh, you know, what was going on personally with me. And it wasn't until I got um through rehab and then I went uh went to the ceremony up in French River just just uh just west of the moose factory, the community moose factory. And I attended a ceremony there um for the first time with my brother uh who always invited me, you know, when he'd come through. He said, "You need to come." And I always say, "Yeah, I'll get you next time." But anyway, I went that year and I had no real intention of of doing it, you know, being really fully participating in anything that was going on, but I just wanted to know more about what it was about. And uh so I went

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 他们那天开始建造小屋。你知道，人们有他们的营地，他们搭建帐篷，布置好一切。嗯，那天晚上我们举行了盛宴。你知道，主持仪式的人开始为我们进行祈祷仪式，然后开始祈祷，然后开始唱歌，这对我来说是一次非常奇妙的经历，我感到与这一切真正地联系在一起，即使我并没有真正地投入其中，你知道，在成长过程中，但我感觉我应该在那里，有一个东西真的在呼唤我，就在那个晚上。嗯，当他们问有多少人禁食时，我甚至没想过，我说，“我要禁食。”所以，我，嗯，我自愿禁食，那是我第一次禁食。嗯，我还是个年轻人，对我来说，这几乎是一种觉醒。它真的让我对很多事情睁开了眼睛。因为我再也没有以同样的方式看待世界。因为当你做一些精神上的事情时，它会改变你。嗯，嗯，你经历的一些事情很难相信，但你知道，我亲眼所见。我感受到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: and uh they started off by building the lodge that day. And you know, people have their camps and they build their tents and set everything up. And uh we had a feast that night. And you know the the person running the ceremony began by you know rendering us the pipe ceremony and then and then the prayer started then the singing started and it was such an amazing experience for me and I felt really connected to to to all of that even though um I didn't really you know put myself and immerse myself into that growing up but I felt like I was meant to be there and and there was something that really called to me that that particular night and uh And when they asked how many fasters are here and I had like I had not even thought about it and I just I'll fast. Um so I uh I you know I volunteered to fast and uh and that was my first fast. Uh was probably it was a young man and uh and and it was a very for me it was a it was a very uh it was almost like an awakening I guess in some way and it really opened my eyes to a lot of a lot of things. cuz I never looked at the world the same way again because when you do something spiritual like that um it changes you um and uh some of the things you experience uh that are difficult to believe but you know like I seen it with my own eyes. I felt it.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，在最后一天会发生一些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, there are something that happens on sort of the last day.

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 是的。是的。你去那里，你祈求好运、保护，获得做事的 [力量]，但你也去那里了解自己。当你停止饮水和进食几天后，就像你的人类祖先和造物主一样，他们会担心。你为什么不吃东西？你为什么不喝水？精神层面也是如此。他们说他们会担心，他们会来看你，拜访你，因为他们关心我们，即使是在精神层面。所以，我们不仅要了解物质世界和我们的祖先，我们还需要了解精神层面。这就是克里族人和其他原住民文化是如何做到这一点的。你会说流利的克里语。嗯，你在书中谈到了，你知道，能够用你的语言与人交谈，嗯，还有一些人不能，嗯，还有你因为精通它而建立的一些联系。你会说你的语言对你和你的家人意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Yeah. Yeah. You get uh you know you go there and you ask for the things like good health uh protection to have the strength to to be able to do things but you also go go there to get to know who you are. And when you stop the water and the food for several days, um just like your human grandparents and creator, they get concerned. Why are you not eating? Why are you not drinking? It's the same thing on the spiritual side. They say they get concerned and they and they come, they say they come to see you and visit with you and and uh because they care about us even on the spiritual side. Um so it's important for us to not only get to know the physical world and and our grandparents and uh we need to get to know that spiritual side as well and that's how we one way uh cre people and other indigenous cultures um are able to do that. you are fluent in Cree. Um, and you talk in your book of, you know, being able to speak to, uh, people in your language, uh, and some people who aren't, uh, able to, um, and how that that there's some bonds that you make because of, uh, your fluency in it. What does it mean to you and your family that you are able to speak your language?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 对我来说，我感到非常幸运能够说我的语言，因为我遇到了很多说不了自己语言的人，我为他们感到非常难过，因为我知道他们正在努力重新联系。他们正在努力学习自己的语言，这对他们来说非常困难，因为他们没有在语言环境中长大，没有听到过，也说不出来。嗯，我听说这就像一种哀悼，你知道，我感觉那种感觉。所以我很幸运能够学会我的语言，我认为很大一部分原因是，许多北部地区的部落因为与世隔绝而保留了强大的语言。你把自己描述成一个老师，当你谈论你的汗屋时，也通过语言。我很想知道，你作为一名老师的职业与你作为一名音乐家的身份是如何重叠的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Well, for me it's it's it's I feel like I'm very uh fortunate um to be able to speak my language and I because I I meet a lot of people who who aren't able to speak their language and I feel really bad for them because I know they're they're they're trying to reconnect. They're trying to learn their language and it's it's very difficult for them um not growing up around their language, not not hearing it and not able to speak it. And uh I hear that it's it's like a it's almost like a mourning, you know, like I I feel that sort of uh it kind of give off that kind of feeling. So I'm just been very very fortunate that I was able to learn my language and uh I think a big part of that is because I a lot of far north bands are very uh they have very uh strong language retention because of the isolation. you sort of describe yourself as a teacher when you talk about your sweat lodge, but even with through language as well. And I'm curious, how does your vocation as a teacher uh overlap with being a musician?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 哦，好问题。嗯，我认为，嗯，在音乐方面，我总是试图以一种方式去做，我的意思是，它有点政治驱动，但它一直都是这样，但我总是试图去 [理解]，即使它不是关于非常积极的事情，我也总是试图通过音乐达到一个更好的境界。我相信音乐是为所有人而存在的，你知道，就像这本书一样，我试图让这本书也为所有人而写。嗯，所以我一直试图用一种方式来运用音乐，再次，只是那种我们都能理解和共鸣的普遍主题。嗯，是的，我的意思是，有些音乐就是在教学，你知道，我们谈论，嗯，嗯，在一些歌曲中我谈论失去，你知道，嗯，我谈论一些歌曲是用克里语演唱的。所以，我认为这些歌曲会很有意义，嗯，这样人们就可以，你知道，学会用克里语唱歌，同时也在学习他们的语言。所以，这些是我尝试将音乐用作教学工具的一些方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Oh, good question. Um, I I think well in the music uh I I always tried to do it in a way I mean it's a little bit politically driven but it's always been uh it's always been that way but I always try to take you know it may even if it's not about something that's very positive I always try to get to a better place with the music. Uh I believe it's for everyone, you know, and uh like the book, I tried to to make this book uh um for everyone. And uh so I've always tried to use music in a way that is uh um again just sort of universal themes that we all can kind of understand and we can all relate to. Um and yeah, I mean in some of the music is teaching, you know, we we we talk about uh um in some of the songs I talk about uh loss, you know, um I talk about some of the songs are in Cree. So those are some of the songs I thought that would be really good to make um so people can, you know, learn to sing the song in Cree and then they learn are also learning at the same time about their language. So, so and those are some of the ways I I try to use music as as uh as teaching tools.

**主持人**: 这里没有什么可以隐藏的。这是珍贵的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Ain't no hiding in here. This is precious.

</details>

**主持人**: 你描述的从五岁起一直到现在都要 [提水]，你称之为爱的行为。跟我说说吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You describing carrying water uh from the age of five up until today uh as an act of love. Tell me about that.

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 嗯，从最早的时候起，嗯，我们过去有这些小桶，它们很小，我们在哈德逊湾买的。它们通常有衬垫。所以我们总有一个用来装水，还有用来装其他东西。嗯，所以我的祖母让我去打水，用来装洗碗水，嗯，洗澡，或者任何日常的事情。冬天我们还用雪，嗯，我们收集在那些，我不知道你是否见过，但加拿大邮政的袋子通常是蓝色或橙色的亮色，但我们用那些，因为它们是聚酯纤维的，所以不会破。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Well, from the earliest age, well, um we used to have these little pills that were small and they you uh we bought them at the Hudson's Bay. They come they usually lard in there. So that we always had one for water and just carrying different things. Um so my grandma made me go get water uh to fill the washer for dishes and and you know um bathing or whatever like like daily thing and then we did snow in winter um which we collected in those I don't know if you've ever seen them but the Canada Post bag usually blue or orange bright colors but we use those cuz they're made of polyester >> so it won't break

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 是的。所以，我们用那些，然后把它们装满雪，嗯，我们冬天还有一个桶，我们把它侧放，我爷爷在上面挖了一个洞，我们用一个小杯子把它装满，因为它们能保持冰面 [开放]。它们整冬天都保持冰面 [开放]，所以我们可以，你知道，放冰、雪和水，然后我们把它们混合在一起。所以，这基本上是我们的工作。嗯，我们用小型雪地摩托来做。嗯，所以，是的，工具种类繁多，你知道，收集水，但它一直都是我的工作，现在仍然是，你知道，我儿子的工作，现在是他们的工作，确保我们有水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: and Yeah. So, we use those and we'd fill them with snow and uh we also had a barrel that we use in the winter that we would put down sideways and we my grandfather cut a hole uh through the top and we'd fill that thing with a little cup cuz they they keep the ice uh open. They keep it a hole in the ice open all winter long so we could you know put in ice, snow and water and we kind of mix it all together. So, that was kind of our job. Um and we do that on the little snow machine. Um, so like yeah, the tools sort of varied, you know, to collecting water, but it it it was I remember it always being my job and it still is, you know, my job, my son's, it's their job now to to make sure that we have the water.

</details>

**主持人**: 在你的书中，你谈到了那些关键时刻，嗯，比如你去打猎等等，但即使是像这样简单的事情，我们在这里看到的，像取水这样简单的事情。那一刻你对你儿子有什么信息？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Throughout your book, you talk about sort of these key moments, uh, one where you go hunting and stuff like that, but even something as simple as that we look at here, something as simple as getting water. What's the message to your son in that moment?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 对我来说，这不仅仅是一项家务。这是一种哲学，我认为这是一种我们在这里进入的生活节奏。无论是建造，还是我们用双手收获食物，总是与我们的双手有关。我认为取水，是的，它在体力上要求很高，而且它确实感觉像是一种不便，有些日子还要排队。这是我们必须做的事情。对我们来说，在那里不是一个选择。嗯，即使有时很难，也要 [努力]，确保你知道，如果你 [病了]，你仍然需要取水。你知道，你病了好几天，你仍然需要去取水。就像，不，我好了再说。不，你必须起床去取。这是我接受的事情。嗯，嗯，即使有时非常困难，我仍然认为我在这里过着非常美好的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: Well, for me, it's it's not just like a chore. It's a philosophy and I think it's a rhythm, you know, of life that we get into up there. Whether it's building or we harvest something to eat with our hands, it's always something to do with our hands. I think getting water, yeah, it's it's it's physically demanding and it's an it is uh it does feel like an inconvenience and some days there's a lineup. It's something that we do because we have to do it. It's not a choice uh for us up there. And uh even though it's difficult at some days to to push yourself to to make sure, you know, if you're if you're down with the flu, like you got to get water still, like you know, you're down for the flu for a few days, you still got to go and do it. Like it's it's not like, no, I'm going to do it when I'm better. No, it's like you got to get up and go get it. It's something I accept. And uh uh even though it's it's it's very hard at times, um I still think I I live a very beautiful life up there.

</details>

**主持人**: 从你成长的地方，在阿达瓦帕斯卡特，到现在，可能发生了很多变化。你能稍微讲讲吗？你看到的有什么大的变化吗？那里永远是你的家，但它变化很大吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: A lot has probably changed uh from how you grew up and where you grew up in Adawapsa to what it is now. Can you tell us a little bit? Is is there a big change in sort of what you see that is always home that will always be home for you, but is it has it changed a lot?

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 变化是有的。嗯，在某些方面，我们仍然感觉我们生活在石器时代，或者仍然生活在石器时代，但确实发生了变化。我认为，我的意思是，水的质量有所提高，你知道，从我小时候没有自来水，直到大约 95 年，90 年，98 年，我们家才通了水管，在那之前我们什么都没有。所以是的，确实发生了一些变化，但我的意思是，你永远不能喝自来水，你知道，很多很多年，你知道，那种水就像毒药，饮用毒药。所以，你知道，人们还在里面洗澡，嗯，我们从加拿大卫生部得到的建议是，不要在那种水里洗澡超过 2 分钟。嗯，你知道，不要吸入自来水产生的蒸汽。所以，当你听到这些话时，你就会想，这到底是怎么回事？我认为任何人都会觉得这非常令人担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: There's been Yeah, there's been there's been change. Um in some ways though we I feel like we still we still live in the stone age uh or still living in the stone ages but but uh there has been change I think uh I mean the water has improved the water quality has improved you know from having no running water as a kid up until it was like 95 90 98 I think we got plumbed our house got plumbed so we we didn't have anything prior to that so yes there has there have been changes but I mean you could never drink the the water from the tap like uh for for many many many years you know that water is like poison drinking poison. So and you know people bathe in that and uh the the information the advice we were getting from Health Canada was do not bathe longer than 2 minutes in that water. Um you know don't breathe the vapors from the water tap. Uh so when you hear those kinds of things you're just like what like what is going on here? uh anyone I think uh would find that very very alarming

</details>

**主持人**: 尽管如此，这些不幸的是很多人读到的头条新闻，但我很想知道你希望人们从阿达瓦帕斯卡特了解什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: with that those you know unfortunately those are the headlines that a lot of people read but I'm curious what do you want people to know out of Wabiscat for

</details>

**Adrien Sutherland**: 我们不是要求被拯救，我们是积极参与我们自己生活的参与者，你知道，我认为我们正在生存，我们都在那里以生存的节奏生活。我们拥有关于如何在陆地上生存的丰富知识，我认为我们大多数选择在那里生活的人是因为我们热爱这种生活方式。正如我之前提到的，你可以过一种非常艰难的生活，但同时你也可以过一种非常美好的生活。这两件事可以并存。嗯，我热爱与土地的联系。我热爱克里文化，克里传统。嗯，这就是我为什么在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adrien Sutherland**: we're not asking to be rescued we're active participants in our in our own lives and and you know I think we are surviving we we all are in a rhythm of survival up there we uh we have a wealth of knowledge about how to survive on the land and I think most of us that are up there choose to live there because we love the lifestyle. As I mentioned earlier, you can live a very hard life, but you can also have a very beautiful life at the same time. Those two things can coexist. Um, and I love the connection to the land. I love the CRE culture, the CRE tradition. Uh, that's why I'm there.

</details>
