summary: 本文深入探讨了领导者如何识别并克服阻碍其成长的“隐性障碍”——那些根深蒂固却未被意识到的信念。通过审视当前结果、行为和潜在思维模式，文章揭示了七种常见障碍，如“我需要立即完成”和“我不能犯错”。Muriel
  Wilkins强调，理解这些信念的来源和作用至关重要，而非简单地消除它们。她提出了“揭示、剖析、重构”三步法，帮助领导者将限制性信念转化为赋能性思维，从而提升个人和组织的适应性与效能。

title: 领导力提升：如何识别并克服阻碍你成长的隐性信念
---

### 发现阻碍：从好奇心开始

MURIEL WILKINS: 我认为，首先要从好奇心开始。所以你不能只想着我需要做些什么不同的事情，这正是我们大多数行动导向型的人会做的。你需要停下来思考一下，现在正在发生什么？我正在得到什么样的结果？**认知失调**（Cognitive Dissonance: 指当一个人同时持有两种或多种相互冲突的信念、观念、态度或价值观时所感受到的一种不舒服的心理状态）在哪里？让我来**逆向工程**（Reverse Engineer: 指通过分析现有产品或系统，推导出其设计原理、结构和功能的行为）一下。我正在采取哪些行为或行动，导致了当前的结果？然后，再退一步问自己，是什么样的思维模式在驱动着那种行动和行为？我正在做出哪些假设，无论是关于我需要如何领导，关于我所领导的人，还是关于我所处的环境，这些假设又驱动着我当前的行动？

<details>

<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: I think
there's the first place
to start is to be curious.
So you've got to
not just go to what
do I need to do
differently, which
is what most of us who are
extremely action biased will do.
You've got to take a
beat and ask yourself,
what is happening right now?
What are the outcomes
that I'm getting?
Where's the dissonance?
And let me reverse engineer it.
What are the
behaviors or actions
I'm taking that are
leading to the current act,
to the current outcomes?
And then take a
step back from that
and say, what is
the mindset that
is driving that type
of action and behavior?
What are the assumptions
that I'm making, either
about the way that
I need to lead,
about those who I'm leading,
about the context that I'm in,
that are then driving
the current actions?</p>

ALISON BEARD: Muriel，非常感谢你今天能和我们在一起。

<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Thank you.
I'm so delighted to be here.</p>

### 什么是隐性障碍？

ALISON BEARD: 我们首先来谈谈究竟什么是**隐性障碍**（Hidden Blocker: 阻碍个人成长和领导力提升，但自身未意识到的信念或思维模式）。它们之所以隐性，是因为人们不知道它们的存在，并且尽管有它们，人们仍然取得了很大的成功，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Let's first
talk about what exactly
a hidden blocker is.
They're hidden because people
don't that they're there,
and they've managed to be very
successful in spite of them?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的。所以隐性障碍是你所持有的信念。信念是什么？信念是你告诉自己的叙述。它是一个故事。它是一个假设。它们之所以隐性，是因为虽然它们过去可能帮助过你，但它们已经变得如此习惯，以至于你甚至没有意识到它们仍在某些情况下运作，而实际上，在这些情况下它们可能不像过去那样有效了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
So hidden blockers are
beliefs that you hold.
And what is a belief?
A belief is a narrative
that you tell yourself.
It's a story.
It's an assumption.
And so the reason
why they are hidden
is because, while they may
have helped you in the past,
they have become so
habitual that you're not
even aware that they're still
operating in situations where
they actually might not
be as effective as they
have been for you in the past.</p>
</details>

### 如何识别隐性障碍？

ALISON BEARD: 如果它不是显而易见的东西，那它是如何变得明显的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: If it is
something that's not obvious,
how does it become apparent?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 它通常会变得明显，因为你所期望的结果与你实际经历的之间存在一些**认知失调**。因此，你可以通过两种方式获得线索。它可以是一个外部线索。例如，如果你曾经收到过一些反馈，你可能会觉得那个反馈与我无关，或者那不是我希望被看待的方式，或者你的团队可能没有按照你希望的方式表现。所以可能有一些外部线索表明事情没有按照你希望的方式发展，但你也可以有一些内部线索。如果你感到沮丧，如果你感到倦怠，如果你对自己在工作中的运作方式或领导方式感到不安或不适，那么这也是你应该倾听的，因为这背后可能是一个信念，一个限制性信念，或者我称之为隐性障碍，它正在阻碍你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: It
usually becomes apparent,
because there's some
dissonance between what
you desire in
terms of an outcome
and what you're
actually experiencing.
And so you can have a cue
around that in two ways.
It can be an external cue.
So if you've ever received
some feedback, for example,
and you're like, that feedback
doesn't resonate with me
or that's not the way
I want to be seen,
or your team might
not be performing
in the way you'd
like them to perform.
So there might be
some external cues
that things aren't going the
way that you would like them,
but you can also have
some internal cues.
If you're feeling frustration,
if you're feeling burned out,
if you're feeling some
unease or some malaise
around how you're operating
at work or how you're leading,
then that is also something
you should be listening
to that behind that, might be
a belief or a limiting belief,
or a hidden blocker,
as I call them,
that is getting in your way.</p>
</details>

### 教练的视角：发现隐性障碍

ALISON BEARD: 你是一名高管教练。那么你是如何理解到许多看似能力很强、成就斐然的专业人士，其实正受这些障碍的困扰，而这些障碍阻碍了他们获得晋升，或者阻碍了他们的团队发挥最佳表现的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And so
you're an executive coach.
And so how did you
come to understand
that lots of professionals who
are seemingly high powered,
high achieving, are suffering
from these blockers,
and it is preventing them
from getting that promotion
or encouraging their team to
perform as well as they can?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的。我认为，这实际上是两条并行路径，在两个层面上。第一个层面是，我发现我的客户非常注重行动，致力于实现他们的目标。所以，如果他们收到反馈，我们会很快地说：“好的，这是你要做的。”但我发现这不可持续。他们能够采取行动，改变行为，但效果是短暂的。所以我开始好奇，为什么他们即使在外表上可能很成功，却仍然会撞墙？他们可能仍然会得到晋升，但他们仍然面临着一定程度的沮丧，对自己的领导方式感到不安。这让我思考，这背后是什么？然后我发现，驱动行为的是信念。它是我们的内部操作系统。所以我看到这种情况发生在我的客户身上，坦率地说，我也看到它发生在我自己身上，我在职业上或其他方面不断遇到某些障碍，并认识到，嗯，也许我在某种程度上促成了这些障碍。这不仅仅是改变我正在做的事情，而是改变我对所做事情的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
I mean, really, it
was a parallel path,
I think, on two levels.
So the first level is,
I saw with my clients
that we were very
action oriented
in terms of moving towards
the goals that they had.
And so we were very quick,
if they received feedback
to say, OK, well here's
what you're going to do.
But what I found is that
it wasn't sustainable.
They were able to take the
actions, change the behavior,
but it was short lived.
And so I became curious around
why is it that they still
keep hitting a wall,
even though they might
be successful on the outside.
They may still
get the promotion,
but they were still
facing a level
of frustration, a level
of unease with the way
that they were leading.
That led me to think,
well, what's behind that?
And I then found that, well,
what's driving the behavior
is the belief.
It's our internal
operating system.
So I saw this happen with my
clients, and quite frankly,
I also saw it happen
with myself, where
I kept hitting certain walls,
professionally or otherwise,
and recognized that,
well, maybe I'm
contributing to
them in some way.
And it's not just about
changing what I'm doing,
but it's also about
changing the way
I think about what I'm doing.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 所以，如果你得到的反馈是你是**微观管理者**（Micromanager: 指对下属工作细节过度干预和控制的管理者），那不是“好的，我如何停止微观管理”，而是“我为什么要微观管理”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So it's
like if you get feedback
that you're a
micromanager, it's not,
OK, how do I stop micromanaging,
it's why do I micromanage.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 完全正确。是什么在驱动这种微观管理？很多时候，这基于你对你所管理的人的看法，或者你对你所做的工作的看法，或者你对自己的看法，这些看法最终导致了那种行为。有趣的是，Alison，这并不是什么新鲜事。它适用于许多其他领域。想想健康。想想减肥。人们总是说，在你改变与食物的关系之前，你必须改变你对食物的看法，这才会改变你的饮食方式等等。那么，为什么它不能应用于我们的工作方式，当然，还有我们的领导方式呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
What's driving the
micromanagement.
Which is, a lot of
times based on, well,
what are you thinking about
the folks that you're managing,
or what are you thinking about
the work that you're doing,
or what are you thinking
about yourself that's
then leading to that behavior?
And what's interesting,
Alison, is this is nothing new.
It's something that's applied
in a lot of other domains.
You think about health.
You think about weight loss.
People always say you've got to
change your mindset around food
before you can change your
relationship with food,
which then changes the way you
eat and all the rest of it.
Well, then so why can't it
apply to the way that we work
and certainly, the
way that we lead?</p>
</details>

### 最常见的七种隐性障碍

ALISON BEARD: 那么你是如何识别出人们最常遇到的障碍类型的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So how did
you go about identifying
the most common types of
blockers that people experience?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的。所以我再次变得好奇，不仅是是否存在可能阻碍你的信念，我还想知道，是否有某些信念是跨越不同类型领导者的？所以我审视了我过去20年指导过的300多位领导者，并寻找证据，看看是什么可能驱动了他们的行为。我当时不确定是否会发现什么，但出乎意料的是，有七种信念浮出水面。这并不是说它们是唯一可能阻碍你的信念，但它们是我合作过的这些领导者中最常见的，顺便说一下，这些领导者在性别、人口统计学和行业方面都有所不同。所以它们在出现的地方是相当普遍的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah.
So I became curious, again,
around, not only are there
beliefs that might get in
your way, but then I wondered,
are there some that cross
different types of leaders?
So I looked across
over 300 of the leaders
that I had coached
over the past 20 years
and looked to see what evidence
there was around what might
be driving their behavior.
And I wasn't sure if I was
going to find anything,
but lo and behold,
there were seven
that bubbled up to the top.
Now, that's not to say they
are the only beliefs that
might get in your way, but
these were the most common ones
across these leaders that I had
worked with who, by the way,
differed in terms of gender,
in terms of demographics,
in terms of sectors.
So it's pretty agnostic in
terms of where they showed up.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 而且，它们在层级上也不同。这可能发生在非常初级的员工身上，也可能发生在C级高管身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And also, they
differed in terms of level
in the hierarchy.
This can happen to
someone who's very junior,
as well as someone
who's in the C-suite.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的，我的意思是，我观察的大多数人至少都处于管理职位，所以他们确实领导着其他人。但问题是，当你试图大规模领导时，它们会变得更具影响力。所以，如果你在领导力发展管道中不断晋升，或者在你的职业生涯中不断进步，那么它们阻碍你的风险就越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, I mean, most
of the folks that I looked
at were, in at very least,
managerial positions,
so they did lead others.
But what happens is they become
more consequential the more
that you're trying
to lead at scale.
So the more that you are going
up through the leadership
pipeline, if you
will, or advancing
in your profession,
the more that there's
a risk of them
getting in the way.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 我想让我们的听众了解这七种障碍是什么。我们不能深入探讨所有这些，但我们会探讨其中几个。这七种是——我需要参与其中，我需要立即完成，我知道我是对的，我不能犯错，如果我能做到，你也能；我不能说不，以及我不属于这里。所以“我需要立即完成”肯定引起了许多人的共鸣，尤其是在当今一切都以如此快的速度发展，我们需要结果的环境下。那么谈谈它是如何表现出来的，以及它可能造成的损害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So I want to
clue our listeners in to what
the seven blockers are.
We can't dig into all
of them, but we'll
dig into a few of them.
So the seven are--
I need to be involved, I need
it done now, I'm know I'm right,
I can't make a mistake,
if I can do it,
so can you; I can't say no,
and I don't belong here.
So the I need it done
now certainly resonates
with many people, particularly
in today's climate
where everything is moving
at such a fast pace,
we need a result. So talk
about how that manifests itself
and the damage
that it can cause.</p>
</details>

### 隐性障碍一：我需要立即完成

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的，所以它表现出来的方式，坦率地说，可能不会以你感到“哦，天哪，我有这个信念，它正在对我造成可怕的后果”的内部线索形式表现出来，但它肯定会对其他人产生后果。它表现出来的方式是，感觉缺乏优先级。我们把所有事情都等同于既重要又紧急。感觉人们筋疲力尽，因为他们正在做各种事情，以便完成清单上的所有任务。哦，顺便说一句，它从来没有感觉任何事情是完成的。它看起来也像是经常发生变化。所以你在组织层面处于变革加速的循环中，这也会带来可怕的后果，因为组织可能没有能力或准备好如此频繁地维持这种程度的变革。所以它在外部表现出来的方式有很多种。坦率地说，唯一觉得从中受益的人是持有这种信念的领导者本身，因为他们认为自己正在提高生产力。但实际上，正在发生的是**有毒生产力**（Toxic Productivity: 指不惜一切代价追求生产力，导致身心俱疲、人际关系受损的过度工作状态），也就是说，当你试图不惜一切代价做事情时，这会对组织内的人员以及你建立公司能力的能力产生严重影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Yeah, so the
way that it manifests itself,
quite frankly, it may
not manifest itself
in terms of you feeling an
internal queue of oh, my gosh,
I have this belief, and it's
having dire consequences on me,
but it certainly has
consequences on everyone else.
And the way it shows up
is, it feels like there's
lack of prioritization.
We are equating everything
as important and urgent
at the same time.
It feels like people
are burned out
because they are pulling
all types of things
to be able to get
everything on the list done.
And oh, by the way, it never
feels like anything is done.
It also looks like there's
frequent change happening.
So you're on the change
acceleration wheel
at an organizational
level, which
also, has dire consequences
because the organization may not
be equipped or ready to
sustain that level of change
so frequently.
So there are a number of ways
that it shows up externally.
And quite frankly,
the only person
who feels like they're
benefiting from it
is the leader itself who holds
that belief, because they think
that they are being productive.
But in actuality,
what's happening
is toxic productivity,
which is, when
you're trying to do
things at all costs
or at any cost, which then has
a severe impact on the people
within your organization and
your ability to build capacity
within that company.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 是的。我们将讨论如何解除这些障碍的过程。但首先，让我们深入探讨更多例子。“我能做到，所以你也应该能做到。”这真的引起了作为**X世代**（Generation X: 指大致出生于1965年至1980年之间的人群）的我，在与来自不同世代、以不同方式运作的人打交道时的共鸣。它也是一个功能性的问题。我来自新闻背景，而不是企业背景。谈谈如果这是我的障碍，它如何阻碍我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And we're going to talk
through the process
for unblocking yourself.
But first, let's dig in
to a few more examples.
I can do it, so you
should be able to too.
That really resonates
with me as a Gen Xer
who is dealing with people from
many different generations, who
operate in a different
way than I do.
It also is a functional thing.
I come from a journalism
background, not a corporate one.
Talk about why, if
that's my blocker,
it could be holding me back.</p>
</details>

### 隐性障碍二：我能做到，所以你也能

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的，有趣的是，所有这些信念都源于一个好的初衷。意图是好的，我们常常认为“如果我能做到，你也能”是激励性的。如果我这个小小的我都能做到，你为什么不能做到呢？但这里的假设是，这个人所带来的与你所带来的是完全相同的，这完全与**人才发展基础**（Developing People 101: 指人才培养和发展领域的基本原则和入门知识）背道而驰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, so you what's
interesting, all of these
beliefs come from a good place.
The intent is good, and we often
think about that if I can do it,
so can you, is motivational.
If I can do it, little old
me, why can't you do it?
But the assumption there is
that what the person is bringing
to the table is
exactly what you bring
to the table, which
runs completely counter
to Developing People 101.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 然后他们会完全按照——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And then they'll
do it exactly the way--</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 而且你会完全按照——完全正确。所以如果我们思考如何发展人才，如何在组织中领导变革，如何在组织中提升能力。第一条规则是，你必须从人们的现状出发。这甚至是一切谈判或影响的基础。因此，能够从人们的现状出发的技能和能够做到这一点的思维模式，是许多不同领域取得高效的关键。所以如果我们的出发点是“不，从我的现状出发”，这本质上就是“如果我能做到，你也能”所表达的，那么我们就会阻碍自己在许多不同领域真正发挥效用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: And that
you'll do it exactly--
exactly.
So if we think about
how to develop people,
how to lead change
in an organization,
how to grow capacity, again,
within an organization.
The number one
rule is, you've got
to meet people where they are.
That, even, underlies any
negotiation or any influence.
And so the skill of being able
to meet people where they are
and the mindset to
be able to do that
is what leads to a
lot of effectiveness
in so many different domains.
So if our starting point is no,
meet me where I am, which is,
essentially, what the if I
can do it, so can you says,
then we're getting in our
way of really being effective
in a number of different areas.</p>
</details>

### 隐性障碍三：我不能犯错

ALISON BEARD: 然后我想谈的第三个是害怕犯错。因为我认为，特别是当你达到一定级别时，你期望你所做的事情，以及每个人都看着你，期望你是完美的。但我也认为，在当前经济和地缘政治高度不确定，技术不断变化的时代，人们感到有些麻痹。他们肯定可能更厌恶风险，因为一步走错真的可能对他们的职业生涯产生可怕的后果。所以请谈谈你现在如何看待“我不能犯错”这种信念在你的客户身上体现出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And then the third
one I just want to touch on
is fear of making mistakes.
Because I think, particularly,
when you get to a certain level,
you expect that
what you're doing
and that everyone sees
you and looks at you
and expects you to be perfect.
But then I think also,
in times like this
of great economic and
geopolitical uncertainty,
with technological
change, people
feel a little bit paralyzed.
And they definitely are
maybe more risk averse,
because a misstep could
really have dire consequences
for their career.
So talk a little
bit about how you
see this I can't make a mistake
playing out for your clients
right now.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的，绝对如此。所以“我不能犯错”这种信念确实阻碍了前进。我的客户中担任领导职位的人很清楚，他们有两项任务，特别是在领导组织时。一项任务是他们必须管理风险。是的，绝对如此。这并不是要成为一个鲁莽的犯错者。你必须管理风险。但他们的另一项任务是推动组织朝着它需要前进的战略方向发展。我们需要取得成果。我们需要能够实现你希望实现的任何指标。而“我不能犯错”往往会阻碍公式的后半部分，因为我们开始担心做出决策。我们开始担心确立立场。这可能导致过于频繁地改变方向，而不是努力坚持到底。这甚至可能导致不授权和不培养内部人才。所以它只是阻碍我们履行我们实际拥有的一些领导责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, absolutely.
So the I can't make a
mistake belief really
gets in the way of being
able to move forward.
And what's clear
with my clients who
hold leadership
positions is they
have two mandates,
particularly when
they are leading organizations.
One mandate is they
have to manage risk.
Yes, absolutely.
This is not about being
a reckless mistake maker.
You ought to manage risk.
But there are other mandate is
to move the organization forward
in the strategic direction
that it needs to go in.
We need to get results.
We need to be able to
deliver to whatever metrics
you're looking to deliver to.
The I can't make a mistake
tends to hold that latter part
of the formula back
because we become concerned
about making decisions.
We become concerned about
putting a stake in the ground.
It can lead to changing
course too often,
instead of trying
to follow through.
It can lead to then even not
delegating and building people
from within.
So it just holds us
back from exacting
some of the leadership
responsibilities
that we actually have.</p>
</details>

### 克服障碍的动力

ALISON BEARD: 是的。在职业生涯方面，你确实指出，有障碍的人仍然可以得到晋升。他们仍然可以在组织中晋升到非常高的位置。那么对于那些可能认为自己的一些障碍是富有成效的，比如完美主义者或要求紧迫性的人来说，推动他们完成所需工作的动力是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And career wise, you do make the
point that people with blockers
can still get promoted.
They can still rise very
high in the organization.
So for someone who maybe thinks
that some of their blockers
are productive, being a
perfectionist or demanding
urgency, what's the impetus
for doing the work required
to push through them?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 我的意思是，总得有一个动力。改变不会仅仅因为闲着说“哦，也许今天我会做出一些改变”而发生。所以通常，要么是外部强加的一些东西。例如，很多时候，“我不能犯错”作为一个隐性信念，它会引起你的老板、你的同事、你的下属等利益相关者的很多挫败感。如果你作为领导者不想疏远或挫败你的同事或利益相关者，那么你就会决定做一些不同的事情。所以这可能是一个动力。但另一方面，同样，也可能有一个内部线索。如果它正在制造一些焦虑，如果你认识到你没有按照你需要的方式前进，你没有达到你想要的水平，或者你的组织没有足够快地前进。那么你必须质疑你在其中扮演了什么角色？你可能不需要对整个事情负责，但你肯定要对其中一部分负责，这可能受到你如何思考你的组织需要采取的行动的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, there
always has to be an impetus.
The change doesn't happen just
from lying around and saying,
oh, maybe today, I'll
exact some change.
So usually, it's
either something
from the outside
that gets imposed.
So a lot of times with the
I can't make a mistake,
as an example, for that
being a hidden belief
is, it causes a
lot of frustration
from stakeholders
your boss, your peers,
those who work for you.
And if you as a leader do not
want to alienate or frustrate
your counterparts or
your stakeholders,
then you decide that you want
to do something different.
So that might be an impetus.
But the other is that, again,
there can be an internal queue.
If it's creating
some angst, if you're
recognizing that you're not
moving forward in the way
that you need to that you're
not performing at the level
at which you would like, or
that your organization is not
moving fast enough.
Then you have to question
what part of that are you
contributing to?
You might not be responsible
for the whole thing,
but you certainly are
responsible for one part of it,
and that can be
driven by how you're
thinking about the actions your
organization needs to take.</p>
</details>

### 诊断和命名隐性信念

ALISON BEARD: 那么，如果你感觉到这些事情，无论是你的团队感到沮丧，还是你个人觉得“有些不对劲”，你如何诊断你的具体问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So if you're
sensing these things,
either your team is
frustrated or you personally
are like, something
is off, how do you
go about diagnosing what
your specific problem is?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 那就是你开始命名它的时候。所以第一步实际上是揭示存在一些**认知失调**，然后命名导致你正在经历的这种失调的信念。所有这些都必须在你做任何不同事情之前发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: That's
when you start to name it.
So the first step is
really even uncovering
that there's some
dissonance and then naming
the belief that is
contributing to the dissonance
that you're experiencing.
That all has to happen before
you do anything differently.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 你有没有见过人们在弄清楚它是什么时遇到困难，或者当它被指出时，他们会抵触？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And do you
ever see people struggle
to figure out what it is or
if what it is is pointed out
to them, they push back on it?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 绝对有。因为信念本身并不是坏事。它帮助过你。它可能就是让你迄今为止取得成功的原因。但如果我们真正审视作为领导者适应性意味着什么，你必须能够打开**视角**（Aperture: 指观察事物的广度或开放程度），并说，有可能过去帮助我的东西现在可能不再帮助我了。那时他们才开始稍微放松一些。同时也要明白，你不需要摆脱那个信念。我的意思是，我们当然不想摆脱“我不能犯错”的信念，因为在某些时候，我们需要坚持那个信念。但同样，作为领导者要更加广阔，并能够处理你正在处理的复杂性，这将要求你利用不同的思维模式，那些在当时会有效的思维模式。所以，一旦领导者开始明白，通过探索并能够暂时把那个信念放在一边，并探索其他思维模式，一旦他们开始明白这可以成为他们的超能力，以实际应对他们所处时代的复杂性，那么他们就会认识到这是一种可以利用的资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
Because the belief, in
and of itself, is not bad.
It has helped you.
It's probably what's made
you successful up until now.
But if we really
look at what it means
to be adaptable as
a leader, you've
gotta be able to open
up the aperture and say,
there is a possibility
that what has helped
me may not be helping me now.
And that's when they start
loosening the grip a little bit.
It's also understanding
that you don't
need to get rid of that belief.
I mean, we certainly
don't want to get rid
of the belief of I
can't make a mistake,
because there are certain
points in time where
we need to hold on to that one.
But again, being more
expansive as a leader
and being able to deal
with the complexity
that you're dealing
with is going
to require you to tap
into different mindsets,
the ones that are going to
be effective for that time.
So what it does
is, once a leader
starts understanding that
by exploring and being
able to put that one
to the side for even
a limited amount of time and
exploring other mindsets,
once they start
understanding that that
can be their superpower,
to actually deal
with the complexities of
the times that they're in,
then they recognize that it's
an asset that they can leverage.</p>
</details>

### 理解信念而非立即改变

ALISON BEARD: 然后我们大多数人会说：“好的，我的问题是我是一个完美主义者。我不能犯错，所以让我改变这个信念。”为什么你会有这个中间步骤，即在尝试修复它之前，更好地理解这个信念是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And then
most of us would then say,
OK, my problem is that
I'm a perfectionist.
I can't make mistakes, so
let me change that belief.
Why do you have this
middle step that
is about better understanding
what the belief is
before you try to fix it?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 对。所以第一步是揭示它，然后是剖析它。剖析就是，让我理解这个信念为什么会存在。在某种程度上，你正在与它成为朋友。因为正如我之前所说，它不是坏事。它只是此刻不为你服务。如果你不理解它何时为你服务，何时不为你服务，你就有更高的风险在错误的场合再次重复它。所以这个过程的一部分是理解在你生命的哪个阶段，在你的职业生涯中，在不同的情况下，它确实帮助了你，这样你就可以评估你所面临的情况，就像我们对待企业一样。你可以评估你所面临的情况，并积极主动地说，我需要将什么样的信念或思维模式带入这种特定情况，以增加我达到我期望结果的可能性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.
So the first is you
want to uncover it,
then you want to unpack it.
And the unpacking
is, let me understand
why this belief is even here.
In a way, you're befriending it.
Because as I said
before, it's not bad.
It's just not serving
you in this moment.
And if you can't understand
when it is serving you,
when it is not
serving you, you have
a higher risk of repeating it
again in the wrong situations.
So part of that process
is understanding
at what point in your
life, in your career,
in different situations,
did it actually
help you so that you
can assess situations,
Just as we do with a business.
You can assess situations
that you're facing
and be proactive and say,
what kind of belief or mindset
do I need to bring into
this particular situation
to increase the probability
that I will get to the outcomes
that I desire?</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 那么现在我们可以开始修复它了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So now
can we get to fixing it?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Yes.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 好的，太棒了。你已经揭示了它，剖析了它，现在你需要前进并改变自己，从一个认为自己不能犯错的人变成一个不同的人。这必须从真正相信自己可以改变开始。如果你一直将自己定义为完美主义者，这是你身份的一部分，你如何转变为一种不再是完美主义者的模式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: OK, great.
So you've uncovered,
you've unpacked,
and now, you need to move
forward and change yourself
from someone who thinks
they can't make mistakes
to a different person.
That has to start with
actually just believing
that you can change.
If you've always identified
as a perfectionist,
it's part of your identity, how
do you move to a mode in which
you wouldn't?</p>
</details>

### 信念的重构与行动

MURIEL WILKINS: Alison，你甚至使用了“改变你是谁”这个术语，这非常有趣。因为实际上，我并不认为这是改变你是谁。原因如下。我认为，这背后是人们错误地将自己的信念等同于自己。我们所有的信念都是后天习得的。它们是我们为了成功，或者为了在生命早期以及我们一生中所处的任何环境中生存或茁壮成长而学到的东西。这里的关键是它们是可塑的。它们是你可以根据自己想要的东西而改变的东西，而不是对你过去经历的反应。但这不一定会改变你作为一个人是谁。如果说有什么不同的话，它会扩展你是谁。所以当你开始从这个角度看待它时，我认为这就是导致更多开放性的思维模式，让你说：“哦，好的，是的，我可以接受另一个信念，或者我现在可以以这种方式开始工作”，这反过来又让你能够真正进入行动阶段，也就是说，如果我接受这个新信念，如果我重新构建了它，并且我从“我不能犯错”转变为“我们将尽我们所能，利用我们拥有的资源”，或者“我们将尽我们所能，利用我们拥有的信息”，那么你就可以说：“好的，那么哪些行动与此相符，能让我达到我想要的结果？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: So it's
so interesting, Alison,
that you're even using the
terminology change who you are.
Because actually, I don't see
this as changing who you are.
And here's why.
I think underlying,
this is people
mistaken that their
beliefs who they are.
All of our beliefs are learned.
They're what we learned
in order to be successful
or in order to survive
or thrive in any context
that we were in early on in life
and as we moved through life.
The key here is
they're malleable.
They are things that
you can change according
to what it is that you
want, rather than react
to the experiences that
you had in the past.
But it doesn't necessarily
change who you are as a person.
If anything, it
expands who you are.
And so when you start seeing
it from that perspective,
I think that that is the mindset
that then leads to more openness
to say, oh, OK, yes, I
can pick up another belief
or I can now start doing the
work in this way, which then
allows you to actually move
into this action phase, which
is, if I pick up this new
belief, if I've reframed it
and I've moved from I can't make
a mistake to we're going to do
the best that we can with
the resources that we have,
or we're going to do
the best that we can
with the information that
we have, then you can say,
OK, well,
what actions align
with that that it
will allow me to get to
the outcome that I want?</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 是的。还有哪些例子可以重新构建这些无效的障碍？也许我们可以讨论一下我们之前讨论过的其他一些，比如“如果我能做到，你也能”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
What are some other
examples of ways to reframe
these unproductive blockers?
So maybe we'll take
some of the others
that we discussed, like,
if I can do it, so can you.</p>
</details>

### 重构具体障碍的例子

MURIEL WILKINS: 所以如果我能为你做到——让我在这里退一步。我认为非常重要的是，正如你必须命名原始信念一样，人们也必须拥有重新构建的信念。所以我可以给出例子，但归根结底，工作是想出一个适合你的信念。所以“我能做到，你也能”的重新构建非常简单。我会从你的现状出发。这是一个不同的起点。这并不意味着你仍然不认为产出是关键，或者你不认为任务很重要。你只是采取了不同的路径来实现目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: So if I
can do it for you-- and let
me just take a step back here.
I think it's very
important that just as you
have to name what the
original belief is,
it's also very important that
people own what the reframe is.
So I can suggest examples,
but at the end of the day,
the work is to say
come up with one
that's going to work for you.
And so the I can do it, so can
you, it's a very simple reframe.
I will meet you where you are.
It's a different starting line.
Doesn't mean that
you're still not holding
the output as critical or
you don't think the task
is important.
You're just taking a
different path to get there.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 是的。那“我需要立即完成”呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And what about I
need it done now?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: “我需要立即完成”，这是一个棘手的问题，因为你必须真正认识到也许不是——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: I
need it done now,
that's a tricky one
because you have to really
recognize that maybe not--</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 有时候——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Sometimes</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 有时候你需要。在那些情况下，房子着火了。我需要立即完成。我需要你离开房子。但并非所有事情都是火灾。所以要明白，重新构建可以是这样的：“如果这是一个优先事项，我需要立即完成。”或者“如果它确实很紧急，我需要立即完成。”或者“如果它符合我们为本月、本年设定的目标参数，我需要立即完成。”所以围绕这个，你所规定的一条普遍规则，就产生了一个过滤器，这使得它在每种情况下都不再是普遍的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Sometimes you do.
And in those situations,
the house is on fire.
I need it done now.
I need you to get
out of the house.
But not everything is a fire.
And so it's understanding that
the reframe can be something
like, I need it done
now if it's a priority.
Or I need it done now,
if it's actually urgent.
Or I need it done
now, if it falls
within the parameters of what
we have set as our objectives
for this month, this year.
So there's a filter that's
created around this,
what you have prescribed
as a universal rule, which
then turns it as not universal
across every situation.</p>
</details>

### 案例研究：我确信我是对的

ALISON BEARD: 是的。你能给我们举一个你合作过或遇到过的高管的例子吗？他们经历了这一过程，将一个隐性障碍转化为一个更具生产力的信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
So can you give us an
example of an executive
that you've worked
with or encountered
that has gone
through this process
to turn a hidden blocker into
a more productive belief?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 绝对可以。我最喜欢的一个例子，我经常谈论，是我合作过的一位高管，他的隐性信念或隐性障碍是：“我知道我是对的。”这其中的棘手之处在于，他实际上大部分时间都是对的。所以很多时候我们听到的是，“也许你可以听听不同的解决方案。”实际上，那些持有这种信念的人，他们有证据表明很多时候他们是对的。他们有一种不可思议的能力，能够预见未来。问题是，这在他们表现出来的方式上产生了后果。他疏远了许多利益相关者。人们真的不喜欢和他一起开会，因为他总是以自己知道答案的方式来领导。他之所以决定重新构建它或以不同的方式看待它，是因为他认识到他的工作不再仅仅是成为一个主题专家。他的工作是在那个组织中领导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
So one of my favorites,
which I talk about,
is one of the
executives I worked
with who, his hidden
belief or hidden blocker
was, I know I'm right.
And what was tricky
about that is,
he actually was right
most of the time.
So a lot of times we
hear, well, maybe you
could hear a different solution.
Actually, the folks who
have that as a belief,
they have evidence that a
lot of times, they are right.
And they have this uncanny
ability to see around corners.
The issue is that there
was then a consequence
to that in terms of the way
that he demonstrated it.
He was alienating a lot
of his stakeholders.
People really didn't
like to be in meetings
with him, because
that's what he led with,
is him knowing the answer.
What led him to then decide that
he wanted to reframe it or look
at it differently is
when he recognized
that his job was no longer to
just be a subject-matter expert.
His job was to lead
in that organization.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 随着他们职位的晋升，很多人都会遇到这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And
that's something
that so many people
struggle with as they
rise through the ranks.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 完全正确。所以领导不仅仅是向人们提供答案。领导还包括培养能力，让他们能够自己找到答案。这是领导的一部分，你正在建立系统。你正在培养人才。哦，顺便说一句，以一种你不会疏远所有你需要一起工作的人的方式来做，而是让他们真正保持一致。所以当他重新定义成功是什么，他想要的结果是什么时，我们就可以倒推，然后说：“好的，那么你需要什么样的信念才能达到那种成功，而不仅仅是得到答案。”他的重新构建是：“我需要引导人们找到正确的答案”，而不是“我有正确的答案”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Exactly.
And so leading was not just
about feeding the answers
to folks.
That leading was also
about building the capacity
so that they could come
up with the answers.
That's part of leading is
you're building systems.
You're building people.
And oh, by the way,
to do it in a way
where you're not alienating
everyone else that you need
to be able to do the
work, but you're actually
getting them aligned.
And so when he
redefined what success
was, what the outcome
was that he wanted,
then we could work
backwards and say, OK, so
what is the belief
that you would
need to be able to reach
that type of success,
rather than just
getting to the answer.
And his reframe was,
I need to guide people
to the right answer, rather
than I have the right answer.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 是的，但这太慢了。所以很多人都为此挣扎。如果我这样做，当然，如果我正在编辑一篇稿件，我知道句子应该怎么写，我不会在旁边评论：“嗨，你能强调这个而不是那个吗？”我只是重写。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah,
that's just slow though.
And so a lot of people
struggle with that.
If I do, certainly,
if I'm editing a piece
and I know how the
sentence should read,
I don't make a comment
in the margins, hi,
could you emphasize
this instead of this?
I just redo it.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 这又取决于你的结果是什么。所以如果你的预期结果，你想要的结果是，我只是想尽快把这个事情搞定，那么这对你来说是有效的。但如果预期结果是，我还想培养这个人，我想让他们下次能够自己解决这个问题，那么就必须采取不同的方法，因为直接告诉他们答案是做不到的。你正在那里创造的是**习得性无助**（Learned Helplessness: 指个体在经历多次失败或无法控制的负面事件后，形成的认为自己无法改变现状的消极心理状态）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: And
it depends, again,
on what your outcomes are.
And so if your desired
outcome, you're
the result you want is, I'm just
trying to get this out the door
as quickly as possible,
then that works for you.
But if the desired
outcome is, I also
want to build talent
in this person,
and I want them to be
able to figure this
out on their own the
next time around,
then there has to be
a different approach,
because feeding them the
answer is not going to do that.
What you're creating there
is learned helplessness.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 对，天哪。好的，Muriel，我可能在这之后需要一些辅导课程。我以为有不同的障碍，但也许那就是我的障碍。那么如果人们同时与几个障碍作斗争，你有什么建议来解决它们呢？是逐一解决吗？还是可以同时解决多个？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD:
Right Oh, goodness.
OK, I might need some coaching
sessions after this, Muriel.
I thought there were
different blockers,
but maybe that's my one.
So if people can struggle with
several blockers at one time,
what's your advice for
how to tackle them?
Is it one by one?
Can you do multiple at once?</p>
</details>

### 如何处理多个障碍？

MURIEL WILKINS: 是的，我的建议是，选择一个，这实际上是基于你如何或应该如何进行任何改变，那就是一次只选择一件事。所以我建议选择一个，选择你最有动力去解决的那个，或者可能是对你造成最即时后果并真正带来代价的那个，然后解决它。我甚至尽量避免使用“工作”这个词，而是使用“练习”。因为这是一种练习。它永无止境。我的意思是，你刚才问我，我有没有遇到过什么困难？我甚至不认为它们是困难。每次它们出现时，我都能更快地识别它们。当它们出现时，我就会想：“你又来了。我们知道该怎么做。”这就是我们想要达到的目标。它让你变得更灵活，以应对你面前的任何情况，这样你就可以在当下自我教练。你练习得越多，所需的时间就越少。你衡量的是你的纠错速度比过去快得多，而且你能够比以前更容易地进入那些情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Yeah, my advice is,
pick one, which
is really grounded
in any way you can or
should ever do change
is pick one thing at a time.
And so I would say
pick one, pick the one
that you're either most
motivated to work on or the one,
potentially, that's having the
most just-in-time consequences
for you and is really creating
a cost, and work on that one.
And I even try to hesitate
using the word work,
but rather, practice it.
Because this is a practice.
It never ends.
I mean, you just asked me, are
there any that I struggle with?
And I don't really even
think about them as struggle.
Every time they pop up,
I'm now able to recognize
them a lot faster.
And when they pop up, I'm
like, there you are again.
We know what to do.
And that's where
we want to get to.
It's making yourself
more nimble to deal
with any situation
in front of you
so that you can coach
yourself in the moment.
And the more you practice
it, the less time it takes.
And what you're measuring is
that your course correction is
a lot faster than
it was in the past,
and that you are able to enter
those situations with a lot more
ease than you previously have.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 所以这种练习是，信念突然出现在你的脑海中，然后你立即重新构建它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So
the practice is,
the belief pops into your head
and you reframe it right away.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 这种练习是，信念突然出现在你的脑海中。你注意到它出现了。你可能甚至还没有命名它。你注意到存在**认知失调**。有些地方不对劲。是什么信念在驱动这种不对劲？我在做什么？是什么在驱动它？如果我想要一些不同的东西，让我重新构建那个信念，这将增加我达到我实际想要的结果的可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: The practice is,
the belief pops in your head.
You notice that it pops up.
You might not even
name it just yet.
You notice there's a dissonance.
Something feels off.
What's the belief
that's driving the off.
What am I doing?
What's driving it?
If I want something
differently, let
me reframe the
belief that's going
to increase the
probability that I will
get to what I actually want.</p>
</details>

### 自我教练与赋能他人

ALISON BEARD: 是的。人们可以自己做这件事吗？我们不想让这成为Muriel教练的广告。但人们需要教练吗？他们需要治疗师吗？他们需要导师吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Yeah.
And can people do
this themselves?
We don't want to make this
an advertisement for Muriel
coaching.
But do people need a coach?
Do they need therapist?
Do they need a mentor?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 我正在努力让自己失业。当我作为高管教练与人们一对一合作时，我衡量成功的标准是，当我们完成时，他们能够自己完成这项工作。我知道他们可以，因为他们会问我一些问题。在我开口之前，他们就会说：“我 K 已经知道我需要问自己什么了。”所以这里的关键在于你问自己的问题，因为答案已经存在了。所以是的，我绝对相信人们可以自己做这件事。他们可以在大多数情况下学会自我教练。也许不是所有情况。我们有时都需要一些额外的支持。但如果领导者能够学会自我教练，这会提高他们教练他人的能力，然后会提高他们更轻松地面对情况的能力，我的天哪，这肯定也会让其他人更容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: I'm trying
to work myself out of a job.
When I work with folks one on
one as their executive coach,
I measure the success that
by the time we're done,
they're able to do this
work on themselves.
And I know that they
can, because they'll
ask me something.
And before I can even open
my mouth, they'll say,
I already know what
I need to ask myself.
So the key here is
in the questions
that you're asking yourself,
because the answer is already
there.
And so yes, I absolutely
believe that folks
can do this for themselves.
They can learn to coach
themselves in most situations.
Maybe not.
We all need sometimes
a little extra support.
But if leaders can learn
to coach themselves,
it increases their
ability to coach others,
and it then increases
their ability
to face situations with more
ease, which, my goodness, would
certainly make things easier
for everyone else as well.</p>
</details>

### 组织层面的应用

ALISON BEARD: 人们不仅对自己的信念，而且对他们的组织、行业或团队的信念，是否有任何应用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: Are
there any applications
to beliefs that people have
not just about themselves,
but about their organization or
their industry or their teams?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 绝对有。这些问题在于，通常情况下，我们外部的事物，他们的团队、他们的组织等等，都不是你所能控制的。所以虽然我们可以坐下来重新构建它们，这可能有助于让你感觉平静一些，但你无法对此采取行动。所以我总是说从自己开始。这并不是说你要对发生的一切负全部责任，但你肯定会贡献一部分，特别是作为领导者。而且，即使你不是从行动的角度贡献，有时它只是你想要改变你体验所面临挑战的方式。我的意思是，我们谈论了现在宏观层面正在发生的不确定性。那么，体验这种不确定性有不同的方式。你确实可以控制的一件事是你如何体验任何情况，但它不是从你在那种情况下做什么开始的。它从你如何思考你在那种情况下做什么开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: Absolutely.
The issue with those
is that, oftentimes,
the things on the outside of us,
their teams, their organization,
et cetera, are not things
that are in your control.
And so while we
can sit and reframe
them, which could be
helpful in just making
you feel a little
calmer, you can't then
exact the action against it.
And so I always
say start with you.
Not to say you hold
full responsibility
for whatever is happening,
but you certainly
contribute some of it,
particularly as a leader.
And if anything, even if
you're not contributing to it
from an action
standpoint, sometimes it's
just a way that
you want to change
the way that you're experiencing
the challenges that you're
facing.
I mean, we talked
about the uncertainty
that's happening right
now on a macro level.
Well, there are different
ways of experiencing
that uncertainty.
And something that you
do have control over
is how you experience
any situation,
but it doesn't start from
what you do in that situation.
It starts with what
you think about what
you do in that situation.</p>

and you need to change.</p>

MURIEL WILKINS: 因为我知道我对你的隐性障碍是正确的。所以绝对可以。我再次会说，你应该从自己开始。你可以首先，以身作则，展示如何完成这项工作。那么这看起来像什么呢？你在一个会议中，在你开始谈论你希望团队做什么之前，你非常清楚你的假设和信念是什么。再次，假设是另一种表达方式。这可能让你感觉更舒服。但如果你正在帮助团队中的其他人，比如说你正在与团队中的某人进行反馈会议或反馈对话，而不是直接说：“这是反馈，你需要做什么”，你可能会问他们，例如，“在你以那种方式处理情况之前，你对那种情况有什么想法？”如果你有人在会议中犹豫不决，例如，你可以问他们：“当你在那些会议中时，你有什么想法阻碍了你发言？”这然后帮助你深入了解，他们需要什么样的思维模式？然后你可以转变为：“你需要怎么想，你需要做出什么假设才能让你在那些会议中发言？”这又让他们在面对那种特定情况的不同方法方面，有了更多的选择。

<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS:
Because I know I'm
right about your hidden blocker.
So Absolutely.
Again, I would say that you
ought to start with yourself.
And you can number
one, role model
what it looks like to
be able to do this work.
So what does that look like?
You're in a meeting
and before you
start talking about what
you want the team to do,
you make it very clear
what your assumptions are
and your beliefs are right.
Again, assumptions is a
different way of framing it.
That may feel more
comfortable for you.
But then if you're helping
others on your team
before, let's say you're
having a feedback session
or feedback conversation
with someone on your team,
instead of moving directly
to here's the feedback,
here's what you need to do,
you may want to ask them,
for example, what were you
thinking about that situation
before you approached
it in that way.
If you have somebody who
is hesitant to speak up
in meetings, for
example, can ask
them, what is it that
you're thinking when you're
in those meetings that's getting
in the way of you speaking up?
And that then helps
you drill down to,
what is the mindset that
they would need to have?
You can then shift
to, what would
you need to think, what
assumptions would you
need to make to enable you to
speak up in those meetings?
And that, again, allows them to
open up in terms of the choices
that they have for
different approaches
in that particular situation.</p>

### 总结与展望

ALISON BEARD: 假设我们所有人都开始这样做，在我们的团队中，在我们的组织中。你认为最主要的积极益处是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD:
Let's say all of us
start to do this, in our
team, in our organization.
What do you see as the
overarching positive benefit?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 我的意思是，你看，我认为关于组织文化有很多讨论。当你思考一个组织文化时，它就是一系列集体信念。所以我认为在集体层面，如果每个人都开始审视我们正在带入的信念是什么，我们需要什么样的信念才能拥有我们想要的那种地方，那将推动组织中真正的文化变革，坦率地说，也会推动组织之外的所有变革。

<details>

<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: I mean, look,
I think there's so much talk
about organizational culture.
And when you think about
an organizational culture,
all it is is a collective
set of beliefs.
And so I think at
a collective level,
if everyone started to
check what are the beliefs
that we're bringing in,
what are the beliefs
that we need in order to
have the type of place
that we want to have,
that is what would then
propel a real culture change in
organizations and quite frankly,
propels change at all,
beyond organizations.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 所以基本上，所有学会了这种重新构建的人，聚在一起讨论：“好的，有哪些信念正在集体阻碍我们？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: So
it's basically, all
of the people who have learned
how to do this reframing,
getting together
and talking about,
OK, what are the beliefs
that are holding us back
collectively.</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.</p>
</details>

ALISON BEARD: 我们如何集体改变组织对它所做事情的看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALISON BEARD: And how
do we collectively
change how the
organization is going
to think about what it does?</p>
</details>

MURIEL WILKINS: 完全正确。我的意思是，你可以在许多不同的层面上做到这一点，无论是为你自己，你都可以在团队层面做到。我看到团队中大部分的挫败感是他们无法度过**冲突阶段**（Storming Stage: 指团队发展模型中，成员之间因意见分歧和角色冲突而产生紧张和摩擦的阶段），因为存在不一致的期望。那么期望是什么？期望是我们认为需要发生的事情。所以你需要**统一认知**（Level Set: 指在团队或组织中，确保所有成员对目标、期望或现状有共同的理解和认识），并检查这些信念，检查这些期望和假设，然后才能前进并决定它们需要是什么，以便我们能够前进。你当然可以在集体层面，在组织层面做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MURIEL WILKINS: That's right.
I mean, you can do this at a
number of different levels,
whether it's for yourself,
you can do it at a team level.
Most of the frustration
I see on teams
is they can't get past
that storming stage
because there are
misaligned expectations.
Well, what are expectations?
Expectations are what we
believe needs to happen.
And so you need to level
set and check those beliefs,
check those expectations
and those assumptions
before you move
forward and decide
what they need to
be in order for us
to be able to move forward.
And you can certainly do
it at a collective level,
at an organizational level.</p>

ALISON BEARD: 好的，正如你所说，我需要从自己开始。所以下周我会给你打电话，我们开始——

Well, Muriel, thank you so much.
I've learned a lot
