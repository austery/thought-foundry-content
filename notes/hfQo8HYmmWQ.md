### 寿命科学的迷思与真相

人们一听到寿命科学或寿命医学，脑海中立刻浮现的可能是试图阻止死亡。比如，亿万富翁每天服用数百种补品以求长生不老，或者人们进行疯狂的锻炼和尝试奇异的饮食。人们关注何时进食、吃什么、吃多少。但我认为，这些实际上分散了我们对寿命科学宏伟目标的注意力。我们不是在讨论永生，而是在于延长你的健康寿命，延长你免受疾病、痛苦和记忆丧失困扰的生命阶段。

<p class="english-text">I think when people hear about
the idea of longevity science
or longevity medicine,
their brain instantly goes
to trying to prevent death.
It's billionaires taking
100s of supplements a day
trying to stay immortal,
or people doing crazy exercise regimens
and eating bizarre diets.
It's when you eat, what
you eat, how much you eat.
And I think that this
really is a distraction
from the big goals of longevity science.
We're not talking about immortality,
this is about increasing your health span,
increasing that period of
life free from disease,
free from pain, free from memory loss.</p>
</details>

这意味着我们需要寿命医学。这听起来像是科幻小说中让人们活得更久的未来技术。但实际上，在过去 200 年里，我们已经将人类的预期寿命翻了一番。减缓衰老过程的经济效益可能是巨大的。经济学家计算出，如果我们能够减缓衰老过程，并让人们保持更健康的状态，哪怕只是一年，其价值也将达到 38 万亿美元。通过保持人们的生物年龄更年轻，我们可以享受更长的健康生活，在那里我们积极、快乐，可以参与我们的爱好，可以和我们的孙子、曾孙一起玩耍。这可能是医学史上最伟大的革命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That means that we're gonna
need longevity medicine.
And it sounds like this incredibly sci-fi,
futuristic way of making
human beings live longer.
But actually, we've already doubled
what it means to be human
in life expectancy terms
over the last 200 years.
And the economic benefits of slowing down
the aging process could be huge.
Economists have calculated
that if we were able
to slow down the aging process
and keep people healthier
for just a single year,
that would be worth $38
trillion, 38 and then 12 zeros.
By keeping people biologically younger,
we can enjoy a longer
period of healthy life
where we're active, where we're happy,
where we can engage in our hobbies,
we can play with our
grandkids, our great-grandkids.
This could be the greatest revolution
in the history of medicine.</p>
</details>

我是安德鲁·斯蒂尔博士，一位寿命科学家、作家和活动家。我写了一本名为《Ageless: The New Science of Getting Older Without Getting Old》（暂译：《永葆青春：不老的科学》）的书。我最初是一名物理学家，后来转行研究寿命科学，原因是一张图表。这是一个非常简单的图表，它显示了你的年龄与你在那一年死亡的可能性之间的关系。它非常引人注目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm Dr. Andrew Steele.
I'm a longevity scientist,
writer, and campaigner,
and I wrote a book called
"Ageless: The New Science of Getting Older
Without Getting Old".
I actually started out as a physicist
and I actually changed
career to longevity science
because of a graph.
It's a very simple graph, it's
a graph of how old you are
versus how likely you
are to die in that year.
And it's pretty striking.</p>
</details>

### 死亡风险的指数级增长

我今年 39 岁，这意味着我今年死亡的风险约为千分之一。这意味着，如果这种情况持续到我生命的剩余时间，我平均可以活到 1030 多岁。但不幸的是，这种情况当然不会发生。作为人类，我们的死亡风险大约每八年翻一番，因此存在指数级增长。所以，如果我足够幸运能活到 90 多岁，但不幸的是，在此期间我们在科学或医学上没有任何进展，那么我的死亡几率将约为六分之一。这就是生死，就像掷骰子一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm 39 years old, and what that means is
that my risk of death this
year is about one in a 1,000.
That means that if that were to continue
for the rest of my life, I'd
live into my 1,030s on average.
But unfortunately, of
course, that doesn't happen.
Our risk of death as human beings doubles
about every eight years,
so that means there's
an exponential increase.
So if I'm lucky enough
to live into my 90s,
but unlucky enough that we haven't made
any advances in science or
medicine in the intervening time,
my odds of death will be about one in six.
That's life and death
at the roll of a dice.</p>
</details>

但对于动物王国的其他动物来说，情况可能大相径庭。有些动物，比如巨型乌龟或某些生活在海里的鱼类，还有一些蝾螈，它们的死亡风险不会翻倍。无论它们出生多久，它们的死亡风险都保持不变。因此，按照这个定义，从统计学上讲，这些动物实际上并没有衰老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But for other animals
around the animal kingdom,
that can look very, very different.
There are some animals,
animals like giant tortoises
or certain fish that live in the sea,
there are certain salamanders
that have a risk of death
that doesn't double.
Doesn't matter how long
ago they were born,
their risk of death stays flat.
And so, by this definition,
these animals literally do not
age, statistically speaking.</p>
</details>

对此有两种看法，你可以把它看作是人类，认为这是指数级的、可怕的死亡之墙向你逼近。或者你可以把它看作是一个物理学家，试图找到世界上最大的问题，然后你可以想，“我们所有生物体内这种从根本上增加我们患癌症、心脏病、中风、痴呆以及所有这些所谓的与年龄相关的疾病的风险的根本滴答作响的时钟是什么？如果我们能理解这个滴答作响的时钟，我们能做些什么吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are two ways to look at this,
you can either look at it as a human
and think this is this exponential,
terrifying wall of mortality coming at me.
Or you can look at it as a physicist
trying to find the biggest
problem in the world,
and you can think, "Well, what is this
fundamental ticking clock
inside all of our biology
that massively increases
our risk of cancer,
of heart disease, of stroke, of dementia,
of all these so-called
age-related diseases?
And if we could understand
this ticking clock,
could we do something about it?"</p>
</details>

### 生物年龄与时间年龄

在过去的十年里，科学家们提出了各种衡量**生物年龄**（biological age: 从生物学角度衡量个体的衰老程度）的方法，这与**时间年龄**（chronological age: 实际年龄）不同。你的时间年龄就是你生日蛋糕上有多少根蜡烛，显然我们大多数人都熟悉这一点。但生物年龄的概念是观察你的细胞内部，观察你的身体内部，并从生物学层面上计算出你的年龄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the last decade,
scientists have come up
with various measures of
what's called biological age,
as distinct from chronological age.
So your chronological age is just
how many candles there
are on your birthday cake,
and obviously most of us
are familiar with that.
But the idea of biological age
is to look inside your cells,
look inside your body,
and work out how old you
are on a biological level.</p>
</details>

现在，我们在这方面做得还不够完美，但我们确实有各种不同的衡量标准。我们可以使用血液测试，我们可以使用所谓的**表观遗传测试**（epigenetic tests: 研究基因表达调控的测试），或者我们可以做一些更基本和功能性的事情，比如你的握力会随着年龄的增长而下降。通过将你的握力值与给定年龄的普通人进行比较，我们可以为你分配一个生物年龄值。在科学界以及整个互联网上，目前最受关注的是这些表观遗传年龄测试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we aren't perfect at doing this yet
but we do have a variety
of different measures.
We can use blood tests,
we can use what are
called epigenetic tests,
or we can do things that are
far more sort of basic and functional,
how strong your grip is declines with age.
And by comparing the value
of something like your grip strength
to an average person of a given age,
we can assign you a biological age value.
And the ones that are getting
the most buzz at the moment
within the scientific community,
but also all around the internet,
are these epigenetic age tests.</p>
</details>

基因组是你的 DNA，它是生命的指令手册。而**表观基因组**（epigenome: 基因组上的一层化学修饰）是位于你的基因组之上的一层化学物质。如果你把你的 DNA 想象成那本指令手册，那么表观基因组就是页边上的注释，是贴在侧面的小便利贴，它们告诉细胞在特定时间使用哪个 DNA。我们知道，随着年龄的增长，这种表观基因组会发生变化，因此通过测量表观基因组的变化，你可以为某人分配一个生物年龄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the genome is your DNA,
it's the instruction manual of life.
And the epigenome is a layer of chemistry
that sits on top of your genome.
If you think of your DNA
as that instruction manual,
then the epigenome is
the notes in the margin,
it's the little sticky notes
that have been stuck on the side,
and they tell the cell which DNA to use
at which particular time.
And we know that there are changes
to this epigenome as you get older,
and so by measuring the
changes in the epigenome
you can assign someone a biological age.</p>
</details>

我认为这些测试应用于个人的问题在于，我们对它们到底告诉我们什么了解得不够。我们不知道表观遗传标记中的这些个体变化意味着什么。我们知道它们与年龄相关，但我们不知道它们是否具有因果关系。因此，我们需要做更多的实验，尝试找出我们是否可以干预这些表观遗传，干预这些生物钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the problem with these tests
as applied to individuals is we don't know
enough about exactly
what they're telling us.
We don't know what
these individual changes
in epigenetic marks mean.
We know they're correlated with age,
but what we don't know is
if they're causally related.
And so what we need to
do is more experiments
where we try and work
out if we can intervene
in these epigenetic, in
these biological clocks.</p>
</details>

### 衰老的十二个标志与 Senolytic 药物

在过去的 10 或 15 年里，科学家们真正开始了解衰老过程的根本潜在生物学原理。他们将此分解为衰老的 12 个标志。其中一个标志是**衰老细胞**（senescent cells: 停止分裂但未死亡的细胞）的积累。现在，衰老只是一个生物学技术术语，指的是“老”。这些细胞随着年龄的增长在我们所有体内积累，科学家们注意到这些细胞似乎会引发一系列不同的疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Over the last 10 or 15 years,
scientists have really
started to understand
the fundamental underlying
biology of the aging process.
And they broke this down
into 12 hallmarks of aging.
One of those hallmarks is the accumulation
of senescent cells.
Now, senescent is just a
biological technical term for old.
These are cells that
accumulate in all of our bodies
as the years go by,
and scientists have
noticed that these cells
seem to drive a range of different
diseases as we get older.</p>
</details>

因此，我们的想法是，“如果我们能够移除这些细胞，并保持身体其他细胞的完整性，这能否减缓甚至部分逆转衰老过程？”科学家们发现了一种叫做 **senolytic 药物**（senolytic drugs: 能够选择性杀死衰老细胞的药物）的药物，这些药物可以杀死那些衰老细胞。他们在小鼠身上进行了试验，结果表明它们确实能有效地使小鼠在生物学上更年轻。首先，它使它们活得更长一点，如果你正在减缓衰老过程，这是你想要看到的基本的事情。而且它不会拖延生命尽头的虚弱期。它们患癌症的几率更小，患心脏病的几率更小，患白内障的几率更小。这向我们表明，通过针对衰老的根本过程，通过识别像衰老细胞这样的一系列与年龄相关的问题的驱动因素，我们可以解决许多甚至可能所有这些标志。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the idea was, "What if
we could remove these cells
and leave the rest of the
cells of the body intact?
Could that slow down or
even partially reverse
the aging process?"
And scientists identified
drugs called senolytic drugs,
these are drugs that kill
those senescent cells.
And they tried them out in mice,
and they do indeed effectively
make the mice biologically younger.
Firstly, it makes them live a bit longer,
and it's a good thing
if you're slowing down
the aging process, the
basic thing you want to see.
But it's not dragging out
that period of frailty at the end of life.
They get less cancer, they
get less heart disease,
they get fewer cataracts.
And what this shows us
is that by targeting
the fundamental processes of aging,
by identifying something
like senescent cells
that drives a whole range
of age-related problems,
we can hit many perhaps
even all of those hallmarks.</p>
</details>

### 细胞重编程：来自未来的治疗

目前，寿命科学中最令人兴奋的想法之一是所谓的**细胞重编程**（cellular reprogramming: 将成熟细胞恢复到更年轻状态的过程）。我有时将此描述为一种从未来虫洞中掉出来的治疗方法。这个想法是，我们可以重置我们细胞内部的生物钟，这个想法最早出现在 2000 年代中期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the most exciting ideas
in longevity science at the moment
is what's called cellular reprogramming.
I sometimes describe this as a treatment
that has fallen through a
wormhole from the future.
This is the idea that we can reset
the biological clock inside of our cells,
and the idea first came
about in the mid-2000s.</p>
</details>

当时，一位名叫山中伸弥（Shinya Yamanaka）的科学家试图找出如何将常规的成人体细胞完全恢复到其生物存在的最初状态，即它们还是胚胎的时候。他对从创造干细胞的角度对此感兴趣，干细胞是一种可以创造体内任何其他类型细胞的细胞，我们将来或许可以用它来进行组织修复。但科学家们也注意到，除了逆转这些细胞的发育时钟外，它还会逆转衰老时钟。接受过这四种**山中因子**（Yamanaka factors: 诱导多能干细胞的四个关键基因）处理的细胞实际上比未接受过处理的细胞在生物学上更年轻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a scientist
called Shinya Yamanaka
who was trying to find out how to turn
regular adult body cells all the way back
to the very beginning of
their biological existence,
the time when they were an embryo.
Now, he was interested in this
from the point of view
of creating stem cells,
a cell that can create any
other kind of cell in the body,
which we might be able to use
for tissue repair in future.
But scientists also noticed,
as well as turning back
the developmental clock on these cells,
it also turns back the aging clock.
Cells that are given these
four Yamanaka factors
actually are biologically younger
than cells that haven't had the treatment.</p>
</details>

因此，科学家们决定将这些山中因子基因插入小鼠体内。现在，如果你以一种天真的方式这样做，让这些基因一直处于活跃状态，那么不幸的是，这对小鼠来说实际上是非常糟糕的消息，因为这些干细胞，尽管它们在可以变成什么样的细胞方面非常强大，但它们在作为肝细胞或心脏细胞方面毫无用处。因此，小鼠很快就死于器官衰竭。但是，如果你只是短暂地激活这些基因，而科学家们第一次成功做到这一点的方式基本上是在周末激活它们。他们发现，这足以逆转这些细胞中的生物钟，但不会逆转发育时钟，也不会将它们变成这些干细胞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what scientists decided to do
is insert these Yamanaka
factor genes into mice.
Now, if you do this in a naive way
so those genes are active all the time
it's actually very bad news
for the mice, unfortunately,
because these stem cells,
although they're very powerful
in terms of what kind
of cell they can become,
they are useless at being a liver cell
or being a heart cell.
And so the mice very quickly
died of organ failure.
But if you activate these
genes only transiently,
and the way that scientists did it
the first time successfully
was essentially to
activate them at weekends.
They found that this was enough
to turn back the biological
clock in those cells,
but without turning back
the developmental clock
and turning them into these stem cells.</p>
</details>

现在，真正的挑战是这是一种基因疗法，它涉及将四种不同的基因传递到你体内的每一个细胞。因此，问题是，“我们能否凭借我们 2020 年代微不足道的生物技术，将其变成一种可行的治疗方法，甚至是一种药丸，我们实际上可以在人类身上使用？” 这就是导致海湾地区的各种亿万富翁向其中投入巨额资金的原因。**Altos Labs** 是该领域最大的所谓初创公司。我并不真正称它为初创公司，因为它从杰夫·贝索斯等人那里获得了 30 亿美元的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the real challenge is this
is a gene therapy treatment,
it involves delivering
four different genes
to every single cell in your body.
And so the question is,
"Can we, with our puny
2020s biotechnology,
make this into a viable
treatment, a pill even,
that we can actually use in human beings?"
And that's what's led various
different billionaires
from the Bay Area to invest
huge, huge amounts of money in this.
Altos Labs is the biggest
so-called startup in this space.
And I wouldn't really call it a startup
'cause it's got funding of $3 billion
from, amongst the people, Jeff Bezos.</p>
</details>

我对此感到非常兴奋，因为我认为 30 亿美元足以好好尝试一下，看看我们是否可以将其变成一种可行的人类治疗方法。我唯一的担心是，表观遗传学只是衰老的标志之一。例如，重置表观遗传时钟无法帮助我们 DNA 中在生命过程中积累的突变。它也无法帮助细胞外部发生的任何事情。例如，对构成我们身体支架的蛋白质的损害，比如构成我们皮肤和骨骼的胶原蛋白。因此，我们可能会解决我们单个细胞内部的衰老问题，但我们让衰老过程的其他部分保持完整。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I'm very excited about this
because I think $3 billion
is enough to have a good go
and see if we can turn this
into a viable human treatment.
My only concern is that epigenetics
is only one of those hallmarks of aging.
For example, resetting
the epigenetic clock
can't help with mutations in our DNA
that accumulate throughout
the course of our lives.
It also can't help with anything
that happens outside of cells.
For example, damage to the proteins
that are the scaffolding of our body,
things like collagen that make
up our skin and our bones.
And so it might be the case that we solve
aging inside our individual cells,
but we leave other parts of
the aging process intact.</p>
</details>

### 现有药物的再利用：短期的快速胜利

寿命科学中最快的短期胜利可能是重新利用现有的药物。原因是，我们花费了多年时间来开发这些药物，我们了解它们在人体内的作用方式，我们对它们的安全性有所了解，而且由于这些分子已经存在，我们只是在小鼠身上、在实验室的各种生物体中尝试了它们；并发现其中的一部分确实可以减缓衰老过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Probably the quickest short-term
wins in longevity science
are going to be repurposed existing drugs.
And the reason for this is because
we spent many, many years
developing these drugs,
we understand how they work in humans,
we understand a bit about
their safety profile,
and because these molecules already exist
we've just tried them out in mice,
in various organisms in the lab;
and found that a subset of them
do indeed slow down the aging process.</p>
</details>

在人类身上提出的第一个寿命药物试验是针对一种叫做**二甲双胍**（metformin: 一种用于治疗糖尿病的药物）的药物，实际上，我们开这种药是为了治疗糖尿病，并且有迹象表明它可能会减缓人们的衰老过程。该试验的目的是观察许多不同的疾病。因此，我们看看服用真正二甲双胍的人，他们是否会更晚患上癌症？他们是否会更晚患上痴呆症？他们患心脏病的几率是否更小？他们是否比对照组的人死得更晚？如果你跟踪这些人三到五年，这应该给我们足够的数据来了解二甲双胍是否能减缓衰老过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first trial of a longevity drug
that was proposed in humans was
for a drug called metformin,
which is a pre-existing drug
that we prescribe, actually,
for diabetes in this case,
and has some indications that it might
slow down the aging process in people.
The proposal in the trial is to observe
a number of different diseases.
So we see if the people who
are taking the real metformin,
do they get cancer later?
Do they get dementia later?
Do they get less heart disease?
Do they die later than
people in the control group?
And if you follow these people
for three to five years,
that should give us enough data
to understand whether metformin
slows down the aging process.</p>
</details>

我认为目前最受关注的药物之一是**雷帕霉素**（rapamycin: 一种免疫抑制剂）。它最初是从复活节岛的土壤样本中的细菌中分离出来的，并被发现具有抗真菌作用，它可以阻止真菌细胞的生长。但是，当科学家们开始在实验室里进行试验时，他们意识到它不仅能阻止真菌细胞的生长，还能阻止人类细胞的生长。雷帕霉素的作用方式是，它针对细胞代谢的一个基本的中心组成部分。它启动了一个叫做**自噬**（autophagy: 细胞自我吞噬和降解的过程）的过程，自噬在希腊语中是“自我吞噬”的意思。这意味着它消耗旧的、受损的蛋白质，然后将它们回收成新鲜的、新的蛋白质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think one of the ones that's got
the most buzz around it at the moment
is a drug called rapamycin.
It was first isolated in bacteria
from a soil sample from Easter Island,
and it was discovered to be antifungal,
that it could stop fungal
cells from growing.
But when the scientists started
playing around in the lab,
they realized it didn't just
stop fungal cells from growing
it also stopped human cells.
The way that rapamycin works
is it targets a fundamental
central component of cellular metabolism.
It starts this process called autophagy,
which is Greek for
self-eating, "auto-phagy."
And that means it consumes
old, damaged proteins
and then recycles them
into fresh, new ones.</p>
</details>

在 2009 年，我们第一次发现，通过在生命后期给小鼠服用雷帕霉素，你可以延长它们的剩余寿命，它们可以多活 10% 或 15%。这是一个非常令人难以置信的结果，这是第一次有药物被证明可以减缓哺乳动物的衰老。现在，我们已经在许多不同的环境、许多动物和许多不同的生物体中、在生命中的许多不同时间尝试过它。这对我们人类来说可能是一个好消息，因为不幸的是，并非我们所有人都可以从出生时就开始服用药物，因为我们大多数人出生已经很久了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in 2009 we found
out for the first time
that by giving it to mice late in life,
you could actually extend
their remaining lifespan,
they lived by 10 or 15% longer.
And this was a really incredible result,
this was the first time
a drug had been shown
to slow down aging in mammals.
And we've now tried it in
loads of different contexts,
in loads of animals and
loads of different organisms,
at loads of different times in life.</p>
</details>

因为我们对这些药物了解很多，这意味着我们可以相对较快地开始进行人体试验。我的意思是，如果我们为这项科学提供足够的资金，我们可能会在未来五到十年内拥有第一种寿命药物。我们可以想象在人类身上进行寿命基因编辑，也许不是在未来五年内，但我认为如果有人打赌它不会在未来 20 年内发生，那将是愚蠢的。而且，这对观看此视频的大多数人来说，时间也很充裕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's fantastic news,
potentially, for us humans,
because not all of us, unfortunately,
can start taking a drug from birth
'cause most of us were
born quite a long time ago.
Because we understand a
lot about these drugs,
it means we could start doing
a human trial relatively soon.
And what I mean by that
is that we could have
the first longevity drug in
the next five or 10 years,
if we give this science
sufficient funding.
And we could imagine doing
longevity gene edits in human beings,
perhaps not in the next five years
but I think it would be foolish
to bet against it happening
in the next 20 years, for example.
And, again, that's in plenty of time
for most people watching this video.</p>
</details>

### 寿命科学的伦理考量

我发现我因为这项工作而收到如此多的伦理问题，这真的很有趣。如果我是一名癌症研究人员，我告诉人们我们有了一个惊人的新突破，可以解决儿童白血病，那么在一次演讲结束时，不会有人站起来问我，“安德鲁，所有这些孩子不会对你给他们带来的额外生命感到厌烦吗？我们不会因为我们会有所有这些癌症幸存者堵塞地球、使用资源和破坏环境而导致人口过剩吗？” 然而，当你开始谈论长寿时，突然所有这些问题都冒出来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I find it really fascinating
that I get so many ethical
questions because of this work.
If I was instead a cancer researcher
and I was telling people
we had this amazing new breakthrough
that was gonna solve childhood leukemia,
I would not get people standing
up at the end of a talk
and asking me, "Andrew,
aren't all these kids
gonna be bored with the extra
life that you've got them?
Aren't we gonna have overpopulation
because we're gonna have all
of these cancer survivors
clogging up the planet and using resources
and destroying the environment?"
And yet, when you start
talking about longevity,
suddenly all of these questions
come out of the woodwork.</p>
</details>

就好像我们将它置于与任何其他类型的医学完全不同的道德、伦理类别中。我相信寿命科学只是现代医学的延伸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's as though we place it in
a completely separate moral,
ethical category to any
other kind of medicine.
And what I believe is longevity science
is just an extension of modern medicine.</p>
</details>

### 延长寿命，预防疾病

目前，衰老是全球主要的死亡原因。每天有超过 10 万人死于癌症、痴呆症以及随着年龄增长而增加的感染疾病风险。如果我们能够抑制随着时间推移而增加的死亡风险，这不仅能让我们开发出针对个体疾病的治疗方法，还能开发出可以从一开始就预防多种不同疾病的药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the moment aging is the
leading cause of death globally.
Over 100,000 people die
every single day of cancer,
of Dementia, of the increased
risk of infectious disease
that comes along with growing older.
And if we can tamp down on that increase
of risk of death with time
that comes along with being a human being,
it could allow us not to just develop
treatments for individual diseases,
but drugs that can prevent
multiple different diseases
from ever arising in the first place.</p>
</details>

但它获得的资金却少得令人震惊。在美国，政府对这类科学的资助仅略高于每位美国人 1 美元，考虑到你认为衰老是癌症和痴呆症的原因，以及感染风险的增加等等，这绝对是引人注目的。如果你把所有这些死亡原因加起来，衰老导致了美国 85% 的死亡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it gets shockingly little funding.
In the United States,
government funding of this kind of science
is just over $1 per American,
which is absolutely remarkable
given that you think about
aging being the cause
of cancer and dementia,
and increased infection
risk, and so on and so on.</p>

我们真的需要一个像人类基因组计划那样规模庞大的项目来了解人们是如何衰老的，因为在我们所有的生物学中都发生了如此多的不同的事情。我们需要测量的不仅是你的 DNA，还有你的基因表达如何变化，你的细胞如何变化，你血液中和细胞之间的蛋白质如何变化。我们需要监测所有这些东西，以便尝试将它们输入到一个巨大的计算机模型中，并创建一个我们称之为人类的系统生物学模型。

<p class="english-text">We really need a giant project
on the scale of the Human Genome Project
to understand how people age,
because there are so many different things
happening in all of our biology.
We need to measure not just your DNA
but how the expression
of your genes changes,
how your cells change, how
the proteins in your blood
and between your cells change.
We need to monitor all of these things
in order to try and feed them
into a giant computer model
and create what we'd call
a systems biology model of a human being.</p>

已经有人在谈论人工智能可以在未来五到十年内治愈所有疾病的想法。我认为这真正遗漏的一点是，人工智能的好坏取决于你用来训练它的数据。我认为这方面的一个很好的例子是**AlphaFold**（AlphaFold: 一种能够根据蛋白质序列预测其结构的AI），这是一种可以仅根据蛋白质序列预测蛋白质如何折叠的人工智能。这是一个巨大的科学突破，但它的实现只是因为几十年来，科学家们一直在测量蛋白质的结构，并将它们存储在一个叫做蛋白质数据库的中心数据库中。

<p class="english-text">There are already people
talking about the idea
that AI could cure all disease
in the next five or 10 years.
And I think the thing this really misses
is that AI is only as good as
the data that you train it on.
And I think a great example of this
is something called AlphaFold,
which is an AI that can predict
how a protein is folded
purely from its sequence.
And this was a huge
scientific breakthrough
but it was only made possible
because for decades scientists have been
measuring the structures of proteins
and
