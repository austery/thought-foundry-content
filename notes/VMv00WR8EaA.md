### AI生产力悖论：企业面临的紧迫挑战

主持人: 我们采访的公司中，有85%表示，他们坚信只有未来18个月的时间来成为行业领导者，否则就会落后。你知道，我们有一个小群聊，里面有位朋友说：“哦，所有这些东西都被过度炒作了，最终会归零。”然而，我每次使用AI时，都觉得它非常棒。

<details>

<p class="english-text">85% of the companies we talked to said they really believe they only have the next 18 months to either become a leader or fall behind. You know, we have our little group chat where we have another friend who's like, "Oh, all this stuff is overhyped and it's going to zero." Every time I use AI, it's amazing.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 在每家大公司里，都有人已经发现，他们现在可以在1分钟内完成过去需要8小时的工作。我曾遇到一个28岁的年轻人，他非常擅长使用**Chat GPT**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型），公司让他制作一个30页的幻灯片演示文稿。然后，他们为投资银行的所有员工组织了一场全球电话会议，让这个年轻人花一小时向大家讲解如何使用Chat GPT。但这很荒谬，以这种方式期望人们采纳改变世界的技术是荒谬的。**Cursor**（一种AI辅助编程工具）让平庸的工程师变得优秀，让顶尖的工程师变得像神一样。我参加的每一次董事会议，对于其他四项指标，我都有报告来展示我们的进展。但对于AI，我只有我们购买了多少东西的数据。当一个**衡量指标**（Measure）变成**目标**（Target）时，它就不再是一个准确的衡量指标了。

<p class="english-text">There's somebody at every big company who has figured out I could do something in 1 minute that used to take 8 hours. 28-year-old guy who was using Chat GPT really really well and they had him create a 30 slide deck and they did a global call for everyone in the investment bank for this guy to spend an hour walking people through how to use chat but that's absurd that's an absurd way to hope people adopt worldchanging technology cursor has taken mediocre engineers and made them good but it's taken amazing engineers and made them gods every board meeting I go in for my other four metrics I have some report of how are we doing those report and on AI all I have is the amount of stuff we bought when I measure becomes a target. It is no longer accurate as a measure.</p>
</details>

主持人: 尽管我们认为已经设定了配额，并且认为每个人都富有生产力，但事实证明，我们自以为的生产力实际上远低于我们可能达到的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even though we thought we had our quota set and we thought everyone was productive, it turned out we thought we were productive and actually it turned out we could be much more productive.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但与什么相比呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But compared to what?</p>
</details>

主持人: 我很高兴能和我的朋友Russ Frerichs在这里。嗯……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm excited to be here with my friend Russ Frerieden. Um</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 是的，很高兴见到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, good to see you.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我认识你很久了，我记得第一次见到你的时候，是通过**Josh McFarland**（著名投资人、企业家）。Josh当时在**Google**，他说：“是的，有个人叫Russ Frerichs，他创办了**Adify**（一家广告技术公司）。”他把公司卖给了**Cox**（一家传媒公司），赚了很多钱。你知道，那时候3亿美元可是一大笔钱。

<p class="english-text">Uh I've known you for a long time and I think when I first met you, I still actually remember meeting you the first time. It was from uh I think Josh McFarland. Um, and Josh was at Google and he was like, "Yeah, there's this guy Russ Fred and he started this company, Adify." And he sold it to Cox for all this money. You know, back then $300 million was a lot.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 这太惊人了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's It is amazing. I I</p>
</details>

主持人: 现在这可能只是B轮融资的规模，但在当时，那是一次巨大的收购。而且当时人们都说，Russ真是个了不起的人，他成功做到了。我们好像是在佛罗里达认识的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now it's like a B- round, but like back then like that was a huge acquisition. And uh there there was like oh like Russ like I had like amazing person that pulled this off. Um and uh I think we met in Florida.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 没错，是在一次**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank）的旅行中，一切似乎都回到了原点。但是，AI可能是世界上有史以来最热门的技术。你也曾在**Web 1.0**时代，那个曾是世界上最热门的领域工作过。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That's right. uh on a Silicon Valley bank trip and kind of all things uh everything comes full circle in the end.

### 从广告技术到AI：衡量价值的挑战

主持人: 但现在有一个大问题。这让我想起了**广告技术**（Adtech）。我认为这是一个很好的过渡，因为在广告技术领域，你试图弄清楚广告是否有效，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now there's this big question actually. It reminds me of adte. I think it's kind of a nice little segue because like adtech you're trying to figure out does the advertising work, right?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 很多广告技术就是这样：这里有一个广告，然后就存在**归因问题**（Attribution Problem）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like a lot of adte is here's an advertisement and there's this attribution problem.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，销售发生了，谁应该为这次销售负责？是**雅虎**（Yahoo）上的横幅广告吗？是**Google**上的最后一次点击吗？还是某个在你的机器上植入**Cookie**（网络浏览器存储的小数据文件）的优惠券网站？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. of the sale happened. Who is responsible for that sale? Was it the banner ad on Yahoo? Was it the last click that happened on Google? Was it the coupon site that you know stuffed a cookie on your machine? So part of adtech is just how do I figure like I'm buying ads. That's part of it, but part of it is also did it work? And AI, there's all sorts of stuff around making AI work, which is like technically very very challenging. But then there's the question of did it actually yield a benefit?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 所以，广告技术的一部分就是我如何弄清楚我正在购买广告。这是其中一部分，但另一部分是它是否奏效了？而对于AI，有很多关于如何让AI奏效的事情，这在技术上非常非常具有挑战性。但接下来就是它是否真的带来了效益的问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So part of adtech is just how do I figure like I'm buying ads. That's part of it, but part of it is also did it work? And AI, there's all sorts of stuff around making AI work, which is like technically very very challenging. But then there's the question of did it actually yield a benefit?</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，这可能是最大的问题。我的意思是，在这方面存在很多误解，但我很想听听**Laridan**（Russ Frerichs创办的AI衡量公司）的起源，以及你如何看待两者之间的一些相似之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. which is probably the biggest question for I mean there's there's a lot of like myths on this on both sides but would love to kind of hear about the origins of Laridan and how you think about even some similarities between the two.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。是的，广告和互联网在90年代的发展与我们现在看到的AI之间，确实有很多相似之处。我的意思是，抛开资本市场的视角不谈，思考现在与5年前、10年前、20年前相比，什么被定义为“大”的退出规模，这很有趣，但这本身就是一个话题。但当我1996年搬到硅谷时，我是第一家在线广告网络的第一位员工。在早期，我们只是觉得有网站，我们应该在上面投放广告。很好。我们如何大规模地做到这一点？很好。我们应该捕捉哪些指标？然后你看到了**Comscore**（一家市场研究公司）或**尼尔森**（Nielsen）等公司的发展，它们进入电视领域，试图弄清楚我如何实际规划、如何花费、如何提供工具。对吧？所有的钱都集中在电视或广播中，并且有**尼尔森**（Nielsen）、**Arbitron**（一家广播收听率测量公司）、**IMS Health**（一家制药行业数据和咨询公司）等工具，帮助人们了解他们在电视上投放广告时能得到什么。你必须为互联网构建整个技术栈。你有了像**DoubleClick**（一家在线广告服务公司）或我曾工作过的**Flycast**，或者像**Omniture**（一家网络分析公司）这样的公司，它们构建了技术栈的不同部分。像**Comscore**这样的公司也构建了技术栈的不同部分，而这些公司，显然**Google**和**Facebook**（现Meta）是迄今为止最伟大的公司之一，但如果没有所有这些基础设施，它们的收入就不会增长得那么快。我真的认为我们将在AI领域看到同样的情况。现在，这项技术令人难以置信。你知道，当我考虑创办Laridan时，我的核心论点是，在成为第一家在线广告网络的第一位员工，以及在25年前成为Comscore最早的两名高管之一之后，我的合伙人Jim和我坐下来，我们说，看，每当预算发生巨大转变时，尤其是在快速发生时，就像从电视到数字广告的转变，以及许多类别从客户端-服务器到云的转变一样，每当这种情况发生时，人们都需要重建所有基础设施。这是一个巨大的机会，可以围绕衡量和治理构建所有这些工具，坦率地说，目的不是为了阻止任何事情，而是为了加速它。因为如果我是一家大公司，是的，我今天会大量尝试AI。从技术的角度来看，这是过去20年发生的最令人兴奋的事情。它很棒，很奇妙。但同时，也有一些非常枯燥但重要的问题。我的员工队伍有35,000人。他们不可能一下子都接受完美的知识和完美的安全性培训。这会如何影响我的**DNO保险**（Directors and Officers Liability Insurance: 董事及高级职员责任保险）？这个项目最终有价值吗？所以我们真的想创办一家公司，专注于如何构建衡量和治理工具集，而不是成为一个守门人，而是为了赋能更多的支出。我认为随着我们的发展，我们将成为所有AI公司最好的朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. Yeah. There there's a lot of parallels really to what happened in the '9s with advertising and the growth of the internet and what we're seeing with AI. I mean forget the capital markets perspective. It is it is funny to think about uh what what is defined as big from an exit these days versus 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. And that's that's kind of its own topic, but just when I moved out here, I moved out to Silicon Valley in 1996 and I was the first guy at the first online ad network. And in the early days, it was just there are websites, we should put ads on them. Great. How do we do that at scale? Great. What are the metrics we should capture? Then you saw the growth of things like comcore or Neielson as they moved into television to figure out like how do I actually plan this? How do I spend this? How do I give tools? Right? All of the money lived in TV or in radio and there were these tools like Neielson, Arbitron, IMS Health on the pharmaceutical side. There were all these tools to help people understand what they were getting when they advertised on television. You had to build that entire stack for the internet. You had companies like DoubleClick or Flycast where I was or uh companies like Omnature building a different part of the stack. companies like Comscore building a different part of the stack and those companies obviously Google and Facebook are two of the most amazing companies ever built but if it wasn't for all of that infrastructure their revenue just wouldn't have grown as quickly and I I really do think we'll see the same thing in AI now the technology is unbelievable and you know my core thesis when I was thinking about starting Laridan after having been you know the first guy at the first online ad network and having been maybe the first one of the first two executives at comcore way way 25 years ago back in the day um my my partner Jim and I sat down and we said look you know every time there's a tremendous shift in budget and especially when it happens at a great pace like what happened from TV to digital advertising what's happened in a lot of categories from client server to cloud anytime that happens people need to rebuild all of the infrastructure there's a great opportunity to build all of these tools around measurement around governance not with the goal of stopping anything frankly with the goal of accelerating it because if I am a large company, yes, I'm going to experiment a ton with AI today. It's the most exciting thing that's happened in the last 20 years from the technology standpoint. It's amazing. It's wonderful. But also, there are very boring but important questions. I have 35,000 people in my workforce. They can't all get retrained all at once with perfect knowledge and perfect security. How does it affect my DNO insurance? Was the project ultimately valuable? So we really wanted to start a company about how would you build kind of the measurement and governance set of tools not to be a gatekeeper but to empower more of this spending. I I think as we grow we will be the best friend to all of the AI companies.</p>

### AI如何“吞噬”劳动力预算：生产力与衡量难题

主持人: 是的，而且，我的意思是，也许我们可以深入探讨你是如何做到这一点的，但为了稍微设定一下基调，我喜欢你给我的这个框架。我已经“偷”走了它。当然，当我“偷”用一个短语时，这是最真诚的赞美，但是，我刚刚发布了一个关于软件如何“吞噬”劳动力的短视频。所以，你知道，软件“吞噬”世界，这是我们公司赖以建立的理论，但它现在正在“吞噬”劳动力。但这并不意味着工作会消失。很大程度上，这意味着人们的生产力将提高10倍，或者我无法雇佣任何人来做这份工作，但我可以雇佣AI来做。所以，有些公司，它们的软件预算非常小，但劳动力预算却非常庞大。而我们公司感到兴奋的巨大机会的第一步是，人们会说：“哦，我要开始雇佣软件了。”但这现在意味着你的软件预算将变得非常庞大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and um I mean maybe we can get into how you're doing this but um just to kind of level set a little bit and I love this framing that you gave me. I've I've stolen it. Um, when I steal a phrase, it's the most sincere form of flattery, of course, but um, I I just released a little video about kind of uh, how software is eating labor. So, you know, software eats the world. This was a thesis that our firm is founded on, but it's eating labor, but it doesn't actually mean that like jobs are going to go away. Largely, what it means is that people are going to be like 10 times more productive or I can't hire anybody to do this job, but I can hire AI to do it. So you have companies where uh their software budget is very very small but their labor budget is enormous and step one of like the mega opportunity that excites us as a firm is that people say oh I'm going to start hiring software but now that means that your software budget is enormous.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 是的。因为现在，如果你的劳动力预算是100亿美元，而软件预算只有1美元，你不会试图削减或优化你那1美元的软件预算，但你会真正地说：“好吧，我需要雇佣更多的人吗？我能让人们的生产力更高吗？”你知道，所有这些事情现在都在人们的脑海中盘旋。这正在催生AI软件公司的许多巨大增长曲线。但现在，这张图表将变得更加平衡。当然，在100亿的劳动力预算中，也许会降到80亿，然后你会在软件上花费10亿或20亿美元。所以，公司的净支出实际上更低了，公司利润更高了，生产力大幅提升，但问题是，这真的有生产力吗？我总是想知道人类是否有生产力，但软件是否带来了更多的生产力？我该如何衡量呢？所以每个人都对这场淘金热感到兴奋。我要使用这些工具，但它们真的有效吗？它们的效果有多好？基线是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Because right now, if you have like a $10 billion labor market, labor budget and like a $1 software budget, you're not going to try to cut, you know, optimize your $1 software budget, but you're really going to say, "Okay, do I need to hire more people? Can I make people more productive?" You know, all these things that are going through people's minds right now. And this is yielding a lot of the mega growth curves of the AI software companies. But now, this chart is going to be a little bit more balanced. Sure. Of like the 10 billion of labor, you know, maybe that goes to eight and now you spend two billion or$1 billion on software. So like the the net spending for the company is actually lower, the company's more profitable, productivity gains galore, but then is this productive? Like I always want to know if the humans are productive, but then like is the software yielding more me more productivity and how do I measure that? So everybody's excited about this gold rush. I'm going to use these these tools, but like do they work? And how well do they work? And what's the baseline?</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。所以，我借用了你的框架，就像，你知道，如果**摩根大通**（JPMorgan Chase）在软件上花费180亿美元，无论他们……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. So, so I've stolen your framing of it's like, you know, if Chase spends $18 billion on software, whatever they</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 他们需要知道这钱花得值不值，他们需要弄清楚这是否是高效的支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like they need to know if they're getting their money's worth, they need to figure out if this is actually efficient spend.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。听着，一件有趣的事情——不，不是有趣，而是一件你会经常听到世界上最大AI公司和最大AI投资公司的人说的事情，他们会说类似这样的话：“你知道，今天全球IT支出是1万亿美元。我们认为，由于AI和代理（Agents）的出现，这个数字可能会达到10万亿美元。”你知道，我们姑且不讨论这是否属实。这当然是**英伟达**（Nvidia）、**OpenAI**以及我们所有其他投入时间做的事情的看涨情况。所以当你思考这个问题时，我想我们说过，如果我没记错的话，摩根大通的全球IT支出大约是180亿或190亿美元，而他们每年在人员上花费数百亿美元。所以如果你真的思考一下，他们的IT支出会从180亿美元增加到1800亿美元吗？在接下来的几个月里，这似乎不太可能，但它肯定会增加。如果它会增加，**首席财务官**（CFO: Chief Financial Officer）需要了解什么？同时，由于速度的原因，我喜欢用一种我认为每个人都知道但大声说出来很重要的框架来解释这一点：是的，社会已经发生了无数次转变，我们从农场转移到城市，对吧？我们都知道所有这些例子，但我们从未经历过这样一个时代，我们期望全球所有的知识工作者立即接受一套六个月前还不存在的新工具的再培训。对吧？所以，每个人都需要在前进的过程中弄清楚这一点。那么，我们公司从何开始呢？对吧？我们的第一套工具就是：你的公司里有什么？人们是否在使用它？你花了这么多钱，人们在使用它吗？你会发现，我们80%多的客户发现，他们的员工使用的工具比他们知道和授权的要多得多。顺便说一句，这并不意味着它不好。其中一些工具很危险，他们应该担心。其中一些工具可能非常受欢迎，他们需要将其纳入管理范围并了解正在发生什么。但从IT的角度来看，你通常不允许软件在你的组织中随意使用，访问你的组织数据，而你却一无所知。我们现在在AI领域一直允许这种情况发生。我并不是以恐吓的方式对客户说这些。这是意料之中的。事情发展很快。你必须知道正在发生什么。所以我们从基线开始，就是弄清楚到底发生了什么。我们试图解决的第二件事是，我们如何让人们在AI方面、在代理方面更有效地使用这些东西？我们如何让人们在他们的工作流程中使用这些东西？我是一个在**通用磨坊**（General Mills）工作的营销人员，对吧？我是一个在通用磨坊工作的营销人员。通用磨坊将如何帮助我使用这些工具？我通常发现，如果你真的想推动员工使用工具，你必须让他们感到安全，这样他们就不会显得笨拙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Look, a funny thing, not funny, a thing you will hear said frequently by the people running the largest AI companies in the world, the people running the largest firms investing in AI in the world is they'll say something along the lines of, you know, today global IT spend is $1 trillion. And we think because of AI and agents that could go to 10 trillion. And you know, let's ignore whether that's true or false. It's certainly the bullcase for Nvidia, for open AI, for all of the other things that we spend all of our time doing. And so when you think about it, I think we said uh I think if I remember correctly, JP Morgan Chase's global IT spend is on the order of 18 or 19 billion and they spend a couple hundred billion a year on people. So if you really think about that, well, is their IT spend going to go from 18 billion to $180 billion? Seems unlikely in the next couple months, but it's certainly going to go up. And if it's going to go up, what does the CFO need to understand? And at the same time because of the pace you know a way I like to frame this that I think everyone knows but I think it's important to say out loud is yes there have been tons of shifts right we've shifted society a million times we've shifted from farms to cities right we we all know all of these examples but we can't we've never had a time where we've expected the entire global workforce of knowledge workers to be retrained immediately on a new set of tools that didn't exist 6 months ago. Right? And so there is an element where everyone needs to figure this out as we go along. So what did we start with as a company? Right? Our first set of tools is just what do you have in your company and are people flatout using it? You've spent all of this money. Are people using it? And what you find is you know 80 something% of our customers find far more tools being used by their employees than they know about and they've licensed. That doesn't mean it was bad by the way. Some of those tools are dangerous and they should worry about that. Some of those tools are might be very popular and they need to bring them into the fold and understand what's happening. But from an IT standpoint, you normally don't allow software to just be used across your organization with access to your organization's data and have no idea what's happening. We're letting that happen in AI all the time. And I don't really say that to our customers as a fear cell. It's to be expected. Things are moving quickly. You have to know what's going on. So we start with the baseline of just flat out what's happening. The second set of things we try and solve is how do we get people using this stuff more in a productive way on the AI side on the agent side. How do we get people using this in their workflow? I'm a marketer working at General Mills or something like that, right? I'm a marketer working at General Mills. How is General Mills going to help me use these tools? And what I've generally found with employees, if you really want to drive employee usage of tools, you have to make them feel safe so they won't look dumb.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 你必须让他们明白，他们可以安全地使用这些工具而不会被解雇。因为，如果你是一个22岁的人，从高中起就一直在有效地使用这些工具，那是一回事。但如果你是一个42岁的人，已经有20多年的职业生涯，每天都在工作，而且，你家里还有事情要做，还要出差。你有很多事情要做。此外，你还得成为一名AI专家。你真的不想显得笨拙，也不想不小心上传错误的数据而导致自己被解雇。这在某些国家实际上是一个更大的问题，因为欧盟围绕AI制定了许多重要的法规。如果我是一家公司的员工，我不想显得笨拙。所以，如果我是CFO，我们购买了所有这些工具。我们到底买了什么？这是第一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you have to make them understand that they can use this safely without getting fired. Because again, it's one thing if you're 22 years old and you've been using these tools effectively your entire life since, you know, high school. But if you're a 42year-old person who's been, you know, had a 20some year career and you're working in your job every day and by the way, you also have things you do at home and you have business travel. You have all of these things you have to do. Also, you have to become an AI expert. You really would like to not look dumb and you'd like to accidentally not upload the wrong data and get yourself fired. This is actually a bigger issue in some countries where there's a bunch of EU regulations around AI that do matter and if I'm an employee at a company, I don't want to look dumb. So, if I'm the CFO, we bought all these tools. What did we actually buy? Number one.</p>
</details>

主持人: 第二，我们如何让人们真正使用这些工具？因为这些工具在企业中的使用率……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, how do we get people actually using these tools? Because the usage on these tools in the enterprise is</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 比人们今天想象的要低，顺便说一句，这很合理。我稍后会谈到生产力的问题，但你知道，任何听众，如果你曾经参与过任何企业的任何软件推广，一个非常枯燥但非常重要的问题是，我们如何推动实际使用？当然，每个人都使用电子邮件。人们使用**Workday**（一款人力资源管理软件），因为如果你不使用Workday，你就会被解雇，对吧？你拿不到工资。但大多数企业软件，你的内部网软件，比如**SharePoint**（微软的协作平台）之类的，只有相对少数的人在使用，而你希望更多人使用。所以，如果目标是让人们通过AI工具提高生产力，你就会希望推动实际的员工参与。因此，我们围绕这一点构建了一套工具。然后你必须进入生产力衡量，也就是这些工具是否真的让人们的生产力更高了？我的组织是否真的更有效率了？所以今天，我知道我想用Laridan达到什么目标。我今天喜欢思考的是，我们在生产力方面所做的工作还没有达到我希望的程度，但它肯定比市场上任何现有的东西都要好。所以我们今天所做的是，我们将其他人没有的行为数据结合起来，也就是Alex是否是Chat GPT的重度用户，就这么简单。我们不是在个人层面进行，但我们会用这个例子来做播客，因为我们必须担心公司对其员工的隐私问题。但归根结底，我想了解的是，我的法务部门中使用了我购买的昂贵法律工具的用户，他们的生产力是否比没有使用的用户更高？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">less than people would think today, which makes sense, by the way. I'm going to get to the productivity thing in a second, but you know, anyone listening to this, if you've ever been a part of any software rollout at any enterprise ever, a very boring but very important question is how do we drive actual usage? And sure, everybody uses email. People use Workday because if you don't use Workday, you're going to get fired, right? You're not going to get your paycheck. But most enterprise software, your internet software from SharePoint, things like that are used by a relatively small set of the population that you wish were using it. And so if the goal is to get people more productive using AI tools, you want to drive actual employee engagement. So we built a suite of tools around that. And then you have to get into productivity, which is did this get people actually more productive? Is my organization actually more productive? So today I I know where I want to go with Larin. What I like to think about today is what we're doing today on the productivity side is not as far as I'd like it to go, but it's certainly better than anything that exists in the market. So what we're doing today is we're marrying the behavioral data that no one else has, which is is Alex a heavy user of chat GPT or not, just flat out. We're not doing it at the individual level, but we'll use that example for the podcast because we have to worry about the employee privacy concerns that companies have for their own employees. But at the end of the day, I want to understand, did my users in the legal department that were using this expensive legal tool I bought, right?</p>
</details>

主持人: 他们的生产力是否比法务部门中没有使用的用户更高？因为我肯定已经增加了我的**运营费用**（Opex: Operating Expenses）。我购买了这款软件，增加了我的运营费用。但他们的生产力更高了吗？我的营销人员在使用**Claude**（Anthropic公司开发的大型语言模型）或Chat GPT时，生产力真的更高了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are they more productive than my users in the legal department that are not? Because what I've definitely done is I've driven up my opex. I bought this software. I've driven up my opex. But are they more productive? Are my marketers that are using Claude or Chat GPT actually more productive?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 你如何衡量这一点？所以今天，我们以迄今为止生产力研究唯一存在的方式进行衡量，那就是我们采用人们50年来一直在做的常规生产力调查市场研究。这并不理想，但它是黄金标准。这是**麦肯锡**（McKinsey）、**韦莱韬悦**（Towers Watson）、**埃森哲**（Accenture）等公司所做的。我们在此基础上叠加了其他人没有的专有数据，即实际使用情况。所以我认为，衡量生产力最糟糕的方式是，我向员工发送一份调查问卷，问他们今天使用Chat GPT后是否感觉生产力更高了。首先，存在定义问题。其次，人们会按照你希望他们回答的方式回答。但第三，你根本不知道他们是否真的在使用这些工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you measure that? So today we do it the only way productivity research has ever existed so far, which is we take the normal productivity survey market research that people have done for 50 years. Not ideal, but it is the gold standard. It's McKenzie. It's Towers Watson. It's Accenture. and we lay on top of it proprietary data that other folks don't have which is actual usage. So the way I think of it is the worst way to measure productivity is I'm going to send a survey to my employees and say do you feel more productive today from using chat GPT. First of all there's a definition issue. Second of all people are going to answer the way you hope they'll answer. But third you have no idea if they're actually using the tools.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 所以，一个更好的方法——我多年前在Comscore学到了这一点，我在Comscore做的许多事情之一就是管理我们的调查市场研究团队，Comscore的调查之所以出色，原因之一是我们有行为数据与实际调查回复相结合。我们在这里也做同样的事情。我最终希望达到的目标是完全被动的生产力衡量。但事实是，对于企业来说，这需要客户提供更高水平的额外数据共享，而我们目前尚未获得。我们最终会实现这一目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a better way to do that I learned this years ago at comscore I one of the things one of many things I did at comcore is I ran our survey market research group and one of the reasons the com score surveys were great is we had the behavioral data married with the actual survey responses. We're doing the same thing here. Where I ultimately would like to get to is full passive measurement on productivity. The truth with that is for enterprises that's going to require a level of additional data sharing that we're not getting yet from customers. We we will eventually get there.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但为了更精确地说明这一点，嗯，我是一名律师。我在一家大公司工作。嗯，在某种程度上，生产力，如果我每天只需要工作四小时而不是八小时，那对我来说太棒了，我感觉这是一种胜利，因为我经常思考**委托-代理问题**（Principal-Agent Problem），对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But to kind of like put a finer point on this, um, so I'm a lawyer. I work at, you know, at at some big company. um you know productivity to a certain extent like if I only have to work four hours a day versus eight hours a day like that's great for me like I kind of feel like it's a win because I I often think about like the principal agent problem right</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 所以，每个人都是代理人，然后公司是委托人，它是一个虚无缥缈的存在。就像，你知道，是的，我想如果我持有公司的股票，我希望它更赚钱，但实际上，我希望工作时间尽可能少，报酬尽可能多，这有点像每个个体代理人的工作。然后你有了这些工具。所以理论上，如果人们能够更懒惰，每个人都会采用这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so uh everybody is an agent and then there's the ethereal being of the corporation which is the principal and it's like you know yeah I guess if I own stock in my corporation I want it to be more profitable but really I want to work as little as possible and get paid as much as possible like that's kind of every individual agents job and then you have these tools. So like theoretically it's like everybody's going to adopt these things if they get to be lazier. Yep.</p>
</details>

主持人: 每个人都想更懒惰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like everybody wants to be lazier.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对吧？他们想更懒惰，更富有。我觉得这就像是人类普遍的状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. They want to be lazier and richer. I feel like these are like the universal like kind of human condition.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 有一小部分人想要晋升，但我同意90%的人想要更富有。这是真的，这是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's some small set that want promotions but I agree for 90% richer. That's true. That's true.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以，如果你能通过减少工作量来获得晋升，我相信人们会选择那样做。但我想，每个人都会使用这些工具，或者，我想我曾给你讲过这个悲伤的故事，因为我们的孩子上同一所学校。就像小一点的孩子因为使用Chat GPT作弊被抓了，对他来说，这显然是生产力提升，对吧？因为这让他可以更懒惰，并且在玩电子游戏的时间上更“富有”，直到我们没收了他的手机。嗯，但是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like if you can get the promotion by doing less work, I'm sure people would opt for that. But I guess like how like think about everybody will use these tools or like I think I was telling you this sad story because our kids go to the same school. It's like younger kid gets busted cheating right with chat GPT like clearly productivity gain for him right because it allowed him to be lazier and you know richer with his video game time until we confiscated his phone. Um but</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 但也有一些规则，违反了会惹麻烦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but also a set of rules that you can get in trouble</p>
</details>

主持人: 设定规则，但是，就像拿那个例子来说，你可以想象个体代理人，也就是这个例子中的律师，他受益了，但是公司受益了吗？因为在某种程度上，我付给你同样多的钱，我希望你每天工作八小时，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">set rules but but like take that example like so you can imagine the individual agent you know the human being the the lawyer in this example is benefiting you know but then does the company benefit because to a certain extent like I'm paying you the same amount of money uh I want you to work for eight hours a day right</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 所以实际上，我的期望应该是，如果你——我不知道律师做什么，但比如起草法律文件——如果你现在能在4小时内完成，而不是8小时，你知道，然后你花4小时去打高尔夫，你很高兴你获得了生产力提升。但公司实际上并没有受益，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so actually my expectation should be that if you're whatever I don't know what the lawyer does but like drafting legal drafts like if you can now do it in 4 hours versus eight you know and spend 4 hours uh you playing golf like you're thrilled you got a productivity gain. The company didn't actually benefit, right?</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，所以你想要的是双方都受益，这总是很难的，因为有时很难向那些会淘汰他们工作的人推销产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so what you kind of want is you want both parties to benefit which is always tough because sometimes it's very very hard to sell products to people that eliminate their jobs.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那可能是最难推销的东西。但我的意思是，也许可以拿这个例子来发挥一下，比如，我现在可以在四小时内完成过去需要八小时的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's probably the hardest thing to sell. But like I mean maybe kind of taking this example and riffing on it like uh now I can do in eight hour like in four hours I can do what used to take me eight.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。但公司会怎么想？公司会说：“哦，哇。你仍然在你的基线水平上运作，但实际上，你应该能够用这个工具完成两倍的工作。”所以，我想，你如何定义基线？你如何解决这个问题？你认为我这样说对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. But how does the company a company's like, "Oh, wow. You're still you're you're you're operating at your baseline, but actually you should be able to do twice as much with this tool." So, I guess like how do you define the baseline? How do you address that problem? How do you think am I am I framing it the right way?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 我认为你肯定以正确的方式来描述它，对于某些规模的公司来说，对吧？我们都知道，对于硅谷，由于竞争和股权薪酬形式，你会发现，如果我能在四小时内完成八小时的工作，我只会再工作四小时，然后再工作四小时。这非常不同。在所有规模的公司中，有一部分员工会这样做，在硅谷可能比例更高，但在**通用电气**（GE）这样的公司可能比例更低。通用电气有一些人希望有一天能成为通用电气的**首席执行官**（CEO），这些人会尽可能多地工作。所以有一部分这样的员工。对于其他人，你看，关于管理层将如何整体演变，这是一个有趣的问题，对吧？我认为所有这些背后，我们首先要解决的问题是，就像我说的，人们是否使用这些工具？从公司的角度来看，对于我们的生产力衡量标准——我们正在与每个客户一起定义这些标准，对吧？对于我们的生产力衡量标准，当我们询问员工时，重度用户和轻度用户之间是否存在生产力差异？我们希望通过这种方式衡量的是某种原始的**工作量**（Tonnage of Work）概念，对吧？最终，当我们谈论员工时，有一个共同的语言，那就是**全职当量**（FTE: Full-Time Equivalent）。我们都知道你工作的方式与我不同，与其他人也不同，我们都知道这一点。然而，如果我是摩根大通的CFO——我不需要再次拿摩根大通举例——如果我是摩根大通的CFO，我对1000个FTE、500个FTE或2000个FTE能做什么，有一个基本的直觉。AI肯定会打破所有这些。所以我们今天的主要目标就是为客户建立基线，也就是最终，使用这些工具的人是否比不使用这些工具的人生产力更高？在此基础上叠加工作时间。你可以得到一个相当好的结果。它永远不会完美。人们会休假。你必须以团队为单位进行衡量，对吧？任何一个人……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think I think you're framing it I I think you're certainly framing it all right way for certain size of companies, right? We all know for Silicon Valley what you're going to have just because of the competition and the equity form of compensation. What you'll have is if I can get done in four hours what I could have done in eight, I'm just going to work four more hours and then another four. And that that's very different. That that's there's some subset of workers at all size companies, probably a larger percent in Silicon Valley, but a smaller percent in at GE, right? There are people at GE who want to one day become the CEO of GE and those people will work as much as they possibly can. So there's some subset of workers there. For the rest, look, there's an interesting question about how is management going to evolve overall, right? I think behind all this the first question is the first question we're trying to solve is like I said do people use these and from a corporation standpoint for our measures of productivity which is we're defining it with each of our customers right for our measures of productivity as we ping folks is there a difference in productivity between the heavy users and the lighter users what we want to measure with that we won't we're not doing this today what we want to measure with that is then some concept of raw tonnage of work right the ultimate there's this lingua franco uh when we talk about kind of employees of FTE right and we all know that you work different than I work and then you know various people work and we all know that yet if I'm the CFO of I don't have to pick on JP Morgan again if I'm the CFO of JP Morgan I have a fundamental you know horse sense for what do a th00and FTE do versus 500 FT versus 2,000 FTE and AI is going to break all of that for for sure and so our main goal today is just to build the baseline for our customers which is at the end of the A are the people using these tools fundamentally more productive than the folks that aren't. Layer on top of that tonnage of amount of time worked. You can get a pretty good It's never perfect. People are on vacation. You have to measure this as groups, right? Any given person</p>
</details>

主持人: 有一天生病了，或者有一天在飞机上，或者有一天在培训中，这几乎不可能衡量。从系统角度看，他们似乎没有工作。但他们实际上在工作。他们在接受培训，对吧？所以，把这看作是聚合数据。它永远不是有用的。这些数据在Russ Frerichs个人层面永远不是有用的。我的意思是，从存在主义的角度看，我昨天有生产力吗？这是不可知的。我无法知道我昨天是否有生产力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">was out sick one day or was on a flight one day or was at a training one day that it's impossible to measure and you you it seems from a system standpoint they weren't working. They actually were working. They were doing a training, right? So think of this as at the aggregate data. It's never useful. None of this data is ever useful at the Russ Freighten level. I mean to get existential, was I productive yesterday? It's is unknowable. Like I can't know if I was productive yesterday.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 我认为你是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you were I</p>
</details>

主持人: 我完全支持。但我们试图在公司层面做的，是在系统层面理解，这些工具的特定使用——高级使用、轻度使用、重度使用——与生产力之间是否存在某种关联？用户在工作中是否更有效率？员工在工作中是否更有效率？然后在此基础上衡量这些员工群体实际工作的时间。因为如果我今天是一名CFO，目标不是要了解Ben做得好不好，Tina做得好不好，目标是了解我是否被要求增加50%的运营费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was all for it. But what we're trying to do at the systems level for companies is understand is there some correlation between specific use of these tools on advanced side, light side, heavy side, he heavy user of the tool, lighter use of the tool. Were the were the users more productive in their job? Were the employees more productive in their job? and then measure on top of that amount of time those segments of workers were actually working because the goal if I'm a CFO today is not to understand did Ben do a good job and did Tina do a good job the goal is to understand I have definitely been asked to spend 50% more on opex</p>

Russ Frerichs: 对。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">did I drive something right and and then by the way there are interesting questions we know this around staffing size and will companies get more done because people will actually work eight hours Yeah,</p>

Russ Frerichs: 看，我怀疑，如果随着时间的推移，所有员工现在每天工作四小时而不是八小时变得清晰，那么这确实是管理者要做的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">look, it will turn out I suspect it is true that this is one of the things managers do. I suspect it is true over time if it becomes clear that all of your employees are now working four hours a day instead of eight.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你可能会决定减少员工数量，剩下的员工将每天工作六小时。我不确定我真的相信在未来几年内，你会看到大公司的人们真的只工作一半的时间。你知道，个体经营者就是这样。如果我是一个个体经营的律师，我今天衡量生产力的唯一标准，无论如何，对我自己来说，对吧？就是我愿意工作多努力，我想要多少钱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You will probably decide to have fewer employees and they will work the remaining employees will work six hours a day. I'm not sure I really buy in the next couple of years you will see people in large companies actually just working half as much. You know, sole proprietors is what it is. Like I if I were a sole proprietor lawyer kind of my only measure of productivity today is to myself anyway, right? It's how hard do I want to work and how much money do I want?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 在那里，委托人就是代理人。这就是为什么它如此重要，这也是为什么，坦率地说，我喜欢你所做的事情。显然，我喜欢你所做的事情，这就是你在这里的原因。但是，你没有基线。就像，这是否有效？首先，你必须知道如何，你必须定义产出。你有投入，这主要是时间和金钱，对吧？

</details>

Russ Frerichs: 被腐蚀了，因为现在人们决定做更多事情来达到这个目标，它就不再是一个客观的衡量标准了。所以，你知道，其中一部分是，如果我试图弄清楚，好吧，有一个产品叫**Harvey**（一种AI法律助手）。很多人喜欢Harvey，它似乎能让人们的生产力大大提高，但与什么相比呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">corrupted because because now now people decide to do more things to hit this target and it's no longer an objective measure. So, you know, part of it is if I'm trying to figure out like, okay, there's a product called Harvey. A lot of people love Harvey and it seems to make people a lot more productive but compared to what</p>
</details>

主持人: 对吧？所以对我来说，你回答这个问题的唯一方式——我们会谈论Harvey，我对他没有任何意见，我相信Harvey很棒——对我来说，真正理解这一点，这就是为什么我认为公司传统上做这件事的方式根本行不通，那就是：“嘿，让我们调查使用Harvey的人，问他们是否提高了生产力。”顺便说一句，他们都会说“是”，因为没有人会回答“没有”，这是第一点；第二点，我的老板为这个产品付了钱，我肯定会说它是个好产品，对吧？除非我们普遍讨厌它，但我假设Harvey并非如此，因为每个人似乎都喜欢Harvey。所以这很棒。所以我认为你唯一能做的，这就是为什么我认为传统的衡量方式是失效的。你看，这就是我们创办Laridan的原因。你真正能做的就是，在不询问人们的情况下，了解这些人实际使用了多少Harvey？对吧？我们有五个人，我们有六个人，无论他们在调查中怎么说。有两个人从未登录过。对吧？我们都见过那个笑话，你知道，你的项目到期了。一个小时后到期。你说你已经赶上了，然后你，哦，我必须请求权限才能访问这个Google文档，对吧？所以，六个人中有两个人——我当然是编造这些数字的——六个人中有两个人，在被告知的那天注册了Harvey，然后就再也没有用过。他们对自己的工作方式非常满意。他们每天都以这种方式工作。六个人中有两个人登录并使用了一点点。六个人中有两个人一直在使用。我唯一能开始理解这个软件是否有价值的方式是，被动地知道这些数据，而不问这些人问题，然后问每个人关于生产力的相同问题，并衡量实际产出的工作量。如果我把这三件事结合起来，那么我就可以开始形成对Harvey是否有用的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right and so to me the only way you answer that we'll talk about Harvey nothing against Harvey I'm sure Harvey is amazing uh to me the only way to really understand this and that's why I think the traditional way companies are doing this just doesn't work at all which is hey let's survey the people that use Harvey and ask them if they were productive and by the way they will all say yes because no one ever answers they weren't number one and number two my boss paid for the product I'm I'm going to say it was a good product right unless We all universally hate it which I assume is not true of Harvey because everyone seems to like Harvey. So that's wonderful. So I think all you can actually do is it's why I think the traditional way of measuring this is broken. Look, it's why we started learning it. All you can really do is understand without asking people how much usage of Harvey are these people actually doing, right? We have five people, we have six people, whatever they'd say on a survey. Two have never logged in. Right? We've all seen the joke about, you know, your project is due. It's due in an hour. You said you were caught up and then you, oh [ __ ] I have to ask permission for this Google back, right? So, there's two of the six, I'm making these numbers up, of course. Two of the six people actually signed up for Harvey the day they were told and then never went back to it all. They're very happy with the way they work. They work that way all day, every day. Two of the six log in and use a little bit. And two of the six use it all the time. The only way I can even begin to understand if that software is valuable is by knowing that data passively without asking those folks the question and then asking everyone the same questions about productivity and measure with amount of work actually output. And if I take those three things together then I can begin to form an understanding of was Harvey useful.</p>

### 企业AI采用的挑战与员工焦虑

主持人: 对吧？你和我都曾与某人讨论过，他们公司激励工程师的方式之一是，他们有一个排行榜，显示每位工程师在云代码上花费了多少钱。创始人谈到他如何找到他的一位最优秀的工程师，说：“我不明白发生了什么。你是我们最优秀的工程师之一。为什么你没有在**Cursor**（一种AI辅助编程工具）上花任何钱？抱歉，不是云代码。为什么你没有在Cursor上花任何钱？我真的不明白发生了什么。”所以，对于那些非常依赖开发者的公司来说，这是一个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? You and I had a discussion with someone uh where they were talking about one of the ways they uh incent their engineers at their company is they have a leaderboard of the amount of money each engineer spends on cloud code. And the founder was talking about how uh he went to one of his best engineers and said, "I don't understand what's happening. You're one of our best engineers. Why aren't you spending any money with uh cursor? I'm sorry, not cloud code. Why aren't you spending any money with cursor? I I really don't get what's going on." And so that that was an example of for these companies where they're very developer heavy,</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

主持人: 你可能不需要我们。如果你是一家非常依赖开发者的公司，衡量在Cursor上花费的金额，加上你对这个人是否实际工作的正常管理理解。如果他们每天工作两小时，你可能会对此满意，也可能不满意。这取决于公司、生活方式和文化。但你在办公室里。我看到你在那里。你没有在Cursor上花任何钱。怎么回事？对吧？我们有这些指标。但问题是，我们看到了数百种AI工具的爆炸式增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You probably don't need us. If you're a very developer heavy company, probably measuring amount of money spent on cursor plus your kind of normal management understanding of is this person actually working? If they come in for two hours a day, you may be happy with that, you may not. That's going to be company specific and lifestyle specific and culture specific. But you're in the office. I see you're there. You're not spending any amount money on cursor. what's up right we have these metrics the issue though is we see this explosion of there's hundreds of AI tools</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 而且公司有数百个职位，所以这就是为什么我们想尝试用一些关于AI的真正有用的数据来取代麦肯锡的企业健康指数或韦莱韬悦或埃森哲的调查。但我认为Cursor的例子确实在我脑海中清晰地展现了你希望为整个公司做些什么，那就是这个人工作了多少？所以我有了那个定量的判断，作为一名经理，定性地判断，对吧？我们不是在取代这个。他们做得好吗？然后从根本上说，他们是否使用了这些工具？当你把这三件事结合起来时，那是你进行衡量的唯一方式。就像我说的，当你想到我的微观世界时，如果你真的认为摩根大通的IT支出将从180亿美元增加到300亿或400亿美元，CFO不会只是说没问题。对。今天，我们的客户是**首席信息官**（CIO: Chief Information Officer）。我认为随着时间的推移，我们的客户将成为CIO和CFO的合作伙伴。数字太大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and companies have hundreds of roles and so that's why we want to try and replace you know the Mackenzie corporate health index or tal Watson or the Accenture surveys with some real useful data around AI but I think that kind of Cursor example really crystallized in my mind what you'd want to be able to do for a whole company which is how much did this person work so I have that qual you know I have that quantitative judgment qualitatively as a matter manager, right? We're not replacing this. Did they do a good job? And then fundamentally, did they use the tools? And when you take those three things together, that's the only way you're going to have measurement. And like I said, when you think about my, you know, micro world of if you really think JP Morgan is going to go from spending 18 billion in it to 30 billion or 40 billion, the CFO is not just going to say no problem. Right. Today, our customer is a CIO. I think over time, our customer becomes a partnership with the CIO and the CFO. The numbers are just big.</p>

主持人: 嗯，显然公司本身，如果你问任何试图向你推销产品的公司，问他们你的产品是否有效，他们可能会99次中有99次说：“当然有效！”对吧？就像它是最好的。它是最好的。你需要一个独立的仲裁者。

<p class="english-text">Well, and obviously the companies themselves, like if you ask any company that is trying to sell you anything and you ask them, does your product work, they will probably 99 times out of 99 say like, of course it does, right? That like it's the best. It's the best. You need to have an independent arbiter.</p>

Russ Frerichs: 嗯，这就是你们发挥作用的地方。但就像之前深入探讨的这一点，这几乎就像公司层面的**强化学习**（Reinforcement Learning），对吧？我正在寻找什么结果？有时很清楚，对吧？所以，嗯，这就是衡量和目标问题也相关的地方，因为就像我希望你写更多行代码。哇，如果有一个衡量指标是写了多少行代码，但如果它成为目标，那么你就会写出一些胡言乱语的代码，然后你就会……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and that that's where you guys come in. But kind of like double clicking on this this point before, it's almost like reinforcement learning at a companywide level, right? Of what is the outcome that I'm looking for? And sometimes it's clear, right? Right. So, um, and this is where the the measurement and target thing is also relevant because it's like I want you to write more lines of code. Whoa, if that's there's a measurement of like how many lines of code were written, but if it becomes the target, then you're just like writing gobbly good code and like you're</p>

主持人: 对于销售来说，这很容易。我希望你卖出更多东西，但从你与客户交谈到你收钱之间有很多延迟。所以你可能会有中间目标，你可能会有中间衡量标准。如果你是律师，起草更多合同。所以我想你如何定义目标？因为其中一些就像是正在流动的背景信息。就像正在发送的电子邮件，或者发送的**Slack**（一款团队协作软件）消息，或者编辑过的**Google Docs**（谷歌文档）。就像有这些非常非常清晰的衡量标准，但这些不一定是产出。所以首先，关于你的衡量观点，这就是我之前说的，如果你考虑任何时候存在真正的第三方衡量，就会出现这种有趣的动态。我们在Comscore看到了这一点，但任何时候他们试图建立一家第三方衡量公司，每个人都看到了这一点。Omniture在早期也看到了这一点。Google在某个时候曾抵制，然后实际上收购了**Urchin**（一款网络分析软件）并建立了**Google Analytics**（谷歌分析），对吧？因为事实证明，如果你的产品确实有价值，那么客户能够追踪价值实际上是件好事，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for sales it's very easy. I want you to sell more stuff, but there's a lot of latency between like you go talk to a customer and then you go collect money. So you might have targets in between, you might have measurements in between if you're a lawyer, draft more contracts. So I guess how do you try to define the goals? Because some of them are just like it's kind of I think of it as like background information that's going through. It's like emails that are being sent or you know Slacks that were sent or Google Docs that were edited. like there are these key like there are these very very clear measurements but those aren't necessarily outputs. So first to your point on measurement this is why I said earlier if you think about anytime true third-party measurement exists there's this interesting dynamic and we saw this at com scorecore but everyone has seen this anytime they tried to build a third party measurement company omnature saw this in the early days Google at some point fought it and then actually bought urchin and built Google analytics right because it turned out it's actually good when your customers can track value if what you do is actually valuable right</p>

Russ Frerichs: 所以我的一般观点是，我认为今天很多AI公司可能对我们不屑一顾，但我认为随着时间的推移，那些真正提供价值的AI工具肯定会喜欢我们，对吧？你最终解锁真正企业预算的方式是因为人们相信这些工具确实有价值。所以我们今天所做的——这是一个旅程，对吧？公司成立大约一年了——所以我们今天所做的是，我们与所有客户合作，说：“看，这些是基线生产力问题，它们是黄金标准，人们已经问了70年了，你知道，它们有利有弊，但你必须从某个地方开始。这就是我们开始的地方，让我们为你的每个部门定义一套指标。”我们发现，真正重要的一件事，不是公司与员工分享的指标（因为那样就会出现**古德哈特定律**问题），而是实际情况，那就是基本的响应能力。我花了一定数量的钱在我的法务部门，我对他们今天的生产力感到满意。所以，除非我试图解雇律师，而我没有这样做，否则你可以争辩说我如何衡量软件的价值？我想我的律师可能会更开心，但我没有人员流失问题。所以坦率地说，我为什么要这样做？所以我们发现，我们发现的一件事几乎就是部门间的**服务水平协议**（SLA: Service Level Agreement），也就是说，如果我推出这些工具，并且我没有解雇员工——因为看待这个问题的一种方式是我是否可以解雇一半的律师。事实证明，公司并不真正喜欢解雇员工。如果不得不，公司会解雇员工，但我实际上从未见过一位CFO对解雇30%的员工感到兴奋。除了呼叫中心，那是另一个我们可以讨论的问题。公司对待呼叫中心员工的方式与对待其他员工不同。但除了呼叫中心，我从未见过一位CFO，如果你对CFO说：“你可以解雇一半的**财务规划与分析**（FPNA: Financial Planning and Analysis）人员。”他不想解雇Tina。他认识Tina。他见过Tina的丈夫和孩子。他不想解雇Tina。他希望Tina更快乐，生产力更高。实际上，他希望她做得很好，永不辞职，对吧？公司并不真正喜欢人员流失。所以我们发现，人们似乎非常兴奋的一个指标是，这是否提高了或降低了部门间的响应能力。所以一个衡量标准是，我现在是否愿意向法务部门发送更多事情？对吧？如果我打算保持法务部门的规模不变，我不会开始起诉更多人。我们这里谈论的是公司，而不是律师事务所，那里的生产力衡量标准不同。成本中心而不是利润中心。所以，随着时间的推移，我的律师现在生产力更高了，其他部门是否向他们提出了更多问题？他们是否更快地得到了回复？当我在产品部门向工程师寻求意见时，他们是否更快地回复了？对吧？这对我来说是一个很好的方式，可以行为上看到我们变得更有效率了，这与代码行数无关。顺便说一句，我同意，如果你公开这个指标并说：“嘿，你最好有响应。”人们可能会撒谎，他们可能会来回发送Slack消息。但我真正想了解的是，作为一款应用程序，我的哪些部门更多地使用了这些工具？他们是否对我的其他部门变得更具响应性？因为当你身处一家大公司时，人们都知道这一点。这是小公司在创新方面做得如此出色的原因之一。所有这些公司都存在巨大的协调问题。我们都知道这一点。你知道，在硅谷，嘲笑这些公司很有趣。但实际上，每个企业家的秘密梦想都是变得如此庞大，以至于他们拥有一家巨大的官僚公司。当然，Google在30年前并没有计划拥有一个巨大的官僚机构。他们只是变得如此成功，以至于现在确实拥有一个巨大的官僚机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so my general perspective is I think Today a lot of the AI companies probably look a scance at us but I think over time certainly the AI tools that actually provide value are going to love us right the way you will ultimately unlock real enterprise budget is because people believe these tools are actually valuable so what we do today and this is a journey right the company's about a year old so what we do today is we work with all of our customers say look here are the baseline productivity questions that are gold standard that people have asked for 70 years you know there's pros and cons to them but this is you have to start somewhere. This is where we start and let's define a set of metrics for each of your uh departments. One of the things we've found that actually seems to matter not as a metric that companies share with their employees because then you have the good hearts law problem but as an actual reality on the ground is fundamental responsiveness. There is an element of I spend some amount of money on my legal department and I am happy with the amount of productivity they do today. So there is an element of unless I'm trying to fire lawyers, which I'm not, you can argue I how would I measure the value of software? I guess my lawyers might be happier, but I don't have a churn problem there. So frankly, why should I do this? And so what we found is one of the things we found is just almost an interdep departmental SLA, which is it turns out if I roll out these tools and I'm not firing employees because one way to look at this is could I fire half my lawyers. Turns out companies don't really like firing people. Companies do fire people if they have to, but I've actually never met a CFO that got excited about firing 30% of the workforce. Outside of call centers, that's a different issue we could talk about. Like companies treat their call center employees different from the rest of their employees. But outside of call centers, I've never met a CFO who was if you went to a CFO and said, "You can fire half your FPNA people." He doesn't want to fire Tina. He knows Tina. He's met Tina's husband and children. He doesn't want to fire Tina. He'd like Tina to be happier and more productive. And actually, he'd like her to do a great job and never quit, right? Companies don't really like churn. So one of the metrics we found that people seem quite excited about is just did this raise or lower the interdep departmental responsiveness. So a measure would be am I now comfortable sending more things to legal. Right? If I'm going to keep my legal department the same size I'm not going to start suing more people. We're talking about companies here not law firms where is a different measure of productivity right there. Cost centers not profit centers. So one thing to do it is did over time because my lawyers are now more productive are other departments asking them more questions are they getting their responses faster when I'm in product and I'm asking for input from engineers are they responding more quickly right that is a that is a good way for me to see behaviorally we become more productive that's not lines of code now by the way I agree if you expose the metric and say hey you better be responsive people can lie they can send slack messages back and forth but what I'd really like to understand is as a app. Which of my departments use these tools more? And do they become more responsive to my other departments because there's an element of when you're at a big company, people know this. It's one of the reasons small companies do so well in innovation. There's just a giant coordination problem for all of these companies. And we know this. And you know, in Silicon Valley, it's fun to make fun of these companies. But actually, every entrepreneur's secret dream is to become so large that they have a giant bureaucratic company. Of course, Google did not plan to have a giant bureaucracy 30 years ago. they just became so successful they now do have a giant bureaucracy.</p>

### 7000亿美元的浪费：企业AI支出的真相

主持人: 对吧？嗯，你知道，这算是一个很好的过渡，可以谈谈企业AI的现状。对吧？所以你谈到了350人。

<p class="english-text">Right. And uh you know kind of that that's kind of a good segue into perhaps the the state of AI enterprise. Right. So you went on this whole like listen you talked about what 350 people.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 是的。我们采访了350家大公司的IT负责人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. We we interviewed 350 heads of IT at major companies.</p>

主持人: 嗯，涵盖了整个范围，对吧？这不仅仅是硅谷的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and across the whole the whole gamut, right? It was it wasn't just uh you know kind of Silicon Valley companies that</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 不，我的意思是，老实说，我整个职业生涯，除了帮助我的朋友在**Carbon**（一家3D打印公司）工作了几年，以及花了一年时间试图解决**wine.com**（一家在线葡萄酒零售商）的问题之外，我的整个职业生涯都在向大公司销售软件，主要是大公司或老公司。是的，偶尔会有硅谷公司发展非常迅速，但如果你是**财富500强**（Fortune 500）公司，99%的情况下你都会有20年以上的历史，对吧？所以如果你要向拥有1000多名员工的公司销售，那么从定义上来说，他们几乎都是一家老公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">not not I mean in all honesty my whole career basically I spent a couple years helping my friend at Carbon and I spent a year trying to fix wine.com but other than that my whole career has been selling software to large companies mostly large companies or older companies yes there's the occasional Silicon Valley company that grows very quickly but if you are in the Fortune 500 you are going to be 20 plus years old 99% of the time right and so if you're going to sell to someone with more than a thousand employees. They're almost by definition an older company.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。那么，你学到了什么？也许给我们讲讲重点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, what may maybe give us the highlights of of what you learned.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。我们看到了许多不同的事情，你知道，人们以前也见过这种情况。我实际上并不这么认为。你会看到人们把这变成一种点击诱饵式的恐吓。我真的不这么认为。所以，首先，我们看到的是，我们从**高德纳**（Gartner）那里知道，企业AI领域有大约7000亿美元的支出。它增长非常非常快。它将继续快速增长。我们发现的一件事是，我们采访的大约70%的领导者表示，他们确信自己在这里浪费了钱。钱花得太快了。顺便说一句，我们应该感到羞愧。我们根本没有系统来衡量这一点。我稍后会回到报告，但我今天正在和一位客户交谈。我们为什么签下他们作为客户？他们是一家由**私募股权公司**（PE firm: Private Equity firm）拥有的非常盈利的企业，他们的老板，也就是他们的私募股权所有者，给了他们今年必须做的五件事。其中一件就是要在整个组织中采用AI。他说：“每次董事会议，对于其他四项指标，我都有报告来展示我们相对于这些报告的进展。”而对于AI，我只有我们购买了多少东西的数据，对吧？这不对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. We we saw a bunch of different things and you know, people have seen this before. I I actually don't think of this. You'll see people turn this into kind of clickbaity fear-mongering things. I don't I don't really think of it that way. So, first of all, we saw like is we know this from Gardner. There's like $700 billion being spent in enterprise AI. It's growing very very quickly. It's going to keep growing quickly. And one of the things we found is something like 70% of leaders we talked to said we are sure we are wasting money here. It's being spent so quickly. And by the way, shame on us. We had no system to measure this in the first place. I'll get back to the report in a second, but I was talking to a customer today. Uh why did we sign them as a customer? They're a very profitable business owned by a PE firm and their bosses, the their PE owners, gave them five things they had to do this year. And one of the five was adopt AI across the organization. And he said, "Every board meeting, I go in for my other four metrics, I have some report of how are we doing against those reports." And on AI, all I have is the amount of stuff we bought, right? It's not.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以，是的，是的，我做得很好。但事实证明……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yes, yes, I'm doing great. But it turned out</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 我们有一个庞大的AI家族。我们采用了所有这些。一切都很棒。但事实证明，我们想真正做到这一点。所以我们发现，这些领导者，也许他们是对的，他们70%的项目都失败了，无论他们是否正确。这是一个巨大的问题。他们之所以有这种感觉，是因为他们根本没有系统来弄清楚。没有人相信他们75%的广告支出都失败了。这不是因为他们的广告策划者比他们的AI采购者更聪明。而是因为有20年的系统到位，帮助我理解当我购买这个广告活动时，当我花这笔钱时，当我进行这个应用程序安装时，无论它是什么，它是否真的为我带来了价值？而我们只是在AI领域没有这样的系统，就像我说的，除了一些非常非常具体的垂直领域。所以，我们发现的最大问题实际上有三点。第一，你看到了AI支出。第二，就像我说的，他们相信70%多的AI项目都被浪费了。但我们发现的另一件事是，我们采访的公司中，大约80%到85%——我不记得是80%还是85%——的公司表示，他们真的相信自己只有未来18个月的时间来成为领导者，否则就会落后。所以我认为，预算出现巨大解锁的原因之一是，这些企业存在巨大的焦虑，他们觉得如果我们不采用这些东西，我们就会失败。所以我们正在快速采用它。我们不知道它是否成功。我们的员工并没有真正使用它。顺便说一句，在所有这些AI热潮中，公司里有一个被遗忘的群体，从我上一家公司来看，我们建立了一家非常非常大型的**人力资源技术**（HR Technology）公司，我们向人力资源负责人销售，接触到公司的所有员工，但我们是向人力资源负责人销售的。所以当我们与许多老客户交谈时——他们今天并不是我们的客户，但他们是影响者——他们都会说，在所有这些大公司中，我们的员工真的很担心。他们甚至不担心会失去工作，对AI和经济等所有这些事情存在一种基本的担忧。他们甚至不担心会失去工作，只是他们每天都被告知要使用一套新系统，对吧？通常，如果你在大公司工作，每年会有一两个新系统倡议。现在，有20种新工具。他们不知道，他们不知道自己被允许做什么，他们也没有接受培训。他们到底如何让人们使用这些工具？所以，你面临着一种奇怪的，你面临着一种奇怪的，几乎是完美的风暴。这就是我们对Laridan感到兴奋的原因。这就是你对Laridan感到兴奋的原因。你面临着预算大幅增长、对一切都无效的巨大焦虑、以及员工对他们被允许做什么的巨大焦虑的完美风暴。所以我们试图做的是，我认为我们并没有解决所有这些问题。那样说会很荒谬，但我认为我们确实在所有这些方面提供了帮助，比如你最初的衡量计划是什么？有人使用它吗？他们使用后生产力更高了吗？你如何为他们提供更多使用它的工具？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we have a large family of AI. We adopted all these. It's all great. But it turns out we want to actually do it. And so what we found is these leaders like maybe they are right that 70% of their projects are failing regardless of their right. It's a giant problem. They feel that way because they have no system to figure it out in the first place. No one believes 75% of their ad spend is failing. It's not because their ad planners are smarter than their AI buyers. It's because there are 20 years of systems in place to help me understand when I buy this ad campaign, when I spend this money, when I do this app install, whatever it is, did it actually drive value for me? And we just don't really have that in AI, like I said, outside of some very, very specific verticals. And so really, the biggest thing we found was kind of three things. One, you saw the AI spend. Two, something like I said, they believe 70s something% of AI projects are wasted. But the other thing we found is basically 80 85% I can't remember 80 85% of the companies we talked to said they really believe they only have the next 18 months to either become a leader or fall behind. So I think one of the things one of the reasons you've seen this giant unlock and budget is there's tremendous anxiety at these enterprises going like we're going to lose if we don't adopt this stuff yet. So we're adopting it quickly. We have no particular idea if it's succeeding. Our employees aren't really using it. by the way a forgotten group in the company for all of this AI and uh from my last company we built a very very large HR uh technology company uh we sold into heads of HR touched all the employees in the company but we sold into heads of HR and so as we've talked to a lot of our old customers who aren't really our customers today but they're influencers what they will all say at all of these large companies is hey our employees are really worried it's not even they're worried they're going to lose their job there's a base level of worry about AI and the economy all that stuff it's not even they're worried they're going to lose their job it's just they're getting told to use a new system all day every day, right? Generally, if you work in a large company, there's one or two new systems initiatives a year. Now, there's 20 new tools. They don't know, they don't know what they're allowed to do, and they have no training. How do they actually how do I get people using these tools? And so, you have this weird we you have this weird almost perfect storm. It's why we're excited about Laren. It's why you're excited about Laren. You have this perfect storm of tremendous growth in budget, tremendous anxiety that none of it is working, tremendous anxiety from their employees about what they're even allowed to do. And so what we're trying to do is I don't think we solve all of that. That would be an absurd thing to say, but I think we really help with all of that about like what is your plan to measure this in the first place? Did anyone use it? Did they become more productive when they did? How do you give them the tools to use it more?</p>

### 赋能员工：让AI从“秘密武器”走向普及

主持人: 是的。嗯，最后一点也超级有趣，因为它就像是：它是否有效？效果有多好？衡量标准是什么？确保衡量标准不会变成目标，就像我们刚才谈论的所有事情一样。然后，用我儿子作弊数学作业的比喻来说，嗯，有些人就像是：“哇，他们是公司里的实干家。”这实际上就是为什么我坚信AI被低估了。是的。你知道，我们有一个小群聊，里面有位朋友说：“哦，所有这些东西都被过度炒作了，最终会归零。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, and that that kind of last point is super interesting as well because it's like there's the did it work, how well did it work, you know, what are the measurements, make sure that the measurements don't become targets, like all the stuff that we just talked about. And then to use the metaphor of my my son who cheated on his math homework, um there are people that are just like, "Wow, like they're they're the go-getters in the company." This is actually why I am convinced that AI is underhyped. Yes. You know, we have our little group chat where we have another friend who's like, "Oh, all this stuff is overhyped and it's going to zero."</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 完全正确。我每次使用AI，都觉得它很棒。

<p class="english-text">it's like somebody in the company and sometimes again I I not to like oversimplify human behavior but it's like I want to be lazy and I want to be rich yes</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 对，就像这两种驱动人们的因素，我发现这个工具能让我更懒惰、更富有，这实际上对公司有帮助。是的。所以不是数学，不是作弊，对吧？就像你得到了，我现在知道我的老板认为这需要八小时。我找到了一个在5秒内完成它的方法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">right like these are the two things that are motivating people and like I found this tool that allows me to be lazier and richer that actually helps the company. Yes. So not the math, not the cheating, right? It's like you're getting like I can now I know that my boss was thinking this would take eight hours. I've figured out a way to do it in 5 seconds</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's really good by the way.</p>

<p class="english-text">It's really good. And the worst thing that can happen this is like the inverse of everything that we just talked about. The worst thing that can happen is that guy keeps it a secret.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 对。因为他可能害怕。他会想：“哦，我被允许使用这个吗？”但你应该做的是，这就是AI如何从被低估到被正确炒作，嗯，并正确普及的方式：就像每家大公司里都有人已经发现了这一点，就像我可以在一分钟内完成过去需要八小时的工作。我们需要让这个人成为英雄，将这件事记录下来，并在整个公司推广。那么你如何做到这一点呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Because like and and he might be afraid. It's like, oh, am I allowed to use this? But what you should do, this is how AI will go from underhyped to like correctly hyped um and correctly diffused is it's like there's somebody at every big company who has figured out this like I could do something in one minute that used to take eight hours. We need to like make this person a hero, memorialize this and push it out through the entire company. So like how do you do that?</p>
</details>

主持人: 这就是我关于AI参与度方面所说的那一点，这是一个很好的问题。这就是我关于AI参与度方面所说的那一点。这是每个人利益一致的领域之一。努力工作的员工喜欢被认可。顺便说一句，他希望他的同事也能跟上。嗯，感到害怕的员工需要支持和培训。顺便说一句，公司实际上希望他们的员工生产力更高。我知道对一部分人来说，在推特上发推文很有趣，但就像我说的，我还没有找到一位CEO——我花了30年时间向CEO推销东西——我还没有找到一位CEO早上醒来就想经营一家规模更小的公司。他想要更多的员工，他想要更多的利润。他想要更多的收入。但与普遍看法相反，他们想要更多的员工。他们喜欢经营大公司。他们确实如此。你可以找到**拉里·佩奇**（Larry Page: Google联合创始人）过去谈论他如何计划让Google有一天拥有100万员工的采访。他花了很多时间思考自动驾驶汽车如何将汽车移到停车场，因为这还是在远程工作出现之前。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This was my point on the uh what we're doing on the AI engagement side and that that's that's a great question. This is my point on what we're doing on the A engagement side. This is one of these areas where everyone's interests are aligned. The employee that's working very hard loves recognition. And by the way, he'd like his co-workers to come up to speed. Um the employee that's scared wants support and wants training. And by the way, companies actually want their employees to be more productive. I know it's a fun thing for a subset of people to tweet about, but like I said, I have yet to find the CEO in all of I've spent 30 years selling things to CEOs. I've yet to find the CEO who wakes up in the morning and wants to run a smaller company. He wants more employees and he wants more profit. He wants more revenue. But contrary to popular belief, they want more employees. They like running big companies. They do. You can find old interviews of Larry Page talking about his plan for how Google was going to have a million employees one day.

Russ Frerichs: 而且实际上，100万员工的汽车要停在哪里？我记得15年前我读到过那篇文章，它一直在我脑海中挥之不去，我从未见过一位CEO想经营一家规模更小的公司。顺便说一句，这是资本市场中一个完全不相关的问题。如果你遇到一家**企业集团**（Conglomerate）的CEO，他们从不想拆分企业集团的原因之一是，他们喜欢经营更大的公司。这更有趣，对吧？我经营过公司，我的公司也发展壮大。它们变大后更有趣。是的，这非常酷。所以从员工的角度来看，我们用**Nexus**（Laridan的产品）这个产品构建的，实际上是一个我们说——或者我讲一个轶事。我七月份在英国，嗯，我参加了很多销售电话会议，我当时正在和一家银行的人交谈，一家非常大的、监管非常严格的欧洲银行，他们是世界上受监管最严格的机构之一，至少在采用新技术方面速度最慢，老实说，这有很好的理由。他们给我讲了一个故事，说他们有一个28岁的年轻人，我不记得这在投资银行中是什么级别，所以我们姑且称之为董事，但我不知道，一个28岁的年轻人，他在投资银行方面非常非常擅长使用Chat GPT。他们让他制作了一个30页的幻灯片演示文稿，然后他们为投资银行的所有员工组织了一场全球电话会议，让这个年轻人花一小时向大家讲解如何使用Chat GPT。我相信这对他来说很酷，但这很荒谬。以这种荒谬的方式期望人们采纳改变世界的技术。另一个荒谬的做法是去购买一些**LMS**（Learning Management System: 学习管理系统）课程，那是人力资源部门会购买的，你知道，很多LMS的秘密，除了你必须做的事情，否则你就会失业，比如性骚扰培训、**HIPAA**（Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act: 健康保险流通与责任法案）培训，否则没有人会去做。他们就是不会去。那么我如何才能真正让人们使用这些工具呢？这就是我之前说的，你希望帮助他们A不显得笨拙，B知道他们不会被解雇。所以我们实际上所做的就是构建了这些围绕模型的**封装器**（Wrappers）。所以我们不告诉人们使用Claude，或者使用**Gemini**（Google开发的多模态大型语言模型），或者使用Chat GPT。我们构建的另一件事是，因为人们也担心被解雇。他们担心因为经济原因、因为AI、因为各种原因而被解雇，这是一种新工具，我不想被解雇。顺便说一句，当你谈论欧洲银行时，有很多法规是一个合理的担忧，如果我们的员工做错了事情，我们就会被罚款。别管你是否解雇他们。这些公司不想被罚款。所以我们做的另一件事是，我们基本上训练了我们自己的定制**Llama**（Meta开发的大型语言模型）模型，以阻止人们提出非法或公司不希望你提出的问题。所以我们这里不是在谈论黑客。公司里真正的恶意行为者有很多安全解决方案。我们真正谈论的是，我是一个大公司的人力资源运营人员，我应该进行劳动力分析。我被允许进入Chat GPT并加载我们完整的员工数据库，包括种族和性别吗？我不知道。我不想被解雇。也许我被允许，也许不被允许。顺便说一句，我认为公司有责任对我们的员工说：“这是一个安全的空间。你在这里做的任何事情都不会让你被解雇。”所以我们说：“哦，Alex，你不允许上传包含社会安全数据的文件。不要分享那个。你不允许提出那个提示，因为在欧洲，我们不允许使用人力资源。我们不允许使用AI来撰写员工绩效评估。”我不知道那是不是一个好法律或坏法律。我没有制定法律。但有些公司会查看**欧盟AI法规**（EU AI Regulations），然后对自己说：“我们对法规的解读——我不会去起诉——我们对法规的解读是，我们认为如果我们的员工使用AI工具进行员工绩效评估，那将是非法的，我们将被罚款。”所以，太好了，如果我是一家欧洲公司，我希望我的员工使用AI，我必须阻止他们将AI用于这些用例。所以我们试图构建的是这种几乎像**安全带**（Harness）一样的东西，它会说你可以提高生产力。你不会显得笨拙，你会更有效率，而且你不会犯任何会让你被解雇的错误。所以我们发现，这实际上推动了更多的AI使用，这简直没有让任何人感到惊讶。从公司的角度来看，你想要什么？A，我想要使用率，B，我想要建立起那些真正对我的公司有效的东西的**知识产权**（IP）。这是一个完全的解锁。在编码方面也是如此，对吧？你知道，Cursor让平庸的工程师变得优秀，但它让顶尖的工程师变得像神一样，对吧？所以我们的目标应该是，我们如何帮助人们通过所有这些工具大大提高生产力？我们如何帮助他们更有效地使用Cursor，更有效地使用Harvey？我们从更有效地使用所有**大型语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models）开始。

<p class="english-text">And literally where were the million employees going to park all the cars? And I remember I read that 15 years ago like that stuck in the back of my mind of I have never met a CEO who wants to run a smaller company. It's one of the reasons by the way totally unrelated point in the capital markets. One of the reasons if you ever meet a CEO of a conglomerate they never want to break up the conglomerate because they like running bigger companies. It's more fun right? I've run I've had my companies grow. They're fun when they're bigger. It is it's super cool. And so from an employee standpoint, what we built with this Nexus product is effectively a product where we said or I'll I'll I'll use an anecdote. I was in the UK in July uh and uh I went on a bunch of sales calls and I was talking to someone at a bank very large very reg European bank is among the most regulated folks in the world least you know fast to adopt new technology for for good reasons honestly and they were telling me a story about how they had it was a 28-y old guy I don't remember what level that makes you an investment bank so let's say a director but I don't 28-y old guy who was using chat GPT really really well in the investment banking side of the and they had him create a 30 slide deck and they did a global call for everyone in the investment bank for this guy to spend an hour walking people through how to use chatbt. I'm sure that was very cool for him, but that's absurd. That's an absurd way to hope people adopt worldchanging technology. Another absurd thing to do is to go out and buy some LMS course that HR is going to buy that you know the secret to a lot of LMS is other than things you must do or you will lose your job like sexual harassment training, HIPPA training and certain or no one no one does it. They they just don't go. And so how do I actually get people using these tools and this was my point from earlier is you want to help them a not look dumb and b know they won't get fired. And so what we effectively did is built these wrappers that exist around the models. So we don't tell people to use quaude or to use Gemini or to use catchy fatigue. Then the other thing we built because again people are also worried about getting fired. They're worried about getting fired because the economy because of AI because whatever it's a new tool I would like to not get fired. By the way when you're talking about European banks there's a lot of regulation that is a legitimate concern of if our employees do the wrong thing we will get fined. Forget whether you fire them. These companies don't want to get fined. And so the other thing we did is we we basically trained our own kind of customized llama model to block people from asking questions that are illegal or the company doesn't want you to. So we're not talking about hackers here. True bad actors in the company has plenty of security solutions. What we're really talking about is the x% of the people who I'm in people ops in HR at a large company. I'm supposed to do a workforce analysis. Am I allowed to go into chat GPT and load in our full employee database with race and gender? I don't know. I would like to not get fired. Maybe I'm allowed to and maybe I'm not. And by the way, I think it's incumbent on the company to say to our employees, here is a safe space. Nothing you can do here is going to get you fired. So we Oh, Alex, you're not allowed to up that has social security data. Don't don't share that. You're not allowed to ask that prompt because in Europe, we're not allowed to use HR. We're not allowed to use AI to write employee reviews. I don't know if that's a good law or bad law. I I didn't write the law. But there are companies that look at the EU AI regulations and say to themselves, our read of the regulation, I'm not going to, you know, prosecute that. Our read of the regulation is we believe it's illegal and we will get fined if our employees use AI tools to do employee reviews. So great, if I am a European-based company, I want my employees using AI, I have to block them from using it for those use cases. And so what we've tried to build is this almost like harness to say you can be more productive. you're not going to look dumb, you're going to be more productive, and you're not going to make any mistakes that get you fired. And so what we found is that actually drives more AI usage, surprising literally no one. And from a company standpoint, what do you want? A, I want the usage, and B, I want to build up that IP of what really works my company. It's a total unlock. Same thing on the coding side, right? Uh, you know, cursor has taken mediocre engineers and made them good, but it's taken amazing engineers and made them gods, right? And so our goal should be how do we help people get much more productive with all of this? How do we help them use Kurser more effectively, Harvey more effectively? We started with all of the LLMs more effectively.</p>

### AI与未来工作：就业影响的辩论

主持人: 是的。嗯，所以也许我们可以谈谈，我的意思是这有点哲学，但关于工作的未来。嗯，因为在某种程度上，就像，好吧，你就是我，就像如果你是衡量者……

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um so maybe we could talk I mean this is a little bit philosophical but future of work. Um because to a certain extent like all right you're you're the me like if you're the measurement</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">sure</p>

主持人: 衡量标准最终会变得更像一个目标。嗯，我总是喜欢提醒人们，我认为在宪法批准时，97%到98%的美国人是农民。

<details>

<p class="english-text">like the measurement inevitably will become a little bit more of a target. Um, and I I always like to kind of remind people that I think it was 97 98% of Americans when the Constitution was ratified were farmers</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 他们都失业了，嗯，因为像拖拉机、化肥以及所有这些麻烦的东西。我认为平均预期寿命大约是35岁，大多数孩子在出生时或出生后不久就夭折了。就像，你知道，事情已经改变了，但这就是技术带给你的。嗯，我的意思是，没有人知道这个问题的答案，但鉴于你负责一家衡量AI生产力、人类生产力以及AI和人类协同工作的公司，我的意思是，你对事情变化的快慢有什么时间表？我们会看到，你知道，新的净增就业岗位吗？顺便说一句，在所有这些背后，都有各种各样以前不存在的工作开始出现。所以也许这是问题的第二部分，因为我们现在的工作，就像，你知道，录制播客，这在200年前根本不是工作。有太多工作是人们甚至无法想象的。所以我想，你认为事情会走向何方？以及，也许更细致地说，你认为在这种新事物中及其周围会出现哪些类型未来的工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they all lost their jobs um due to these pesky things like the tractor and fertilizer and all these things and I think the the average life expectancy was like 35 and most children died in childbirth or shortly thereafter. It's like you know we things have changed but this is what uh this is what technology brings you. Um, I mean, nobody knows the answer to this, but given that you're you're in char you're in charge of a company that's measuring AI productivity and human productivity and kind of AI and humans working together, I mean, what what's your timetable for like how fast things change? Are we going to see, you know, net new jobs create like every and by the way, like behind every one of these, there are all sorts of jobs that start becoming around that didn't exist before. So maybe that's kind of part two of the question because like the job that we have right now like you know filming a podcast like that wasn't a job like 200 years like there's so many jobs that just like nobody could even think of. So so I guess like where do you think things are going and like what types of maybe to put a nuance on it like what types of like future jobs do you see in and around this like new stuff?</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 所以我一点也不相信AI会导致大规模失业，坦率地说，因为我们从历史上看到的一切，就是纯粹的资本主义。如果我的两个选择是，我可以保持我的基本生产力水平，但解雇我的一群员工，从而获得更高的利润，这在短期内是一个不错的想法。如果我是一个**私募股权公司**（PE firm），这可能是一个好主意，可以去收购一堆微利公司，解雇一半员工，让它们更赚钱，但私募股权公司长期以来一直对非竞争性公司这样做，然而就业率仍在增长，对吧？所以你可以争辩说，我们一直有一个职能，或者说在过去40年里，我们有一个职能，其目标是接管表现不佳的公司并解雇一群员工，对吧？我们姑且说这就是私募股权公司所做的，理论上AI也可以做到这一点，然而就业率却增加了。所以我并不相信AI会导致失业，你看，这很哲学，你知道，我没有任何特殊的专业知识，因为我正在建立一家衡量公司，但我并不相信它，因为你街对面的竞争对手不会解雇所有那些员工。他只会让那些员工做更多事情，然后他就会扼杀你的生意。对吧？我的意思是，这就是**杰夫·贝佐斯**（Jeff Bezos: 亚马逊创始人）的“你的利润就是我的机会”那句话。如果AI会提高你的利润，那将是所有竞争对手的机会，他们会降低利润来与你竞争。所以除了某些非常小众的垄断性企业，我可以解雇所有人，你知道，一人公司，比如我们会不会有一人公司能做到10亿美元的收入？可能吧，但今天我们有很多非常盈利的，你知道，一人或一人运营的公司，在**乔·罗根播客**（Joe Rogan Podcast）工作的人不多，我想在**本·汤普森公司**（Ben Thompson Incorporated）工作的人也不多，然而我猜这些都是相当盈利的企业，据我所知，所以这很棒，而且会有大量的机会成为更成功的独立企业家，所以我绝对相信会有更多的企业家，但从宏观层面来看，我只是不相信财富500强公司在30年后会比今天雇佣更少的人，因为那些试图裁员的公司将不再是财富500强。所以，我只是坦率地说，因为我们生活在一个竞争激烈的世界。我们还没有看到任何证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I don't buy for a second there's going to be large scale job loss because of AI frankly because of what we've seen through all of history which is just flatout capitalism. If my two choices are I can maintain my base level of productivity but fire a bunch of my employees and be more profitable that is a fine idea in the short term if I'm there's probably a good idea for a PE firm to go along go around and buy a bunch of minorly profitable companies fire half their employees and make them more profitable but that's what PE firms have done for a long time for non-competitive companies anyway yet employment has still increased right so you can argue we've always had a function or for the last 40 years you can argue we've had a function whose goal is to take underperforming companies and fire a bunch of employees, right? And let's let's say that that's what PE firms have done and that's you know what AI could theoretically do yet employment has increased. So I I don't buy an AI and look it's philosophical and you know I don't have any special expertise because I am building a measurement company but I don't buy it because your competitor across the street is not going to fire all those employees. He's just going to do more with those employees and he's going to kill your business. Right? I mean this is the um Jeff Bezos your margin is my opportunity line to the extent that AI is going to drive up your margin that will be all of your competitor's opportunity to be less profitable and compete with you. So it other than some very niche monopolistic I can fire everybody you know oneman firm like will we have onewoman firms that do a billion in revenue probably but today we have very profitable you know one man onewoman operations not many people work at the Joe Rogan podcast I I don't think that many people work for Ben Thompson Incorporated and yet I imagine those are quite profitable businesses the best I can tell so that that that that's amazing and there'll be a ton of opportunity to be more successful solo entrepreneur so I absolutely believe there'll be even more entrepreneurs, but at a very high level, I just don't believe the Fortune 500 will employ fewer people in 30 years than they do today because the ones that try and cut all the people will no longer be in the Fortune 500. So, I just flatly because we live in a competitive world. It's we haven't seen any proof yet.</p>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 经济是零和游戏的证据，对吧？也许吧，对吧？你可以这样争辩，但我们还没有看到任何证据。GDP持续增长。在某些地方增长较慢，在其他地方增长较快，但总体上是增长的。就业率总体上也是增长的。我只是不知道你为什么会认为这次会有所不同，因为从竞争的角度来看，技术是不同的。技术很棒。但从根本上说，几乎肯定会发生的是。有一个有趣的理论问题，你知道，这更像是，你知道，**常春藤盟校**（Ivy League）研究生院的讨论，关于作为一个社会，如果我们都同意工作时间减半，但生产力与今天一样，我们是否会更快乐？我不知道，也许吧。但那不是人性，对吧？所以，我甚至不确定那是否属实。我倾向于相信**泰勒·科文**（Tyler Cowen: 经济学家）的观点，即真正重要的只有增长。所以，我的一般观点是，你作为一个**风险投资家**（VC: Venture Capitalist），如果你的公司来这里说：“嘿，我们实现了1亿美元的收入。”你知道吗？因为AI工具太好了，我们将解雇90%的员工，我们将赚取9000万美元的利润。你不会对那个企业家感到兴奋，因为你知道**红杉资本**（Sequoia）会资助那家公司的直接竞争对手，他们会继续招聘，他们会乐于接受10%的利润率，并且会摧毁你的公司。我们都知道这一点。所以，这就像是，你知道，有很多有趣的头条新闻，关于“哦，AI”，然后你必须有反驳的观点，关于“哦，它会抢走工作”，以及“哦，现在的孩子”。我不知道，就像当你……我们都知道这一点，我们都见过这种情况。你可以找到关于电视出现时，阅读就结束了；报纸出现时，对话就结束了的文章。所以我确实认为新工具的出现令人恐惧，它正在影响全球所有地方的知识工作者。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That the economy is zero sum, right? Maybe, right? You can argue that, but we haven't seen any proof yet. GDP keeps increasing. It increases slower in some places and faster in other places, but it's generally grown. employment has generally grown. I just don't know why you'd believe that this time is different because the competitive point of view I the tech is different. The tech is amazing. But fundamentally what will almost definitively happen. There is an interesting theoretical question that you know is more like a you know I don't know Ivy League grad school you know discussion about wouldn't it be more fun as a society? Wouldn't we all be happier if everyone agreed we'd work half as much and be just as productive as we are today? I don't know, maybe. But that's not human nature, right? And so, I'm not even sure that's true. I I tend to believe in the Tyler Cowan point that all that really matters is growth. And so, my general perspective is you as a VC would just never get excited if one of your companies came in here and said, "Hey, we got to 100 million in revenue." And you know what? because AI tools are so good, we're going to fire 90% of our employees and we're going to make 90 million in profit. You would not be excited with that entrepreneur because you know that Sequoia is going to fund a direct competitor to that company who's going to keep hiring, who's going to be happy with 10% margins and is going to destroy your company. And we we all know this. So I I don't it's one of these things of like,</p>

主持人: 所以，我认为会有成为播客主持人的机会，可能会有更多的水管工，会有更多围绕数据中心建设的就业机会，对吧？会有整套工程师，也许我们需要更多的宇航员。**埃隆**（Elon Musk）说我们要去火星。就像，总会有人在空间站里刷马桶，总会有人驾驶飞机，驾驶飞船去空间站。

Russ Frerichs: 而且当劳动力严重短缺时，有很多工作看起来就是那样。所以如果你在1849年的加利福尼亚做任何事情，就像，繁荣，对吧？对。就像，哦，你是一个人。你需要一个拿**干草叉**（Pitchfork）的人，去干这个，或者就像，你知道，你看到那条线了吗？就像，嗯，是的，把它弄直。所以，嗯，但不同的是，是的，这对一些人来说很可怕，但现在的一切，也许机器人未来会工作得更好，但现在的一切都是比特操作，或者说更多地增强白领、受过高等教育的人，因为他们受过高等教育，嗯，这可能不像，你知道，**底特律**（Detroit）发生了什么，对吧？那实际上不是关于自动化，那是关于日本人制造了更好的汽车。发生这种情况有很多原因。但你如何处理一个拥有非常高薪工作但实际上没有多少技能，现在却失业的人？嗯，因为他们没有任何技能，他们找不到另一份工作。然而，如果你技能高超，你就会找到其他事情做。我确实认为，看，肯定有一部分人受过相当高的教育。他们上过好班级。他们进入了好学校，无论那意味着什么。他们找到了一份好工作。他们在20多岁时工作很努力，30多岁时稍微不那么努力，40多岁时更不那么努力，但他们的薪水相当不错。这些人今天可能有点不舒服，因为他们的职业，坦率地说，有些职业只是需要继续教育。顺便说一句，如果你是电工、水管工、医生或律师，这些职业中的一些只是需要不断地维护和不断地学习。这在很多职业中并不适用。有很多工作，你到了40或50岁，你可以继续做得很好，但你真的不需要学习太多新东西。你只需要继续做好你正在做的事情，你不需要学习太多新东西。那可能相当不舒服。我承认这对那些人来说相当不舒服。但正如你所说，他们受过教育。他们有技能。我们拥有更多的知识经济。所以我没有必要遇到这样的问题，我真的在底特律有房子。现在的工作在**诺克斯维尔**（Knoxville），对吧？别提日本了。现在的工作在诺克斯维尔。我不想搬到诺克斯维尔，对吧？我们都知道关于流动性、住房成本以及所有这些的数据。所以当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just like showed up at work with no skills and got paid. Yes. And there are a lot of jobs that look like that when there's tremendous labor shortages. So if you were doing anything in 1849 apparently in California, like boom, right? Right. It's like there's just like, oh, you're a human. You have a need someone with a pitch like go do this or just like you know you see that line over there like uh yeah like straighten it out. So um but what's different is that you yes it's scary for some people but like everything right now and maybe robots will work better in the future but like everything right now is bit manipulation going after or augmenting I would argue more augmenting white collar hypereducated people by virtue of the fact that they're hypereducated um it might not like this does not mean that like you know what what happened to Detroit right it's like that that actually wasn't about automation that was about like the Japanese built better cars. There were a lot of reasons why that happened. But what do you do with somebody who had like a very very highpaying job but actually didn't have that many skills and now they lost that job? Well, because they don't have any skills, they can't find another job. Whereas, if you are highly skilled, you will find something else to do. And I do think there's an element of look, there are certainly a set of people who were pretty highly educated. They were in good classes. They got into a good school, whatever that meant. They got a good job. They worked pretty hard in their 20s, a little less hard in their 30s, and a little less hard in their 40s, but they're paid pretty well. And those people probably are a little uncomfortable today because their career, frankly, there's there's some professions that just require continuing ed education. By the way, if you're an electrician or a plumber or a doctor or a lawyer, some of these professions just require constant upkeep and constant education. That's not true in a lot of professions. There are a lot of jobs where you get to 40 or 50 and you can keep doing a good job, but you don't really have to learn much new. You you can just keep doing a good job doing what you're doing and you don't have to learn much new. And that's probably quite uncomfortable. I I acknowledge it is quite uncomfortable for those people. But to your point, they're educated. They have skills. We have much more of a knowledge economy. So I don't necessarily have the issue of I literally I have this house in Detroit. The jobs are now in Knoxville, right? Forget Japan. The jobs are now in Knoxville. I don't want to move to Knoxville, right? We all know the data on mobility and housing costs and all that. So sure,</p>
</details>

主持人: 但归根结底，正如你所说，是的，有一部分人可能一直在慢慢减少工作量，减少对自己的要求，而现在他们必须更加努力。这只是，我总是开玩笑说——我不会说我用的公司名称——但我在推销Laridan时，谈到这一点时，我说：“看，当我们和员工交谈时，你知道，你的普通员工是一个42岁的品牌经理助理，如果你问他们对AI有什么期望，他们确实希望它消失。”他们最希望的就是它消失。“我喜欢那样，因为我喜欢昨天。”但如果我们有能力让AI消失，我们会赚很多钱，那将是一个巨大的敲诈生意，但我们没有那种能力，所以我们能做的就是给你工具，让你更好地使用这些东西，帮助你提高生产力，并帮助你作为经理了解你的团队是否更好地使用了这些工具。所以，你知道，我的宏观观点是，我真的不相信会有大规模的失业。

<details>

<p class="english-text">but at the end of the day, to your point, yes, there's a set of people who've probably been slowly working less and pushing themselves less, and now they have to push themselves more. And that just is I my joke all the time I I won't say the company I use but part of my sales pitch for Laridan when I'm talking about this I say look when we talk to employees you know look your average employee is a 42-year-old associate brand manager and if you ask them what they want out of AI they do want it to go away their number one risk wish would be that it would just go away I'd like that I because I like yesterday but we'd make a lot of money if we had the power to make AI go away super big blackmail business but we don't have that power so all we can do is give you the tools to use these things better and help you be more productive and help you as a manager understand if your team is using these tools better and so you know my macro point is I just don't really believe there will be widescale mass unemployment</p>

Russ Frerichs: 个人可能需要更努力吗？是的，当然，其中一些人会对此感到难过，就像，嗯，同样的事情也发生在娱乐业，对吧？工作已经转移，工作已经改变，人们不再像以前那样看电影了，你知道，电视剧以前有22集，现在却因为消费者偏好改变了。

<p class="english-text">might an individual have to push themselves more yeah for for sure and some of those will be sad about that and like um that same thing is true in the entertainment industry right that that jobs have moved and jobs have shifted and people don't watch movies the way they used to and you know TV seasons used to be 22 episodes and now they're because consumer preferences have changed</p>

主持人: 关于《法律与秩序》（Law and Order）的一部分，对吧？那可能令人不舒服。我不是冷酷无情。当然，它会以多种方式对我的生活产生负面影响。但我就是不相信他们不会受到更多教育。

<p class="english-text">a part on law and order, right? That probably is uncomfortable. I'm not being callous. Sure, there's many ways it will impact my life negatively. But I I just don't buy that they won't be more educated.</p>

Russ Frerichs: 是的。很多事情实际上早于AI。嗯，有一篇很棒的文章或采访，是关于**废物管理公司**（Waste Management）的CEO的。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. A lot of this actually predates AI. Uh there there's this great uh article or interview with the CEO of Waste Management. Okay.</p>
</details>

主持人: 在Chat GPT出现之前。嗯，他说：“我每天都会收到无限量的简历，来自那些拥有**MBA**（工商管理硕士）学位并想在我们办公室工作的人，他们就像在互相压价，那里的价格一直在下降。”嗯，所以每100个职位空缺有100份申请，或者我忘了他说什么了。

<p class="english-text">Before Chat GPD came out. Um, and he was saying, "I have unlimited like I get resumes every day from somebody who has an MBA and wants to work like in our office for and like the they're like negotiating against themselves like the price keeps going down there." Um, so 100 jobs for 100 applications for every opening or I forgot what he said.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 我需要雇佣卡车司机。嗯，需要有人，不仅仅是自动驾驶，我需要有人真正地收集垃圾。就像废物管理公司做的那样，每年15万美元。我找不到他们。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I need to hire truck drivers. Uh, somebody who and not just like self-driving like I need somebody who actually is collecting the trash. like that's what waste management does for $150,000 a year. I can't find them.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以，事情的变化方式很有趣。但我想说的另一件事是，嗯，我几乎会认为，现在AI在工作场所普及的很多问题，几乎是一个**产品营销**问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it is kind of interesting how how things have flipped. But I I guess the other thing that I would say is uh I would I would almost argue that a lot of AI's problem right now in terms of diffusing into the workplace. It's almost a product marketing problem. Sure.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对吧？就像，好吧，AI可以做任何事情。对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Where it's like, okay, AI can do anything. Right.</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 对。但我不是在寻找任何东西。就像我说：“嘿，AI可以做任何事情。”你就像：“我不需要你。”就像：“不，我能做这一件非常非常好的事情。”就像，这需要，这就像，我认为一旦你有了更多关于能做什么的阐述，以及那些真正实现超高速增长的东西，就像：“哦，我有AI，它能做所有事情。哦，我会帮你编码。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Right. But I'm not looking for anything. Like I say like, hey, I can do anything. And you're like you're like I don't need you. It's like no, I could do this one thing very very oh you do that and and like that that needs like this is kind of I think once you have more of these articulations of what can be done and like the things that have really kind of gone hyperrowth it's like oh like I have AI it does everything oh I will help you code</p>
</details>

主持人: 我会帮你更好地编码。我有一个聊天机器人，是的，看，很久很久以前，当你老了就觉得好笑，很久很久以前，就像我说的，我是Comscore的第一位员工，Comscore早期的销售宣传——对于那些不了解Comscore的人来说，它基本上拥有互联网上所有发生的事情的数据。所以创始人是真正的天才，他们基本上知道互联网上所有地方发生的一切。我们早期的销售宣传会是：“我们知道一切。”我的意思是显然不是，但它基本上会是：“我们知道一切。你想知道什么？”事实证明，那并不是一个很好的销售宣传。你有时会偶然遇到一些人，他们会说：“哦，天哪，我需要知道这个。你能做这个吗？”我们会说：“是的，我们可以。”然后就成了。但事实证明，我们只有少数销售人员能实时弄清楚这一点。然后事实证明，如果我们说我们可以告诉你**Visa**（维萨）、**万事达卡**（Mastercard）与日本其他支付方式的市场份额。事实证明，Visa确实想知道这一点。但我也可以告诉你你的药品与其他药品在网上研究中的份额。事实证明，他们也想知道这一点。嗯，在……

<p class="english-text">I will help you code better I have this chatbot for yeah look a long long time ago it's funny when you get old uh a long long time ago I was like I said I was the first guy at comscore and comscore's sales pitch in the early Comscore for those that don't know, right, basically had all the data for everything that was happening on the internet. And so the founders were true geniuses and they basically knew everything that was happening everywhere on the internet. And our sales pitch in the early days would be we know everything. I mean obviously not, but would it basically be like we know everything. What would you like to know? And it turned out that wasn't a really good sales pitch. You would sometimes accidentally run into someone who would go oh my god I need to know this. Could you do this? And we'd say yes we could and there you go. But it turned out we only had a couple sellers that could figure that out in real time. And then it turned out if we said we can tell you the market share for Visa verse Mastercard verse others in Japan. Turns out Visa really wants to know that. But I can also tell you the share for your pharmaceutical drug versus others in research online. Turns out they also want to know that. Uh after</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 我可能会说错，但**福特**（Ford）曾与**普利司通轮胎**（Bridgestone tires）发生过巨大的问题，轮胎会着火。事实证明，他们确实想知道，员工对福特的搜索是否因为普利司通而变差了，对吧？所以人们确实想知道这些具体的事情。就像我说的，我认为这正是思考它的正确方式，你需要解决这个产品营销问题。看，这就是为什么我们如此关注正在发生什么。他们是否更有效率？你如何让他们更多地使用它？我们实际上可以做很多事情，但你不能那样销售东西。那更像是普遍的创业建议，但事实证明，构建一个很棒但人们不知道如何使用的东西，大多是行不通的，除非它行得通，就像Chat GPT，对吧？所以，百万分之一的情况下它会成功。Facebook Chat。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm gonna get it wrong, but Ford had some giant issue with Bridgestone tires setting on fire. It turns out they really do want to know that did employees did search for forward get worse because of bridge home, right? So people do want to know these specific like I said I I think that's exactly the right way to think about it is you need this product marketing problem. Look, it's why we're so focused on what's happening. Are they more productive? How do you get them to use it more? We can actually do a lot of things but you can't sell things that way. And that's that's more like general entrepreneurally advice, but it turns out building something amazing that people don't know how to use mostly doesn't work unless it does, which is chat GPT, right? So, one in a million times it does work out. Facebook chat</p>
</details>

主持人: **GP**（指Chat GPT）在那里。它就像魔法一样。如果你给某人展示一个魔术，或者你让某人上瘾，对吧？嗯，你会猜到我指的是哪个，但嗯，如果你看过**《宋飞正传》**（Seinfeld: 一部美国情景喜剧），有一集很棒，**杰瑞**（Jerry Seinfeld: 剧中主角）给他父亲买了一个**Sharp Wizard**（夏普向导），那就像早期的**Palm Pilot**（掌上电脑）一样。它就像1990年代早期的智能电脑。它没有取得巨大的成功，但它能做所有事情。就像，你知道，他可以运行这些应用程序。杰瑞试图向他父亲解释，他父亲说：“嗯，我不明白。它能做什么？”杰瑞说：“嗯，你看这里。它有一个小费计算器。”他父亲说：“哦，天哪，一个小费计算器！”然后他向所有朋友解释。他说：“看这个。我的儿子，他是个喜剧演员，他做得很好。他给我买了一个小费计算器。”杰瑞说：“不，它还能做其他事情。”

<p class="english-text">GP there. It's just like it's magic. If you show somebody a magic trick or you get somebody addicted, right? Um, and you'll guess which one I'm referring to for for which, but um, the if you ever watch Seinfeld, y there's this great episode where Jerry buys his father a Sharp Wizard, which was like an early Palm Pilot kind. It was like this early smart computer like in the 1990s. Never went on to to great things, but it did everything. It was like, you know, he could run these applications. And Jerry's trying to explain it to his dad, and he's like, "Well, I I don't get it. What does it do?" He's like, "Well, like look here. It has a tip calculator." He's like, "Oh my god, a tip calculator." And then he explains it to all of his friends. He's like, "Look at this. my my son, he's a comedian, he's doing great. He got me a tip calculator and Jerry's like, "No, it does other things."</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 而这往往会让那些做其他事情的公司感到沮丧，因为他们渴望拥有一个更广泛的横向平台，但我们需要的更多是这些小费计算器之类的东西。嗯，所以，我知道，我知道我们……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it often ends up being frustrating for the company that does the other things because they aspire to have this like more broad horizontal platform, but what we kind of need is more of these uh these tip calculator things. Um so I know I know we're we're</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，谢谢。但实际上，我们为什么不……还有没有什么我们没有谈到，但你想说一点独白的内容？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, thank you. But but actually why don't we just uh is there anything that we haven't talked about that you want to get in like a little soliloquy that you can uh</p>
</details>

Russ Frerichs: 不，你看，我想给你留下两个想法。一个与你在对话中提到的以及那位教授有关，另一个与Laridan有关。所以你看，我的一般观点是，每当你看到预算发生巨大转变时，你就会构建一套非常重要但非常枯燥的工具。实际发生了什么？人们的生产力更高了吗？我如何让他们更多地使用它？你知道，那里有很多商机。然后我给你留下一个与你的哈佛教授无关的想法。所以正如你所说，我们的孩子上同一所学校，嗯，我最大的孩子上12年级，刚刚考上大学，他考上了他最想去的学校，他为此非常自豪，那是一所排名很高的学校，我为他感到非常高兴。他回家后说：“爸爸，看这个排名。”他给我看了新的**《美国新闻与世界报道》**（US News World Reports）排名，显示了不同的排名。嗯，我说：“亨利，我为你感到非常自豪。在很多不同的年份里，会有很多不同的排名。你只需要知道一件事：无论排名怎么说，每个人都知道第一名是哈佛。所以这不重要。别激动。无论它说什么，无论它把你的学校排在哪里，每个人都知道，无论排名如何，哈佛都是第一名。”我没有上过哈佛。

<p class="english-text">No, I look I think I'll leave you with two thoughts. The one one related to something you brought up in the conversation and the professor but one related to Laridan. So look my general perspective is anytime you see some giant shift in budget you're going to build a set of very important but very boring tools. What's actually happening? Are people more productive? How do I get them to use it more? And you know there's there's a ton of business there. And then I'll leave you with a leave you with an unrelated thought to your to your Harvard professor. So as you said uh our kids go to the same school and uh my oldest kid is in 12th grade and just got into college and he got into this top choice and he's very proud of himself and it's a very highly rated school and I'm very happy for him. And he came home and he said, "Dad, look at this ranking." And he showed me the new US News World Reports ranking that showed the different rankings. And um and I was like, his name's Henry. I said, "Henry, I'm very proud of you. There's going to be a lot of different rankings over a lot of different years. And there's only one thing you have to know for sure. Whatever the ranking says, everyone knows number one is Harvard. And so it doesn't matter. Don't get excited. Whatever it says, wherever it puts your school, everyone always knows whatever the rank is, Harvard's number one. I did not go to Harvard.</p>
