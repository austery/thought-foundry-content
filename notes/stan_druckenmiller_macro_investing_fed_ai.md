## 当前宏观经济展望

Nicolai Tangen: Hi everybody, I'm Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, and today I'm here with Stan Druckenmiller, a proper legend in the investment world. Stan, what a pleasure to be here.

尼古拉·坦根: 大家好，我是尼古拉·坦根，挪威主权财富基金的首席执行官。今天，我与斯坦·德鲁肯米勒（Stan Druckenmiller）在一起，他是投资界的传奇人物。斯坦，很高兴能来到这里。

Stan Druckenmiller: Happy to see you, Nicolai.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 很高兴见到你，尼古拉。

Nicolai Tangen: Now, what are the most important data you're looking at these days currently?

尼古拉·坦根: 当前，您最近在关注哪些最重要的数据？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah, interestingly enough, I'm known as a **macro investor** (宏观投资者：一种专注于大规模经济因素，如利率、通货膨胀和货币政策，以预测市场走势并进行投资的策略), but I do macro from the bottom up. So we're listening primarily to companies, and we're not seeing any material signs of weakness other than maybe in the housing market, but that's from a very elevated price level. So we're not seeing bottom-up information indicating to us that there's an economic problem anytime in the next 3 to 6 months.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，有趣的是，我以**宏观投资者**而闻名，但我的宏观分析是自下而上的。所以我们主要倾听公司的声音，除了房地产市场可能有些疲软外，我们没有看到任何实质性的疲软迹象，但房地产也是从一个非常高的价格水平回落的。因此，我们从自下而上的信息中并未发现未来3到6个月内会出现经济问题的迹象。

I would also say, I'm revealing now that I'm more of a market animal than an economist, that we look at **financial conditions**. They've been very, very loose. I mean, they're looser than they were when the Fed actually started tightening. They've tightened considerably in the last four or five weeks, ever since, ironically, ever since the Fed cut, because the dollar has rallied and obviously interest rates have gone up, but they're still quite above normal. So that's pretty much the data we're looking at.

我还要说，我现在要揭示一个事实，我更像一个市场动物，而不是经济学家。我们关注**金融状况**（Financial Conditions：指一系列金融变量的综合状态，这些变量影响着家庭和企业的借贷和支出行为，如利率、信贷利差和资产价格等）。金融状况一直非常、非常宽松。我的意思是，比美联储真正开始收紧时还要宽松。在过去四五周里，情况已经显著收紧，讽刺的是，这恰恰发生在美联储降息之后，因为美元反弹，利率也明显上升，但金融状况仍然远高于正常水平。所以这基本上就是我们正在关注的数据。

## 对通胀和美联储政策的担忧

Stan Druckenmiller: I'd say the other thing I'm focused on, I've been obsessed with whether we were in the '70s, really since 2021 when this whole inflationary episode started. And I'd say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on, but I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. More recently, and you can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I've switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我想说我关注的另一件事是，自2021年这次通胀开始以来，我一直痴迷于我们是否正处于70年代那样的时期。我想说，两年或一年半前，我非常确信通胀会下降，这一点我判断对了，但我担心经济，这一点我完全错了。最近，你可以对此持保留态度，因为我一错一对，我已经转而更担心未来的通胀，而不是经济本身。

Why do I say that? If we go back to the '70s, there was an episode with OPEC that set off an inflation. You had a recession and inflation came down, I think from about 8% to 3%, and then went back up again.

我为什么这么说？如果我们回到70年代，当时石油输出国组织（OPEC）的事件引发了通货膨胀。之后出现了一次衰退，通胀率从大约8%降至3%，然后再次回升。

Nicolai Tangen: Yes, and what's bothered me and what I have wanted to say, you're exactly right, it went back up again.

尼古拉·坦根: 是的，这正是我一直困扰并想指出的，您说得完全正确，它又回升了。

Stan Druckenmiller: It went back up again, and the number of months would correlate to the bottom being right about now. Yeah, so my confidence a year, a year and a half ago, was we're going to have that period where we came down again, and then we'd see. And I'm a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don't have conviction like I had in '21 that inflation was going to go up; that's when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don't have conviction that they've snuffed this thing out and won the battle. And to cut 50 basis points with credit spreads tight, gold at new highs, equities roaring, no sign of material weakness in the economy—of course, there are some spots—that just makes me nervous that this thing could turn up again.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 它又回升了，而且从时间周期上看，现在的时点很可能就是通胀的底部。是的，所以一年或一年半前我的信心在于，我们会经历那个通胀回落的时期，然后我们再看情况。现在我有点担心美联储过早宣布胜利了。我不像21年那样确信通胀会上涨，当时货币供应量增长了40%，各种事情都在发生。但我也不能确信他们已经扑灭了通胀并赢得了这场战斗。在信贷利差收紧、黄金创下新高、股市飙升、经济没有实质性疲软迹象的情况下（当然，局部有一些问题）降息50个基点，这让我感到紧张，担心通胀可能会再次抬头。

Nicolai Tangen: What would make you turn up again? What would be the factors?

尼古拉·坦根: 是什么因素会让通胀再次抬头？会是哪些因素？

Stan Druckenmiller: I think what I just said, easing into financial conditions. Let's say Trump wins. If Trump wins, you could have **animal spirits** (动物精神：由经济学家凯恩斯提出的概念，指驱动人们进行经济活动的非理性情绪、信心和直觉，而非冷静的理性计算) from the business community who are dying for deregulation. You could have tariffs, which are on the margin inflationary. Immigration has been a great boon to this country, maybe not the way it was done, but it certainly enabled us to have growth without inflation and labor materially the last two or three years. So the combination of animal spirits, recovery doing better than it is... I'm just open-minded to it again.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我认为就是我刚才说的，金融状况的宽松。比方说，如果特朗普当选。如果特朗普当选，商业界可能会出现**动物精神**，他们极度渴望放松管制。你可能会看到关税，这在边际上是通胀性的。移民对这个国家来说是一个巨大的福音，也许执行方式有待商榷，但在过去两三年里，它确实使我们能够在没有通胀的情况下实现增长并获得劳动力。所以，动物精神的结合，复苏比预期要好……我对通胀再次抬头的可能性持开放态度。

## 美联储的动机与前瞻性指引

Nicolai Tangen: Why is it so urgent for the central bank to cut, given this?

尼古拉·坦根: 既然如此，为什么中央银行这么急于降息呢？

Stan Druckenmiller: Honestly, I don't take the nefarious view that Powell is doing it for, quote unquote, political reasons. I do think he's obsessed with the soft landing, and I think he's obsessed with his legacy. And having made the mistake he made in '21, and he's being egged on by other economists in the press, to me, the Fed's job is to avoid the big, big mistakes, like the '70s, like the great financial crisis, like the big inflation we just had. But all this fine-tuning and worrying about a soft landing, that is not the job of the Fed in my opinion. It is to maximize employment for the long term, not for the next three months or the next four months. But I think the Fed's obsession with nailing this so-called soft landing... I would remind everybody that the reason we're having a landing is because they let inflation go from 2% to 9%. So there was no need for a landing for 20 years. But I think that's what they're obsessed with.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 老实说，我并不认为鲍威尔这样做是出于所谓的“政治原因”这种阴谋论。我确实认为他痴迷于实现**软着陆**（soft landing：指在经济增长过热时，央行通过收紧货币政策使经济增速放缓至正常水平，同时避免引发经济衰退），并且他非常在意自己的历史评价。在21年犯了错误之后，加上媒体上其他经济学家的怂恿，他更是如此。在我看来，美联储的工作是避免大的、灾难性的错误，比如70年代的滞胀，比如大金融危机，比如我们刚刚经历的大通胀。但所有这些微调和对软着陆的担忧，在我看来，并不是美联储的职责。它的职责是最大化长期就业，而不是未来三个月或四个月的就业。但我认为美联储痴迷于实现所谓的软着陆……我想提醒大家，我们之所以需要“着陆”，是因为他们让通胀从2%飙升到了9%。在这之前的20年里，根本不需要什么着陆。但我认为这就是他们所痴迷的。

Nicolai Tangen: How much of a problem is the **forward guidance** (前瞻性指引：中央银行用来向公众传达其未来货币政策意图的沟通工具)?

尼古拉·坦根: **前瞻性指引**的问题有多大？

Stan Druckenmiller: It's a huge problem. My friend Jim Grant says they're forward guidance dependent, not data dependent. It's a problem because once you do forward guidance, you eliminate your optionality. And I think, Nicolai, you and I being in this business, we know we have to change our mind when we're wrong. This Fed has shown over and over again that they think if they change their mind, they're losing credibility. So it makes them have their hands tied behind their back. I'm wrong all the time. I think my record is mainly because when I'm wrong, I change my mind, not that I'm always right. I'm certainly not. Forward guidance seems to tie them into positions where and eliminate flexibility they need.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 这是个巨大的问题。我的朋友吉姆·格兰特（Jim Grant）说，他们是“依赖前瞻性指引”，而不是“依赖数据”。这是一个问题，因为一旦你给出了前瞻性指引，你就失去了选择的灵活性。尼古拉，我认为你我身处这个行业，我们都知道当自己错了的时候，必须改变主意。而这届美联储一次又一次地表明，他们认为如果改变主意，就会失去信誉。这让他们束手束脚。我经常犯错。我认为我的投资记录之所以还不错，主要是因为当我错了的时候，我会改变主意，而不是因为我总是对的。我当然不是。前瞻性指引似乎将他们锁定在某个立场上，并消除了他们所需要的灵活性。

## 美国预算赤字与潜在风险

Nicolai Tangen: How big a problem is the **budget deficit** (预算赤字：指政府在一个财政年度内的支出超过其收入的部分)?

尼古拉·坦根: **预算赤字**问题有多大？

Stan Druckenmiller: As a practitioner, it's something I can't be obsessed with on a 3 to 6-month basis. As an American, it's something I'm really obsessed with because debt to GDP can't go up forever. And to me, we have a reckoning, but I don't know the time when that's going to take place. I will say that because of the **reserve currency** (储备货币：指被各国政府和机构大量持有，作为外汇储备的货币), we've been permitted to engage in behavior that, say, the Brits couldn't have behaved in. There's a new term I have: "getting Liz Trussed." We haven't been Liz Trussed because we are the reserve currency, even though if you look at everything we're doing, it's much more radical than the Brits were doing.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 作为一名从业者，这不是我能在3到6个月的短期内过分纠结的问题。但作为一名美国人，我对此非常担忧，因为债务与GDP的比率不可能永远上升。在我看来，我们总有一天要为此付出代价，但我不知道那一天何时会到来。我想说，因为我们拥有**储备货币**地位，我们被允许做出一些行为，比如英国人就无法这样做。我有一个新词：“被利兹·特拉斯化”（getting Liz Trussed，指代前英国首相利兹·特拉斯因激进的减税政策引发市场动荡而迅速下台的事件）。我们没有“被利兹·特拉斯化”，是因为我们是储备货币，尽管如果你看我们所做的一切，比英国人当时做的要激进得多。

What's that old saying? "How do you go bankrupt? Slowly, and then suddenly." Running deficits with full employment at basically 7% of GDP is a recipe that can't last forever. One of the reasons we haven't paid for it is in COVID, the entire private sector, 80% of individuals, refinanced their mortgages. So the average mortgage rate is still under 4%, even though at the margin it got to 8%. Corporations termed out their debt. That stuff rolls over in '25 and '26. If we're going to have a problem, it's probably more like late '25, early '26, but you just don't know.

那句老话怎么说来着？“你是如何破产的？慢慢地，然后突然地。” 在充分就业的情况下，赤字占GDP的7%，这是一种不可持续的模式。我们之所以还没为此付出代价，原因之一是在新冠疫情期间，整个私营部门，80%的个人都对他们的抵押贷款进行了再融资。所以平均抵押贷款利率仍然低于4%，尽管边际利率曾高达8%。公司也延长了他们的债务期限。这些债务将在25年和26年到期。如果我们将会遇到问题，很可能是在25年末或26年初，但你永远无法确定。

Nicolai Tangen: And what is it that can create this kind of Truss moment, where people suddenly change their mind in terms of the price they want to have to lend money to?

尼古拉·坦根: 那么，是什么可能触发这种“特拉斯时刻”，让人们突然改变主意，要求更高的利率才愿意借钱呢？

Stan Druckenmiller: It could be a failed auction. It could be if the Fed is wrong about inflation and it turns back up again because they're easing financial conditions into a melt-up. If they were to have to start increasing interest rates again, which is why I think they should be so cautious about their optionality now that they've forward-guided to a series of cuts, that could cause it. My best guess would be a failed auction, but honestly, it could be 6 months, it could be 6 years. I just don't know.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 可能是一次失败的**国债拍卖**（failed auction：指国债发行时，投标购买的总额低于计划发行的总额，或投标利率过高，表明市场需求不足）。也可能是，如果美联储对通胀的判断是错误的，并且由于他们放宽金融条件导致市场过热（melt-up），通胀再次回头。如果他们不得不再次开始加息，这正是我认为他们现在应该对自己的选择权如此谨慎的原因，因为他们已经通过前瞻性指引暗示了一系列的降息。这都可能成为导火索。我最好的猜测是一次失败的国债拍卖，但说实话，这可能在6个月后发生，也可能在6年后发生。我真的不知道。

Nicolai Tangen: So if rates start to go up, how high can they go?

尼古拉·坦根: 那么如果利率开始上升，它们能升到多高？

Stan Druckenmiller: Well, that's a great question because right now the 10-year, I guess it's around 4.5%. It can go to nominal GDP. So let's say inflation went to 4%, 4.5%, and real growth was 2.5% or 3%, 10-years can go to 6% or 7%. I'm not predicting that, but that would be consistent if things, if inflation did turn back up again and the economy wasn't weakening. I think you could get there. It's interesting, that's what happened in the '70s. The bond market didn't really respond until we went back up from like 3% to 12%, and then it responded in spades. Again, I'm not predicting this, but as a practitioner, I'm very open-minded to it, and I've got it on my radar.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 嗯，这是个很好的问题，因为现在10年期国债收益率大概在4.5%左右。它可以升至名义GDP的水平。所以，假设通胀升至4%或4.5%，而实际增长率为2.5%或3%，那么10年期收益率可以升至6%或7%。我不是在预测这个，但如果通胀确实再次回升而经济并未走弱，这是完全可能发生的。我认为可以达到那个水平。有趣的是，这正是70年代发生的事情。债券市场直到通胀从3%回升到12%时才真正做出反应，而且反应非常剧烈。再次声明，我不是在预测这个，但作为一名从业者，我对此持非常开放的态度，并且它一直在我的雷达上。

## 投资策略与市场仓位

Nicolai Tangen: Well, you say you make the most money from Fed mistakes. So is this the way you are positioned now?

尼古拉·坦根: 嗯，您说过您的大部分钱都是从美联储的错误中赚来的。那么，这是否就是您现在的仓位布局方式？

Stan Druckenmiller: I'm short bonds. I'm not like mega short. I actually had good timing for once. I shorted them literally the day the Fed cut. It's been kind of an easy ride since then. I should have been much bigger. Now that they moved so much, I'm a little worried about if anything, being too big. But yeah, no, that's the way I'm positioned. If I thought what we are talking about was happening, and I don't see a sign of it yet, I'm just open-minded to it, I would be much bigger. I'm like 25% NAV short 10-year equivalent.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我在做空债券。但不是那种超级大规模的做空。这一次我的时机把握得不错。我正是在美联储宣布降息的那天做空的。从那以后，这笔交易可以说是一帆风顺。我本应该下更大的赌注。现在利率变动这么大，我反而有点担心仓位过大。但是，是的，这就是我的仓位布局。如果我认为我们正在谈论的风险正在发生（目前我还没看到迹象，只是对此持开放态度），我的仓位会大得多。我现在大约是25%的净资产价值（NAV）做空10年期国债等价物。

## 股市领导力与科技板块

Nicolai Tangen: Moving on to the stock market, the leadership is very narrow. It's led by not so many stocks. Just how do you read this narrow leadership?

尼古拉·坦根: 转向股市，市场的领导力非常狭窄，由为数不多的几只股票引领。您如何解读这种狭窄的领导力？

Stan Druckenmiller: It's never been great, but the leadership's not as narrow as it was last April. So you're starting to get some broadening out. The financials are doing better. It's not great. We've never had a bear market start without the leadership narrowing, and it's narrowing enough that you're starting to get toward a necessary condition being satisfied, but it's early. It's a yellow light, it's not a red light. That's how I read it.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 这种情况从来都不是好事，但现在的领导力并没有去年四月时那么狭窄。所以你开始看到一些市场广度的改善。金融股表现得更好。情况不算太好。历史上，每一次熊市的开始都伴随着市场领导力的收窄，现在收窄的程度已经开始接近满足熊市的必要条件之一，但这还为时过早。这是一个黄灯信号，还不是红灯。我就是这么解读的。

Nicolai Tangen: So how do you think the tech sector will develop? What kind of signs are you seeing there?

尼古拉·坦根: 那么您认为科技行业将如何发展？您在那里看到了什么样的迹象？

Stan Druckenmiller: The AI boom is going unabated. Nicolai, I think the private sector just sees it as an existential threat to their business if they don't spend money on it. Because if they don't spend money on it and their competitors do, and their competitors are right, they're going to have a big, big competitive problem. And of course, the **hyperscalers** (超大规模数据中心服务商：指像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云这样提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司), they're all in, and their demand is just continuing. So look, you've got very rich prices in the tech sector. Stuff like Apple selling at, I don't know, 25 or 30 times earnings, it's certainly not growing at 25% or 30%. But we don't have that much exposure to the tech sector, and we're not short it. So not really involved.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: **人工智能（AI）**的热潮势头不减。尼古拉，我认为私营企业只是将其视为一种生存威胁，如果他们不在上面花钱的话。因为如果他们不花钱，而他们的竞争对手花了，并且竞争对手的决策是正确的，他们就会面临巨大的竞争问题。当然，还有那些**超大规模数据中心服务商**，他们全都投入进来了，他们的需求还在持续增长。所以你看，科技行业的估值非常高。像苹果这样的公司，市盈率达到25或30倍，但它的增长速度肯定达不到25%或30%。但我们对科技行业的敞口不大，也没有做空它。所以并没有真正参与其中。

## 发现早期趋势：AI与减肥药

Nicolai Tangen: Because you were very early into it. Yeah, what... how do you spot these early trends? What is it that you look at?

尼古拉·坦根: 因为您很早就进入了这个领域。是的，您...您是如何发现这些早期趋势的？您关注的是什么？

Stan Druckenmiller: Honestly, I've got young, really good analysts here. A lot of people have a lot of young analysts who are on top of things. And they started... we noticed about three or four years ago that the kids that go to Stanford and MIT, the engineers, were shifting from crypto to AI. That was the first sign. Then my young partners started talking more and more about AI. I asked them how to play it. They mentioned a company called Nvidia, which I thought was a gaming company. I hadn't done work on it in a long time. I bought a pretty good chunk of it, and then like a month later, ChatGPT happened. It was just total luck. I had no idea about ChatGPT, but the AI drum around here was big enough and the stock was down, I think from 400 to 150 or something. So that's how I got started in it.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 老实说，我这里有年轻、非常优秀的分析师。很多人都有很多紧跟潮流的年轻分析师。他们开始...我们大约在三四年前注意到，去斯坦福和麻省理工学院的孩子们，那些工程师，正在从加密货币转向人工智能。这是第一个迹象。然后我的年轻合伙人们开始越来越多地谈论人工智能。我问他们如何投资这个领域。他们提到了一家叫**英伟达（Nvidia）**的公司，我当时以为它是一家游戏公司，很长时间没有研究过它了。我买入了相当大的一部分，然后大概一个月后，ChatGPT就问世了。这纯属运气。我当时完全不知道ChatGPT，但我们内部对AI的讨论已经足够热烈，而且那只股票当时下跌了，我记得是从400美元跌到了150美元左右。我就是这样开始投资AI的。

Once we invest in something like that, then we really start to dig deeper. And then there was a whole chain of things. We knew it would affect power, we knew it would affect uranium. We just went through the whole chain, and it was a pretty easy trend to spot, not unlike the cloud was. You know, these things come in waves. But the question with AI now that I'm wrestling with, and the reason our exposure is really neither long nor short, is how to play it. Because we started with **picks and shovels** (“卖铲子”策略：一种投资策略，指不直接投资于某个热门行业的核心产品，而是投资于为该行业提供必要工具、设备或服务的公司，如同在淘金热中卖铲子和镐头给淘金者), which is Nvidia and to some extent Microsoft. But now we're seeing just massive amounts of capital being spent by these modelers. And if AI is for real, and I think it is, they're all going to give you the same answer. So we're going to have four or five companies who have spent massive amounts of capital, but I don't see it as a winner-take-all model.

一旦我们投资了类似的东西，我们就会开始真正深入挖掘。然后就有一系列的连锁反应。我们知道它会影响电力，我们知道它会影响铀。我们就顺着整个产业链去研究，这是一个很容易发现的趋势，和当年的云计算差不多。你知道，这些趋势都是一波一波来的。但我现在纠结的关于AI的问题，也是我们现在既不做多也不做空的原因，就是如何去投资它。因为我们开始时采用的是**“卖铲子”策略**，也就是投资英伟达，某种程度上还有微软。但现在我们看到这些大模型公司正在投入巨额资本。如果AI是真的，我认为它是，那么这些模型最终都会给你同样的答案。所以我们最终会有四五家投入了巨额资本的公司，但我不认为这是一个赢家通吃的模式。

On the other hand, I think there are applications that I haven't even thought of, and nobody's thought of, that are going to spring up. I mean, who would have thought of Uber or Facebook when the internet started? So we're very bullish on AI, but we're not bullish currently on exactly where we're supposed to be and how to play it aggressively, not unlike the internet in 2000-2001. You could have believed in the internet, not been exposed, and then got your exposure on a more timely basis. Or I could just be wrong, which wouldn't be that unusual.

另一方面，我认为会有一些我甚至没想过，也没人想过的应用会涌现出来。我的意思是，当互联网刚开始时，谁能想到会有优步（Uber）或脸书（Facebook）？所以我们非常看好AI，但目前并不看好应该具体投资哪里以及如何积极地去布局，这和2000-2001年的互联网泡沫有点像。你当时可以相信互联网的未来，但暂时不投入，然后在更合适的时机再进入。或者我可能就是错了，这也并不稀奇。

Nicolai Tangen: But you were also early into the anti-obesity drug producers.

尼古拉·坦根: 但您也很早就投资了抗肥胖药物生产商。

Stan Druckenmiller: Oh, that was easy. I mean, I don't know what it's like in Norway, but in America, if you go to Disney World, everything... and if you know the American psyche, if you know an American, they got a way to lose weight without doing any work. And I knew the drug worked early on just because we were exposed to it. And then when I heard if you get off the drug, you gain the weight back, then I knew it was sort of a **razor and blade business model** (剃刀和刀片商业模式：一种商业策略，其中主产品（剃刀）以低价甚至亏本出售，而消耗性的配套产品（刀片）则以高利润率反复出售), because people would have to stay on the drug.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 哦，那个很简单。我的意思是，我不知道挪威是什么情况，但在美国，如果你去迪士尼世界，看到的一切……如果你了解美国人的心理，如果你认识一个美国人，他们找到了一种不用费力就能减肥的方法。我很早就知道那种药有效，因为我们接触到了相关信息。然后当我听说一旦停药，体重就会反弹，我就知道这是一种**“剃刀和刀片”的商业模式**，因为人们必须持续用药。

Nicolai Tangen: But you say it's easy, but I mean, hey, it's not like you're the only one who is walking around in Disneyland and looking at these kind of things, right? But you actually act on your intuition or your all the data that's in front of you.

尼古拉·坦根: 但您说这很容易，可我的意思是，嘿，并不是只有您一个人在迪士尼乐园里走来走去观察这些事情，对吧？但您真正做到了根据您的直觉和您面前的所有数据采取行动。

Stan Druckenkenmiller: I do, but it's not all brilliance. I bought Nvidia very well, but I sold it at 800 or 900 right when the party was really getting going. And I sold my Eli Lilly in the high 700s. Granted, I had a nice profit, but yeah, I look for big trends. I'm not a guy that holds for 20 years, but I look for two-to-four-year stuff, and both fit into that category. And frankly, we're looking now for AI applications that might not have been recognized yet.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我确实是这样做的，但这并不全是天才之举。我在英伟达上买得很好，但我在800或900美元的时候就卖掉了，而那时派对才真正开始。我的礼来（Eli Lilly）也是在700多美元的高位就卖了。诚然，我赚了一笔可观的利润，但是的，我寻找的是大趋势。我不是那种会持股20年的人，我寻找的是能持续两到四年的趋势，而这两个都属于那一类。坦白说，我们现在正在寻找那些可能尚未被发现的AI应用。

I'm on the board of Memorial Sloan Kettering, have been for almost 30 years, and the applications in cancer are unreal.

我担任**纪念斯隆-凯特琳癌症中心**（Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center：世界领先的癌症治疗与研究机构之一）的董事会成员快30年了，AI在癌症领域的应用前景简直不可思议。

Nicolai Tangen: And just FYI, the Memorial Sloan Kettering is the leading cancer hospital in the world. And they have a lot of money in the endowment partly because you are on the board or the investment committee.

尼古拉·坦根: 顺便说一句，纪念斯隆-凯特琳癌症中心是世界领先的癌症医院。他们的捐赠基金之所以有这么多钱，部分原因就是您在董事会或投资委员会里。

Stan Druckenmiller: Well, they have a lot of money in their endowment, and I wouldn't say partly because I'm on the board, but thank you.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 嗯，他们的捐赠基金确实有很多钱，但我不会说部分原因是因为我在董事会，不过谢谢你。

## 投资哲学：“先投资，后调查”

Nicolai Tangen: Now, when we last met, you mentioned the concept of "buy first, analyze later." Tell me about that.

尼古拉·坦根: 现在，上次我们见面时，您提到了“先买入，后分析”的概念。能给我讲讲吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah, Soros used to call it "invest and then investigate." I think I just gave a classic example. I didn't know that much about Nvidia. I just knew that AI, and I had some people here tell me how to play it. So we bought Nvidia, and then we were in the process of doing a lot more work, and then ChatGPT happened. But I've always had the view that markets are smart, they're fast, and they're getting much more so with all the communication and the technology we have today. And that if I hear a concept and I like it, if I wait and spend two or three months analyzing it, I may miss a big part of the move. And then psychologically be paralyzed. It's hard to buy a stock you're looking at at 100, it's 160, even if it's going to 400. Somehow your head is screwed up and you're waiting for the pullback. So we will buy something, a meaningful position, but not earth-shaking, and then really do the work. And if I think we made a mistake, I'll sell it. And if I don't think we made a mistake, we'll add to it if we have to.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，索罗斯过去称之为**“先投资，后调查”**（invest and then investigate）。我想我刚才就给出了一个典型的例子。我对英伟达了解不多，我只知道AI这个概念，并且我这里有些人告诉我该如何布局。所以我们买了英伟达，然后我们正在进行更深入的研究，紧接着ChatGPT就问世了。但我一直认为，市场是聪明的，反应迅速，而且在我们今天拥有的所有通信和技术下，它们变得越来越快。如果我听到一个我喜欢的概念，如果我等上两三个月去分析它，我可能会错过大部分的涨幅。然后心理上就会陷入瘫痪。当你看着一只股票从100涨到160，就很难下手去买了，即使它最终会涨到400。不知怎的，你的思维就僵住了，总是在等待回调。所以我们会先买入一些，一个有意义的仓位，但不是那种惊天动地的规模，然后才真正去做研究。如果我认为我们犯了错，我就会卖掉它。如果我不认为我们犯了错，并且有必要的话，我们还会加仓。

Nicolai Tangen: Yeah, I happen to have worked exactly the same way in my life. It really focuses your work and your efforts, your thinking. But have you always believed in your own pattern recognition?

尼古拉·坦根: 是的，我这辈子恰好也是完全用同样的方式工作的。这确实能让你的工作、努力和思维更加专注。但您是否一直都相信自己的模式识别能力？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. When I started in the business, I got promoted too early. So before I had really learned the nuts and bolts of the analysis to the extent that I should have, I was promoted to a leadership position. And I had to rely a lot on charts, and I had to rely a lot on intuition. But I found it's not that hard if you're dealing with a cyclical company and they're losing money or they're not profitable, and everybody in their industry is shutting capacity down, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to try and envision 18 to 24 months out. If nobody's adding capacity, they may not be losing money anymore, they might be making a lot of money. I have found it's very important never to invest in the present, always try and envision the situation as you see it in 18 to 24 months, and then see if security prices reflect that. I think that's probably the biggest mistake investors make, is they invest in the present rather than forward-looking and looking where the puck's going instead of where the puck is.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。当我刚入行时，我被提拔得太早了。所以在我还没来得及真正掌握分析的基本功到应有的程度时，我就被提拔到了一个领导岗位。我不得不非常依赖图表，非常依赖直觉。但我发现，如果你面对的是一家周期性公司，它们正在亏损或不盈利，而且它们行业里的所有公司都在削减产能，那么你并不需要成为火箭科学家就能预见到18到24个月后的情景。如果没有人增加产能，它们可能就不再亏损，甚至可能开始赚大钱。我发现，永远不要投资于“现在”是至关重要的，要始终努力去想象你眼中18到24个月后的情况，然后看证券价格是否反映了这一点。我认为这可能是投资者犯的最大的错误，他们投资于当下，而不是向前看，不是看向**冰球将要滑向的地方，而是它现在所在的位置**（a famous quote attributed to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, meaning to anticipate future trends rather than focusing on the current state）。

Nicolai Tangen: A few people believe in other people's gut feel. Did Soros believe in your gut feel, or did you have to show him analysis?

尼古拉·坦根: 很少有人会相信别人的直觉。索罗斯相信您的直觉吗？还是您必须向他展示分析报告？

Stan Druckenmiller: Soros and I had a rocky start. I went there, I had had some significant success running public funds at Dreyfus, and he told me I was his successor. But I don't really think his mind was completely made up when I got there. And the first six months were quite rocky because it wasn't clear who was in charge. Frankly, we're both trading badly. And I was flying to Pittsburgh because I still had Duquesne, I was running both. And when I got off the airplane, I think we had payphones back then, we didn't have cell phones, and the head trader there told me he had sold out my bond position. So I probably had a higher opinion of myself at the time than I should have. I was young and I had always been in charge, so I was quite upset.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 索罗斯和我的开局并不顺利。我去他那里时，我已经在**德雷福斯（Dreyfus）**管理公募基金取得了一些显著的成功，他告诉我我是他的接班人。但我真的不认为我到那儿时他已经完全下定决心了。最初的六个月相当坎坷，因为不清楚谁是负责人。坦白说，我们俩的交易都做得很糟糕。我当时还要飞往匹兹堡，因为我还在管理**杜肯资本（Duquesne Capital）**，我同时管理两家公司。当我下飞机时，我记得那时候我们用的是公用电话，还没有手机，那里的首席交易员告诉我，他把我的债券头寸全卖了。当时我可能对自己评价过高了。我很年轻，而且一直都是负责人，所以我非常生气。

And basically expressed extreme displeasure. And he said, "We'll talk about it when you come back to New York," implied that I wanted to quit. And he said that maybe there were too many cooks in the kitchen and he was going to Eastern Europe for four or five years, he'd be out of touch, and then he'd find out whether he had been in my hair or if I really was incompetent. That's sort of the way he talks, the way we think, except he actually says it. And luckily for me, while he was gone, the Berlin Wall came down. I invested in the Deutsche Mark. But I think it was lucky for both of us. I went on like the best run I've had before or since for like four years. So he kept seeing the results. So I think he trusted my intuition only because the record started that way.

我基本上表达了极度的不满。他说：“等你回到纽约我们再谈。”暗示我想辞职。他还说，也许是厨房里的厨师太多了，他要去东欧四五年，期间不会联系，然后他就会知道，究竟是他妨碍了我，还是我真的无能。他就是那样说话的，他会把我们心里想的话直接说出来。对我来说幸运的是，在他离开期间，柏林墙倒塌了。我投资了德国马克。但我认为这对我们俩来说都是幸运的。接下来的四年，我经历了我职业生涯中最好的一段时期，无论是之前还是之后。所以他一直能看到结果。因此，我认为他之所以相信我的直觉，仅仅是因为我的业绩记录就是那样开始的。

Nicol.ai Tangen: Do you trust the intuition of your colleagues now?

尼古拉·坦根: 您现在相信您同事的直觉吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: I trust their analysis. They're so much deeper and better at analysis than I was. But I can see the intuition developing. That I'm probably as bullish on the talent, the equity talent in my firm as I've been in 45 years. So I guess that's an answer of yes. But partly brain, partly analytics, and then partly intuition. They're not as intuitive as I am because I was sort of forced to be intuitive because I never acquired their analytical skills.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我相信他们的分析。他们在分析方面比我当年要深入得多，也优秀得多。但我能看到他们的直觉正在发展。我可能对我公司里的人才，特别是股票方面的人才，是我45年来最为看好的。所以我想答案是肯定的。但这是部分靠头脑，部分靠分析，然后部分靠直觉。他们不像我那么依赖直觉，因为我是被逼得必须凭直觉行事，因为我从未掌握他们那样的分析技巧。

## 卖出时机与技术分析

Nicolai Tangen: You mentioned some examples of where you had sold a bit early. Do you generally sell early?

尼古拉·坦根: 您提到了一些您卖出得有点早的例子。您通常会提早卖出吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: No. I mean, embarrassingly, I did an interview on Nvidia, I think it was like 370 or something, and I said this is one we're probably going to own for a few years. But I didn't think it was going to go to 900 in a year and to over a $2 trillion market cap. I think it started at like 100 billion or 150 billion. It was something crazy. So no, I don't necessarily sell early. I'm a technician, so I usually wait for tops.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 不会。我的意思是，说来惭愧，我曾接受过一次关于英伟达的采访，当时股价大概是370美元左右，我说这支股票我们可能会持有好几年。但我没想到它会在一年内涨到900美元，市值超过2万亿美元。我记得它开始时市值大概是1000亿或1500亿美元。这太疯狂了。所以不，我并不一定提早卖出。我是一个**技术分析师**（technician：指主要通过研究市场历史数据，如图表和交易量，来预测未来价格走势的投资者），所以我通常会等待顶部形态的出现。

Nicolai Tangen: What does that... just want to explain what does it mean to have a top?

尼古拉·坦根: 那...能不能解释一下，出现“顶部”是什么意思？

Stan Druckenmiller: A top is something, the rate of change of it's going up changes and it tends to flatten out for quite some time. The trick is in the technical world, that could end up being a bull flag where it just consolidated for a bit and then did a new leg, or it could be a top where that was it.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: **顶部（top）**形态是指，股价上涨的速度发生变化，并趋于在相当长一段时间内横盘整理。在技术分析的世界里，棘手之处在于，这最终可能是一个**牛旗形态**（bull flag：一种技术分析中的持续形态，预示着上涨趋势在短暂盘整后会继续），即股价只是短暂盘整然后开启新一轮上涨；也可能就是一个真正的顶部，意味着涨势结束了。

Nicolai Tangen: And how do you know which is which?

尼古拉·坦根: 那您如何判断是哪一种呢？

Stan Druckenmiller: You don't. You have an opinion, and you express it, and sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're wrong. With Nvidia, there was no top, but I've analyzed the semiconductors industry, not particularly well, but since the 1970s. And it's a cyclical industry. And I knew Nvidia had staying power and was... they had 4,000 software engineers, so it wasn't just hardware. You know, they have this thing called CUDA software that they do to make their GPUs. But I just thought once it went through 2 trillion, this is just too much, and worst case, it'll have a big correction, I'll get another chance. And of course, I didn't get another chance.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 你判断不出来。你只能形成一个观点，然后据此行动，有时你对，有时你错。对于英伟达，当时并没有出现顶部形态，但我从1970年代起就在分析半导体行业，虽然不是特别精通。这是一个周期性行业。我知道英伟达有持久力，而且……他们有4000名软件工程师，所以它不仅仅是硬件公司。你知道，他们有那个叫做**CUDA**的软件平台来配合他们的GPU。但我只是觉得，一旦市值突破2万亿美元，这就太多了，最坏的情况是，它会有一个大的回调，我会有另一次机会。当然，结果是我没有得到另一次机会。

Nicolai Tangen: Oh, you may.

尼古拉·坦根: 哦，您也许还有机会。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes, I may.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，也许吧。

Nicolai Tangen: You think you will?

尼古拉·坦根: 您觉得您会有吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: I don't know from this price. I assume I will, or I would have bought it back. I don't mind buying something back higher than I sold it. I don't like it, but I'm perfectly willing to buy something back higher than I sold it. Some people can't get themselves to do it.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 从现在的价格来看我不知道。我假设我会有的，否则我早就买回来了。我不介意以比我卖出时更高的价格买回一只股票。我不喜欢这样做，但我完全愿意以更高的价格买回来。有些人就是做不到这一点。

## 竞争、情绪与成功秘诀

Nicolai Tangen: Oh, I can. I'm the one thing I'm strong on is I'm not emotional.

尼古拉·坦根: 哦，我能做到。我的一大优点就是我不情绪化。

Stan Druckenmiller: But you never had a down year. No, stupid question. Why is that important?

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 但您从来没有过亏损的年份。不，这是个蠢问题。为什么这很重要？

No good reason. I think it's important because other people talk about it, and my investors loved it when I had investors because, you know, they have this stuff in our industry, you know, called **risk-weighted return**. I'm not big on that, but I will say it's a stressful job and there's less stress if you don't have big drawdowns. I have had significant drawdowns intra-year, so part of the "no down year" is just luck.

没什么好理由。我认为它重要是因为别人会谈论它，而且当我还有外部投资者的时候，他们很喜欢这一点，因为，你知道，我们行业有种东西叫**风险加权回报**（risk-weighted return）。我不太看重这个，但我要说这是一个压力很大的工作，如果你没有大的回撤，压力就会小一些。我在年内有过显著的回撤，所以“没有亏损的年份”这个记录部分是运气。

Nicolai Tangen: What does a drawdown do to you?

尼古拉·坦根: 一次回撤对您有什么影响？

Stan Druckenmiller: I get anxious, upset.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我会变得焦虑、不安。

Nicolai Tangen: You get upset even though it's only your money?

尼古拉·坦根: 即使亏的是您自己的钱，您也会不安吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. Yeah, I'm just a very competitive person. Even if it's just my own money, I wish I wasn't, but I am. And it's probably one of the reasons my results are as good as they are. But I prefer myself not to be. It's a bit of a sickness, but it works for me.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。是的，我只是一个竞争心非常强的人。即使只是我自己的钱，我也希望我不是这样，但我就是。这可能也是我业绩这么好的原因之一。但我希望自己不是这样。这有点像一种病，但它对我有用。

Nicolai Tangen: Who do you compete against?

尼古拉·坦根: 您和谁竞争？

Stan Druckenmiller: I compete against what I would call the opportunity set. And if there was a great opportunity set that year and I missed it, I'm disappointed in myself. Like if I'm up 20% and I think I should have been up 50%, I'm disappointed in myself. If the opportunity set was basically to be up 10% or 15% and I'm up 20%, I'm thrilled. I mean, the good thing about being an investor is there's always a good reason to hit yourself in the head, right?

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我和我所说的**机会集（opportunity set）**竞争。如果那一年有很好的投资机会而我错过了，我会对自己感到失望。比如，如果我赚了20%，但我认为我本应该赚50%，我就会对自己感到失望。如果机会集本身只能带来10%或15%的回报，而我赚了20%，我就会非常激动。我的意思是，做投资的好处就是，总能找到一个敲打自己的好理由，对吧？

Nicolai Tangen: I don't know if that's a good thing about our business, but it's probably the bad thing about our business. And for some reason, I like to hit myself in the head. I always measure from the top.

尼古拉·坦根: 我不知道这算不算是我们这个行业的好事，但这可能正是我们这个行业的坏处。而且出于某种原因，我也喜欢敲打自己。我总是从最高点开始衡量。

Stan Druckenmiller: But you are quick at selling your losers. What's the key to that?

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 但您在卖掉亏损头寸时非常果断。关键是什么？

If the reason I bought a stock is no longer the case, I don't care what I paid for it. And if I bought it at 60 and it's 50 because the market discovered the problem before me, I have no emotion whatsoever. Soros was the same way. I didn't really learn it from him, but it was certainly reinforced. Like after a while, Nicolai, you also develop enough confidence that you're not afraid to clean the slate and start over because you have the confidence that you'll be successful again. And you're not going to sit there in a lazy position that you're not that sure about anymore. Just clean house. And if you've been doing it for decades and it's worked, you kind of have the confidence to take a loss and not worry about it too much. Once I'm out, I'm out.

如果我买入一只股票的理由不复存在，我根本不在乎我付了多少钱。如果我60美元买入，现在是50美元，因为市场比我先发现了问题，我对此毫无情绪波动。索罗斯也是一样。我并不是真的从他那里学到这个，但这无疑得到了加强。就像过了一段时间，尼古拉，你也会建立起足够的信心，不害怕推倒重来，因为你相信自己会再次成功。你不会再懒洋洋地守着一个你已经不那么确定的仓位。直接清仓。如果你已经这样做了几十年并且一直有效，你就会有那种承担亏损而不过分担心的信心。一旦我出局了，就彻底出局了。

Nicolai Tangen: You said you don't have feelings. What do you mean by that?

尼古拉·坦根: 您说您没有感情。这是什么意思？

Stan Druckenmiller: Did I say I don't have feelings? I have a lot of feelings.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我说过我没有感情吗？我感情很丰富。

Nicolai Tangen: You mean about taking losses.

尼古拉·坦根: 您是指在承受亏损方面。

Stan Druckenmiller: Just what I mean by that is, I think one of the reasons charts work, we have the reason there's support and there's resistance, is the resistance is a bunch of people that bought it at 60 and it went down, and they've been waiting for three or four years for it to get back to 60 while they could have been in something else that was going up the whole time. I just don't care what I paid for a stock. It's absolutely irrelevant in terms of my investment process going forward.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我想说的是，我认为图表之所以有效，之所以有**支撑位（support）**和**阻力位（resistance）**，其中阻力位的形成就是因为有一群人在60美元买入后股价下跌，然后他们等了三四年，就为了等股价回到60美元，而在此期间他们本可以投资于其他一直在上涨的资产。我只是不在乎我为一只股票付了多少钱。这对于我未来的投资决策过程是完全无关的。

Now, this combination of being on the one hand stubborn, but on the other hand being able to change your mind, it's pretty rare.

现在，这种一方面固执，另一方面又能改变主意的结合，是相当罕见的。

I'm told it is. Yeah, I'm told by my friends and other investors that I'm entirely unemotional. And yes, I am told it's rare.

别人也这么告诉我。是的，我的朋友和其他投资者都说我完全不情绪化。是的，别人告诉我这很罕见。

Is that the key to your success, you think?

您认为这是您成功的关键吗？

One of them. I think it's a big part of it. I think again, being open-minded and having humility. The only reason you can change your mind is if you're not arrogant about a position. It has mattered. I think I had some great mentors, the one in Pittsburgh and then Soros, in terms of sizing. And I think I learned some lessons very early on. Concentration, not to be afraid of concentration, that's a big reason for my success. And probably the other big reason was sort of self-taught, is being willing to go into other asset categories. And if you're going to concentrate, it's better to have five buckets to play in than to play in one. So I was brought up in the equity market, but sometimes the risk-reward in the equity market is not that clear, when it actually is clear in the bond market or the currency markets. And it's a coincidence you asked about never had a down year. Part of it is the most action in bonds and currencies tends to happen in bear markets in equity markets. So you can put the equities in the drawer for a while and just concentrate in those markets. I think that's been a huge part of my success, is it gives you the discipline not to play in areas that you don't have a lot of conviction in. Because if you've got credit to play in, if you've got commodities to play in, currencies or bonds, you can usually find something that you think there's a great risk-reward in. It's also they tend to be more liquid than equity markets, so to our earlier conversation, you can change your mind when you're wrong.

其中之一。我认为这是很大一部分原因。我认为，再次强调，就是保持开放的心态和谦逊。你能够改变主意的唯一原因是你对一个仓位不自负。这很重要。我认为我有一些很棒的导师，一位在匹兹堡，然后是索罗斯，特别是在头寸规模方面。我想我很早就学到了一些教训。**集中投资（Concentration）**，不害怕集中投资，这是我成功的一大原因。可能另一个重要原因是我自学的，那就是愿意进入其他资产类别。如果你要进行集中投资，最好有五个篮子可以玩，而不是只玩一个。所以，我是在股票市场长大的，但有时股票市场的风险回报并不那么清晰，而此时在债券市场或外汇市场却很清晰。你问到我从未有过亏损年份，这其中有个巧合。部分原因在于，债券和外汇市场最活跃的时候，往往是股票市场的熊市。所以你可以暂时把股票放一边，专注于那些市场。我认为这是我成功的一个巨大因素，它给了你纪律，让你不去那些你没有太多信心的领域玩。因为如果你有信贷市场、商品市场、外汇或债券可以投资，你通常能找到一个你认为风险回报极佳的机会。而且这些市场通常比股票市场流动性更好，所以回到我们早先的对话，当你错了的时候，你可以改变主意。

## 从索罗斯身上学到的“重注”艺术

Nicolai Tangen: What did you learn about sizing from Soros?

尼古拉·坦根: 您从索罗斯那里学到了关于头寸规模的什么？

Stan Druckenmiller: I don't know whether you know about... do you know baseball at all or would your listeners know about...?

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我不知道你是否了解……你了解棒球吗？或者你的听众会了解吗？

Nicolai Tangen: I don't play it, but...

尼古拉·坦根: 我不打棒球，但是……

Stan Druckenmiller: When I went to Soros, I thought I would learn what would make the Deutsche Mark go up and the Yen go up. And modestly, I found I was better at that than him. In baseball terms, I had a very high batting average. He had a much higher **slugging percentage** (长打率：棒球术语，衡量击球手每次击球能推进的垒包数，代表其强力打击能力。在此比喻中，“高击打率”意味着频繁做出正确的、盈利的小决策，而“高长打率”意味着虽然决策频率可能不高，但一旦正确，就能带来巨大的回报). So what I learned from Soros is when you have conviction, you should bet really big. I know your listeners have probably heard it before, but probably the best illustration is the pound.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 当我去索罗斯那里时，我以为我会学到是什么让德国马克和日元上涨。坦率地说，我发现我在这方面比他更擅长。用棒球术语来说，我的**击打率**（batting average：指安打数占总打席数的比例，代表击中球的频率）很高。而他的**长打率**要高得多。所以我从索罗斯那里学到的是，当你充满信心时，你应该下重注。我知道你的听众可能以前听过这个，但最好的例子可能就是英镑的交易。

## 狙击英镑：一战成名的背后

Nicolai Tangen: So what happened? So let's go back. So you are in the office. What's happening in the UK?

尼古拉·坦根: 所以发生了什么？让我们回到过去。您在办公室里。当时英国发生了什么？

Stan Druckenmiller: So I'm in the office in New York and Scott Bessent, who was a partner of mine in Europe, mainly traded the European area, he's in London and he tells me the London housing market is in big trouble and the British economy is in trouble because like most Anglo-Saxon economies at the time, it's very much driven by housing.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 当时我在纽约的办公室，我的欧洲合伙人斯科特·贝森特（Scott Bessent），他主要交易欧洲市场，当时在伦敦。他告诉我伦敦的房地产市场遇到了大麻烦，英国经济也陷入了困境，因为和当时大多数盎格鲁-撒克逊经济体一样，它非常依赖房地产驱动。

Nicolai Tangen: And so forth. Just paint it out a bit. So your office, are you like overlooking Central Park?

尼古拉·坦根: 等等。稍微描绘一下场景。所以您的办公室，是能俯瞰中央公园的那种吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: I'm not overlooking Central Park, but I'm near it. I'm in the Soros office on the 32nd floor, but it's okay, it's not a corner office, it's nothing big, fancy. And the UK economy is going down the toilet.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 我不能俯瞰中央公园，但我离它很近。我在索罗斯办公室的32楼，但还好，不是角落办公室，没什么大的、花哨的。当时英国经济正在急剧恶化。

Nicolai Tangen: We think the UK economy is going down.

尼古拉·坦根: 我们认为英国经济正在下滑。

Stan Druckenmiller: But I need to take you back about three years when the Berlin Wall came down. It'll probably save me my job because I probably would have been fired at Soros six months after he went to Eastern Europe had the Berlin Wall not come down. But the Deutsche Mark went down for two days dramatically because the theory in the market was the Ostmark, which was the East German currency, was going to pollute the Deutsche Mark. I knew German history and knew they were obsessed with inflation because of the Weimar Republic and then that led to Hitler and so forth and so on. So I knew the Germans were absolutely obsessed with inflation. I knew that bringing all these East Germans into the labor supply was going to cause a boom in the economy. So we were very bullish on the overall German economy and we were very convinced that there is no way the **Bundesbank** (德国联邦银行：德国的中央银行) would let inflation... so we're very convinced it would be accompanied by tight monetary policy.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 但我需要带你回到大约三年前，柏林墙倒塌的时候。那件事可能保住了我的工作，因为如果柏林墙没有倒塌，在他去东欧六个月后，我可能就会被索罗斯解雇了。但当时德国马克曾急剧下跌了两天，因为市场的理论是东德马克（Ostmark），也就是东德的货币，会“污染”西德的德国马克。我了解德国历史，知道他们因为魏玛共和国的恶性通胀以及之后导致希特勒上台等一系列事件，对通货膨胀有着极度的执念。所以我知道德国人对通胀是绝对痴迷的。我知道将所有这些东德人引入劳动力市场将会导致经济繁荣。所以我们对整个德国经济非常看好，并且我们坚信**德国联邦银行**绝不会容忍通胀……所以我们坚信这必将伴随着紧缩的货币政策。

So we had shorted the Italian Lira successfully during that period. So when Scott called me, we were already sort of on this Deutsche Mark journey, we've been for a few years. And the British economy is going down and the currencies are linked.

所以在那段时期，我们成功地做空了意大利里拉。所以当斯科特打电话给我时，我们已经在这条看好德国马克的路上走了好几年了。而当时英国经济正在下滑，但两种货币却是挂钩的。

Nicolai Tangen: So it was a peg, right? It was a peg.

尼古拉·坦根: 所以那是一个固定汇率，对吗？一个挂钩。

Stan Druckenmiller: So I called and asked how much it would cost me to short the pound versus the Deutsche Mark for six months. It was a half a percent. I think the fund was around 7.5 billion at the time, Quantum Fund. And I decided to do an "invest and then investigate" position. So I did a billion and a half, or like 20-25% of the fund, short the pound, long the Deutsche Mark, figuring I'd probably lose half a percent because it's a peg and it won't break within six months. But I wanted the position on. Fast forward probably about five or six weeks, the day, I believe was September 15th, not that I would remember. I read the Financial Times and the head of the Bundesbank... Now, I'm sure I'm aging, but I'm pretty sure it was Tietmeyer, has written an editorial in the Financial Times basically, in more proper language, but he's basically saying that the Deutsche Mark and the pound should no longer be linked.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 所以我打电话问，如果我做空英镑、做多德国马克，持仓六个月的成本是多少。成本是0.5%。我记得当时基金，也就是**量子基金（Quantum Fund）**，规模大约是75亿美元。我决定建立一个“先投资，后调查”的头寸。所以我投入了15亿，大概是基金规模的20-25%，做空英镑，做多德国马克，心里盘算着我可能会亏掉那0.5%的成本，因为这是一个固定汇率，六个月内不会打破。但我想要建立这个仓位。快进大约五六周，那一天，我记得是9月15日，虽然我不一定记得清楚。我读了《金融时报》，德国联邦银行的行长……现在，我肯定老了，但我很确定是蒂特迈尔（Tietmeyer），他在《金融时报》上写了一篇社论，基本上，用更正式的语言，他说的就是德国马克和英镑不应该再挂钩了。

So I decide to take Duquesne and the Quantum Fund to 100% long the Deutsche Mark, short the pound, because it's still a half a percent, unbelievably. Now you're going to hear vintage Soros. So he happens to be in New York at the time, which he wasn't always. I go into his office and I explain to him why I'm going to 100%. And he had a rather large personal account, that's how we kept each other out of each other's hair. He traded that. And I told him why I was doing this and he had this unpleasant, puzzled look on his face when I'm telling him my thesis that this one economy is booming and they need higher rates, this other economy is falling apart, they need lower rates. These two currencies shouldn't be linked. And I'm thinking, "What does he not understand about this?" because this guy pretty much understood everything.

所以我决定将杜肯资本和量子基金的仓位全部（100%）用于做多德国马克，做空英镑，因为令人难以置信的是，成本仍然只有0.5%。现在你将听到经典的索罗斯故事了。他当时碰巧在纽约，这并不总是如此。我走进他的办公室，向他解释为什么我要把仓位加到100%。他有一个相当大的个人账户，我们就是用这种方式来互不干涉的。他交易那个账户。我告诉他我为什么这么做，当我向他陈述我的论点——一个经济体在繁荣，需要更高的利率，另一个经济体在崩溃，需要更低的利率，这两种货币不应该挂钩——他脸上露出那种不悦、困惑的表情。我当时在想，“他到底有什么不明白的？”因为这家伙几乎什么都懂。

And he says, "Look, this is a one-way bet. They come along very, very rarely. It's ridiculous doing 100%. We should put 200% of the fund in this trade." So there you have it.

然后他说：“听着，这是一个**单向押注**（one-way bet）。这种机会非常、非常罕见。只投入100%太荒谬了。我们应该把基金的200%都投入到这笔交易中。” 所以，你瞧。

Nicolai Tangen: So that means that you borrow money in the bank and double up.

尼古拉·坦根: 所以这意味着你们从银行借钱，把赌注加倍。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah, on a $7.5 billion fund, he thought we should have $15 billion short the pound, long the Deutsche Mark. It turns out we never got there, but it shows the way the man thinks. I saw it over and over again.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，对于一个75亿美元的基金，他认为我们应该有150亿美元的仓位做空英镑，做多德国马克。结果我们从未达到那个规模，但这显示了那个人的思维方式。我一次又一次地看到这一点。

Nicolai Tangen: Because you... once you were trading, the thing happened.

尼古拉·坦根: 因为你们……一旦你们开始交易，事情就发生了。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah, unfortunately, we had a pretty strong reputation, and when I started selling it that night, I noticed a lot of other hedge funds started selling it, the gossip community in the currency markets. And by midnight to 1:00, the forwards had blown out. They'd started at a half a percent, they were like 6% or 7%, and it basically wasn't trading after 1:00 in the morning. Then the British raised rates, I think from 6% to 9% to try and stop the bleeding, and then they went to 12%. I knew it was over, but the forwards were out so much, it didn't matter. And it was done by noon the next day.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，不幸的是，我们当时声誉很响亮，当我在那个晚上开始抛售时，我注意到很多其他对冲基金也开始抛售，外汇市场的传闻圈子就是这样。到了午夜到凌晨1点，远期汇率的价差已经彻底爆开了。开始时成本是0.5%，后来飙升到了6%或7%，基本上凌晨1点后就没什么交易了。然后英国人加息，我记得是从6%加到9%，试图止血，然后又加到12%。我知道一切都结束了，但远期汇率价差已经拉得那么大，加息已经无关紧要了。到第二天中午，一切都尘埃落定了。

Nicolai Tangen: And you were sitting at your desk looking at the Reuters screen, yes, or whatever the screen at the time was.

尼古拉·坦根: 而您就坐在办公桌前看着路透社的屏幕，是的，或者当时不管是什么屏幕。

Stan Druckenmiller: We only got 7.5 billion done, ironically. Well, had it not been for Soros, I probably would have not got to the 7.5, because intending to do 15, I was in a bigger hurry.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 讽刺的是，我们最终只完成了75亿的交易。不过，如果不是因为索罗斯，我可能连75亿都达不到，因为打算做150亿，所以我行动得更急了。

Nicolai Tangen: So what did you feel when the peg broke?

尼古拉·坦根: 那么当固定汇率被打破时，您是什么感觉？

Stan Druckenmiller: There was a lot of adrenaline. It was exciting. I didn't feel bad because I thought the British economy needed it. I was gratified years later when they changed it from Black Wednesday to White Wednesday. Then I went into action after it broke because the Gilts were down two points, which I thought was ridiculous. The British needed lower rates. There's some theory in academia that if you have a weak currency, your interest rates have to go up. So I bought Gilts, I bought British stocks.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 肾上腺素飙升。非常兴奋。我没有感觉不好，因为我认为英国经济需要这次贬值。多年后，当他们把那天从“黑色星期三”改称为“白色星期三”时，我感到很欣慰。汇率脱钩后，我立即采取了行动，因为**英国国债（Gilts）**下跌了两个点，我认为这很荒谬。英国需要更低的利率。学术界有一种理论认为，如果你的货币疲软，你的利率就必须上升。所以我买了英国国债，买了英国股票。

There was a whole... because what happened was that the currency depreciated and it was good for exports, right? So the stocks went up afterwards.

当时有一整套……因为发生的情况是，货币贬值，这对出口有利，对吧？所以之后股票就上涨了。

The stocks went up, the Gilts went up because they needed lower rates and they'd been held artificially high. So there was all kinds of other stuff I did around it, which is kind of the way I trade. You get a theme and then you look at the concentric circles or the dominoes that fall because of a theme. And but the point was with Soros, if he really believed something, the position could never be big enough, particularly if it's in a liquid market. And I learned from him. I like to play the turn, maybe my ego, in a big turn in something. He was perfectly happy to play from the third to the sixth inning, if we go back to baseball terms. If it's a nine-inning game, he was perfectly happy to play the third to sixth inning when there was more certainty, on much greater leverage. He had more courage than I did in terms of sizing positions. I don't think it totally rubbed off on me, but it certainly helped and it was a huge learning experience. I think the major thing I learned with him is it's not whether you're right or wrong, it's how much you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong. And that's what he was probably as good as anybody who's ever been at.

股票上涨了，英国国债也上涨了，因为他们需要更低的利率，而利率之前被人为地维持在高位。所以围绕这个主题我还做了各种其他交易，这差不多就是我的交易方式。你找到一个主题，然后观察因此倒下的同心圆或多米诺骨牌。但关于索罗斯的关键点是，如果他真的相信某件事，头寸永远都不可能足够大，特别是在一个流动性好的市场里。我从他那里学到了这一点。我喜欢在大的转折点进行交易，也许是出于我的自负。而他则完全乐意打第三到第六局，如果我们回到棒球术语的话。如果是一场九局的比赛，他完全乐意在确定性更高的时候，用更大的杠杆去打第三到第六局。他在头寸规模上的勇气比我大。我不认为这完全影响了我，但这肯定有帮助，而且是一次巨大的学习经历。我认为我从他那里学到的最主要的事情是，**重要的不是你对还是错，而是你对的时候赚多少，错的时候亏多少。** 而他在这方面可能是有史以来最出色的人。

## 鲜为人知的交易：瑞典克朗与泰铢

Nicolai Tangen: Stan, many people have heard about the pound, but not many people know that you also did the Swedish Krona.

尼古拉·坦根: 斯坦，很多人都听说过英镑的交易，但没多少人知道您也做空了瑞典克朗。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. My memory's a little less clear on that one as to the reasoning, but it was just another victim of the Deutsche Mark. I assume there was some kind of divergence between the two economies and there was a peg that I thought was inappropriate. And it turned out, yeah, that worked out.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。关于那笔交易的理由，我的记忆有点模糊了，但它只是德国马克的又一个受害者。我猜是两国经济之间出现了某种分化，并且有一个我认为不合适的固定汇率。结果是的，那笔交易也成功了。

Nicolai Tangen: So you took that peg too. But you took another peg too because I thought you were also involved with the Thai Baht.

尼古拉·坦根: 所以那个固定汇率您也打破了。但您还打破了另一个，因为我记得您也参与了泰铢的交易。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah, the Thai Baht was easy. They...

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的，泰铢那次很容易。他们……

Nicolai Tangen: But nobody knows about this, right?

尼古拉·坦根: 但没人知道这个，对吧？

Stan Druckenmiller: No, I think Sebastian Mallaby wrote a book called *More Money Than God*. There's a whole chapter on the Thai Baht.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 不，我想塞巴斯蒂安·马拉比（Sebastian Mallaby）写了一本叫《富可敌国》（More Money Than God）的书。里面有一整章都是关于泰铢的。

Nicolai Tangen: That was not on the Swedish Krona.

尼古拉·坦根: 但书里没有写瑞典克朗。

Stan Druckenmiller: No, the Swedish Krona, no. No, I prefer nobody knew any of this stuff.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 不，瑞典克朗没有。不，我宁愿没人知道这些事。

Nicolai Tangen: Well, we need to get it right for the history books. I'm happy to talk about it 25 years later.

尼古拉·坦根: 嗯，为了历史记载的准确性，我们得把它弄清楚。25年后，我很乐意谈论这些。

## 后悔与反思

Nicolai Tangen: Any trades you regret not making?

尼古拉·坦根: 有没有后悔没做的交易？

Stan Druckenmiller: Oh, there's trades I regret not making constantly. I'd say one of the biggest mistakes I made was having predicted the inflation really early and feeling so strongly about it. I wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal with my partner, Kevin Warsh, in the spring of '21. I had a massive short for me in two years, sort of like we just talked about with the pound. It was a one-way bet. They were at 15 basis points, and I was so mesmerized by where they'd been, I took most of them off at like 150 basis points. It seemed like a great win from 15 basis points to 150, but as you know, they went to 500. I regret deeply not holding that position. There's probably 30 others, but I prefer to forget my mistakes.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 哦，我总是在后悔没做某些交易。我想说我犯过的最大的错误之一，就是很早就预测到了这次通胀，并且对此感觉非常强烈。21年春天，我和我的合伙人凯文·沃什（Kevin Warsh）在《华尔街日报》上写了一篇文章。我在两年期国债上建立了一个对我来说巨大的空头头寸，有点像我们刚才谈论的英镑交易。那是一个单向押注。当时利率是15个基点，我被它之前的位置迷惑了，在利率涨到150个基点左右时我就把大部分仓位平掉了。从15个基点到150个基点，看起来是一场大胜，但如你所知，利率最终涨到了500个基点。我非常后悔没有坚持持有那个仓位。可能还有30个其他的错误，但我宁愿忘记我的错误。

## 人与机器在投资中的角色

Nicolai Tangen: Do you think machines can take the place of humans when it comes to investing?

尼古拉·坦根: 您认为在投资方面，机器能取代人类吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: No, I don't. But I think they can work as a co-pilot, and the combination can beat anything a mere human could be. I'm lucky enough to have known Garry Kasparov for a long time. I'm co-founder of the Kasparov Chess Foundation, for no good reason. I can hardly play chess, my nine-year-old daughter was beating me, that's how I started with Garry. But he was probably one of the first guys to use machines to train himself and work with them. I could see the same thing happening with money management. So I don't think the pure machines, they'll make money because they have a disciplined process and there's math. But I think if you could find an intuitive investor who's using AI and other things to supplement, I think that would probably be the top investor in the world, not a machine.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 不，我不这么认为。但我认为它们可以作为**副驾驶（co-pilot）**，而人机结合可以战胜任何纯粹的人类。我很幸运认识加里·卡斯帕罗夫（Garry Kasparov）很长时间了。我是卡斯帕罗夫国际象棋基金会的联合创始人，没什么特别的原因。我几乎不会下棋，我九岁的女儿都能赢我，我就是这样和加里开始交往的。但他可能是最早利用机器来训练自己并与机器合作的人之一。我可以预见到同样的事情会发生在资金管理领域。所以我不认为纯粹的机器会成为主宰，它们会赚钱，因为它们有纪律严明的流程和数学基础。但我认为，如果你能找到一个有直觉的投资者，同时利用AI和其他工具来辅助决策，那个人可能会成为世界顶级的投资者，而不是一台机器。

## 2000年科技泡沫与“休假”的启示

Nicolai Tangen: Now, you took a sabbatical in 2000. Yeah, what was the reason behind that?

尼古拉·坦根: 现在，您在2000年休了一次长假。是的，那背后的原因是什么？

Stan Druckenmiller: It's a painful but really fun story. It really starts in 1998... well, no, it starts in the spring of 1999. I shorted, I think it was 11 or 12 internet stocks, not the leaders like AOL or Yahoo, but the also-rans. And I believe the position was like $200 million, and in like four weeks, I had lost like $600 million. So it was the first time I'd ever had a big drawdown. I was down like 16% or 17% in the spring of '99. I then pivoted and realized that Greenspan, because of the Asian financial crisis, while our economy was strong and we had the internet and all this behind it, I went out and hired a couple of young managers to buy tech stocks that I didn't know how to spell. They had their own little accounts and I would plow in on top of their positions. And we ended up the year, I think something like 42% net or something, after being in this debacle because I rode this crazy Nasdaq wave in '99.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 这是一个痛苦但又非常有趣的故事。它实际上始于1998年……不，是始于1999年春天。我做空了，我记得是11或12只互联网股票，不是像AOL或雅虎那样的龙头股，而是一些跟风者。我相信那个仓位大概是2亿美元，结果在大概四周内，我亏了大约6亿美元。那是我第一次经历大的回撤。在99年春天，我大概亏了16%还是17%。然后我改变了策略，意识到格林斯潘因为亚洲金融危机正在放水，而我们的经济很强劲，背后还有互联网的推动。我出去雇了几个年轻的基金经理去买那些我连名字都拼不出的科技股。他们有自己的小账户，我会在他们的仓位之上大举跟进。结果那年年底，我们大概取得了42%的净回报，尽管之前经历了那场惨败，因为我乘上了99年那波疯狂的纳斯达克浪潮。

So then in January, I just said, "This is ridiculous," and I sold out all my tech holdings. Like I can't remember, it was like they had grown to like $6 billion or it was enormous for that period of time. And I actually went and told Soros why I had sold them out. And next thing that happens, the two little satellites inside, they don't sell out. They're gamblers. I don't really care because Quantum's huge and they're this little thing, they're not going to affect the performance that much. But Nicolai, they're making like 4% to 5% a day. I mean, the market is still roaring going into March, and I'm watching this and I'm getting really annoyed with myself that I'm not still in this trade.

然后到了一月份，我对自己说，“这太荒谬了”，然后我卖掉了我所有的科技股持仓。我记不清具体数字了，大概增长到了60亿美元左右，在那个时期是巨大的数额。我甚至还去告诉了索罗斯我为什么卖掉了它们。接下来发生的事情是，我内部的那两个小的卫星基金，他们没有卖。他们是赌徒。我其实不太在乎，因为量子基金规模巨大，而他们只是很小一部分，不会对整体业绩产生太大影响。但是，尼古拉，他们当时一天能赚4%到5%。我的意思是，市场在进入三月份时仍在疯狂上涨，我看着这一切，对自己没有继续持有那个仓位感到非常恼火。

And then around early March, I can't take it anymore. And I told you earlier I'm not emotional, this was a real emotional, really dumb move. I buy everything back. I think I missed the top by about an hour. So I buy back all these tech stocks and within a week, I know I'm dead. And Quantum goes from like up 14% to up 1% in a week. And I go in and... now I've already been through the trauma of the spring before, I recovered from it, but it had a big effect on me, the stress. I had young kids, you know, and it's like a repeat of the year before.

然后到了三月初，我再也受不了了。我之前告诉你我不情绪化，但这次是一个真正的、非常愚蠢的情绪化决定。我把所有股票都买了回来。我想我大概就差一个小时就买在了最高点。所以我买回了所有这些科技股，不到一周，我就知道我完蛋了。量子基金的业绩在一周内从上涨14%跌到只上涨1%。我走进去……现在我已经经历过前一年春天的创伤了，虽然恢复了过来，但那次压力对我影响很大。我当时有年幼的孩子，你知道，这就像是前一年的重演。

So I go into Soros and I tell him two things. A, I'm getting out of all this stuff. B, I'm quitting. We can't tell anybody because I got to liquidate this portfolio. But the Nasdaq is in the beginning wave of a down 90% move, and you can't get out. So by the time I get out, takes a few weeks, the fund is down like 17%, and Duquesne is down 17%. And I'm just exhausted. I've been running this high-profile fund for 12 years. So I sell everything out, everything of Duquesne, send my investors a letter and say, "I'm going on a sabbatical. I don't know whether I'm coming back or not. You can take all your money out, but if you take your money out, if I decide to come back, I can't guarantee I'll let you back in." I think I had like 200 clients, one of them pulled their money. I remember who it was, but they'll remain anonymous for now.

所以我去找索罗斯，告诉他两件事。第一，我要退出所有这些头寸。第二，我要辞职。我们不能告诉任何人，因为我必须清算这个投资组合。但纳斯达克正处于一波下跌90%的行情的开端，你根本出不来。所以等我清仓出来的时候，花了好几周，基金大概亏了17%，杜肯资本也亏了17%。我筋疲力尽。我已经管理这个备受瞩目的基金12年了。所以我卖掉了一切，杜肯的所有东西，给我的投资者写了一封信说：“我要休个长假。我不知道我是否会回来。你们可以把所有的钱都拿走，但如果你们拿走了钱，而我决定回来，我不能保证会再让你们投进来。” 我记得我大概有200个客户，其中一个撤回了他的资金。我记得是谁，但暂时让他们保持匿名吧。

So I shut everything down, I go to Africa with my wife and kids, and the best thing I did is during the summer, I refused to expose myself in any way to something that would tell me where the markets were. So I'm not allowed to watch TV, I'm not allowed to see the Wall Street Journal prices, nothing. So I come back on Labor Day, I think my wife couldn't have handled me being around once the kids go back to school. Sort of humor, maybe not. So I come back and it's remarkable because the S&P has rallied back almost to the high, the Nasdaq's retraced about 85% of the decline, but the dollar is up, interest rates are up, and oil is up. Three death knells for markets if you look at history.

所以我关闭了一切，和我的妻子孩子去了非洲，我做的最好的一件事就是，在那个夏天，我拒绝以任何方式接触任何能告诉我市场行情的东西。所以我不准看电视，不准看《华尔街日报》的报价，什么都不看。等到劳动节我回来，我想我妻子可能无法忍受孩子们返校后我还整天待在家里。这算是个玩笑，也许不是。所以我回来了，情况非常引人注目，因为标普500指数几乎反弹回了高点，纳斯达克指数也收复了大约85%的跌幅，但是，美元上涨了，利率上涨了，石油也上涨了。如果你看历史，这三者是市场的**丧钟**（death knells）。

So I then start calling all my clients who are basically small businessmen, they're not fancy institutions. And all their businesses are terrible. So then I call Ed Hyman, and I say...

所以我开始给我所有的客户打电话，他们基本上都是小企业主，不是什么高大上的机构。他们所有人的生意都糟透了。然后我打电话给**艾德·海曼（Ed Hyman）**，我说……

He's an equity strategist, macroeconomist.

他是一位股票策略师，宏观经济学家。

Yeah, he's probably was the number one institutional guy, whatever that rating, Institutional Investor economist. And I say, "This is very odd." And I've been out of touch, dollar's up, blah, blah, blah. And two days later in his daily missive, he has regression analysis and it says it's 50% currency, 25% oil, and 25% interest rates, and it looks one year forward and it predicts earnings. And it's predicting that earnings are going to decline 36% the next year, and the Wall Street consensus is they're going to go up 18%.

是的，他可能是排名第一的机构投资者经济学家，不管那个评级叫什么。我说：“这非常奇怪。”我一直与世隔绝，美元涨了，等等等等。两天后，在他的每日简报中，他做了一个回归分析，说影响因素是50%的汇率，25%的石油和25%的利率，这个模型可以预测一年后的盈利。它预测下一年的盈利将下降36%，而华尔街的共识是盈利将上涨18%。

So combination of that, listening to my clients, the fact that Greenspan got a tightening directive on, which I think is inappropriate, I start buying all these treasuries. And the market doesn't go my way, but all the information keeps going my way. So I keep buying more and more and more and more. So now I have a 350% 10-year equivalent in the fund. And then I get lucky with the Gore-Bush fiasco, economy falls apart. I end up making 40% in the fourth quarter. So I had written the year off. When I came back, I'm down 18%. I assume, okay, at least I don't have to worry about this anymore. I'm finally going to have a down year. And it's like the best quarter I ever had. And to this day, if I had stayed managing money, I think I'd been tied in knots and there's no way I would have made that trade. It was the fact that I was away for four months, had a clean slate, had a clear head, and just looked at the new evidence. So it was a very, very, very horrible beginning and a very lucky ending.

所以，结合了这些因素——听取我客户的意见，格林斯潘收到了一个紧缩指令（我认为这是不合适的）——我开始大量买入国债。市场并没有马上按我的方向走，但所有的信息都持续支持我的判断。所以我不断地买入，买得越来越多。到最后，我的基金里有相当于350%仓位的10年期国债。然后，我因为戈尔对布什的选举闹剧而走运，经济崩溃了。我最终在第四季度赚了40%。我本来已经放弃那一年了。当我回来时，我还亏着18%。我心想，好吧，至少我不用再担心这个了，我终于要有一个亏损的年份了。结果那成了我经历过的最好的一个季度。直到今天我都认为，如果我当时一直坚持管理资金，我会被束缚住，绝不可能做出那样的交易。正是因为我离开了四个月，有了一张白纸，一个清醒的头脑，只看新的证据。所以那是一个非常、非常、非常可怕的开始，和一个非常幸运的结局。

## 日常作息与给年轻人的建议

Nicolai Tangen: Now, you don't take four months off very often. You work very hard. When do you wake up in the morning?

尼古拉·坦根: 现在，您不常休四个月的假。您工作非常努力。您早上几点起床？

Stan Druckenmiller: 4:00, 4:00 in the morning.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 早上4点。

Nicolai Tangen: Yeah. What do you do? You have an office at home, right?

尼古拉·坦根: 是吗。您做什么？您家里有办公室，对吧？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yeah. Yeah, I immediately go to the Bloomberg.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。是的，我立刻去看彭博终端。

Nicolai Tangen: 4:00, you do... you make a cup of coffee before you go to Bloomberg or straight to Bloomberg?

尼古拉·坦根: 4点钟，您是……在看彭博之前先冲杯咖啡，还是直接去看彭博？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. No, yeah, I make a cup of coffee. I go up, I don't shower yet. Check all the markets, read the Journal, skim the Financial Times, skim the New York Times, check like all the emails overnight. When I say check, I mean skim them for the important ones. Then it's probably 5:15 or 5:30, take a shower, go to work, start all over again.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。不，是的，我先冲杯咖啡。我上楼，还不洗澡。检查所有市场，读《华尔街日报》，浏览《金融时报》，浏览《纽约时报》，检查所有夜间的邮件。当我说检查时，我的意思是快速浏览，找出重要的。然后大概是5:15或5:30，洗个澡，去上班，重新开始。

Nicolai Tangen: When you go to bed?

尼古拉·坦根: 您什么时候睡觉？

Stan Druckenmiller: Usually around 8:30, quarter to 9, as soon as I see what's happening in Japan.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 通常在8:30左右，8:45，只要我看到日本市场开盘的情况就行。

Nicolai Tangen: You basically live according to financial markets.

尼古拉·坦根: 您基本上是按照金融市场的节奏生活的。

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. My mother-in-law said a long time ago, I'm an idiot savant. She thought she was joking, but she's correct. It's the only thing I'm really good at. I really enjoy it. Keeps me young. I'm dealing with brilliant young people here as analysts, but also I'm forced to read the newspaper and forced to learn about these waves, and keeps me stimulated. I love it.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。我岳母很久以前就说，我是一个**白痴天才**（idiot savant：指在某些特定领域表现出非凡才能，但在其他方面可能低于常人的人）。她以为她在开玩笑，但她说的是对的。这是我唯一真正擅长的事情。我真的很享受它。它让我保持年轻。我在这里和聪明的年轻人一起工作，他们是分析师，但同时我也被迫去读报纸，被迫去了解这些浪潮，这让我保持兴奋。我爱这份工作。

Nicolai Tangen: Now you are 71, right?

尼古拉·坦根: 您现在71岁了，对吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。

Nicolai Tangen: And you will continue until you die, you think?

尼古拉·坦根: 您觉得您会一直工作到去世吗？

Stan Druckenmiller: Yes. Hopefully it won't be tonight.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 是的。希望不是今晚。

Nicolai Tangen: No, I think probably not. So last thing, we got tens of thousands of young people here now. They want to be like you, make a lot of money, be successful in financial markets. What should they be doing? How should they enter? What should they think about?

尼古拉·坦根: 不，我想应该不会。最后一个问题，我们这里现在有成千上万的年轻人。他们想成为您这样的人，赚很多钱，在金融市场取得成功。他们应该做什么？他们应该如何入行？他们应该思考些什么？

Stan Druckenmiller: First of all, if they're going in it for the money, they should go elsewhere. There's too many people in the business like me that just love the game and the passion for reasons I just articulated. And they're not going to be able to outwork the people that are passionate in the game. And it's not a fun game if you're losing. It's horrible. I just told you how I respond to drawdowns. So but if they have a passion for it, if I was a young person, I would not get an MBA. I'd go find a mentor. And if they didn't want me, I would just relentlessly bug the hell out of them, which a couple of have done with me, until they finally accepted me to go and work for them. Learn what I could from them. If they still like the business, just keep trying to grow your knowledge base.

斯坦·德鲁肯米勒: 首先，如果他们是为了钱进入这个行业，他们应该去别处。这个行业里有太多像我一样的人，他们只是热爱这个游戏，出于我刚才阐述的那些原因而充满激情。他们不可能比那些对游戏充满激情的人更努力。而且如果你在输钱，这个游戏一点也不好玩。它很可怕。我刚告诉过你我如何应对回撤。但是，如果他们对此充满激情，如果我是一个年轻人，我不会去读MBA。我会去找一个**导师（mentor）**。如果他们不想要我，我就会不停地烦他们，就像有几个人对我做的那样，直到他们最终接受我为他们工作。从他们身上学习我能学到的一切。如果他们仍然喜欢这个行业，就继续努力扩大自己的知识库。

I would say an analyst skill set in our business is completely different than a portfolio manager skill set. Once in a while, you'll get an overlap, but I would be careful if they really love the analyst part, which is where we all start, of thinking they have to become a portfolio manager. I've seen it ruin people's lives who weren't built for trigger-pulling. So they should be open-minded. I got in the business because I wanted intellectual stimulation, and you're going to get plenty in either one. But that would be that would be my advice to them, and be open-minded.

我想说，在我们这个行业，**分析师（analyst）**的技能组合和**投资组合经理（portfolio manager）**的技能组合是完全不同的。偶尔你会看到两者有重叠，但我会提醒他们，如果他们真的很喜欢分析师的工作（我们都是从这里开始的），要小心那种认为自己必须成为投资组合经理的想法。我见过这种情况毁掉了一些人的生活，他们天生就不是做决策、“扣扳机”的料。所以他们应该保持开放的心态。我进入这个行业是因为我想要智力上的挑战，而无论做哪个角色你都能得到很多。所以那会是我给他们的建议，并且要保持开放的心态。

Nicolai Tangen: Stan, this has been an epic conversation.

尼古拉·坦根: 斯坦，这是一次史诗级的对话。

Stan Druckenmiller: Thanks, Nicolai. I probably said more than I should have.
