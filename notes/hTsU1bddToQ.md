### 2025年政治回顾：聚焦高光与低谷

这一年，在安大略省乃至全国范围内，发生了许多事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot has happened this year politically in Ontario and across the country.</p>
</details>

仅仅列出本省的主要事件，可能就需要一整年的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Listing the major events just here in this province could take us a whole other year.</p>
</details>

因此，让我们拨开噪音，聚焦于今年的高光时刻和低谷时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's cut through the noise and focus on some highlights and lowlights.</p>
</details>

我与《多伦多星报》渥太华分社社长兼高级记者Tonda Morales，以及TVO Today的专栏作家、OnPoli播客的联合主持人John Michael McGrath坐下来，讨论2025年最大的时刻。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I sat down with Tonda Morales, bureau chief and senior reporter in the Toronto Star's Ottawa bureau, and John Michael McGrath, TVO Today columnist and co-host of the OnPoli podcast, to talk about the biggest moments of 2025.</p>
</details>

Tonda和John Michael McGrath，欢迎来到节目。

<p class="english-text">Tonda, John Michael McGrath, welcome to the program.</p>
</details>

很高兴你们能来这里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Great. You guys can be here.</p>
</details>

我先从你开始。今年政治格局的走向受到了哪个事件的更大影响？是贾斯汀·特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）的辞职，还是特朗普（Trump）宣布关税政策？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to start with you. What event had a bigger impact on the course of this year's political landscape? Is it Justin Trudeau's resignation or Trump's announcement on tariffs?</p>
</details>

### 关税的全球性冲击与特鲁多辞职的背景

嗯，我认为是特朗普关于关税的宣布。但在某种程度上，这也是贾斯汀·特鲁多辞职的背景，因为这也是克里斯蒂娅·弗里兰（Chrystia Freeland）辞职的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think Trump's announcement on tariffs. But in a way that was the backdrop for Justin Trudeau's resignation, because it was also the backdrop for when Chrystia Freeland resigned.</p>
</details>

你还记得我们说过自由党没有应对即将到来的关税的计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You recall saying that the Liberals didn't have a plan to deal with the coming tariffs.</p>
</details>

但特朗普的关税是全球性的影响。它影响了全球的经济、安全、安全讨论，影响了方方面面。这是一种地震般的改变，改变了世界合作的方式。所以，就单一事件而言，就是这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Trump's tariffs have affected globally. Everybody upended global trade economics, security, security discussions, everything. It's it is a seismic change in the way the world is working together. So I mean as one single event that's it.</p>
</details>

但在加拿大日历上的一个重大政治事件中，贾斯汀·特鲁多的辞职是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But as a big political event in the Canadian calendar, Justin Trudeau's resignation was huge.</p>
</details>

JMM，同样的问题问你。回顾过去很难，已经12个月了。但是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">JMM, same question to you. It's hard to look back. It's been 12 months. But yeah.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，如果我有一台时间机器，让我重演过去这一年，我最想看到答案的问题是，你知道，如果贾斯汀·特鲁多继续担任总理，并在特朗普关税的背景下竞选连任——这些关税显然在马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）的联邦竞选中起到了非常重要的作用，围绕着保护加拿大就业和保护加拿大经济的信息展开——你知道，贾斯汀·特鲁多今天还能是总理吗？我对此表示怀疑，但这只是一个引人入胜的历史性问题，我很想知道答案。就像Tonda一样，我认为你必须承认，从全球范围来看，唐纳德·特朗普的总统任期是更大的、更大的议题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if I had a time machine and I could rerun this past year, this is the question I most want to see answered, which is, you know, if Justin Trudeau had stayed on as prime minister and could run for re-election in the context of the Trump tariffs, which obviously played so heavily into Mark Carney's federal campaign about, you know, elbows up and all of the messaging around protecting Canadian jobs and protecting the Canadian economy. You know, could Justin Trudeau still be prime minister today? I'm skeptical, but it's just such a fascinating historical question that I would love to know. Like Tonda, I think you have to say that just globally speaking, Donald Trump's presidency has been the bigger, bigger issue.</p>
</details>

即使在加拿大政治的背景下也是如此。显然，我可以多谈谈它对安大略省的影响。关税的影响确实非常巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And even in the context of Canadian politics. And obviously, I could talk a bit more about the effect it's had in Ontario. The tariffs really have just been so huge.</p>
</details>

### 特鲁多辞职的政治影响与福特的回应

我想接着你说的贾斯汀·特鲁多的辞职。这对我们这里（安大略省）来说为什么如此重大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on what you said, Justin Trudeau's resignation. Why was it so big for us here?</p>
</details>

因为就在他做出决定前的几天，也就是1月6日，他辞职了。也许人们会记得。但在最后一刻，他试图硬撑过去。在弗里兰辞职之后，他的财政部长在预算日或财政经济更新日辞职。这是件大事。然后他整个圣诞假期都在和顾问们一起商量、开会。所以，当他做出离开的决定时，让一切都动了起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because right up until a couple of days before he made the decision, he resigned on January 6th. Maybe people will recall. But right up until the very end, he tried to tough it out. After Freeland's resignation, the resignation of his finance minister on a budget day or a fiscal economic update day. Big deal. And spent the whole of Christmas holidays huddling with advisors and talking to caucus.</p>
</details>

这让马克·卡尼进入了加拿大政治。它突然挑战了保守党，让他们要面对一位新的自由党领袖，这位领袖正试图给自由党披上新的品牌和面孔，而自由党已经执政了十年。而且，你知道，这确实挑战了保守党，让他们在上次竞选中去面对这一现实。鲍威尔（Pierre Poilievre）继续竞选反对贾斯汀·特鲁多，而且可以说有些日子他仍然这样做。在整个竞选中，许多人觉得他从未转向去应对美国关税带来的威胁，而自由党通过选择马克·卡尼作为他们的领袖来应对了这一威胁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so really, when he took the decision to get out, it put everything in play. It brought in Mark Carney into Canadian politics. It suddenly challenged the conservatives to deal with a new Liberal leader who was putting attempting to put a new brand and face on the Liberal Party, which had had a decade in power. And, you know, it really challenged the conservatives in the last campaign to confront that reality. Mr. Poilievre continued to campaign against Justin Trudeau, and arguably some days he still does. Throughout that campaign, and many felt that he never did make the pivot to deal with the American threat the way the liberals did via the selection of Mark Carney as their leader.</p>
</details>

约翰·迈克尔，我们来谈谈省级政治，我知道我们一直在谈论省级政治。我这里没有道具，也没有戴着“加拿大待售”帽子的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">John Mikal, let's talk provincial politics, captain Canada I know that's what we were talking provincial politics here. I don't have any props or any hats that say Canada's for sale here.</p>
</details>

但手指上的泡沫手套呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But foam glove with the finger.</p>
</details>

确切地说。但那个绰号对道格·福特（Doug Ford）在竞选期间产生了什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. But what effect did that nickname have on Doug Ford during his campaign?</p>
</details>

嗯，你知道，Tonda提到了皮埃尔·鲍威尔（Pierre Poilievre）无法或不愿根据不断变化的政治环境进行调整的能力。而且，你知道，作为一个专栏作家，有时你会把事情搞砸。有时你会做出不应验的预测。如果我能获得一个非常小的胜利圈，我早就很早就在预测，当唐纳德·特朗普赢得选举时，道格·福特就会有理由提前举行安大略省选举。当然，在此之前，人们已经猜测了几个月会有提前选举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, Tonda mentioned the inability or unwillingness by Pierre Poilievre to pivot to reflect the changing political circumstances. And, you know, as a columnist, sometimes you get things wrong. Sometimes you make predictions that don't pan out. And if I can be allowed a very small victory lap, I was pretty early on in calling that the moment Donald Trump won the election, that Doug Ford would have grounds to call an early Ontario election.</p>
</details>

当然，在此之前，人们已经猜测了几个月会有提前选举。而最大的问题是，你知道，提前选举的借口会是什么？特朗普的选举结果一经确定，你知道，我们就知道关税要来了。对我来说很清楚，这将是新一轮选举的基础。果不其然，这就是它的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, there had been speculation for months before that. And the big question was, you know, what would the excuse for an early election be? And the moment Trump's election was was final. And, you know, we knew that tariffs were coming. It was clear to me that we would be that was going to be the grounds for a new election. And and sure enough, that's what it was.</p>
</details>

你知道，我们不能过度强调关税对加拿大决策者来说是多么巨大的地震般的转变。我们花了一代人的时间来假设美国市场将永远向我们开放，条件是最优惠的。自2020年1月20日以来发生的变化，也许不应该让决策者感到惊讶，但它确实让他们感到惊讶。我认为很多人都在一厢情愿地认为，特朗普谈到对所有人的关税时，并不是真的针对我们，但他确实针对了我们，以及其他所有人。从那以后发生的一切都只是调整的形式，这也是道格·福特在竞选活动中如此奏效的原因之一，那就是真正地，你知道，转向，坦率地说，几乎所有除了谈论保护安大略省经济和保护安大略省就业之外的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it really cannot overstate what a seismic shift the tariffs are to Canadian policymakers. We really have spent a generation just assuming that the American market would always be open to us under the most favorable terms. And the change since January 20th, perhaps it should not have taken policymakers by surprise the way it did. I think there was a lot of sort of wishful thinking that somehow Trump didn't really mean us when he talked about tariffs on everybody, but he did. He meant us as well as everybody else. And everything since then has just been a form of adjusting, and that has been part of what worked so well for Doug Ford in that election campaign was really, you know, pivoting away from, frankly, almost anything except talking about protecting the Ontario economy and protecting Ontario jobs.</p>
</details>

### 福特与卡尼的“好警察/坏警察”策略

好的，汤姆。所以，我只想说，他也以一种非常本能的、情感化的方式抓住了时机。他在情感层面上向安大略省选民发出了呼吁，这是马克·卡尼或皮埃尔·鲍威尔都无法捕捉到或仍然无法捕捉到的，即加拿大人在面对特朗普威胁时，面对“第51个州”的威胁以及加拿大人为之采取的防御姿态——你知道，停止为娱乐目的前往美国旅行，停止购买美国制造的产品，转而支持“购买加拿大制造”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Tom. So I would just say he also did so by seizing the moment in a visceral, emotional way. He appealed to Ontario voters as a defender on an emotional level in a way that neither, frankly, Mark Carney nor Pierre Poilievre did or still are able to capture, sort of the, the, the, the reactions of Canadians in the face of the Trump threats of 51st state and the defensive posture that Canadians adopted to, you know, stop traveling to the US for pleasure and stop buying American made products and go for Buy Canadian.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我认为道格·福特让愤怒的唐纳德·特朗普通过与这个国家进行贸易谈判而缓和下来，这正是他所做的。道格·福特政府，道格·福特本人，在情感层面和智力层面都抓住了反关税的论点，并将其放在美国人面前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think that was Doug Ford, I think gave voice to that even with the ad that later so angered Donald Trump into easing trade negotiations with this country. Doug Ford's government, Doug Ford himself, captured both on an emotional level and in a way, on an intellectual level, the anti-tariff argument and put it back in the face of Americans.</p>
</details>

还记得当他威胁要切断安大略省的电力出口时，他们有多生气吗？所以我想那是他成功的一些秘诀。而且，让我们面对现实，自从他成为总理以来，马克·卡尼很高兴让道格·福特扮演那个角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Remember how mad they got when he threatened to cut off Ontario's electricity? Ontario electrical electrical exports? So I think that was the secret of some of his success. And let's face it, since he's been Prime Minister, Mark Carney is quite happy to have Doug Ford play that role.</p>
</details>

好的，我们坚持这一点。让我们把这两个人放在同一个房间里。我们有道格·福特省长，马克·卡尼总理。你对他们的关系有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's stick with that, Tom. Let's throw these two in a room together. We've got Premier Doug Ford, Prime Minister Mark Carney. What do you make of their relationship?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，他们关系很好。毫无疑问。围绕那则广告产生了一些紧张气氛，因为联邦方面的人非常清楚，这激怒了特朗普，也激怒了美国驻加拿大大使，也激怒了美国的一些共和党人。但我认为，除了那种紧张之外，总的来说，这两个人相处得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they've got a good relationship. There's no question there is. There was a source of tension around the ad because the Canadians on the federal side were acutely aware that it was angering Trump and angering the US ambassador here and angering some of the Republicans in the US. But I think that aside from that tension, by and large, these two get along.</p>
</details>

几乎没有一项联邦政策出台，道格·福特不会公开站出来支持。你知道，他在重大项目上支持了马克·卡尼。他在关税问题上的处理方式上基本上支持了马克·卡尼。当马克·卡尼在美国关税上采取了反制关税并取消了数字服务税，以期，你知道，安抚特朗普时，福特一路都在赞扬他的努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's barely a federal policy that comes out that Doug Ford doesn't come out in public and defend. You know, he has backed Mark Carney on major projects. He has backed Mark Carney largely on his approach to tariffs. When Mark Carney rolled back Canada's counter-tariffs on the US and rolled back the digital services tax in an effort to, you know, woo Trump, Ford was with him every step of the way praising his efforts.</p>
</details>

而且，看，他们的关系很好。他们经常交谈。我认为这对他们双方来说都是一种成功。你知道，好警察/坏警察的剧本对他们是奏效的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And look, they do have a good relationship. They talk frequently. And I think that's, you know, a bit of a success for both of them. You know, the good cop/bad cop playbook is working for them.</p>
</details>

好的，我也想就此跟进一下。我应该提到，福特省长说卡尼省长事先知道那个广告的事，据称是托尼亚（Tonya）提到了这个“好警察/坏警察”策略在这里有多大程度的实施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I want to pick up on that as well. I should mention that Premier Ford said that Carney knew about the ad, allegedly, that Tonya had mentioned how much of this is a good cop/bad cop strategy here.</p>
</details>

我不太确定其中有多少是事先计划好的，即他们有意识地扮演这些角色，但他们似乎至少是自然而然地达到了这种状态。他们已经进入了一个游戏，在这个游戏中，你知道，福特采取了一种更具对抗性、更积极的立场，然后卡尼可以扮演相对更具调和性的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not sure how much of it is premeditated in that sense, of them playing those those roles consciously, but they seem to have, at the very least, organically. They have arrived at this game where, you know, Ford takes out a bit more of an antagonistic, aggressive position, and then Carney can be the relatively more conciliatory one.</p>
</details>

公平地说，这项行动并没有完美奏效。我们现在没有与美国达成协议，而且我不知道有谁会自信地说有协议在望。但显然，我不会把所有责任都归咎于加拿大决策者。这里的首要行动者是唐纳德·特朗普及其政府拒绝达成协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's fair to say that this act has not worked perfectly right. Like we don't have a deal with the Americans right now, and I don't know of anybody who would confidently say that there is a deal within sight. But obviously I don't place all of the blame for that on Canadian policymakers. The primary actor here is Donald Trump and his administration's refusal to to make a deal.</p>
</details>

你知道，我提出的另一点是，我认为福特在某种程度上非常、非常积极，这种积极性可能会让一些不熟悉这些情况的人感到惊讶，你知道，省级层面上有多少杠杆可以用来进行国际政治动作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the other point I would make is that I think Ford has been very, very active in a way that I think might have surprised people, maybe not not always familiar with this, you know, just how many levers there are at the provincial level to make international political moves.</p>
</details>

没错。你知道，汤姆提到了威胁电力出口，安大略省可以做到，因为安大略省拥有自己大部分的电力系统，并且它肯定监管这里的电力销售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. You know, Todd mentioned threatening electricity exports, which Ontario can do because Ontario owns most of its own electricity system and it certainly regulates electricity sales here.</p>
</details>

还有一些事情，比如因为安大略省拥有省级经营的酒类专卖权，所以把美国的酒类产品从**LCBO**（Liquor Control Board of Ontario: 安大略省酒类管理委员会，负责省级酒类销售垄断）货架上撤下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Things like pulling American liquor out of the LCBO shelves because Ontario has a provincially run liquor monopoly.</p>
</details>

你知道，当它想向美国人表明立场时，省政府可以施加所有这些压力点，你知道，比如肯塔基州两位参议员一直非常直言不讳地表示，美国的关税正在伤害肯塔基州的波本威士忌出口商，因为安大略省的LCBO是世界上最大的单一酒类买家之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, there are all of these pressure points that the provincial government can, can, can push on when it wants to make a point to Americans, you know, and like the fact that both of Kentucky's senators have been very vocal about how American tariffs are hurting Kentucky bourbon exporters, because Ontario is the LCBO is one of the single largest liquor buyers in the world.</p>
</details>

目前，你不能在安大略省销售肯塔基波本威士忌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the moment, you can't sell Kentucky bourbon here in Ontario.</p>
</details>

### 能源战略：SMR项目与联邦合作的信号

我想继续谈能源问题，但我想谈谈国家建设工程。达灵顿（Darlington）小型模块化反应堆（**SMR** - Small Modular Reactor: 一种比传统核反应堆更小、希望建造更快、成本更低的核反应堆）是一个快速通道上的项目。这就在奥沙瓦（Oshawa）以东。意义重大。请解释一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to stick on energy, but I want to talk nation building projects. The Darlington Small Modular Reactor is a project that's on the fast track list. This is just east of Oshawa. Significant. Explain.</p>
</details>

所以这是一个已经进行很长时间的项目。如果你要回到安大略省电力公司的最早版本，OPG（Ontario Power Generation）在麦金泰（McGuinty）政府时期就为达灵顿的场地申请了环境评估，并且获得了该评估。即使在那之后，核电提案的一代被取消了，OPG明智地保留了环境评估的有效性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this has been a project that has been underway for actually a very long time. If you want to go back to the earliest incarnation of Ontario's power company, OPG first applied for an environmental assessment at the Darlington site back under the McGuinty government. And they got that assessment. And even after that generation of nuclear proposal was scrapped, OPG wisely kept the environmental assessment alive.</p>
</details>

在过去十年中，随着小型模块化反应堆——这些通常是更小、正如其名，更小的核反应堆——成为核政策中的热门话题，人们希望它们能更快、更便宜地建造出来。安大略省能够接触到全球公司，并说，嘿，我们这里有一个现成的场地，有现成的环境批准，可以立即开始建设。现在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in the last decade, as as the idea of small modular reactors, these are generally smaller, as the name implies, smaller nuclear reactors that the hope is will be faster and cheaper to build, as that has become sort of the the hot topic in nuclear policy. Ontario was able to go to global companies and say, hey, we've got this site ready to go, ready to build with an existing environmental approval. Now.</p>
</details>

马克·卡尼将达灵顿SMR场地列入主要项目名单的意义是什么？对我来说并不完全清楚，因为正如我已经说过的，它已经拥有了所有联邦批准。现在，联邦政府可以做其他事情来支持它，比如提供资金，他们已经承诺了。但我认为我们现在看到的省级和联邦政府在核电方面达成的和谐，很可能是未来事件的预兆，因为安大略省不会止步于达灵顿场地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The significance of Mark Carney putting the Darlington SMR site on the the major projects list. It's not entirely clear to me because as I sort of already said, it already has all of its federal approvals. Now, there are other things that the federal government can do to support it, like make money available, which they've promised. But I think the harmony that we're now seeing between the provincial and the federal government on nuclear power is probably a foreshadowing of things to come, because the Ontario is not stopping with the Darlington site.</p>
</details>

他们今年开始由省政府宣布一个巨大的新核电站，他们想在希望港（Port Hope）建造，就在达灵顿以东一点。而这只是他们正在谈论的几个地点之一。所以，今年一个沉睡的故事，可以说，就是安大略省真的更热切地投入到核电中。他们将需要联邦的帮助来执行这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They this year began with the provincial government announcing a massive new nuclear station that they want to build in Port Hope, just a bit further east of Darlington. And that is only one of several locations they're talking about. So one of the sleeper stories this year, so to speak, has been Ontario really going even more enthusiastically into nuclear power. And they will need federal help to to execute that.</p>
</details>

我想跟进我认为的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on I think.</p>
</details>

是的，我想我只是要说，我们看到像这样的项目，你说的对，它已经有了这么多批准，这更多的是关于，你知道，联邦政府实际上能为这个特定项目做什么，而不是。但在早期，当马克·卡尼将整个项目清单，第一阶段的项目列为国家建设的潜在指定项目时，我认为这是向全国发出的一个重要信号，即主要项目和快速审批的重点将放在矿山、关键矿物、能源以及其他相关的贸易促进基础设施，比如港口和铁路，比如丘吉尔港、蒙特利尔港。这些是，你知道，它们处于不同的阶段。第一阶段，第二阶段。但到目前为止，它们都没有获得国家利益的头衔，也没有被快速审批。但市场看到了一个非常明确的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think I was just going to say that the reason we see a project like that, which you're right, had so many approvals already in place, is less about, you know, what the federal government can actually do for that one particular project. But in the early days when this whole list, the first phase of projects that Mark Carney put on the on the table for potential designation as nation building, I think this was part of a greater signal to the country that the emphasis for major projects and fast tracked approvals is going to be on mines, critical minerals, energy and other related trade boosting infrastructure like ports and rail and say the Port of Churchill, the Port of Montreal. These are, you know, they're in different phases. Phase one, phase two. But none of them have actually so far gotten the title of nation in the national interest or been fast tracked. But there was a very clear signal to markets.</p>
</details>

看，你没有在那个名单上看到“每个加拿大人都有家庭医生”作为国家建设工程，你没有看到“药房护理”作为国家建设工程。你看，这也是很有趣的。他们把安大略省的高速铁路也列了进去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, you didn't see on that list a family doctor for every Canadian as a nation building project, you didn't see Pharmacare as a nation building project. You don't see. It was also interesting. They put on things like high speed rail for Ontario.</p>
</details>

没错。所以这也是一个倡导者们说我们已经看到了好处的项目，即使我们还没有将其纳入快速审批流程。他们已经看到了走出去说服投资者向该项目投入资本的好处。他们说，看，这是一件真实的事情。所以我想这是卡尼所做的大部分内容。他有一个非常清晰的愿景，他想优先实现什么。它都围绕着贸易、经济，潜在地围绕清洁能源。尽管它可能不是。听起来不像那样，我想，因为我们现在也在谈论管道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So that is also a project that the proponents are saying we're already seeing benefits, even if we haven't been put into the process for fast track approvals yet. They are already seeing the benefit of going out to persuade investors to pour capital into the project. They're saying, look, this is a real thing. So I think that was a large part of what Carney is doing. He's got a very clear vision for what he wants to get priority. And it's all around trade, economy and potentially clean energy. Although it might not. It doesn't sound like that, I suppose, because now we're also talking about pipelines.</p>
</details>

好的，让我们跟进这一点。卡尼最近签署了与阿尔伯塔省的谅解备忘录，他将自己的做法解释为合作的联邦主义。我对这种做法在多大程度上能很好地适应其他省份感到好奇。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, let's let's follow up on that. Carney most recently signed the memorandum of understanding with Alberta, and he explained his approach as cooperative federalism. And I'm curious to know how much of that approach would will bode well for other provinces.</p>

我的意思是，这是一个信号，表明他正试图尊重围绕权力划分的宪法原则，并且他希望在他们各自的管辖范围内与各省进行接触。这在某种程度上有些陈词滥调。但他是在向皈依者布道。我的意思是，阿尔伯塔希望在自己的管辖范围内运作。

<p class="english-text">I mean, that's a signal that he's trying to honour a constitutional principle around the division of powers, and he wants to engage provinces on their areas of jurisdiction. It's a bit of a it's a bit of a cliche in a way. But he's he's preaching to the converted. I mean, Alberta wants to operate in its own areas of jurisdiction.</p>

但它确实发出了信号，那就是卡尼愿意与各省达成交易，只要每个人都在同一个目标上保持一致。所以，例如，他与阿尔伯塔协议的一部分是，如果他们最终批准任何管道，那么阿尔伯塔方面将对他们自己的排放物实施更严格的工业碳定价。

<p class="english-text">What it does, though, signal, is that Carney is willing to cut deals with provinces as long as everybody's aligned on the same goal. So, for example, he part of the agreement with Alberta, if they were to ever approve a pipeline, would be tougher industrial carbon pricing on Alberta's part on their own emitters.</p>

而联邦政府将同意取消，例如，《清洁电力条例》，这些条例旨在使天然气发电厂在某种程度上越来越不成为常态，或者要求他们为排放付费。联邦政府准备取消这一点。道格·福特想要这个。安大略省想要这个。你知道，我认为你所看到的是卡尼向各省发出的信号。然后向我展示的不是金钱，而是展示我前进的道路。你将要脱碳。向我展示你将如何实现净零排放。向我展示你将如何削减你的排放量，我们将削减这些类型的交易。

<p class="english-text">And the feds would agree to lift, for example, the Clean Electricity Regulations, which are sort of aimed at making natural gas powered plants sort of less and less the the norm or requiring them to pay for emissions. The feds are prepared to lift that. Doug Ford wants that. Ontario wants that. You know, I think what you saw is Carney signaling to provinces. Then show me not the money, but show me the way. You're going to decarbonize. Show me the way you're going to get to net zero. Show me how you're going to cut your emissions, and we'll cut these kinds of deals.</p>
