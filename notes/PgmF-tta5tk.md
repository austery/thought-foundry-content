title: 佐兰·曼达尼的竞选：草根动员与数字策略的成功蓝图
---

### 曼达尼的崛起与竞选启示

官方消息称，**民主社会主义者**（Democratic Socialist: 一种主张通过民主手段实现社会主义目标的政治意识形态）佐兰·曼达尼将成为下一任纽约市市长。他的竞选活动激发了进步人士和年轻人的热情，其成功震惊了许多传统政治势力。

主持人：珍，欢迎来到节目。你最近怎么样？
珍：挺好的。非常感谢邀请我。

<p class="english-text">Host: Jen, welcome to the program. How are you doing? Jen: Pretty good. Thank you so much for having me.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的，当然。如果一年前你问我：“佐兰·曼达尼是谁？”我可能会像大多数人一样告诉你：“我不知道。我从没听过这个名字。”但现在，突然之间，他的名字无处不在，当然，因为他实至名归。他赢得了纽约市的市长竞选。你能回顾一下吗？他是如何开始他的政治生涯的？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Host: Yeah, of course. Now, if you were to ask me a year ago, "Who is Zohran Mamdani?" I would probably tell you, like most people, "I don't know. I've never heard that name." But now, suddenly, his name is everywhere, of course, because he deserved it. He won the mayoral race in New York. Can you take a step back? How did he get his political start?</p>
</details>

### 佐兰·曼达尼的政治起步

珍：哦，好问题。基本上，在纽约市，有一个**纽约市民主社会主义者**（New York City DSA: Democratic Socialists of America，美国民主社会主义者组织在纽约市的分支），他们进行拉票，并组织人群进行租户组织、工人组织和选举活动，包括提名候选人参选并支持他们的竞选。佐兰·曼达尼在2017年加入了纽约市民主社会主义者组织，以支持一位候选人。他挨家挨户地拜访。那位候选人最终落选了，但佐兰非常喜欢这个政治过程并参与其中，人们鼓励他竞选**州议员**（assemblyman: 州立法机构的成员），这相当于我们安大略省的**省议员**（MPP: Member of Provincial Parliament）。然后，去年夏天，他考虑竞选市长，而民主社会主义者组织也让他登上了选票。这就是他政治生涯的真正开端：一个自愿为社区做出改变的人，挨家挨户地与人们交谈，然后爱上了这个过程并投身其中。

<p class="english-text">Jen: Oh, great question. Basically, in New York City, there is the New York City DSA (Democratic Socialists of America). They canvas and have groups of people who do tenant organizing, worker organizing, and electoralism – nominating people to run for office and supporting their campaigns. Zohran Mamdani was someone who, in 2017, joined the New York City DSA to support a candidate. He went door-to-door. The candidate ultimately lost, but Zohran really liked the political process and got involved. People encouraged him to run as an assemblyman (a member of a legislative assembly), which is our equivalent of an MPP (Member of Provincial Parliament) here in Ontario. Then, last summer, he thought about running for mayor, and the DSA had him on the ballot. That's really how it started: just someone who volunteered to make a difference in their community, went door-to-door, started talking to people, and then just loved the process and got involved.</p>

### 竞选活动的影响力与数字策略

主持人：曼达尼的竞选活动有哪些方面产生了如此大的影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What about Mamdani's campaign made such an impact?</p>
</details>

珍：哦，我的意思是，这个问题我们该从何说起呢？方方面面。太多了。我认为，对于我这个从事组织工作，并有组织租户、工会和参与选举过程经验的人来说，1万名志愿者挨家挨户拜访，接触了120万纽约市民，这令人瞩目。当你考虑到这一点时，这意味着尽管佐兰·曼达尼是一位社会主义者和穆斯林，并受到主流媒体的猛烈抨击，但他依然能够脱颖而出。他之所以能做到这一点，是因为有大量民众自发地愿意与人们就真正重要的问题进行一对一的对话。我认为这就是他能够承受如此多攻击的“秘密武器”：这确实是一个**草根**（grassroots: 由民众自发组织和参与的）运动和系统。背后没有大笔资金支持，但肯定有富豪们资助了大量针对他的广告。然而，如果我们团结起来，共同为一个项目努力，人们就能克服这些。此外，他的许多成功也归功于他的数字策略。据报道，已经有政治家试图模仿，但效果不佳。他的数字策略为何如此有效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jen: Oh, I mean, where do we go with this question? Everywhere. So much of it. As someone who organizes and has a history of organizing tenants, unions, and in the electoral process, I find it remarkable that 10,000 people volunteered to go door-to-door. They reached 1.2 million New Yorkers. When you think of that, it means that yes, Zohran Mamdani is a socialist and is Muslim, and he is rising to this occasion despite being hammered by the mainstream media. He's able to do that because there's this huge groundswell of people who are willing to have one-on-one conversations about the issues that really matter. I think that's the secret sauce of why he could withstand the levels of attacks against him: it's truly a grassroots (由民众自发组织和参与的) thing and system. There's no big money behind it, but there are definitely big money billionaires who funded lots and lots of ads against him. However, people can overcome that if we come together and work on a project. A lot of his success was also attributed to his digital strategy. It's been reported that politicians have already tried to copy it, but not as successfully. What was it about his digital strategy that was so effective?</p>
</details>

珍：嗯，这反映了社区组织模式。他的数字策略师并没有报酬；他们实际上是一个由志愿者组成的创作者集体，自愿参与到竞选活动中。因此，这并非一种交易关系。任何人都可以参与。它可以是我们在纽约市看到的那些非常出色的艺术家、喜剧演员和播客主持人，但它也是普通的日常民众，他们对曼达尼所做或所说的事情进行二次创作。我认为这就是一场充满希望、积极参与并能吸引人们加入的竞选活动的火花。我认为这绝对是了不起的，真的要赞扬那些勇敢决定信任一位竞选公职的人的创作者们。我认为现在人们对政治有很多犬儒主义，我也感同身受。但是，我认为人们对佐兰·曼达尼抱有很大的信心，相信他不会出卖任何人，因为他建立了这场运动，并且长期以来一直是其中的一部分。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jen: Well, it mirrors that of the community organizing model. His digital strategists weren't paid; they were really a collective of creators who volunteered to be part of the campaign. So, this isn't a transactional relationship. It could be anybody – some of the really amazing artists, comedians, and podcasters we see in New York City, but it's also everyday regular people who are remixing things that he's doing or saying. I think that is the spark of a hopeful, engaged campaign that brings people in. I think it is absolutely remarkable, and really kudos to those creators who bravely decided to put their trust in someone running for office. I think there's a lot of cynicism these days about politics, and I share that too. But I think there's a lot of faith that Zohran Mamdani isn't going to sell anybody out because he's built this movement and he's been part of it for so long.</p>

### 独特的寻宝游戏与历史传承

主持人：好的，谈到社区的参与以及他在这方面取得的成功，我们想播放一段视频，我相信我们的观众中，如果他们经常刷社交媒体的话，可能已经看过了。这是他TikTok上的一段视频。我们来看看。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Host: All right, talking about the undertaking of the community, the success that he had with that, we want to play a clip that I'm sure a few people have probably seen – our viewers, if they've been scrolling on their socials. This is a clip from his TikTok. Let's have a look.</p>
</details>

佐兰·曼达尼（TikTok片段中）：大家好，我的朋友们。我必须坦白。我有些事情要隐瞒。事实上是很多事情，因为我们正在进行一场寻宝游戏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zohran Mamdani (from TikTok clip): Hello, my friends. I have to come clean. I have something to hide. Many things, in fact, because we're doing a scavenger hunt.</p>
</details>

主持人：仅仅是像**寻宝游戏**（scavenger hunt: 一种参与者需寻找线索并完成任务的游戏）这样简单的活动吗？它是如何在让人们实地参与、提出问题并记住他方面取得如此成功的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Was it something as simple as a scavenger hunt? How was that so successful in getting people on the ground, asking questions, and thinking of him?</p>
</details>

珍：嗯，这是纽约市民主社会主义者组织和佐兰·曼达尼竞选团队整个网络的一部分。这很有趣；参与其中也很有趣。有爸爸们带着孩子去公园的聚会小组，有跑步俱乐部的人一起跑步，有咖啡馆聚会，人们还在自己的客厅和庭院里举办筹款活动和拉票会议。所以，这个寻宝游戏是一个大型活动，在纽约市各地都设有站点。参与是免费的，成千上万的人前来参加。事实上，他们印制的卡片都用完了。这个寻宝游戏真正关键之处在于——是的，我们在网上看到了它有多有趣，人们分享着他们的参与和对城市的热爱——曼达尼和他的竞选团队带着参与者去了纽约市各地的站点，目的是让他们逐渐适应一位非常进步的社会主义市长的概念。他们参观的地点都是纽约市左翼历史的一部分。这也是我们加拿大可以做的事情。这让我想起了一个道具，一张70年代在萨斯喀彻温省制作的传单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jen: Well, it's part of the whole network of the New York City DSA and Zohran Mamdani's campaign. It was fun; it was fun to be part of. There were meetup groups of dads taking their kids to the parks, running clubs of people going running, coffee shop meetups, and people had fundraisers and canvas meetings in their own living rooms and patios. So, the scavenger hunt was this mega event with stops all over New York City. It was free to participate, and thousands upon thousands of people came out. In fact, they ran out of cards that they had printed. What is really essential about this scavenger hunt – and yes, we saw online how fun it was and people were sharing their participation and love for their city – is that he and his campaign took them to stops all over New York City to acclimatize them to the notion of a very progressive socialist mayor. They were visiting spots that were part of left-wing history in New York City. That's something we could also do in Canada. This reminds me, I have a prop, a flyer from Saskatchewan that was made in the 70s.</p>
</details>

珍：那张传单只是为了提醒萨斯喀彻温省的人们，他们自己的社会主义历史以及他们从何而来。所以，这些活动对于让人们适应这种观念很重要，尤其是在你受到这种程度攻击的时候，即这是可以的、正常的，并且实际上是我们政治遗产的一部分。
主持人：好的，让我们回到国内。我希望我们不必追溯到那么久远的历史，但加拿大有像曼达尼这样的人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jen: That flyer was just about reminding people in Saskatchewan about their own socialist history and where they came from. So, these kinds of activities are important to acclimatize people, especially when you're under this level of attack, to the idea that it's fine, normal, and in fact part of our political heritage. Host: Well, let's bring it back home. I'm hoping we don't have to go that far back into history, but is there someone like Mamdani here in Canada?</p>
</details>

### 加拿大的借鉴与未来领导者的培养

珍：嗯，我相信普通人，我认为我们都有能力成为那1万名志愿者中的一员，参与到政治活动中。他的政策就是这样制定的。人们就是这样建立起这些网络的，我认为这是最重要的事情。由此，我们将在加拿大，或者在我所在的安大略省剑桥市，或者在你所在的埃格林顿-劳伦斯地区（从TVO工作室拍摄）找到下一个佐兰·曼达尼。我们不需要一个寻找特定简历和已有媒体曝光度的人的遴选委员会。佐兰不是通过那种方式发现自己的声音的。他是通过与普通人交谈、挨家挨户地讨论租户问题、工人问题以及在选举中竞选来发现的。这正是他获得自信、能够如此简洁地表达，并制定出冻结租金、全民托儿、免费公交等惊人政纲的原因。这些想法都是在拉票时直接与普通人交谈中产生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jen: Well, I believe in the everyday person, and I think that we all have the ability to be one of those 10,000 people who volunteer to be part of a political movement. That's how his policy was developed. That's how people built these networks, and I think that's the most important thing. From that, we will find the next Zohran Mamdani of Canada, or of where I am in Cambridge, Ontario, or where you are in the Eglinton-Lawrence area, filming from TVO studios. This is how we develop the next Zohran. We don't need a search committee looking for a particular resume and someone who already has media exposure. That's not how Zohran discovered his voice. He discovered it by talking to everyday people, knocking on doors, and talking about tenant issues, worker issues, and campaigning in elections. That's what gained his confidence, his ability to speak so succinctly, and to develop this amazing platform of freezing rents, universal child care, and free buses. These are ideas that came directly out of talking with everyday people when canvassing.</p>
</details>

主持人：珍，这个国家有一些政党正在寻找新的领导人。曼达尼的竞选活动能提供哪些经验教训？
珍：那就是你的志愿者基础——无论是挨家挨户拜访的人，还是建立社区的人，抑或是内容创作者——他们都至关重要。你应该主要与他们合作，并以此为基础发展壮大，因为纽约市民进行的120万次对话，是由1万名志愿者和仅有的两名全职工作人员（他们都是纽约市民主社会主义者组织的一部分）促成的，这最终导致了那场动员。这完全是可能实现的，但我们需要思考如何构建竞选活动，并以真正不同的方式来做。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Host: Jen, there are a few parties in the country that are looking for new leaders. What lessons should be taken from Mamdani's campaign? Jen: That your volunteer base – whether it is people who are knocking on doors, or people who are creating community, or content creators – they matter. You ought to work primarily with them and build up from there, because those 1.2 million conversations that New Yorkers had, generated by 10,000 volunteers and only two full-time staff who were part of the New York City DSA, led to that mobilization. It's entirely possible to do it, but we need to think about how we structure campaigns and do it really differently.</p>
