### 佐兰·曼达尼的崛起

正式消息确认，**民主社会主义者**（Democratic Socialist: 一种主张通过民主手段实现社会主义目标的政治意识形态）佐兰·曼达尼将成为下一任纽约市市长。他的竞选活动激发了进步派和年轻人，其成功令许多旧守派人士震惊。他的胜利以及他竞选的方式，对于北方的政党来说，是否具有任何借鉴意义？我与**布罗德本特研究所**（Broadbent Institute: 一个加拿大进步思想智库）的执行董事珍·哈桑进行了交谈。

<p class="english-text">It's official. Democratic socialist Zoron Mandani will be the next mayor of New York City. His campaign energized progressives and young people, and its success shocked many in the old guard. Does his win and how he ran his campaign hold any lessons for political parties up north? I talked to Jen Hassam, executive director from the Broadbent Institute.</p>

>> 珍，欢迎来到节目。你最近怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Jen, welcome to the program. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

挺好的。非常感谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">pretty good. Thank you so much for having me.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，当然。如果一年前你问我，佐兰·曼达尼是谁？我可能会像大多数人一样告诉你，我不知道，我从未听过这个名字。但现在，突然间，他的名字无处不在，当然，因为他实至名归，赢得了纽约市长竞选。你能回顾一下吗？他是如何开始他的政治生涯的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, of course. Now, if you were to ask me a year ago, uh who who is Zoron Mandani? I would probably tell you like most people, I don't know. I've never heard that name. But now, suddenly, his name is everywhere, of course, because he deserved it. He won the mayoral race in New York. Can you take a step back? How did he get his political start?</p>
</details>

>> 哦，好问题。基本上，在纽约市，有一个**纽约市美国民主社会主义者组织**（New York City Democratic Socialists of America: 一个在美国推动民主社会主义政治议程的组织），他们进行拉票，并组织人群进行**租户组织**（Tenant Organizing: 动员租户集体行动以改善居住条件或维护权益）、**工人组织**（Worker Organizing: 动员工人集体行动以改善工作条件或维护权益）和**选举主义**（Electoralism: 通过参与选举和支持候选人来推动政治变革的策略）。这意味着他们提名候选人参选并支持他们的竞选。佐兰·曼达尼在2017年加入了纽约市美国民主社会主义者组织，以支持一位候选人。他挨家挨户地拜访选民。那位候选人最终落选了。但佐兰非常喜欢这个政治过程，并积极参与其中，人们鼓励他竞选**州议员**（Assemblyman: 美国州议会下院的成员），这相当于我们安大略省的**省议员**（Member of Provincial Parliament: 加拿大安大略省议会的成员）。然后，去年夏天，他再次考虑竞选市长，而这个组织也提名他参选。他的政治生涯就是这样开始的：一个志愿者，希望为社区带来改变，挨家挨户地与人们交谈，然后爱上了这个过程并投身其中。

<p class="english-text">>> Oh, great question. And so um basically in uh in New York City uh there is the New York City DSA so the Democratic Socialists of America and they canvas and have groups of people who do tenant organizing, worker organizing and electoralism. So nominating people to run for office and supporting their campaigns. And Zoran Mdani was someone who in 2017 joined the New York City DSA in order to support a candidate. went door todo. The candidate ultimately lost. Uh but Zoran really liked the political process and got involved and people encouraged him to run as a assemblyman. So, our equivalent of an MPP here in Ontario. And uh and then, you know, once again in um last summer, he thought about running for mayor to be mayor and uh the DSA had a um had run him on the ballot. And that's really how it started was just someone who volunteered to make a difference in their community, go doortodoor, start talking to people, and then just love the process and got involved.</p>

### 竞选策略的影响力

>> 曼达尼的竞选活动有哪些方面产生了如此大的影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What about Mum Donnie's campaign made such an impact?</p>
</details>

>> 哦，这个问题我们从何说起呢？方方面面。对我来说，作为一个组织者，一个在租户、工会和选举过程中有组织经验的人，我觉得有10,000人自愿挨家挨户地拜访选民，接触了120万纽约人，这非常了不起。当你考虑到这一点时，这意味着尽管佐兰·曼达尼是一位社会主义者和穆斯林，并受到主流媒体的猛烈抨击，他仍然能够脱颖而出。他之所以能做到这一点，是因为有一股巨大的**草根**（Grassroots: 指来自民众、基础层面的社会或政治运动）力量，人们愿意与选民进行一对一的对话，讨论真正重要的问题。我认为这就是他能够抵御针对他的各种攻击的秘诀，因为它确实是一个非常非常**草根**的运动和系统。背后没有大笔资金支持，但肯定有亿万富翁投入大量资金资助反对他的广告。然而，如果我们团结起来，共同努力一个项目，人们就能克服这些。现在，他的许多成功也归功于他的数字策略。据报道，已经有政治家试图复制它，但效果不佳。他的数字策略有什么特别之处，使其如此有效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, I mean, where do we go with this question? Everywhere. So much of it. I I think that for me something that was uh impactful as someone who organizes um and has a history of organizing tenants, unions and in electoral the electoral process, I find it remarkable that 10,000 people volunteered in order to go doortodoor. They reached 1.2 million New Yorkers. And so when you think of that, it means that yes, Zor Mamdani is a socialist, is Muslim, and is rising to this occasion despite being hammered by the mainstream media. And he's able to do that because there's this huge ground swell of people who are willing to have one-on-one conversations with people about the issues that really matter. And that's I think the secret sauce of like why it is that he could withstand the levels of attacks that happened against him was because it's really really really a grassroots thing and grassroots system. There's no big money behind it but there's definitely big money billionaires who funded lots and lots of ads against him. Uh but people can overcome that if we come together and and work on a project. Now a lot of his success uh was chocked up to his digital strategy as well. It's been reported that uh there's been already politicians who have tried to copy it not as successful. What was it about his digital strategy that was so effective?</p>
</details>

### 创新的数字与社区策略

>> 嗯，这反映了社区组织模式。他的数字策略师没有报酬。他的数字策略师实际上是一个由创作者组成的集体，他们自愿参与其中，成为竞选活动的一部分。因此，这不是一种交易关系。任何人都可以参与。它可以是我们在纽约市看到的一些非常棒的艺术家、喜剧演员和播客，但它也是普通的日常民众，他们正在重新混编他所做或所说的事情。我认为这就是一场充满希望、积极参与并吸引人们的竞选活动的火花。我认为这绝对是了不起的，真的要赞扬那些勇敢决定信任一位竞选公职的人的创作者们。我认为现在人们对政治有很多犬儒主义，我也感同身受。但是，我认为人们对佐兰·曼达尼抱有很大的信心，相信他不会出卖任何人，因为他建立了这样一个运动，并且长期以来一直是其中的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it mirrors that of the community organizing model. So his digital strategists weren't paid. his digital strategists um were really uh a collective of of creators who volunteered um to be part of it, to be part of the campaign. And so there this isn't a transactional relationship. And it could be anybody. It could be some of like the really amazing artists and comedians and podcasters who we see in New York City. uh but it's also everyday regular people who are remixing things that he's doing or saying and that is I think the spark of a campaign that is hopeful and that is engaged and that takes people in. Um and I I think it is absolutely remarkable and really kudos to those creators who bravely decided to put their trust in someone running for office. I think there's a lot of cynicism these days about politics and I I share that too. Um, but I think that there's a lot of faith that Zor Mamdonni isn't going to sell anybody out because he's built like this movement and he's been part of it for so long.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，谈到社区的努力以及他在这方面取得的成功，我们想播放一段视频，我相信我们的观众中，如果他们一直在刷社交媒体，可能已经看过了。这是他**TikTok**（TikTok: 一款流行的短视频社交应用）上的一个片段。我们来看看。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> All right, talking about the undertaking of the community, the success that he had with that, we want to play a clip that I'm sure a few people have probably seen, our viewers, if they've been scrolling on their socials. This is a clip from his TikTok. Let's have a look.</p>
</details>

>> 大家好，我的朋友们。我必须坦白。我有些东西要藏起来。事实上是很多东西，因为我们正在进行一场**寻宝游戏**（Scavenger Hunt: 一种参与者根据线索寻找物品或地点的游戏）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Hello, my friends. I have to come clean. I have something to hide. many things in fact because we're doing a scavenger hunt.</p>
</details>

>> 仅仅是像寻宝游戏这么简单的事情，它是如何成功地让人们参与进来，提出问题并记住他的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What was it as simple as something as simple as a scavenger hunt? How was that so successful in uh getting people on the grounds and asking questions and and thinking of him?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，这是纽约市美国民主社会主义者组织和佐兰·曼达尼竞选团队整个网络的一部分。这很有趣。参与其中很有趣。而且，有父亲带着孩子去公园的聚会小组，有跑步俱乐部的人一起跑步，还有咖啡馆聚会，人们在自己的客厅和露台上举办筹款活动和拉票会议。所以，这个寻宝游戏是一个大型活动，他们在纽约市各地都设有站点。参与是免费的，成千上万的人前来参加。事实上，他们印制的卡片都用完了。这个寻宝游戏真正关键的地方在于，是的，我们在网上看到了它有多有趣，人们分享他们的参与以及对城市的热爱，但他和他的竞选团队带着他们去了纽约市各地的站点，目的是让人们逐渐适应**进步社会主义市长**（Progressive Socialist Mayor: 具有进步主义和社会主义理念的市长）这个概念。因此，他们参观的地点都是纽约市左翼历史的一部分。这在加拿大也是我们可以做的事情。这让我想起了一个道具，一张上世纪70年代在萨斯喀彻温省制作的传单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's part of the whole network of the New York City DSA and Zorom Donny's campaign. It was fun. It was fun to be part of. And uh there were meetup groups of dads taking their kids to the parks, running clubs of people going running, um coffee shop meetups, people had uh fundraisers and canvas meetings in their own living rooms and patios. And so the scavenger hunt was this mega thing where they had stops all over New York City. It's free to participate pe and thousands upon thousands of people came out. In fact, they ran out of cards that they had printed. And what is really essential about this scavenger hunt and yes we saw online how fun it was and people are sharing their participation and love for their city but they he took them and his campaign took them to stops all over New York City in order to um acclimatize the the notion of a very progressive socialist mayor. And so they were visiting spots that were part of of left history in New York City. And that's something that, you know, we could also do in Canada. And I'm reminded by this, I've got a prop, a flyer in Saskatchewan that was made in the 70s.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大能从曼达尼的经验中学习什么？

>> 嗯，那张传单只是为了提醒萨斯喀彻温省的人们他们自己的社会主义历史以及他们的根源。所以，这些都是，你知道，让人们适应这些概念很重要，尤其是在你受到这种程度攻击的时候，要让他们知道这是可以的，是正常的，实际上是我们政治遗产的一部分。那么，让我们把话题带回国内。我希望我们不必追溯那么久远的历史，但加拿大有像曼达尼这样的人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, that was just about reminding people in Saskatchewan about their own socialist history and where they came from. And so these are, you know, this is important to a climatized people, especially when you're under this kind of level of attack, that it's fine, normal, and in fact part of our political heritage. Well, let's bring it back home. I'm hoping we don't have to go that far back into history, but is there someone like Amdani here in Canada?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我的意思是，这就是我相信普通人的地方，我认为我们每个人都有能力成为那10,000名志愿者中的一员，参与到政治活动中。他的政策就是这样制定的。人们就是这样建立起这些网络的，我认为这是最重要的。从这一点出发，我们将在加拿大，或者在我所在的安大略省剑桥市，或者你在TVO工作室拍摄的埃格林顿-劳伦斯地区，找到下一个佐兰·曼达尼。这就是我们培养下一个佐兰的方式。我们没有一个寻找特定简历和已经有媒体曝光的人的遴选委员会。佐兰不是通过这种方式发现自己的声音的。他是通过与普通民众交谈，挨家挨户地敲门，讨论租户问题、工人问题，以及在选举中竞选来发现的。正是这些经历让他获得了信心，让他能够如此简洁地表达，并制定出冻结租金、全民托儿、免费公交等令人惊叹的政纲。这些想法都是在拉票时直接与普通民众交流中产生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I mean, here's where, you know, I believe in the everyday person, and I think that we all have the ability to be one of those 10,000 people that volunteers in order to be part of a political thing. And that's how his policy was developed. That's how people built these networks and I think that's the most important thing and from that we will find the next Zor mom Donnie of of Canada or of where I am in Cambridge Ontario or where you are in in Egllandon Lawrence area filming from TVO studios. This is how we develop the next Zoron. We don't have a a search committee looking for a particular resume and someone who already has media exposure. That's not how Zoron uh discovered his his voice. He discovered it by talking to everyday people, knocking on the doors and talking about tenants issues, workers issues, and campaigning in elections. And that's what has gained his confidence, his ability to speak so succinctly and to develop this amazing platform of freezing rents, universal child care, free buses. These are ideas that came directly out of talking with everyday people when canvasing.</p>

>> 珍，这个国家有几个政党正在寻找新的领导人。曼达尼的竞选活动应该给他们带来什么教训？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Jen, there are a few parties in the country that are looking for new leaders. What lessons should be taken from mom Donniey's campaign</p>
</details>

>> 你的志愿者基础——无论是挨家挨户拜访选民的人，还是创建社区的人，抑或是内容创作者——他们都非常重要，你应该主要与他们合作，并以此为基础发展。因为纽约人通过10,000名志愿者和仅有的两名全职员工进行了120万次对话。

</details>

>> 这些对话是纽约市美国民主社会主义者组织的一部分，正是这些对话促成了那次动员。这完全是可能实现的，但我们需要思考如何构建竞选活动，并以真正不同的方式进行。
