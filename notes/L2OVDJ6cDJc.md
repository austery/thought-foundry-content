title: "中彩票后的真实人生：金钱、价值观与幸福的博弈"
summary: "作为前英国国家彩票运营商Camelot的理财顾问，演讲者分享了他在十多年间见证的中奖者故事。通过三个截然不同的案例——因嫉妒而痛苦的退休夫妇、沉迷于纯粹消费主义的跑车迷，以及为残障儿子创造最后回忆的年轻夫妇，他揭示了突如其来的财富如何成为人性的试金石。演讲最终指出，真正的奢侈品是时间、健康和人际关系，而我们每个人其实都已经中了“生命的彩票”。"

### 彩票背后的支持系统

**演讲者**: 1994年11月，时任英国首相约翰·梅杰（John Major）购买了第一张启动 **National Lottery**（国家彩票）的彩票。一家名为 **Camelot** 的公司赢得了运营该服务的合同，并且一干就是30年。事实上，直到去年才结束。在那段时间里，Camelot 为超过7000人带来了百万富翁般的财富。我相信你们在电视上见过其中一些人，他们微笑着，开着香槟庆祝。你们可能也在小报上读到过差不多数量的人，他们犯了错，最终破产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: In November 1994, the then-UK Prime Minister John Major bought the very first ticket to launch the National Lottery. A company called Camelot won the contract to run that service, and they did so for 30 years. In fact, until just last year. In that time, Camelot brought millionaire riches to over 7,000 people. You will have seen some of these people, I'm sure, on TV, smiling and popping champagne. You may have read about a similar number of them in the tabloids, making mistakes and going bankrupt.

</details>

**演讲者**: 在幕后，你们可能不知道的是，Camelot 尽了最大努力去支持这些中奖者的一生。他们理解彩票中奖对个人可能产生的真正影响。值得称赞的是，无论发生什么，他们都坚持陪伴并支持这些中奖者。每一位中奖者都会被分配一名来自 Camelot 的指定支持人员，这个人会与他们一起庆祝，也会在事情出错时提供一个可以依靠哭诉的肩膀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Behind the scenes, what you probably don't know, is that Camelot made every effort to support their winners for their entire lifetime. They understood the real impact that a lottery win can have on an individual. To their great credit, they stuck with their winners and supported them whatever happened to them. Every winner was given a named support person from Camelot, someone who would celebrate with them, who would be there to offer a shoulder to cry on when things went wrong.

</details>

**演讲者**: 这个人会亲自把香槟和支票送到中奖者家中。而在中奖两周后，当那种兴奋感消退，也就是他们必然会经历某种程度的心理落差时，这名支持人员会组织一次与外部理财顾问的会议。我有幸在十多年的时间里担任这些理财顾问之一。我目睹了人们瞬间跻身百万富翁的行列，我认为今天在座的各位都能从我遇到的中奖者身上学到一些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The person who actually physically brought the bottle of champagne and the check to the home. And in what must have been somewhat of a comedown for them, a fortnight after the win, would organize a meeting with an external money adviser. I had the extraordinary privilege for over a decade to be one of those money advisers. I saw people transported to millionaire riches in an instant, and I think that everyone here today can learn something from the winners that I met.

### 突如其来的财富实验

**演讲者**: 这听起来可能有点残酷，但在很多方面，彩票就像是一个实验室实验，测试我们作为人类如何应对突如其来的财富。如果你以一百万英镑卖掉一家企业，或者你继承了一百万英镑，你在一定程度上知道会发生什么。你可能提前几年就看到了这笔钱的到来，并且有时间去计划和适应这笔钱将如何影响你的生活。根据定义，彩票中奖者在号码被抽出的那一刻之前是一无所知的。他们瞬间从原本的任何处境被弹射到了百万富翁的地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: It may seem like quite a cruel way to view it, but the lottery is in many ways like a laboratory experiment in how we, as humans, react to the acquisition of sudden wealth. If you sell a business for a million pounds, or you inherit a million pounds, you know, to an extent, what to expect. You will have seen the money coming, probably years in advance, and you will have had time to plan for and adapt to how that money is going to impact on your life. By definition, a lottery winner knows nothing until the moment their numbers are drawn. They are catapulted from whatever their situation is into being millionaires in an instant.

</details>

**演讲者**: 英国三分之二的成年人每年至少买一次彩票。那是超过3600万人。没有什么其他事情能以这种规模将我们团结在一起。也许体育可以，也许政治还行，我不确定。所以我们这样做一定是因为我们想赢，对吧？因为我们认为那笔钱会让我们的生活变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Two thirds of adults in the UK play the lottery at least once a year. That's over 36 million of us. Nothing else really unites us in those kind of numbers. Possibly sport, maybe politics, still, I don't know. So we must be doing it because we want to win, right? Because we think that that money is going to change our lives for the better.

</details>

### 案例一：失衡的预算

**演讲者**: 好吧，让我带你们回到几年前。那是一个炎热的夏日，我坐在一间空调坏了的办公室里。我很不明智地选择了一套深色西装，我能感觉到汗水开始顺着我紧绷的衬衫领子流下来。坐在我对面的是我见过的最痛苦的人。（笑声）这个人刚刚中了彩票。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Well, let me take you back several years. It's a boiling hot summer's day, and I'm sat in an office with broken air conditioning. I have very unwisely chosen to wear a dark suit, and I can feel sweat starting to run down my tight shirt collar. Sat opposite me is the most miserable man I have ever met. (Laughter) This man has just won the lottery. (Laughter)

</details>

**演讲者**: 两周前，他还是一个快乐满足的人。他和妻子原本打算很快退休，他们的养老金足以支付开销。他们与住在附近的成年子女关系融洽，还有一个很棒的朋友圈。他们生活在一个让他们有归属感并感到受重视的当地社区里。他们为建立简单但幸福的生活辛勤工作了一辈子。在这种背景下，注入一笔彩票奖金造成的伤害比好处更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Two weeks ago, he was a happy and contented man. He and his wife were due to retire quite soon and their pensions were ready to cover their outgoings. They had a good relationship with their adult children who lived nearby, and a great network of friends. They lived in a local community that they felt a part of and felt valued by. They'd worked hard for an entire lifetime to build a simple but happy life. Into that context, the injection of a lottery win was causing more harm than it was good.

</details>

**演讲者**: 就像有时会发生的那样，中奖的消息在当地传开了。友谊开始因为嫉妒而变质。家庭成员突然从不知什么地方冒出来，声称有权分享奖金，在某些情况下，甚至向他们索要钱财。在中奖和号码出现的最初那种欣喜若狂的感觉过去两周后，这个人意识到这将改变生活，只是不是以他预期的方式。事实上，当我见到他时，他和妻子已经在计划搬到国家的另一个地方去了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: The win, as it sometimes happens, had become known locally. Friendships had started to sour through jealousy. Family members were popping out of the woodwork and claiming an entitlement to a share in the win, and in some cases, demanding of them some of the money. Two weeks after that initial euphoric feeling of winning and having your numbers come up, this man was realizing that it was going to be life-changing, just not in the way he'd anticipated. In fact, by the time I got to have the meeting with him, he and his wife were already planning a move to a different part of the country.

</details>

**演讲者**: 你看，我们所有人在开始生活时都有两个预算要花：我们剩下的时间，以及我们要沿途积累的金钱。如果你像我一样，大多数人开始生活时，时间预算很多，而金钱预算很少。我们会开始花费时间去获取——除其他事物外——那些金钱。在某个时刻，我们可能会达到生活中感觉财务稍微舒适一点的阶段，但这通常伴随着一种感觉，即时间预算开始缩水了。这当然会引发那种典型的中年或晚年危机。你看，对于我们的第一位中奖者来说，他原本平衡得很好，然后命运的手指按在了天平的金钱一侧，让他的一切都失去了平衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: You see, all of us have two budgets to spend when we start in life. The time that we have left and the money that we're going to accumulate along the way. Most of us, if you're like me, you start life with lots in the time budget and not very much in the money budget. And we will start spending time acquiring, amongst other things, some of that money. At some point, we probably reach a point in life where we feel a little bit more financially comfortable, but that often coincides with a sense that maybe the time budget is starting to shrink. That, of course, can trigger that classic mid- or later-life crisis. You see, for our first winner, he had the balance right, and then the finger of fate pressed down on the money side of the scales and unbalanced everything for him.

</details>

### 案例二：纯粹的消费主义

**演讲者**: 相比之下，我们的第二位中奖者在我第一次见到他时简直欣喜若狂。他不想听关于中奖潜在陷阱的事情。他不想听我那些——在我看来——非常聪明的规划策略，（笑声）以及这笔奖金如何能支持他的余生。他对自已想要什么有着极其清晰的认知。那就是一辆昂贵的车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Our second winner, by complete contrast, was absolutely over the moon when I met him for the first time. He did not want to hear about the potential pitfalls of a win. He didn't want to hear about my, in my opinion, very clever planning strategies, (Laughter) all the ways in which the win could support him for the rest of his lifetime. He was beautifully clear-eyed about what he wanted. And that was an expensive car.

</details>

**演讲者**: 刚见面时他让我大吃一惊，因为他很早就承认他没有驾照。（笑声）事实证明，他也没有任何考驾照的计划。（笑声）通常彩票中奖者平均会用奖金买五辆车，但那通常是为了分给家庭成员。这位中奖者计划将他大部分的奖金花在给自己买的一辆车上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: He threw me at first when I met him, because he confessed very early on that he didn't have a driving license. (Laughter) Nor had he, it turned out, Any plan to get one. (Laughter) Now lottery winners will, on average, buy five cars with their win, but typically that's to share amongst family members. This winner was planning on spending the majority of his entire win on a single car for himself.

</details>

**演讲者**: 就像几百年前我们会对待我们的驴和牛一样，他甚至计划盖一座新房子，这样他就可以住在他新车上方的房间里。（笑声）他甚至在地板上设计了一个窗户，这样他就可以坐在床上盯着那辆车看。（笑声）这是一个纯粹消费主义的案例，拥有一件物品仅仅是为了获得那种拥有的温暖光芒，而不是为了用它做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Much as we would have done with our donkeys and our cattle hundreds of years ago, he was even planning to build a new house so that he could live in a room above his new car. (Laughter) He'd even factored in a window in his floor, so he could sit up in bed and stare at the car. (Laughter) It was a case of the purest consumerism, owning an object simply to get that warm glow of the ownership, not to do anything with it.

</details>

**演讲者**: 表面上看，他把奖金花在能让他快乐的事情上并没有错。毕竟，这是他的奖金。但所有的研究都告诉我们，我们从获取物品中获得的内啡肽激增是短暂的。它不会一直伴随着我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with him spending his win on something that's going to make him happy. It is, after all, his win. But all the research tells us that the endorphin rush we get from the acquisition of an object is fleeting. It is not something that hangs around for us.

</details>

### 案例三：最好的投资

**演讲者**: 所以，我们今天的最后一位中奖者是多年来让我印象最深刻的一位。他们是一对年轻夫妇，在中奖时，两人都全职工作以养活他们年轻的家庭。他们不想把钱花在豪车上，而是计划把一半的奖金花在房子上，然后辞去工作，靠另一半奖金生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: So our last winner for today is the one that has stuck with me the most vividly over the years. They were a young couple who worked full time, both of them, to support their young family when the win came along. They didn't want to spend it on an exotic car, but actually planned to spend half of the win on their home and they gave up their jobs and lived on the other half.

</details>

**演讲者**: 十八个月后，嗯，他们花光了所有的财富。他们不得不回到工作岗位，回到中奖前的旧生活。但实际上，这并不是一个警世故事。在这个案例中，我没有告诉你们的是，他们有一个患有严重残疾的年幼儿子，需要全天候的照顾。房屋改造并不是为了安装室内游泳池或镀金水龙头，而是为了改造房子的底层，以便他们的儿子能生活得更舒适。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Eighteen months later, well, they had blown through the entire fortune. They had to return to their jobs and their old lives pre-win. But actually, this one isn't a cautionary tale. In this case, what I haven't told you is they had a young son who was severely disabled and needed round-the-clock care. The home improvements weren't for the installation of an indoor swimming pool or gold-plated taps, but rather adaptations to the ground floor of their house so their son could live more comfortably.

</details>

**演讲者**: 他们看清了彩票中奖的本质：这是一个四千五百万分之一的机会，让他们能作为一个家庭去生活。是的，十八个月后，钱没了，但他们的儿子也走了。他们用那笔财富换取了一生的回忆。在我作为理财规划师的25年里，这仍然是我见过的任何人做出的最好的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They saw their lottery win for what it truly was, a one-in-45-million chance to live life as a family. Yes, 18 months later, the money was gone, but so was their son. They traded in that fortune for a lifetime of memories. In my 25 years as a financial planner, this remains the best investment I've ever seen anyone make.

</details>

### 真正的奢侈品

**演讲者**: 希望正如我们所看到的，中彩票并不是通往某种乌托邦的门票。它更多的是对我们现有价值观的一种考验。所以，如果我们要从这些中奖者身上学到什么，我们需要审视我们是如何过自己的生活的。你是如何花费你的时间和金钱预算的？你是否在获取生活中真正的奢侈品？与他人共度的优质时间、健康、睡眠以及无愧疚感的放松？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Hopefully, as we've seen, winning the lottery is not a ticket to some kind of utopia. It's more of a test of our existing values. So if we're to learn anything from these winners, we need to examine how we're living our own lives. How are you spending your time and your money budgets? Are you acquiring life's real luxuries? Quality time with other people, health, sleep and guilt-free relaxation?

</details>

**演讲者**: 好消息是，无论你是否有这种感觉，事实上你有时间和资源今天坐在这里，聆听这些精彩的 TEDx 演讲者的演讲，意味着你已经中了全球彩票。事实上，我们在座的所有人都已经中了人生的彩票。所以，我只需祝愿大家在花费和投资这些奖金时一切顺利。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Now the good news is, whether you feel like it or not, the fact that you have the time and resources to be here today, listening to these wonderful TEDx speakers, means that you've already won the global lottery. All of us here have, in fact, won the lottery of life already. And so it just remains for me to wish you all the very best in how you spend and invest those winnings. Thank you. (Applause)
