### 女性健康数据鸿沟

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您正在收听《**Mistreated**》。我是**Nam Kiwanuka**。对于超过1300种不同的疾病，女性的平均诊断时间比男性晚2到4年。这些疾病包括抑郁症、焦虑症和**阿尔茨海默病**，后者对女性的影响尤为严重。根据**成瘾与精神健康中心**（**CAMH**）的数据，尽管女性被诊断出**抑郁症**的可能性是男性的两倍，但女性的症状被认为是“非典型”的，而男性的症状则被认为是“典型”的。但诊断延迟并非只发生在精神健康领域。2019年的一项丹麦研究发现，女性平均比男性晚2.5年才被诊断出**癌症**，而像**糖尿病**这样的代谢疾病则晚了4.5年。这是因为我们大部分的医学知识、临床试验、研究，包括如何诊断一个人，主要基于男性的症状或经历。这种健康数据鸿沟意味着女性不仅需要花费更多时间等待所需的治疗或被延迟诊断，她们还花费更多时间被误诊或未被诊断。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You're listening to **Mistreated**. I'm **Nam Kiwanuka**. For over 1300 different disorders, women are diagnosed on average 2 to four years later than men. These disorders include conditions like **depression** and **anxiety** and **Alzheimer's disease**, which disproportionately impacts women. According to **CAMH**, the **Center for Addiction and Mental Health**, even though women are twice more likely to be diagnosed with depression, symptoms in women are considered atypical, whereas in men, the symptoms are typical. But it's not just mental health conditions where a late diagnosis happens. A 2019 Danish study found that on average, women received **cancer** diagnoses 2.5 years after men. They received diagnoses for metabolic diseases like **diabetes** 4.5 years later. That's because most of our medical knowledge, clinical trials, research, and including how to diagnose someone is based mostly on symptoms from males or the experiences of men. This health data gap means that women not only spend more time waiting to get the treatment they need or are diagnosed late, but they also spend more time being misdiagnosed or undiagnosed.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 女性在五种疾病中也存在诊断不足的情况：**心脏病发作**、**子宫内膜异位症**、**自闭症**、**多动症**和**自身免疫性疾病**。根据**gabi.org**（疫苗联盟）的数据，女性健康差距每年导致7500万年的生命因健康状况不佳或过早死亡而损失。弥补这一差距将使全球39亿女性每年多获得七天健康生活，或一生平均多出500天。这就是为什么研究健康中的性和性别差异至关重要。这个领域的主要研究人员之一是世界著名的神经科学家**Lisa Galia博士**，她来自**CAMH**。**Galia博士**的研究对于填补这一知识空白至关重要，它有助于理解激素如何影响女性大脑，尤其是在怀孕和产后期间。因为女性健康在研究中常常被忽视。我们将讨论为什么到60岁时，女性被诊断出**阿尔茨海默病**的可能性是**乳腺癌**的两倍，为什么医生正在从使用**HRT**（激素替代疗法）转向**MHT**（更年期激素疗法），以及为什么我们对女性大脑健康知之甚少。她还将帮助我们理解一些近期新闻头条，包括**FDA**取消**MHT**的黑框警告，以及更年期是否与**阿尔茨海默病**有关。我学到了很多，希望您也一样。**Galia博士**现在加入我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Women also go underdiagnosed in five conditions: **heart attacks**, **endometriosis**, **autism**, **ADHD**, and **autoimmune diseases**. According to **gabi.org**, or the vaccine alliance. The women's health gap equates to 75 million years of life lost due to poor health or early death each year. Closing the gap would give the 3.9 billion women in the world today an extra seven healthy days a year or an average of 500 days over a lifetime. This is why researching sex and gender differences in health matters. One of the leading researchers in this space is worldrenowned neuroscientist **Dr. Lisa Galia** from **CAMH**. **Dr. Galia's** research is vital in filling this knowledge gap in understanding how hormones influence the female brain, especially during pregnancy and postpartum. As too often, women's health is ignored in research. We talk about why by age 60, women are twice as more likely to be diagnosed with **Alzheimer's** than with **breast cancer**, why physicians are moving away from using the name **HRT** to **MHT**, and why we don't know more about women's brain health. She also helps us to understand some recent news headlines, including the **FDA** removing the black box from **MHT** and if menopause is linked to **Alzheimer's**. I learned so much. I hope you do, too. **Dr. Galia** joins me now.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我叫**Lisa Galia**。我拥有神经科学博士学位。我是**Trey Living**家族女性精神健康主席，任职于加拿大安大略省多伦多的**成瘾与精神健康中心**。我还是**多伦多大学**精神病学教授。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: My name is **Lisa Galia**. I hold a PhD in neuroscience. I am the **Trey Living family chair in women's mental health** at the **Center for Addiction and Mental Health** here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. And I'm also professor of psychiatry at the **University of Toronto**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您的资历令人惊叹。我想和您谈谈您在**Galia Lab**所做的工作。但首先，我想请您帮助我们理解一件事。当我们谈论女性大脑健康时，性和性别之间有什么区别？因为这是您研究的领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Your credentials are mindblowing. I want to talk to you about the work that you do with the **Galia Lab**. But first I wanted you to help us understand something first. When we talk about women's brain health, what is the difference between sex and gender? Because this is something that you study.

</details>

### 性别与社会性别差异

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。性通常指的是男性、女性和双性个体之间可能存在的生物学特征差异。而性别则是一种社会心理建构，它超越了性别认同，即你是否认同自己是女性、非二元性别、性别多元或男性。它还包括社会期望你如何行事，以及基于你的性别认同，你在社会中的角色是什么。这涵盖了社会生活的各个层面，从家庭生活、教育到购物或就业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. I mean, okay. So, sex usually people will refer to that as the sort of biological characteristics that may differ between males, females, and interex individuals. Gender is a psychosocial construct. So, it goes beyond gender identity. That's whether you identify as a woman, non-binary, gender diverse, or man. But also how society expects you to act and what your roles in society are based on your gender identity and that's society from every level home life which we were just talking about education as well as just going to the mall or your employment.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 很高兴您帮助我们理解了这一点。但为什么区分两者很重要呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, I'm glad you helped us understand that. But why is it important to draw that distinction that there is a difference?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 好的，这对于很多事情都很重要，我也想把注意力重新引回到女性本身。我们正在共同努力理解性和性别之间的任何差异或影响。举个例子，你可能会发现女性的胆固醇比男性高（我只是举例，不是说这是事实），但你可能也会发现，用于降低胆固醇的**他汀类药物**在男性中比在女性中更容易被开处方。那么，这是性别差异吗？是生物学差异导致了胆固醇的这种差异吗？还是因为女性没有被开具降胆固醇药物，因为她们被认为不需要？你知道，可能就是这么简单的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Okay, so for many things, and I want to also try to draw back the attention to women themselves. So there is a concerted effort to understand any kind of difference or influence between sex and gender. So for example, you might see that cholesterol is higher in women than in men. Like I'm just giving this example. I'm not saying that this is true. But then you might also see that **statins** which are prescribed to lower cholesterol are more likely to be prescribed in men compared to women. So is that a sex difference? Is that a biological difference that's driving this difference in cholesterol? Or is it because women are not prescribed the cholesterol-lowering medications because they thought they're thought not to need them? You know, maybe it could be something like that as simple as that.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 甚至是被转介给专科医生。我们知道女性被转介给膝关节和关节专科医生的频率不如男性。这是一种性别差异，因为她们有同样多的损伤和手术需求，但她们不常被转介。但这基本上是我们的社会结论或看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Or even being referred to specialists. We know that women are tend not to be referred to like knee specialists and joint specialists as much as men are. And that would be a gendered difference because they have just as many injuries and need for the surgeries, but they don't get referred as often. But it's basically I guess what are societal conclusions or perceptions.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，是看法，对吧？这完全取决于你的看法，以及社会期望你如何表现，或者因为你的性别。所以它不是由生物学驱动的，而是由社会驱动的。我想强调的是，对我来说，这有点像先天与后天之争。你可能听说过这种争论，比如在抚养孩子方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah, it's perceptions, right? It's all about your perception and what should be expected of you or because of your gender. So it's not it's not driven by biology, but it's driven by society. And I'll just to sort of underscore this to me, it's kind it's kind of like nature versus nurture. And you've probably heard that argument as a nature versus nurture in terms of maybe bringing up children or something like that.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 几乎总是两者兼而有之。对于任何存在的性别影响或社会性别影响，这都将是事实。它很可能是生物学和社会期望的混合。但我觉得被忽视的另一点是，例如，**加拿大政府**已做出协同努力，确保科学家们普遍将性和性别作为我们健康方程式的一部分。这被称为**SGBA**，即基于性和性别的分析。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Almost always it's a bit of both. And that's going to be true for any kind of sex influence or gender influence that's seen out there. It's probably going to be a mix of both biology and the social societal expectations. But the other thing that I think gets lost in this and the government of **Canada** for example has made a concerted effort to ensure that scientists in general will be looking at sex and gender as part of the equation for our health. It's called **SGBA** or sex and gender based analysis.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 即使在政府文件中，人们也会看到，如果你上网查，**GBA**就是性别分析。问题是，对于女性健康，我们仍然会迷失其中。如果我们总是不断地与男性或雄性进行比较，就好像我们有一个被比较的“规范”，而女性并非只有一种情况。性别多元化的人也并非只有一种情况。那么，我们是在谈论一个使用**激素避孕药**的人，一个怀孕两次或三次或从未怀孕的人，一个有子宫的人，一个没有子宫的人吗？所有这些都会影响我们的健康结果和疾病风险，研究这些很重要。所以我之所以如此关注性和性别，同时我也特别关注女性健康，是因为我坚信女性所经历的独特经历和激素转变，本身就值得深入研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And even in government documents people would see if you look online **GBA** which is gender based analysis. The thing is for women's health, we're still going to get lost in this. If if we don't if we're always constantly being compared to men or males, it's like we have this norm that we're being compared to, whereas women are not just one are not one thing. Gender diverse people are not just one thing. And so are, you know, are we talking about a person who's on **hormonal contraceptives**, a person who's had two pregnancies or three pregnancies or no pregnancies, who has a uterus, who doesn't have a uterus, all of these things will influence our health outcomes and disease risk, and it's important to study. So why I have such a focus I do have a focus on sex and gender but I also have a focus on women's health specifically and that's because I truly believe that the unique experiences and hormonal transitions that women go through are important to study on their own.

### 临床试验中的女性缺失

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 让我们多谈谈这一点，因为，回溯一点，直到1993年，美国才将女性和所谓的少数族裔纳入临床试验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Let's talk more about that because to go back a little bit women weren't included in in clinical trials women and so-called minorities until 1993 in the US.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 加拿大是1997年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And 97 in Canada.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，而且在整个...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes. And throughout...

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 这不太准确，我能澄清一下吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It's not quite accurate. Can I...?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 不准确，请您澄清。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's not. Yes, please clear it up.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我能澄清一下吗？人们经常引用这个说法。他们是被纳入了，但他们是强制要求纳入女性的，而且这是强制性的。是的，女性和所谓的少数族裔，正如你所说，是在1993年。那只适用于**NIH**资助的试验。**NIH**代表**美国国立卫生研究院**。是的，在美国，那只占全球临床试验的15%。是的。所以，实际情况比人们知道的还要糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Can I clear that up? People will often quote that. They were included not but they they made it mandatory to include women and it was mandated. Yeah. Women and so-called minorities as you say in 1993. That's only for **NIH** funded trials. So **NIH** stands for **National Institutes of Health**. Yeah. In the US, that's 15% of clinical trials in the world. It's Yeah. So, it's actually worse than people actually know.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么，全球范围内的女性临床试验情况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Give us an idea. What's it like around the world? Are women included in clinical trials?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 这是一个很好的问题，我不知道答案。我应该知道**欧盟**和**澳大利亚**的数据，但我不知道。我认为至少在**澳大利亚**，强制要求纳入女性是相当新的规定。但我不确定所有相关细节。然而，即使在加拿大和美国有强制规定，情况是会有一些纳入，但比例会失衡。比如说，20个人中，只有2名女性和18名男性。这样很难得出任何结论。不仅如此，他们也没有进行我们所说的“按性别分列”的数据分析。所以，我们实际上看不到基于女性或男性，或非二元性别，或不同种族背景的结果。我们看不到数据以这种方式传播。所以我们无从得知。研究人员也没有去查看是否存在差异。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So, here's it is not that's a really good question. I don't know the answer to it. I I should know the **EU** data and the **Australian** data. I don't. I think it's fairly new that it started to be mandated at least in Australia. But I'm I I I'm not sure of all of the details around that. But what even with the mandates in Canada and in the US, what's happened is there'll be some inclusion, but there'll be disproportionate. So say you know, of 20 people, two will be women and 18 will be men. So it's hard to draw any conclusions. But not just that, they're not what we call sex disegregated. So, we don't actually see the results based on, you know, females or males or women or non-binary or or with ethnicity as a background. We we don't see them disseminated that way. So, we have no way of knowing. And the researchers didn't look to see if there was a difference.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以我们仍然把男性身体视为“典型”，女性身体视为“非典型”？这样说公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, we're still kind of treating the male body as the typical and the female body as atypical. Is that fair to say?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 这样说有点公平。更多的是一种“不可知论”的态度。就好像人们会说，“是的，我们会把每个人都包括进来，但我们不会去看看这是否会产生任何影响。”所以对我来说，这同样糟糕，因为我们没有去探究这是否有影响。当我们真正去探究时，几乎总是会发现它对研究结果有影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It's somewhat fair to say. It's more about like agnostic. It's almost like people are yes, we'll include everyone, but we're not going to look to see if it makes a any has an effect. So, for me, that's just as bad because we're not we're not looking to see if this has an influence or not. And when we do look, almost always you will see that it has an influence on the findings.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 告诉我们更多关于这方面的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Tell us more about that.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 嗯，我有很多不同的方式可以解释，但我正在努力想一些好的例子。**Ambien**可能是很多人都知道的例子，那是**食品药品监督管理局**（**FDA**）首次，而且那也没多久，抱歉，我不记得具体时间了，大概在2000年代末。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Uh, well, there's so many different ways that I could explain that, but I'm trying to think of some good examples. **Ambien** was is probably the one that a lot of people will know about and that was from the food and drug association that for the first time ever and that was not that long ago. I'm sorry, I don't remember. It's some in the late 2000s.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 大概2014年左右。2019年显然不是。总之，那很近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um like 2014, something like that. 2019, obviously not. Anyway, um it's recent.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，那是相当近的事情。他们首次没有说需要使用不同的药物，而是说需要使用不同的剂量。我想我们，你知道，你只需要坐下来思考一下。我们的药瓶上，无论是**对乙酰氨基酚**，比如**泰诺**或**布洛芬**，它都说成年人服用一到两片。它没有说如果你是男性或女性，甚至根据你的体重，应该服用多少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It's recent. It's fairly recent. Where they for the very first time ever, they didn't say that a different drug needed to be used, but that a different dose needed to be used. And I think we, you know, you just have to sit back and think about this for a minute on our pill bottles, like whether it's first **acetaminophen** like **Tylenol** or **Advil**. It doesn't it says take one or two pills if you're an adult. It doesn't say take a certain amount if you're a man or a woman or even how much you weigh.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 对吧？体重对药物在体内发挥作用有很大影响。当然，男性和女性的体重不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Right? Weight weight has a big impact on how a drug is going to work in our body. And of course, men and women weigh differently.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 正如您可能非常清楚的，有很多治疗**勃起功能障碍**的药物。据我所知，只有一种治疗女性性欲低下的药物。这只是指性兴趣。我认为它叫**Addyi**之类的。**食品药品监督管理局**要求这家制药公司确保该药物与酒精之间不会有任何不良相互作用，因为他们可能认为服用这种治疗女性性欲低下药物的人也可能同时饮酒。所以他们在20个人身上进行了测试。这20个人中，有多少是女性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: As you probably are very well aware, there are many drugs for erectile dysfunction. There's one there's only one as far as I know for female libido which just means sexual interest libido. And I think it's something called **Addyi** something like that and the food and drug administration asked the drug company to and ensure that the interaction with alcohol there wasn't going to be any adverse interactions with alcohol because maybe they assume that people might be taking this drug for female libido also with alcohol. And so they tested it on 20 people. And of those 20 people, how many were female or women?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 不是全部。我本以为是全部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Not all. I would assume all.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，你本以为是全部。而且应该全部是。结果是12个人中有2个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah, you would assume all. And it should be all. It was two out of the 12.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，情况越来越糟。所以我们在2009年和2019年进行了一项大型研究，考察了超过3000项研究，间隔10年，涵盖了六种不同的医学期刊，主要针对神经科学和精神病学领域。当我们审视这些研究时，发现很多研究都增加了其研究中使用的男性和女性的百分比，无论是临床研究、临床前研究还是试验。所以，我认为从大约30%的研究关注男性和女性，增加到了68%。但是，只有5%的研究去探究这是否会产生差异，而且我认为大约14%的研究使用了我刚才提到的这种不均匀的样本量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. I mean, it gets worse and worse. So we we did a huge study where we looked at over 3,000 studies in 2009 and then in 2019. So a 10-year gap across six different medical journals. This is for neuroscience and psychiatry. And when we looked at it, lots of studies had increased the percentage of males and females that they used in their studies whether it was clinical studies or pre-clinical studies or trials or not no trials. So I think it went from say 30% to 68% of studies were looking at males and females. But only 5% were looking to see if it made a difference and I I think it was something like 14% were using these uneven sample sizes that I just told you about this like.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 年轻人会说，“说得通啊！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: The young people would say make it make sense.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 说得通啊！对我来说也说不通。然后当我们看，他们是否在研究男性特有的研究和问题，或者女性特有的问题，比如女性健康方面的问题，只有3%是关于女性健康的问题，而27%是只针对男性或男性的研究。这就像，抱歉。不，但这就像，这太令人沮丧了，因为我想当我年轻的时候，你不会真正考虑所有这些事情，因为你很健康。你认为事情理所当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Make it make sense. I mean it doesn't make sense to me either and then when we looked at are you looking at are they looking at male specific studies and questions or female specific questions like women's health kinds of questions there's only 3% for women's health kinds of questions and 27% for male only or men only studies. Hm. This is like sorry. No, but it it is like you it's it's so frustrating because I think when I was younger when you're you don't really think about all of these things because you're you're healthy. You're you assume things.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但一旦你到了，至少对我来说，是在我生了第一个孩子之后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But once you hit for me anyway it was when I had my first baby.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那时我就觉得，这不对劲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: That's when I was like oh this is not you know.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 然后...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And then.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我能问你一个问题吗？你是在怀孕期间还是生完孩子之后才注意到这些的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Can I ask you a question about that? Did you notice it while you were pregnant or after you had your baby?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 怀孕期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: During the pregnancy.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 甚至在怀孕期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Even during the pregnancy.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，更多是在之后，比如剖腹产之后。孩子一抱走，就好像，“你自己看着办吧，姐妹。”就好像，“我还在呢。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, more after, like after cuz I had an emergency C-section and as soon as the baby was taken away, it was like, you're on your own, sister. It was just like, I'm still here.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我知道。我当时也是这种感觉。我当时觉得，我怀孕的时候受到了这么多关注。然后孩子一出生，我是说，孩子们很可爱，我理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: I know. That's how I felt, too. I was like, there's so much attention to me when I was pregnant. And then as soon as the baby was, I mean, the babies are cute. Like, I get it.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但是，随着年龄增长，我越来越关注我的大脑健康。是的。我真的很担心我的晚年。我一直听到人们说你应该做这个，你应该做那个。很多事情我希望我年轻的时候就知道。所以，当我们谈论大脑健康时，您能告诉我们您在**Galia Lab**所做的工作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But I'm thinking as I get older, I'm thinking more about my brain health. Yeah. Um, and I'm really worried about my later years. And I keep hearing people saying you should do this, you should do that. A lot of things that I wish I had known when I was younger. So when we talk about brain health, can you tell us about the work that you're doing with the **Galia lab**?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我们有多少时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: How much time do we have?

</details>

### 大脑健康与激素影响

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我当然可以。我喜欢研究性和性别差异，我最感兴趣的两种疾病是**抑郁症**和**阿尔茨海默病**。所以我研究与压力相关的精神疾病，如**抑郁症**，以及晚年出现的神经退行性疾病，如**阿尔茨海默病**。我为什么选择这些疾病呢？我也研究大脑健康，但原因有二：第一，患这两种疾病的女性多于男性；第二，我是一名神经科学家，这意味着我热爱研究大脑，而我最喜欢的大脑区域叫做**海马体**。我可以告诉你所有关于**海马体**的事情。我们研究它所有有趣的地方。它里面有很多激素受体。所以我对激素，特别是性激素，如**睾酮**和**雌激素**，以及应激激素，如何影响大脑和大脑健康很感兴趣。那里有很多这类受体，这意味着它会影响那个特定的大脑区域，而且它非常具有可塑性，它是这两种疾病首次表现出功能障碍的大脑区域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So I I absolutely can. What I love studying is how sex and sex differences, gender differences in the two disorders that I'm really most interested in are depression and **Alzheimer's disease**. So I look at stress related psychiatric disorders like depression as well as neurogenerative disorders like **Alzheimer's disease** later on in life. And why did I pick those diseases? I also look at brain health too but because two things one more women than men suffer from both of those disorders and then my very I'm a neuroscientist which just means I love studying the brain and my very favorite brain area is called the **hippocampus**. I can tell you all about the **hippocampus**. And we study all the fun things about it. It has a lot of these hormone receptors in it. So I'm interested in how hormones particularly sex hormones like **testosterone** but **estrogens** but also stress hormones how they impact the brain and brain health and there are a lot of these kinds of receptors there which means that it's it's going to influence that particular brain area and it's very plastic and it's the first brain area that shows disruption with both of those types of disorders.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 这就是，我们还研究女性一生中许多激素的转变。所以我们研究青春期，我们研究月经周期或发情周期（这方面的研究不多），但也研究怀孕如何影响大脑，包括短期和长期影响，以及更年期如何影响大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So that's and and we also look at a lot of the hormonal transitions in a female's lifespan. So we look at adolescence, we look at men menstrual cycles or estroycles, not as much work in that area, but also how pregnancy affects the brain both in the short term but also in the long term and how menopause impacts the brain as well.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么，激素以何种方式影响我们的大脑呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, in what ways do hormones impact our brains?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 再次，有很多方式。所以，我思考的方式是，无论在生命周期的哪个阶段，激素转变都是一个转折点，这对于男性和性别多元化个体也是如此。更年期就是一个关于衰老的转折点。月经周期，或者如果你是啮齿动物，发情周期，将是你当前健康和未来健康的转折点。我甚至听说有人说，你的月经周期是一个生命体征，然后人们有时会说“period”，我觉得这很可爱。我说“period”，我知道这很棒。不，不，这很棒。怀孕和产后也是如此。怀孕实际上被称为身体的第一次压力测试。所以，如果你在怀孕期间更容易患上与怀孕相关的疾病，比如**子痫前期**或**高血压**，那么你在晚年患**心脏病**的风险会更高。我希望这不会吓到大家。它的目的是说，嘿，这不是一个警钟，而是我需要更多地关注这一点，而且它不会停止。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It's again so many ways. So for I the way I think about it is hormonal transitions no matter where they are across our lifespan and this is going to be true for men and and gender diverse individuals as well have an inflection they're an inflection point and so menopause for example would be an inflection point for aging. Menstrual cycles or estrocycles if you're a rodent are going to be an inflection point for your your current health but also your future health. I've I've even heard people say your menstrual cycle is a vital sign and then people will sometimes say period which I think is kind of cute. I say period I know it's great. No, no, it's great. And and even same thing with pregnancy and the postpartum. So pregnancy is actually known as the first stress test for the body. So if you are more likely to have a pregnancy related disorder like **preeclampsia** or **hypertension** during pregnancy you you are at greater risk for heart disease later on in life and that I hope that doesn't scare people. What it's meant to do is say hey this is a not not necessarily a wakeup call but like I need to pay attention to this a little bit more and it's not going to stop.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我认为这赋予了人们力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I think it's empowering people.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 它应该赋予人们力量。是的，没错。我希望现在人们能获得这些信息，这样如果他们确实患有这些妊娠期疾病，他们就能意识到后期的潜在影响。我认为部分挫败感在于女性健康方面的研究不足，所以对于很多这些疾病，如果你了解它，你就能说，好的，我患这种病的风险更高，我会关注这一点。对吧？所以，你提到了青春期，年轻女孩可能会被建议服用**避孕药**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It should empower people. Yes. Exactly. And and I hope now that people are getting that information so that if they do suffer for some of these gestational disorders that they are aware of the potential implications later on. I think part of the frustration is there's been a lack of research done with women's health and so a lot of these conditions if you know it then you can actually say okay I'm at a higher risk of this I'm going to pay attention to that right. So during you mentioned puberty young girls may there you might be a suggestion for them to go on birth control.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但患有**子宫肌瘤**（像我一样）或**子宫内膜异位症**的女性，我们也会被要求服用**避孕药**来控制这些症状，对吧？这在那些时期对我们的大脑健康有什么影响？青少年大脑和成年大脑会有所不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But women with conditions like **fibroids** like I had or **endometriosis** we can also we we can be asked to go on birth control to manage those symptoms, right? What impact does this have on our brain health during those times? And is it different for an adolescent versus an adult brain?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，所以我之前说过，全球有3亿人服用**激素避孕药**。也许我没说过。它们上市已经70年了。那么，在所有这些全球范围内的研究中，你能猜出有多少百分比的研究是关于大脑健康和**激素避孕药**的吗？是零吗？非常接近零。0.15%。但最近对**激素避孕药**如何影响大脑的兴趣有所增加。对身体其他部位有影响，是的，但对大脑或精神健康的影响不多。文献中有些研究表明，它会增加早年患多种精神疾病的风险。所以，如果你在青春期服用它们，你更有可能增加患**抑郁症**的风险，或者使用**抗抑郁药**，这与**抑郁症**不完全相同。现在已经有很多大型研究针对服用**激素避孕药**的成年人，发现在21岁或更年长的成年人中，没有迹象表明它会增加风险。目前有一些非常好的研究正在探讨，如果一个人情绪已经处于可能更容易患**抑郁症**或**焦虑症**的状态，那么他们可能更容易因为**激素避孕药**而“崩溃”，而其他人则不会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah, so there's so I think I said it earlier that 300 million people worldwide take **hormonal contraceptives**. Maybe I didn't say that. And they've been on the market for 70 years. So of all of the studies, you know, worldwide throughout time, can you guess what percentage of studies are on brain health and **hormonal contraceptives**? Is it zero? It's very close to zero. 0.15%. But there has been a sort of recent like more interest in how **hormonal contraceptives** affect the brain. There other areas of the body, yes, but not so much brain or mental health and there is some suggestion in the literature that it increases risk for a number of mental health disorders earlier on in life. So if you're taking them during adolescence, you're more likely to it it increases your risk for depression for example or anti-depressant use which is not exactly the same as depression. If there's been a number of huge studies now done looking at adults taking **hormonal contraceptives** and at an adult age like 21 or or older there is zero indication that it's it's increasing risk. And there are some really great studies out there right now looking at if the person w had a great if they were um if their mood was already at a a state where they maybe were a greater risk to develop depression or anxiety they were probably more likely to be sort of tipped over the edge with **hormonal contraceptives** where somebody else wouldn't have been.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 所以，我们再次没有那么多研究，但我会给你一些安慰。对某些人来说，你知道，我们都不同，对吧？这就是为什么没有“一刀切”的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So again we don't have that many studies but I will give you some reassurance. So for some people it's you know we're all different right? That's why one size doesn't fit all.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 而且**避孕**方法种类繁多，一种药片不等于另一种。**宫内节育器**也不一样。**铜质宫内节育器**和**曼月乐**不一定会产生相同的结果。但是，他们已经开始研究**激素避孕药**可能如何影响晚年的大脑健康，一些使用**英国生物样本库**的早期研究实际上显示，它可能具有保护作用。但我还要说的是，对某些人来说，比如我自己，我很喜欢它，它让我感觉更好。它使我的月经周期规律，它让我的脾气也更平稳了一些。当我47岁出现一些围绝经期症状时，我非常非常易怒。我当时在威尼斯，本应该玩得很开心，但我却对我的丈夫非常生气。可怜的家伙。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And there are so many different kinds of birth control methods as well that not you know one pill is not going to equal the other. An **IUD** is not going to be the same. **Copper IUD** versus **Monura** is not going to be the same outcomes necessarily. But they've been starting to just starting to look at how **hormonal contraceptives** might impact later life brain health and some early work using something called the **UK bio bank** has shown actually might be have a protective effect. But something else I'll just say is for some people like myself, I loved it and it made me feel better. It evened out my periods. It you know maybe evened out my temperament a little bit more and as soon as I noticed when I had some permenopausal symptoms at 47 I was really really irritable. I was in Venice I should have been having the time of my life and I was just like so mad at my husband. The poor guy.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 他是不是嚼东西声音太大了？我完全是嚼东西声音太大，而且，你知道，我希望他笑的时候他没笑。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Was he chewing too loudly? I am totally chewing too loudly and you know not smiling when I wanted him to smile.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 那个电话。总之，我们玩得很开心，我们当时在**布拉吉丽娜**租的船上，有人带着我们到处游览。总之，真的非常棒，但我当时很易怒。我意识到，哦，我上次有这种激素失调的感觉时，对我来说，那是一种药片。它帮助我稳定了情绪。所以，我回到了我的家庭医生那里，我说，我想重新服用**激素避孕药**，她给我开了我以前吃的那种药片。但这就是我们现在正在努力做的研究。所以对有些人来说可能不起作用，但对另一些人来说，它可能实际上能提升情绪或有所帮助。

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: The call. Um anyway, I was having the time of we were on **Bragelina's** boat like with the boat that they had rented. You know, we were had somebody touring us around. Anyway, really, really fantastic, but I was irritable and I real I remembered, oh, the last time I felt like this hormonal, in my case, it was a pill. It helped it helped even out my mood. And so, I went back to my family doctor and I said, look, I I'd like to go back on **hormonal contraceptives** and she she put me on the same pill that I was on before. But that's the kind of re research we're we're trying to do now. So for some people it might not work for them but for other people it might actually be you know mood boosting or or or helpful for their.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但您正在进行研究，因为女性并非铁板一块。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But the fact that you're doing research because women are not a monolithic.

</details>

### 怀孕与产后大脑变化

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，没错。我们刚才谈到怀孕是身体的第一个压力源。那么，产后女性的大脑会发生什么变化呢？因为，又来了，这个可爱的词叫“产后抑郁”，因为有些母亲会有“产后抑郁”，有些则没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yes. Exactly. We talked a little bit about how you mentioned the pregnancy was the first stressor on a person's body. But what happens to her brains during postpartum because again it's this kind of like this cutie word baby blues because some some mothers have baby blues and some don't.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，没错。我是说，这很常见。这取决于你查阅的研究。大约20%到80%的人会说他们在那段时间经历了忧郁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yes. Correct. I mean it is a pretty common I mean it depends on the study you look at. It can be anywhere from like 20 to 80% of people will say that they experienced the blues during that period.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那就是产后，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Which is postpartum, right?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，产后，抱歉。所以，让我们稍微回顾一下。怀孕本身是一件令人惊奇和美妙的事情。我是一名神经科学家，但我也是一名神经内分泌学家，这意味着我非常喜欢谈论激素。所以我要稍微谈谈激素。我知道我不应该有偏爱。我有两个孩子，我没有偏爱的孩子。我爱你们俩。但**雌二醇**是我最喜欢的激素。所以我们现在就谈谈**雌二醇**。**雌二醇**是**雌激素**中非常强大的一种，是所有**雌激素**中最强大的一种。所以，在怀孕20周时，它的水平大约是正常水平的200倍，怀孕30周时是正常水平的300倍。然后它会以更快的速度攀升，达到几乎是正常水平的1000倍。然后，孩子出生后会发生什么？胎盘会出来，而胎盘一直在分泌所有这些激素。不仅仅是**雌二醇**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah the postpartum sorry the um so so let's just sort of back up a bit pregnancy itself it is amazing and a wonderful thing I am a neuroscientist but I also am a neuroendocrinologist which just means I really like to talk about hormones. So I'm going to talk a little bit about hormones. Um and I know I shouldn't have favorites. I have two kids and I don't have a favorite kid. I love you both. Um uh but **estradiol** is my favorite hormone. So I'll just talk about **estradiol** for now. And **estradiol** is just a very powerful of the estrogens, the most powerful of all the estrogens. So it's about 200 times normal levels by week 20 of pregnancy, 300 times normal levels by week 30 of pregnancy. And it climbs even more dramatically than that up to almost a thousand times normal levels. And then what happens with the birth of the baby? the placenta comes out and that the placenta is the one that's been shooting out all these hormones. It's not just **estradiol**.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 它会急剧下降。所以你实际上就像处于更年期水平。他们称之为那个时期的**性腺功能减退**。所以，它就像这些非常高且持续很长时间的水平，然后急剧下降，而且不仅仅是**雌二醇**，还有各种各样的激素。我有一个在丹麦的精神病医生朋友，她叫**Viva Fyager**，我很喜欢她。她对我说，这就像一场完美的风暴。我认为这是一个非常好的比喻，是精神健康挑战的完美风暴。我们的激素水平下降，我们知道这与月经周期期间的一些情绪恶化有关。在围绝经期，情况也是如此。我们还看到大脑的变化。我喜欢的大脑区域**海马体**，在产后期间实际上会萎缩。欧洲有一些很棒的研究专门探讨了这一点。这并不意味着这是一件坏事。他们研究了记忆测试。他们没有发现与记忆有任何关联。他们实际上发现它与他们所说的“母婴依恋”有很好的关联。所以，这是应该发生的。这是一种自然的适应性变化。所有这些激素变化也是如此。炎症，所有我们所说的特别是**抑郁症**的生物标志物，在产后都朝着同一个方向变化。所以，产后时期是任何人一生中患任何精神疾病风险最高的时期，也许这并不奇怪。这是因为这种汇合，我认为是这些同时发生的自然生物学变化的汇合。所以有些人会更容易受到影响，有些人则不会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: It nose dives. So you're actually like like menopausal levels. They call it hypoganatal in that period. So it's like this these really high sustained levels for a long long time and then a drop and not just an **estradiol** and and a variety of hormones. And a friend of mine who's a psychiatrist in Denmark, her name is **Viva Fyager**, love her. She said to me, it's like the perfect storm. And I think that's a really good analogy, perfect storm for mental health challenges. We have these drops in hormone levels which we know is also associated with some mood exacerbations just during the menstrual cycle. During parmenopause, it's the same kind of thing. We also see changes in the brain. So the **hippocampus**, that brain area I love, it actually shows it shows that it shrinks during the postpartum period. There's some lovely work out of Europe looking at that specifically. That doesn't mean it's a bad thing. They they've they've looked at memory tests. They don't see any connection with memory. They actually see a good connection with what they call maternal child attachment. So it's it's meant to happen. It's a natural adaptive change. Same with all these hormone changes. Inflammation all sorts of what we call biomarkers of particularly depression all change in the same direction in the postpartum. And so maybe it's no wonder that the postpartum period is the time of greatest risk to develop any kind of mental health disorder in anyone's life. And and it's because of this confluence I think it's because of this confluence and of these biological changes that happen at the same time that are just natural. So some people will be more susceptible and some people will not be.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我认为，从历史上看，一直以来被宣传的观念是，当你生了孩子，你就会有这些快乐的激素。你看着你的孩子，坠入爱河，感觉棒极了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: I think historically the idea has been or the what's been pushed out is that when you have your baby, you have these happy hormones. You look at your baby, you fall in love, and you feel amazing.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 然后对于那些没有这种感觉的女性来说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And then for the women who don't feel those things.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么你就会觉得自己还没开始就已经失败了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Then you feel like you're failing before you've even started.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，没错。这是一个可怕的故事，而且还在被讲述。即使你鼓起勇气和你的医生谈论，比如，嘿，我感觉有些其他的情绪，它也常常被轻描淡写地认为是，哦，这很正常。别担心，你只是累了。在某些情况下可能确实如此，但对于某些人来说，估计有12%到20%的个体将经历更严重的症状，包括**产后精神病**，这是一种相当毁灭性的疾病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yes. Exactly. It's a it's an it's an awful story that is is getting to told. And even if you are brave enough to talk to your practitioner about like, hey, I'm not feel I'm feeling some other kinds of feelings, it's often brushed off as, oh, it's normal. Don't worry, you're just tired. Um and in some cases that might be the case but for for some people and the estimates are around 12 to 20% of individuals will experience something more severe including something called **postpartum psychosis** which is a pretty devastating.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What is that?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: **精神病**是**精神分裂症**的特征或症状之一。所以会有幻觉。这可能是最常见的一种。所以你可能会听到一些东西，或者认为，你知道，另一种情况，这不是**精神病**，而是**产后焦虑**。通常表现为人们非常担心会对自己的孩子做有害的事情，担心自己的孩子会发生不好的事情。显然，这些都是产后可能发生的非常严重的问题，不应该被忽视。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So psychosis is um is one of the characteristics that or symptoms that you have with schizophrenia. So it'll be hallucinations. That's probably the most common one. So you might hear something or think, you know, another one that's quite this is not psychosis, but is **postpartum anxiety**. And usually how that's wrapped up is that people are very anxious about that they're going to do something harmful to their baby, that something bad is going to happen to their baby. And obviously these are really serious issues that can happen in the postpartum and not something that should be ignored.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但我想你也必须谈谈，我有过两次怀孕，在英国和加拿大两个不同的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But I think you also have to talk to tell you have I had two pregnancies and in two different countries in the UK and Canada.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 两位医生都没有告诉我这可能会发生。

<details>

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And so if it happens there's that shame and stigma at saying this is how I feel right. So.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 哦，我是说100%。这确实是问题的一个重要部分，也是**加拿大围产期精神健康协会**这个组织一直在努力解决的问题。他们试图在加拿大发布一项策略，强制要求在产后护理中询问你的情况，你的感受，甚至进行**爱丁堡产后抑郁量表**测试，看看你是否得分很高，因为这非常重要。它是高度可治疗的，可以通过药物治疗，也可以通过谈话疗法等方式高度可治疗。**CAMH**发布了一项非常棒的试验。**Daisy Singler**是这项试验的首席研究员，它被称为**Summit Trial**，人们可以查阅。**Summit Trial**的结果非常非常棒，简单来说，它提供了帮助，因为显然很难找到精神科医生。很难找到时间。我是说，你有了孩子，连洗澡都很难，更别说去寻求精神健康支持了。所以，在这种情况下，他们培训了助产士和社会工作者来实施一种叫做“行为激活”的方法。基本上就是谈话疗法，用来帮助人们改善情绪。对于那些不那么严重，而是轻度到中度病例的人来说，它和与精神科医生或心理学家交谈一样有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Oh, I mean 100%. Like this is a big part of the problem and something that a group that was is called the **Canadian Perinatal Mental Health Society**. They they were trying to release a strategy in Canada to make to make it mandatory that in your postpartum care you're also asked about how you were doing, how you were feeling and even being administered the something called an **Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Test** to see are you are you scoring highly on these things because it's really important to it's very it's highly treatable it's it's treatable through pharmaceutical agents but also highly treatable through things like talk therapy. There was a really fantastic trial that was released through **CAMH**. **Daisy Singler** was the principal investigator of it and it's called the **Summit Trial** so people can look it up but really really really great results from the **Summit Trial** and just very briefly it was giving you because obviously it's hard to find a psychiatrist. It's hard to find the time. I mean you have a baby it's hard enough to have a shower never mind. Yeah. Go and try and seek support for your mental health. So in that case they train midwives and social workers to to administer something called behavioral activation. Basically it's talk therapy to to help people's moods. And for people that are you know not very severe cases but the sort of mild to moderate cases it re it was just as helpful as talking to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 怀孕期间和生完孩子后我们还会听到一个词叫“**妈妈脑**”。是的，这个名字很可爱。但“**妈妈脑**”到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Something else that we hear during pregnancy after you've had a baby is **mommy brain**. Yes, cute name. But what is **mommy brain**?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 嗯，我不知道。不久前有一篇文章说我们不应该那样称呼它，因为它带有负面含义，对吧？但是，正如我告诉你的，在产后期间，你的**海马体**会缩小。**海马体**，我喜欢这个结构的另一个原因是它对记忆非常重要。所以它对于将新记忆、新经历转化为记忆非常重要。所以，整合这些信息是它的主要功能。有一些证据表明，在怀孕期间，特别是在孕晚期，你可以测量到一些认知缺陷，不，不是缺陷，而是认知变化。数量不多，而且看起来，就像我说的，这取决于孕期，甚至取决于你怀的宝宝的性别。所以如果你怀的是男孩，你的认知症状会更少。如果你怀的是女孩，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Um, so I don't So there was a an article that was written not long ago saying we shouldn't we shouldn't call it that because it's got this like sort of uh negative connotation to it, right? Um, but it definitely as I told you when during the postpartum period you have this decrease in the epic campus. The **hippocampus** the reason another reason I love this structure is is really important for memory. Um, so it's it's it's really important for getting those new memories into into into your new experiences that you have into memory. So consolidating that information, that's the the big one for it. And um there is some evidence that in the sort of uh t during pregnancy um particularly in the third trimester uh that there are some um some cognitive deficits that you can not deficits but cognitive changes that you can measure. Uh not a ton of them and it looks like it like I said it depends on trimester depends on actually even what the sex of the baby you're pregnant with. So if you're pregnant with a boy, you have fewer of these cognitive symptoms. And if you're pregnant with a girl,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我先怀了一个男孩，然后一个女孩，然后又一个男孩。嗯，这种想法是，你会有这种类似“脑雾”的感觉，对吧？你会变得有点迟钝，但你也会非常容易分心，对吧？你的激素水平很高，然后又很低，这很可能导致一些可以测量的变化。然而，当我们把人们带到实验室，我们很久以前发表过一篇论文，但当我们把他们带到实验室，在一个没有干扰的房间里给他们做测试，他们没有带孩子，所有人都表现得很好。他们唯一表现不好的地方是我们所说的“前瞻性记忆”，也就是记住将来要做某事。我们给了他们一个贴好邮票的信封，他们必须在一周内寄回，但他们没有做到。但这并不是非常令人惊讶，对吧？因为在现实世界中，还有太多其他事情需要考虑。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I had a boy then a girl that I had a boy, too. Um and and the idea is that you sort of have this almost like brain fog, right? You get a little more but you're also really distracted, right? You have these really high levels of hormones and you have these low levels of hormones and it's it is likely contributing to some of these kind of changes that are that that are that can be measurable. However, when we bring people into we have a paper that was published a long time ago, but when we brought them into the lab and actually gave them like tests to do in a room where they were not distracted, they didn't have their baby with them, everybody performed just fine. Um the only thing that they didn't perform very well on was something that we call perspective memory and that's remembering to do something in the future and we gave them an envelope that was still stamped and they had to me like mail it back in a week and that didn't happen. But it's not so super surprising, right, that that didn't happen. There's just so many other things to think about when you're out in the real world.

### 更年期与阿尔茨海默病风险

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我想把我们的注意力转移到**更年期**。这是一个我们的激素会造成严重破坏的时期。是的。从历史上看，我认为一直存在一种沉默、恐惧和耻辱的文化，关于**更年期**，但仍然有很多困惑。**BBC**在2026年1月发表了一篇题为《**更年期与阿尔茨海默病样大脑变化相关**》的文章。我想给您读一下其中一位研究人员在谈到经历更年期转变的女性时的一段引文。引文是：“更年期可能会使这些女性在未来更容易受到伤害。虽然这并非全部真相，但它可能有助于解释为什么我们看到女性患**痴呆症**的病例几乎是男性的两倍。”我读了那篇文章，立刻变得更加担忧。但后来我看到其他科学家和研究人员说这并不是一个完整的画面。这项研究说了什么？**更年期**期间女性的大脑到底发生了什么？**更年期**会使我们更容易患**阿尔茨海默病**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I wanted to shift our attention to menopause. Um a time when our hormones wreck havoc. Yes. Historically, I think there's been this kind of like culture of silence, fear, stigma about menopause, but there's still a lot of confusion. A recent article from the **BBC** came out in January of 2026. It was titled **Menopause linked to Alzheimer's like brain changes**. I just wanted to read you a quote from this from one of the researchers when talking about women going through the menopause transition. This is the quote. Menopause could make these women vulnerable further down the line. While not the whole story, it may help explain why we see almost twice as many cases of **dementia** in women than in men. Um, I read the article and I immediately became even more worried. But later I saw other scientists and researchers saying that this wasn't a complete picture. What does the study say? And what exactly happens to women's brains during menopause? Does menopause make us more likely to getting **Alzheimer's**?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 好的，所以让我们回顾一下。女性患**阿尔茨海默病**（不是**痴呆症**，而是**阿尔茨海默病**）的可能性是男性的两倍，这是事实。**痴呆症**是一个总称。**阿尔茨海默病**是**痴呆症**的一种特定形式，但它占所有**痴呆症**病例的70%到80%。还有一种叫做**血管性痴呆**。例如，女性患**血管性痴呆**的可能性并不比男性高。但**阿尔茨海默病**有一些特殊之处。所以，我们确实更有可能患上这种病。事实上，在60岁时，如果你是女性，你被诊断出**阿尔茨海默病**的可能性是**乳腺癌**的两倍。所以，我确实认为我们了解我们大脑健康的潜在风险以及我们能做些什么来在生命早期降低这种风险非常重要。我认为这非常重要，但这并不意味着每个人都会患**阿尔茨海默病**，好吗？但主要的风险因素是年龄增长。所以，你年龄越大，女性患病可能性越大。如果你出生时被指定为女性，并且有某种形式的遗传因素（我很乐意谈论），**阿尔茨海默病**的平均诊断年龄大约在70岁左右，70到73岁，这取决于多种因素。现在我们了解到，**阿尔茨海默病**的一些神经病理学特征，我们大脑中看到的**淀粉样β斑块**和**神经纤维缠结**，实际上会提前20年出现。所以你甚至可以更早地看到这些形成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So um uh so let's back up. So it is true that women are twice more likely to have **Alzheimer's disease**, not **dementia** but **Alzheimer's disease** than men. **Dementia** is the umbrella term. **Alzheimer's disease** is a specific form of dementia but it accounts for about 70 to 80% of all **dementia** cases. But there's something called **vascular dementia**. There's no women are more not more likely to get **vascular dementia** than men for example. But **Alzheimer's disease** there is something a little special about it. So, so we are more likely, in fact, at the age of 60, if you're a woman, you're you're twice more likely to to be diagnosed with **Alzheimer's disease** than you are breast cancer. So, I do think it's really important for us to be aware of of the potential for our brain health and what we can do to mitigate that risk earlier in life. I think it is really important, but that doesn't mean everybody's going to get **Alzheimer's disease**, okay? But the top major risk factors are advancing age. So, the older you are, the more likely female sex. So if you are a female signed at birth and an a certain form of genetics which I'm happy to talk about the **Alzheimer's disease** you're the sort of average age of diagnosis is around like 70ish 70 73 something like that depends on a number of factors and the idea with **Alzheimer's disease** that as we're learning now is that some of the neuropathological features we see in the brain which are **amaloid beta plaques** and **neuropiary tangles** that they actually show up 20 years prior. So you actually can see the formation of these even earlier now that we've been.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 就像你50多岁的时候？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: In like your 50s?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 对吧？那么50多岁还会发生什么呢？**更年期**的平均年龄是51.4岁。所以，就像我之前说的，这些激素转变确实是转折点，对于各种事情，对吧？对于我们的健康结果和疾病风险。**更年期**也不例外。它是我们衰老的转折点。所以我们在这个时期所做的事情，以及我们的**更年期**如何表现，真的可以影响我们晚年的大脑健康，不仅仅是大脑健康，还有骨骼健康、心脏健康，所有这些。我认为这种对话变得越来越响亮是件好事。我，再次，我们没有这个数据，所以我们对加拿大在15年间的所有资助进行了一项大型调查，特别是女性健康方面，只有6.4%的资助。所以，你的税款并没有大量用于女性健康研究。我希望在加拿大改变这一点。对于**更年期**，我们还没有发布这项研究，但我会给你一个早期预告，那就是在15年间，只有0.22%的资助用于**更年期**研究。这个领域的研究非常少。我正在努力争取**加拿大卫生研究院**（**CIHR**）的资助，以解决这个具体问题。但我能告诉你的是，每当人们看到这些头条新闻时，非常重要的是要问，研究中是否考虑了**更年期**的类型、人群、如何测量，以及如果他们确实研究了，使用了哪种**更年期激素疗法**。就像**激素避孕药**或**避孕药**一样，有200种不同的**更年期激素疗法**配方。所以，当人们说**更年期激素疗法**做了或没做什么时，我最讨厌的就是这种说法。到底是什么类型？对谁有效或无效？我们经历的**更年期**有很多种。有些人有很多症状。有些人几乎没有任何症状。而现有的一点点研究表明，所有这些都将是我们晚年大脑健康的指标。所以，一个更一致的发现是，你越早进入**更年期**，晚年患**痴呆症**的风险就越大。所以，这是另一个转折点，一个需要了解的信息。这是否意味着你一定会患**痴呆症**？绝对不是。但是，就像知道你在怀孕期间患有**子痫前期**会影响你后来的健康一样，你是否可以做些什么来降低这种风险？我们对女性健康的研究非常少，对激素影响的研究也更少。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Right? So what also happens in your 50s? Average age of menopause is 51.4 years of age. So it actually does seem like as I said earlier, these hormonal transitions are inflection points and for a variety of things, right, for our health outcomes and disease risk. **Menopause** is no exception. It's an inflection point for our aging. And so what we do at this time period and how how our menopaus have manifests can really inform on our brain health later in life and not just brain health, bone health, heart health, all of these things. And I think it's it's great that the conversation is growing louder. I in term again we don't have this so I we did a big survey of all the Canadian funding that went out over 15 years and specifically for women's health it was 6.4% 4% of the funding. So that's your tax dollars not going to a lot of women's health research. I would love to change that in Canada. And for menopause specifically, we we haven't released this study yet, but I will give you an early sneak peek, which is 22% as on menopause. 02 for over 15 years. Very little work is being done in the area. I'm trying to get a grant funded right now for from **CIHR** on this specific question. But what I can tell you is that consist so whenever people see these headlines it's really important to ask in the study did people look at what type of menopause in what population how did they measure it what type of **menopausal hormone therapy** was used if they did look at it that at all and I just like **hormonal contraceptives** or **birth control** there's 200 different formulations of **menopause hormone therapy** so when people my pet peeve is when people say **menopause hormone therapy** did or didn't do this. Like what kind and in whom did it work or not work? And so there are many types of menopause that we go through. Some of us have a lot of symptoms. Some of us hardly have any symptoms. And the little bit of research that's been done, we will we know that all of this will be an indicator for our brain health later in life. And so one of the more consistent findings is the earlier you go through menopause the greater risk for **dementia** you have later on in life. So that is sort of a another inflection a piece of information to have. Does it mean that you're going to get dementia? Absolutely not. But are there things you can do to mitigate that risk just like knowing that you had preeacclampsia during pregnancy to influence your health later on? And the fact that we have very little research around women's health but also fewer research around hormonal Yeah. impacts.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 哦，是的，我是说，没错。所以我是说，我可以给你确切的百分比，但它们真的，我认为**更年期激素相关疗法**，我认为在15年里只有四项拨款。人们必须明白，每年大约有一千项拨款获得资助。所以这只是一个非常非常小的比例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Oh yeah. I mean exactly. So I mean I I can I can give you the exact percentages of things but they're really I think the menopause hormone related therapy I think it was like four grants over 15 years. And people have to understand it's about a thousand grants that are funded every year. So it's it's a really really tiny fraction that's being funded.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是一千项。但如果是一千项拨款，我们占人口的50%。我觉得我们应该得到其中500项拨款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's a thousand. But if it's a thousand grants, we make up 50% of the population. I feel like we should get 500 of those grants.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 那不是很好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Wouldn't that be nice?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我是说，这有点道理，或者，你知道，至少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I mean, that makes some sense or, you know, at least tw.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 至少，至少有些。但是，谈到激素，2025年11月，**美国食品药品监督管理局**宣布将取消大多数**更年期激素疗法**产品（我们很多人称之为**HRT**）的黑框警告。黑框警告是**FDA**能发出的最强警告，这可以追溯到2002年的**妇女健康倡议**临床试验。您能帮助我们理解**FDA**最初为何发出黑框警告，以及现在取消它意味着什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: At least at least something. But talking about hormones, in November of 2025, the **US Food and Drug Administration** announced that it would remove the black box for most **menopausal hormone hormone therapy** products of what a lot of us know as **HRT**. The black box is the strongest warning the **FDA** can issue, and this goes way back to 2002 in the **Women's Health Initiative** clinical trial. Can you help us understand why the **FDA** issued the black box in the first place and what it means that they have now removed it?

</details>

### MHT黑框警告的撤销

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 政治因素，我认为这是个好消息。你问他们最初为什么发出警告。好的，就像我们之前谈到的，**WHI**研究（**妇女健康倡议**）只使用了一种**更年期激素疗法**。我知道你提到了**HRT**，我知道很多人都知道这个缩写。我不太喜欢使用这个缩写，因为它代表的是**激素替代疗法**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Uh politics and I think good news you said why did they put it on the first place. So okay so just like we were talking about before the **WHI** study the **women's health initiative** used one kind of **menopause hormone therapy**. I know you said **HRT** and I know a lot of people know that. I I don't love using that acronym because it stands for so it's **hormone replacement therapy**.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 它们从未被设计来替代我们的激素。所以给定的水平与我们绝经前的水平相比非常非常低。这就是为什么很多科学家已经转向使用“**更年期激素疗法**”而不是“替代疗法”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And they were never designed to replace our hormones. So the levels were given are really really low compared to what we had premenopausal. So that's why a lot of scientists have sort of shifted to say **menopausal hormone therapy** rather than replacement. I mean.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 谢谢您澄清这一点，因为我们很多人从社交媒体获取信息。我们看到**HRT**，然后又看到**MHT**，就觉得不明白有什么区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Thank you for but thank you for clarifying that because a lot of us are getting our information from social media. We're seeing **HRT**, then we're seeing **MHT** and it's like I don't understand what's the difference.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，没错。但它们是同一回事。它们谈论的完全是同一回事。但再次强调，它不是单一的，对吧？有很多不同的配方。**WHI**研究中使用的那种特定配方，那项研究发生了很多事情。它是最大的研究。数据仍在发布中。很多数据仍在从那项研究中发布。我希望，如果我们谈论随机对照试验、临床试验和观察性研究，那会花费我们更多时间。我认为所有这些都非常重要，它们都为我们提供了信息片段。它是一项所谓的随机对照试验。它只使用了一种**更年期激素疗法**，叫做**Prem**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah, exactly. But that's it's they're the same thing. They're talking about exactly the same thing. But again, it's not a monolith, right? There's so many different formulations. And the particular one that they used in the **WHI**, there's a bunch of things that happened with that study. It was the largest study. They're still being released. Like a lot of data is still being released from that study. I I would love it would take us so much longer to talk about you know randomized control trials versus clinical trials versus observational studies. I think all of them are really important and they all give us pieces of information. It was a random what's called a randomized control trial. It only uses one form of **menopausal hormone therapy** that's called **Prem**.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: **Prem**代表“怀孕的母马”。所以他们，你可能知道也可能不知道，他们取了马尿，然后从马尿中合成了不同的**雌激素**和**孕激素**，真的，它都是**雌激素**，然后制成了这种配方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: **Prem** stands for pregnant mayors. So they took you pro you may or may not know this. They took horse urine and then they synthesized the different **estrogens** and **progesterines** from that from that horse urine and really it was all **estrogens** and then made this formulation.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 其中主要成分大约50%是**雌酮**。所以**雌激素**有很多种，不只是一种。我们体内现在至少有四种。而**雌酮**实际上是一种相当弱的**雌激素**。**雌二醇**，我最喜欢的一种，是更强大的一种。所以，在**更年期**期间，**雌酮**和**雌二醇**都会下降，但**雌二醇**下降的幅度远大于**雌酮**。所以实际上，绝经后的女性体内的**雌酮**水平会高于**雌二醇**。绝经前的情况则相反。所以在我看来，我有点好奇他们为什么决定使用**雌酮**而不是**雌二醇**替代。所以这是一点。这种特定的配方可能对某些人有效，对另一些人则无效。另一点是，那项随机对照试验中参与者的平均年龄是63岁。你可能也听说过这一点。**更年期**的平均年龄是50-51岁。所以他们已经绝经十多年了。我们确实知道有很多好的研究表明，如果你想获得**更年期激素疗法**的好处，最好在**更年期**转变的早期服用，而不是晚期。就好像效果会逐渐减弱。你的身体会补偿这种**雌激素**的缺乏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: The main one it's about 50% of it is **estrone**. So there are many kinds of **estrogens**. There's not just one kind of **estrogen**. We have at least four in our body right now. And **estrone** is the is is actually quite a weak one of the **estrogens**. **Estradile**, my favorite one is the more powerful one. And so we were and what happens during menopause is both **estrone** and estradi **estradile** is much higher at much higher levels than **estrone**. And at menopause they both decline but **estradile** much more so than estone. So actually end up having a post-menopausal woman will have more higher levels of **estrone** than they were estradi. Premenopause it would have been the other way around. So it was in my head I was kind of I was curious to me like why they decided to use estone versus an **estradile** replacement. So that's one thing. This particular one works may may work well for some people may not work well for other people. Another thing is that the average age of the participant in that randomized control trial was 63. You might have heard this as well. Average age of menopause 50 51. So they were more than a decade past menopause. And we do know there's quite a bit of good research to say, you know, if you want the benefits of **menopausal hormone therapy**, it's better to take it earlier, in your menopausal transition rather than later. It's like the effects sort of wear off. Your body compensates for this lack of of **estrogens**. And so.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 让我们多谈谈这一点，因为我认为当我们谈论**更年期**转变时，我们听到“潮热”。又是一个有点可爱的词。潮热。你会变得有点暴躁，所有这些听起来都不太严重。也许只是，哦，你知道，那些女人就是女人样，喜怒无常，情绪不稳定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Let's talk a bit more about that because I think when we talk about the menopause transition, we hear hot flash. Again, another kind of cutesy word. Hot flashes. You get kind of ragy and all of these sound kind of not serious. Maybe it's just, oh, you know, those women being women, moody and all over the place.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但实际上有些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But there's actually something.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 情绪化的女人。

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 情绪化的女人。这听起来像个乐队名。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 可能是。我喜欢这个乐队名。但就像我正在学习的，当我经历围绝经期时，就是。

<details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It could be. I love it as a band name. But it's like what I'm like what I'm learning as I'm going through pmenopause is that um.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yes.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但像**更年期激素疗法**，我需要一段时间才能习惯说这个词。它不仅仅是关于潮热，它还关乎你的心脏健康、骨骼健康、大脑健康。您能多谈谈这一点吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But like **menopause hormone therapy**, it's going to take me a while to get used to say that. Um, it's not just about hot flashes, it's about your heart health, your bone, your brain health. Can you talk a bit more about that?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。好的。所以，我再次希望我们有更多时间。在**更年期**转变期间可能会出现很多症状，包括皮肤瘙痒、眼睛干涩，是的，我们很多人都有血管舒缩症状。那些就是你的潮热和盗汗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. Okay. So, so I have, again, I wish we had more time. Um, so, you know, there's so many symptoms that can occur during the menopausal transition, including things like itchy skin and dry eyes and, uh, yes, many of us have vasom motor symptoms. Those are your hot flashes and your night sweats.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **冻结肩**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Frozen shoulder.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: **冻结肩**是另一个。有很多很多。有些人会不屑一顾地说，这只是衰老。就像，你知道，忍着点，亲爱的。就像，这只是会发生在我们所有人身上。嗯，它不会发生在我们所有人身上。它不会在某个特定的年龄段发生在我们所有人身上。让我们思考一下。在**更年期**，你的卵巢不会完全停止工作，但它们正在减速，对吧？所以**雌激素**和**孕酮**正在下降。这些激素通过受体来帮助你的身体和大脑。所以**雌激素受体**、**孕酮受体**，它们在你的身体里哪里呢？它们不仅仅在你的乳房里，你知道，在你的私密部位。我不知道为什么我不想说阴道或子宫。它们不仅仅在那里，也不仅仅在你的卵巢上。它们遍布你的全身。每一个器官，包括你的皮肤。难怪我们会这样，包括你的肌肉，包括你的心脏，包括你的肺，包括你的，我们身体的每一个器官都有这些激素受体，对吧？所以，当你想到这一点并了解这一点时，你会觉得，即使我当时正在经历（我现在已经过去了），即使我当时正在经历，我也会想，这到底是什么新症状？我会查阅资料，甚至会尝试和我的医生谈谈，她很棒，但你知道，他们不可能获得所有关于**更年期**的教育。这实际上是有道理的。从生物学上讲，我们有这些各种各样的症状是说得通的。血管舒缩症状本身，那些潮热和盗汗，也是我们血管系统的一个晴雨表，以及它如何运作和响应不同信号。是的，它们在**更年期**后可能会消退，但在许多女性身上并不会消退。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: **Frozen shoulder** is another one. There's just there's so many. And some people will sort of roll their eyes and say it's just aging. Like just, you know, suck it up, buttercup. Like it's just it happens to all of us. Well, it doesn't happen to all of us. It doesn't happen to all of us at a certain sort of age range. And let's think about this just for a moment. With menopause, your ovaries are they don't shut down completely, but they're they're ramping down, right? So est **estrogens** and **progesterone** are declining. These hormones work through to to help your body and your brain. They work through something called receptors. And so **estrogen receptors**, **progesterone receptors**, where are they in your body, they're not just in your boobs and, you know, in your um pride parts. I don't know why I'm not going to say vagina or uterus. They're not just there or on your ovaries. They're they're everywhere in your body. Every single including your skin. No wonder we get including your your muscles, including your heart, including your lungs, including your it's every single organ in our body has these hormone receptors, right? So, so then when you think about that and you know that, you think even when I was going through I' I've passed now. Um, but even when I was going through and I was like, what the heck is this new symptom that I have? And I'd I'd look it up and I'd even try to talk to my practitioner who's fantastic, but you know, they don't have all of the education that they could possibly get around menopause. Um, it it actually makes some sense. It makes some biological sense why we have these variety of of symptoms. I I vasom motor symptoms themselves, those hot flashes and night sweats are also sort of a barometer of our our vascular system and how well it's sort of working and listening to different signals. Yes, it they can die down after menopause, but in many women it doesn't die down.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 所以即使是我自己，当我，你知道，如果我忘记换我的贴片，我仍然会经历这些症状。是的，听众们，我使用**雌二醇贴片**。我可以告诉你更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And so even for myself, I still experience them when I'm, you know, no longer if I forget to change my patch, for example. Yes. Listeners, I wear an **estradile patch**. I can tell you more about.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。我喜欢它。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yes. And I love it.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 喜欢它。我也喜欢它。我不喜欢之后那些黏黏的东西，但没关系。但是当我忘记的时候，我立刻就知道，因为我确实会盗汗。那是我最主要的症状。所以我会从一大滩汗水中醒来，然后说：“啊，对了。我忘了。今天是星期三。我得换贴片了。”总之，对我们来说，缓解这些症状非常重要，因为这些症状与未来更不利的健康后果有关。我认为这说得通，你知道，从心理上讲，我们不喜欢经历这些症状，或者至少我是这么认为的。如果你在晚上有这些症状，你会醒来，这会造成更多的睡眠障碍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Love it. Me, too. I love it. I don't like the little like gummy stuff afterwards, but whatever. Um, but I when I forget, then I I know right away because I I I don't I actually have night sweats. That's my my big symptom. So, I'll wake up in a big pool of sweat and go, "Ah, right. I forgot. It's Wednesday. I've got to change my patch." Anyway, um it's very important for us to mitigate those symptoms because those symptoms have been related to more adverse health consequences down the line. I think it makes sense, you know, psychologically we don't love experiencing those symptoms or at least I'm I'm speaking for me. Um if you have them during night, you you're going to wake up and it's going to create some more sleep disturbances.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 睡眠也是**更年期**期间受影响的另一件事，即使没有盗汗。但是，你知道，睡眠卫生是我们能为健康做的最重要的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Um and and sleep is another thing that also is affected during menopause as we know even outside of these night sweats. Uh but it's you know sleep hygiene is one of the most important things we can do for our health.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 和大脑健康。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And brain health.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And brain health. It's one of Yeah. The the acronym I always use is stress which stands for diet reducing your stress and that's any way you can do it whether it's watching heated rivalry. I just finished it last night. So good. Um uh you know binge watching um or you know uh the retail therapy whatever way reduces your stress exercising both your body and your mind and it could be as little as 10 minutes a day uh social support and sleep those those are the sort of pillars of brain health I would say.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我认为我们还不能揭穿这一点。我认为现在下结论还为时过早，而且这很有趣，因为几乎就像有两个阵营。相信它的人和不相信它的人。它不应该是非此即彼，因为我们都不同。我们都经历了不同的**更年期**。有些人有基本症状。有些人没有血管舒缩症状。我们都可能服用不同形式的**更年期激素疗法**。我们去年刚发布了一项研究，显示在记忆表现方面（这是加拿大数据，**加拿大老龄化纵向研究**），我们发现**透皮雌二醇**（贴片）和**阴道雌激素**（我们还会发布另一篇论文来展示这一点）更有可能与更高的记忆分数相关，而不是口服**雌二醇**。这有一些生物学原因，我很乐意讨论。但所以不同的配方，甚至我们服用激素的方式，都可能对我们的大脑健康产生不同的影响。但再次强调，只有0.22%的数据点，我们无法具体指出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: So I don't think we can debunk that yet I think that there I think jury is still out and I I I and it's so interesting because it's almost like there's two camps. People that believe in it versus people that don't believe in it. And it's it shouldn't be a this or that because again we're all different. We all went through different menopauses. Some of us had basic symptoms. Some of us didn't have vasom motor symptoms. And we all might take different forms of **menopause hormone therapy**. And we had a study that was just released last year that showed in terms of memory performance and this was Canadian data the **Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging** we found that **transermal estradile** the patch was and **vaginal estrogens** actually and we'll come out with another paper to show this was more likely to be associated with higher memory scores than **oral estral** and there's some biological reasons for that which I'm happy to discuss but so different formulations even how we take our hormones can have different influences on our brain health. But again, 0.22% very few data points out there that we can specifically point to.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 听到您谈论所有这些正在进行的研究，真是令人兴奋。因为当我们听到像70%的**阿尔茨海默病**患者是女性这样的统计数据时，我们现在才开始了解激素如何影响女性的大脑健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's really exciting to hear you talk about all of this research that's being done. Because when we hear stats like 70% of **Alzheimer's** patients are women and we're now just understanding how hormones impact women's brain health.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我再次想知道，为什么我们对女性大脑健康知之甚少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Again, I wonder why don't we know more about women's brain health?

</details>

### 女性大脑健康研究的障碍

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 你知道，我不知道答案，我希望我知道。我认为主要有三点。第一，我认为一些研究人员只是不认为男性和女性或双性个体之间存在很大差异。为什么要研究它？这不是一个真正重要的因素。我们有两条胳膊，两条腿，两只眼睛，两只耳朵。我们没有什么不同，除了我们比基尼下面。但是我们的染色体是XX、XY，它们决定了我们出生时被指定为女性或男性，或者X0或XXY。不像你可能听到的那样，不止两种。它们存在于我们身体的每一个细胞中。每一个细胞。所以，这就是为什么我们所有的器官都会受到这些性激素的影响，以及为什么在很多方面存在性和性别差异。所以，我认为有这一点。还有一点是，女性健康不被视为严肃的科学，它可能是一个公平问题，但它不是真正的科学，不是严肃的科学。但我在这里告诉你，它是严肃的科学。我认为我们大多数人都会明白它是严肃的科学。很少有医学教育涉及女性健康，所以我们的医生或其他医护人员，你不能过多地责怪他们，因为他们根本没有接受过这方面的教育。我认为他们可能只花了一个上午或类似的时间学习**更年期**，可能在怀孕方面多一些，但在其他任何生命阶段都很少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: You know, I I don't know the I wish I knew the answer to that. I I think that there are three main things, if I may. One is that I think some researchers just don't think that there's much of a difference between males and females or interex individuals. Why do we need to study it? It's not a real big factor. We have two arms and two legs and two eyes and two ears. We're we're not different except for what underlies our bikini. Uh, but our chromosomes are XXXY that determine whether we're, you know, assigned female or male at birth or Xnot or XXY. Unlike what you might hear, there's more than two. Um, they're in every single cell in our body. Every single cell. So, that's why all of our organs are going to be affected by these um our sex hormone compliment and why there are sex and gender differences in a lot of things. Uh, so I think there's there's that. Uh there's that women's health isn't seen as serious like it's not you know it's maybe maybe it's an equity issue but it's not real science not serious science but I'm here to tell you it's serious science I think most of us would understand it's serious science um very little medical education goes to women's health like so our our medical doctors or other we can't you can't blame them very much right because they just don't get the education um I think they get a morning or something on menopause like that a lot a lot more maybe on pregnancy but very little on any other sort of life stage.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 第三点是，我将比过去更开放一些，我认为其中夹杂着一些性别歧视。有一种观点，其中一些来自其他科学家，无论是男性还是女性，这种观点认为我们不应该研究大脑中的任何性别差异，因为那会以某种方式使女性大脑显得低劣。我的反问是，为什么它不会使男性大脑显得低劣呢？就像人们认为，仅仅因为不同，仅仅因为我们不同，并不意味着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: And the third thing is, and I'm going to be a little more open than I have been in the past, and I think it's some sexism rolled in there. There's this idea, and and some of it comes from other scientists, and it doesn't matter if they're a man or a woman, but this idea that we shouldn't study any sex differences in the brain because that somehow makes female brains inferior. And my question back is like, why doesn't it make male brains inferior? Like people like that that just because they're different just because we're different doesn't mean.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们更弱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We're less.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我们更弱或虚弱。我们的激素也是如此。有时我因此受到一些指责，但你知道，我们知道对于某些人来说，我们的激素与大脑健康和情绪息息相关。这是一种弱点吗？还是一个理解不同疾病如何治疗的机会？也许它们需要不同类型的治疗，这取决于我们是谁，这是一个被称为**精准医疗**的整个研究领域，它正是如此，对吧？不是“一刀切”。所以我想，我想这是其中一部分。我是说，我有点偏颇，但我想说我们实际上是**赫拉克勒斯**式的，因为我们能够做到的事情，考虑到所有这些，我喜欢看社交媒体上那些关于女孩们把“period”放在那里的短视频，男孩们会说：“哦，天哪，我连两个都做不到。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: We're less or weak and same thing with our hormones. Sometimes I get some flack about that but you know we we know that that for certain people our hormones are tied to brain health and are tied to our mood. Is that is that weak or is that an opportunity to understand how the different disorders could be treated and maybe they need different kinds of treatment depending on who we are like and that that there's a whole field of research called **precision medicine** which is exactly that, right? Not one sizefits-all. So I think I think that's part of it. Um, I would I mean I'm a little biased, but I would say we're actually herculan because of the things that we're able to do% considering all like I don't I I love watching these little videos on social media of um girls who put the period on there are great boys are like, "Oh my god, I can't even do two."

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的。就像，“哦，那没什么。”你知道，因为我们可以开玩笑，我们有点，你知道，但这会造成什么样的伤害呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah. And it's like, "Oh, that's nothing." Um, you know, because we can joke about this and we kind of, you know, but what what kind of harm does this cause?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 哦，是的。太多了。我们知道，他们进行了一些大规模研究，考察了1300多种不同的疾病，女性的平均诊断时间比男性晚两年。如果你把其中75%的女性诊断延迟的疾病加起来，那就是四年，这包括**抑郁症**、**焦虑症**和**阿尔茨海默病**等对女性影响尤为严重的疾病。所以我们晚了两年，我们有90%的新疗法，我们有副作用，或者更多的副作用。我认为，你知道，导致这些诊断延迟的原因有很多，但主要原因之一是，我们大部分的医学知识，包括我们诊断人的方式（这非常非常重要，我们如何诊断人，比如你的胆固醇水平、血压、**阿尔茨海默病**、**抑郁症**），实际上主要基于男性的症状。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Oh, yeah. So so much so so we know and they because they've done some really large scale studies looking at over 1300 different disorders that women are diagnosed on average if you take all those 1300 different disorders two years later than men are. If you take the 75% of them that are diagnosed later in women and just add that that's four years and that includes things like depression and anxiety and Alzheimer's disease like the ones that disproportionately affect women and females. So we two years later we have 90% of new therapeutics we have side effects on or more side effects for that and I think you know there's going to be many reasons for these delays in diagnosis but one of the major ones is that most of our medical knowledge including the way we diagnose people and that's really really important how we diagnose people like your cholesterol levels your blood pressure Alzheimer's disease depression it's actually based on mostly on symptoms in.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以我们是非典型的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, we're atypical.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。那是我最喜欢的一个短语。你总是看到这个“非典型”的标签。而且，你必须问自己，你怎么会是非典型的，特别是对于像**抑郁症**这样的疾病，女性的风险是男性的两到三倍。所以，你知道，这么多女性。我们怎么会有非典型**抑郁症**呢？但你去查一下。我们更有可能患有非典型**抑郁症**。这怎么可能？不，那才是典型的**抑郁症**。那才是更多人表现出来的，而不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. And that's one of my favorite phases. You see this atypical label all the time. And and again, you have to ask yourself, how do you how are you atyp especially for something like depression where you see two to two to three times the risk higher risk in women. So, you know, that many more women. How do we have atypical depression? But look it up. You we have a we're more likely to have atypical depression. How is that? No, that's the typical depression. That's what the more the people show that rather than they.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那个小个子男人带着乳房。是的，我们会把那部分剪掉。您在2020年9月为《**政策选项**》杂志撰写了一篇关于在**COVID-19**大流行背景下女性健康研究资金不足的论文。您写道：“**多样性孕育发现**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: The small man with boobs. Yeah, we'll cut that part out. You wrote this in a paper for **policy options** in September of 2020 when talking about the lack of proper funding for women's health research against the backdrop of **COVID-19** pandemic. And this is what you wrote. Quote, "**Diversity breeds discovery**."

</details>

### 多样性孕育发现

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的，我最喜欢的一句话。我们看到对多样性的抵制，因为政治原因，而且“女性”这个词在美国科学家申请研究拨款时被标记为**DEI**（多元、公平和包容）。当涉及到女性大脑健康时，“**多样性孕育发现**”是如何体现的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yes, my favorite. Um, we're seeing a push back on diversity because of politics and the word uh women women has been flagged as **DEI** for scientists in the United States when applying for grants to conduct research. When it comes to women's brain health, how does **diversity breeds discovery**?

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我是说，我认为我们一直在谈论它，甚至在节目中也是如此，对吧？如果我们能理解，让我们以**围产期抑郁症**为例。这是人们会使用的术语。它实际上听起来像是一回事，比如“哦，一种特殊形式的**抑郁症**”，但实际上有四种不同的发展轨迹。你可能只在怀孕期间患**抑郁症**。你可能在整个怀孕和产后期间都患**抑郁症**。你可能只在产早期患**抑郁症**，或者只在产后期患**抑郁症**。这对我来说意味着，因为我们的生物标志物（这意味着我们的生物学、我们的炎症、我们的新陈代谢、我们的激素，甚至我们的社会状况）在这些不同的时间段内会发生如此巨大的变化。这对我来说意味着它们有不同的病因，而且可能需要不同类型的治疗。所以，再次强调，这超越了“一刀切”的模式。我们知道疼痛机制在男性和女性之间已经存在差异。甚至**COVID-19疫苗**，我知道疫苗现在莫名其妙地引起争议，我不知道我们怎么会走到这一步，但无论如何，我们都接种了**COVID-19疫苗**，我们已经知道，对于流感和**COVID-19疫苗**，女性普遍对疫苗有更强的反应。所以这本可以表明，我不知道我们是否在文章中写过，但它本可以表明，你知道，当时全球疫苗短缺，也许女性只需要一半剂量或四分之三剂量，我们就可以更快地为其他人接种疫苗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: I mean, I think we've been talking about it even during the show, right? If we can understand let's let's take **perinatal depression**. That's the that's the term that people will use. It's actually it's not it sounds like it's one thing like oh special form of depression but actually there's there's four different trajectories you can have. You can have depression during pregnancy only. You can have depression throughout pregnancy and the postpartum. You can have it only during the early postpartum or you can have it only in the late postpartum. And that suggests to me because our biomarkers which just means our biolic our inflammation, our metabolism, our hormones, even our social situation can change so dramatically across those different time periods. That suggests to me that they have different causes and probably, you know, and probably need different kinds of treatments. So again, it's beyond this oneizefits-all. Um we know pain mechanisms already differ between males and females and even **COVID-19 vaccines** I know vaccines un like inexplicably are controversial now I I don't know how we got here but nevertheless we are you take **COVID-19 vaccines** and we already know that for flu and **COVID-19 vaccines** females women in general have stronger responses to our vaccines so that would have suggested and I I don't know if we wrote that in the article but would have suggested that you know um with a shortage of vaccines in the in the across the world at that time, maybe women just needed a half dose or threequarters of a dose and we could have vaccinated other people that much faster.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 所以对我来说，那是一件小事，比如**Ambien**的剂量，疫苗的剂量，显然这是一个巨大的公平问题，但这种多样性将使我们更接近更好的治疗和更早的诊断。这就是为什么它如此重要，而且它会省钱。所以**麦肯锡**报告，如果没人想到其他事情，他们发布了一份报告，建议如果我们能缩小医学知识中的性别差距，我们每年可以为全球经济节省1万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Um so like to me that's a small thing like the the dose of **Ambien**, the dose of vaccines and and it obviously it's a huge equity issue, but that diversity will bring us closer to better treatments um earlier diagnosis. That's why it's so and it's going to save money. So the **McKenzie** report like if nobody else thinks of anything else um the they released a report suggesting that if we could achieve uh like reduce the gender gap in our medical knowledge, we could save the worldwide economy $1 trillion.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 每年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: A year.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 每年。他们对加拿大进行了估算，每年是370亿美元。现在，我认为这是一个低估，因为他们没有把所有东西都包括在这些估算中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: A year. And they've done the estimates for Canada and it's 37 billion again a year. Now, I think that's an underestimate because they're not including everything in those estimates, but.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，我们在播客中讨论过这一点。我们请了**麦肯锡**的人来谈论这一点，这是一个惊人的数字。而且，当你拥有多样性时，它会扩展知识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Yeah, we we did that on the podcast. We had someone from **Mackenzie** talking about that, which is an an astounding amount of money. Um, but also like when you do have diversity, it expands knowledge.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 如果你有盲点，我也有盲点。感觉就像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It uh if you have blind spots, I have blind spots. It just feels like it.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们已经多次谈到**NIH**。**美国**和**NIH**一直是研究领域的领导者。目前，由于现任政府优先事项的转变，正在进行大量削减。您认为加拿大应该扮演什么角色？这是我们挺身而出的机会吗？我知道您提到了6.4%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um you we've talked about the **NIH** a couple of time. Um the United States and the **NIH**, they have been a leader in research. Um there's a lot of cuts that are being done right now with the shifting priorities of the current administration. Uh what role do you see for Canada? Is this an opportunity for us to step up? I know it's 6.4% that you mentioned.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我是说，是的。对我来说，这很明显。为什么不接过旗帜，勇敢地飞翔呢？我还要说，多样性在我们的商业投资组合中也是如此，对吧？就像我认为金融，不是说我在这里，但我知道例如共同基金表现更好，对吧？就像分散你的投资一样，科学也是如此，因为我们不知道下一个伟大的发现会来自哪里。所以你希望多样化你的科学家，你希望多样化你的想法，因为如果你把所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，就不太可能像我们把许多鸡蛋放在许多不同的篮子里那样产生那么多发现。这就是为什么它如此重要。但绝对是加拿大挺身而出的时候了。我希望我们的政治家们能认识到，现在参议院有一项法案。最终的宣读，我想，是在二月底。那是S243号法案。如果人们认为女性健康值得关注，它是关于创建一个框架，以推动女性健康在研究、创新和护理获取方面的进展。我们有一个框架非常重要，这样我们才能知道如何最好地利用加拿大有限的资源。所以，我只是鼓励人们，如果这引起了他们的共鸣，就给他们的参议员和国会议员写信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: I mean yes. I mean to me that's an obvious thing. Why not take up the flag and fly bravely? And I will also say about diversity that's also true in our like business portfolios, right? Like I think finance not that I'm I'm out here but I know that mutual funds for example do better rights like diversify your investments the same thing with science because we don't know where the next great discovery is going to come from. So you want to diversify your scientists you want to diversify ideas because you put all your eggs in one basket. It's not likely to come up with as many discoveries as if we put many eggs in many different baskets. That's why it's so important. But absolutely it's time for Canada to step up. Um, I hope that our politicians recognize there's a bill right now before the Senate. The final reading, I think, is in the end of February. It's uh uh 243, I think, S243. Um, if people believe that women's health deserves, it's about um um creating a framework to um push forward progress for women's health both in terms of research, innovation, and our access to care. Um, it's really important that we have a framework so we know where to best place the limited resources we have in Canada. Uh, so I just encourage people to write their senators and their MPs about it if they uh, this resonates with them.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 但我确实认为这是加拿大填补这一空白的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: But I do think this is a place for Canada to to um, fill that gap.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 而且我认为我们真正需要的是我们自己的**冰桶挑战**。**冰桶挑战**在2014年为**ALS**（一种神经退行性疾病）筹集了1.15亿美元，五年后，该领域的出版物数量翻了一番，研究人员数量翻了一番。临床试验数量增加了10倍，甚至在治疗**ALS**方面也取得了进展，在短短大约10年的时间里。我们需要加拿大也为女性健康做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Uh, and really what I think we need is our own **icebucka challenge**. Um so I spark a challenge raised 115 million for **ALS** which is a neurodeenerative disorder in 2014 and and five years later it had doubled the number of publications doubled the number of researchers working in the area. There were 10 times the number of clinical trials and there has been some progress even in treatments for **ALS** in this very short time period really about 10 years now and we need that for Canada um for uh women's health in particular.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 因为我认为有时人们只是不知道，你知道，你不知道什么，对吧？我们开始对话时谈到了性别差异在大脑功能和疾病中的重要性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Because I think sometimes people just don't know what that you know what you know right um we began our conversation talking about the importance of sex differences in brain function and disease.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您发表了200多篇科学论文，您现在，您非常成功，您被誉为“全球少数几位将性和性别考量整合到研究设计中的神经科学家之一”。为什么这项工作对您很重要？在女性大脑健康研究的延迟中，我们失去了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You are credited with over 200 scientific publications and you are old now you're uh you're very accomplished and you are quote one of the few neuroscientists globally recognized for integrating sex and gender considerations into research design. Um why is this work important to you and what have we lost in this delay in research into women's brain health?

</details>

### 为女性寻求答案

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 我是说，所有我们一直在谈论的事情，对我来说，我非常高兴能在这个领域工作。我热爱我所做的工作。我热爱思考女性健康。我热爱思考，你知道，为什么会有这种差异，并试图从各个不同的角度来找出答案。它对我来说很重要，不仅仅因为我是女性，不仅仅因为我有一个女儿，或者，你知道，我妈妈大约十年前去世了，她患有**帕金森病**和**子宫内膜癌**以及**关节炎**。可怜的她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: I mean for all the same things that we've been talking about for me I'm I am like so thrilled to be in this area. I I I love doing the work I do. I love thinking about women's health. I love thinking about, you know, why there might be this disparity and trying looking at it from all different angles to try and figure this out. It matters to me because not just because I'm a woman, not just because I have a daughter or you know, my mom passed away about 10 years ago now and she had **Parkinson's disease** and end **endometrial cancer** as well as **arthritis**. The poor thing.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 是的。最后有点艰难，但她实际上对我说，她就像，你知道，**Lisa**，你为什么还没有找到**帕金森病**的治疗方法？我说，嗯，妈妈，第一，我不研究**帕金森病**；第二，如果很简单，我们早就解决了。对于女性健康问题也是如此。如果像**更年期激素疗法**能降低**痴呆症**风险那样简单，我们早就有了答案。我们没有，因为女性、**更年期**、**更年期激素疗法**存在太多不同的多样性。但是对我来说，这很重要，因为我想要为女性找到答案。我受够了。我受够了听到人们说他们的医生称他们为“医学之谜”，说我们不知道，或者他们无能为力，或者你是我最最讨厌的事情之一，就是你处于**更年期**。你去看医生，你说你正在经历潮热和盗汗，是的，你感觉不像自己，但医生却说：“它们困扰你吗？也许三个月后再回来看看你的情况。”不，如果你向你的医生或护士执业师透露你正在经历这些，那从定义上讲就意味着它们困扰着你，你已经注意到了它们，而且它们困扰着你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. Was a little bit rough at the end there, but she actually said to me, I like, you know, Lisa, why haven't you found a cure for **Parkinson's disease** yet? And I said, well, mom, I a um I don't study **Parkinson's disease** and b if it was simple, we would have figured it out already. And and that's going to be the same thing for women's health issues as well. If it was simple like **menopause hormone therapy** reduces the risk of **dementia**, we would have that answer already. We don't because there's so many different diversity in terms of women, menopause, **menopausal hormone therapy**. Um, but it's important to me because I want answers for women. I'm like I'm sick of it. I'm sick of going to hearing people say that they're their their doctor called them a medical mystery and that we don't know or there's nothing they can do for me or are you one of my biggest biggest pet peeves is you're menopausal. You go to your doctor, you say that you're having these hot flashes and night sweats and yeah it's um you don't feel like yourself and yet it's like well are they bothering you like maybe just come back in three months and we'll see how you're doing. No, if you're disclosing to your physician or your health your nurse practitioner that that you're having these that means by definition they're bother you've noticed them and they're bothering you.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Uh would I like to go on vacation more 100%.

It's not just going to be beneficial for women's health. It's going to help men's health. It's going to help gender diverse health. And I can give you examples of why I think that if you want please.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Yeah. You want.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 因为我们错过了，如果我们不考虑性和性别，如果我们不看这是否会产生差异，或者，你知道，这个人是什么类型，他们的社会经历，我们会错过，我们会错过现在本可以上市的关键药物。其中一种是**Lazaroids**。它是一种以**拉撒路**命名的药物，抱歉，显然不太符合圣经。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: Because we miss we miss the we if we're not taking into account sex and gender if we're not looking at whether that makes a difference or you know the type of person this is their social experiences we miss um we miss crucial drugs that could be on the market right now and one of them is **Lazaroids** uh it was a drug that was was named after **Lazaroid Lazarus** sorry obviously not very biblical.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 来自圣经。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: From the Bible.

</details>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 来自圣经，是的，**Lazaroid**是因为它真的能让人起死回生。所以如果他们中风了，它能让他们从床上起来。所以之前有非常棒的试验，但当他们最终进行随机对照试验时，他们的三期试验失败了。为什么失败了？它对男性有效，但对女性无效。所以我们现在市场上不再有这种本可以改变男性生活的药物。还有另一种药物，另一家公司测试用于**抑郁症**。它对女性非常有效。对男性完全无效，但他们不能将其推向市场，因为它不适用于所有人。我们必须摆脱这种思维方式。因为再次强调，它不是“一刀切”。我们都知道，我认为我们已经认识到，这是**精准医疗**，但我们错过了**精准医疗**不仅仅是关于我们的基因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: From the Bible yes the **Lazaroid** is because it literally rose people from the dead. So if they had a stroke, it rose them from the bed. Um so really great trials beforehand, but when they did their randomized control trial at the end, their fa what it's called phase three trial, it failed. Why did it fail? It worked in men. It didn't work in women. So we now no longer have this drug on the market that could have been a life changer for men. There's another drug that another company has tested for depression. Works really well in women. Doesn't work in men at all, but they can't bring it to market because it doesn't work for everyone. And and we have to get away from that kind of thinking about it. Um uh because again, it's not one sizefits-all. It's all I you know, we all we know already. I think we recognize already that it's **precision medicine**, but we we're we're missing **precision medicine** is not just about our genetics.

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: 而是关于我们的，因为性也是我们基因的一部分。总之，它是关于我们一路走来的经历，以及这些经历如何塑造了我们的健康。

**Dr. Lisa Galia**: But it's about our because sex is also part of our genetics actually anyway. It's about um our experiences along the way and how that's shaped us in our health.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您很棒。这里是《**Mistreated**》。感谢收听。您可以在任何您收听播客的地方关注我们的节目，这样您就可以在每次新节目发布时收到通知。我们很乐意听到您的反馈。您可以发送电子邮件至mistreatedodcast@tvbo.org，或通过我的社交渠道联系我。以下是上周节目中**安大略医学协会**主席**Zanab Abdul Ramen博士**的两位听众评论。第一条评论：“**安大略公共卫生局**在1999年发布研究称，到2030年我们将缺乏足够的医疗服务提供者。我们有远见，只是缺乏政治意愿。”关于这条评论，这里引用的研究是**Barry Chan**关于医生服务供应的研究。该研究表明，尽管1990年代医生数量有所增加，但医生的分布不均。城市地区有服务，但农村地区没有，这正是我们今天仍在努力解决的问题，包括急诊室关闭和新家庭医生排队时间过长。另一条评论：“我们应该拥有一个支持健康人口、易于获取且对所有人公平的系统。令人悲伤的是，感受到系统失败冲击的加拿大人，正是最需要这个系统的人。”一如既往，非常感谢您的评论，请给我们发送任何评论或赞扬。我们想听到所有声音。本周的节目由**Matthew Omera**和我制作，**Colin Kish**编辑。**Jonathan Hallowell**和**TVO**的数字媒体服务团队提供制作支持。**Lori F**是数字执行制片人。**John Ferry**是节目和内容副总裁。特别感谢我们的演播室工作人员，让播客看起来如此精彩。我们非常感谢。一如既往，感谢您的收听。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You were great. This was **Mistreated**. Thanks for listening. You can follow our show wherever you get your podcast so you can get notified each time a new episode is available. We would love to hear your feedback. You can write me an email at mistreatedodcast@tvbo.org or reach out to me on my social channels. Here are two comments from our episode last week featuring the **Ontario Medical Association** President **Dr. Zanab Abdul Ramen**. The first comment, **Ontario Public Health** published research in 1999 that we would run out of enough healthcare providers in 2030. We had foresight just not political will. And just to reference that comment, the study being cited here is on the supply of physician services from a researcher named **Barry Chan**. What the research showed was that even though the number of physicians had gone up during the 1990s, the distribution of those doctors was uneven. So, urban areas were serviced, but not rural areas, which is something we continue to grapple with even today with emergency room closures and huge lineups for new family doctors. Another comment, we deserve a system that supports a healthy population, is easy to access, and equitable for all. It is sad that the Canadians feeling the brunt of the system failures are the ones who need the system the most. As always, thank you so much for your comments and send us anything comments, kudos. We want to hear it all. This week's episode was produced by **Matthew Omera** and me and edited by **Colin Kish**. Production support from **Jonathan Hallowell** and **TVO's** digital media services team. **Lori F** is the executive producer of digital. **John Ferry** is vice president programming and content. And special thanks to our studio crew here for making the podcast look so fantastic. We appreciate it. And thanks always for listening.
