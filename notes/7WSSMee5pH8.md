title: "摆脱大脑的“预设脚本”：如何拿回人生的主导权？"
summary: "本文探讨了认知心理学中的“认知脚本”概念，揭示了“续集脚本”、“取悦脚本”和“史诗脚本”如何潜移默化地限制我们的职业、情感与成功观。通过识别这些自动化思维，并将内心独白中的“我应该”替换为“我可以”，我们可以打破心理局限，转向以好奇心为导向的实验性生活。"

### 什么是认知脚本？

**认知脚本**（Cognitive Script: 大脑中内化的行为模式，告诉我们在特定情境下该如何行动）是一种内化的行为模式，它告诉我们该如何行动，或者至少是我们“认为”在某些情况下应该如何行动。它们对于日常生活中的常规任务和决策非常有帮助。**1979年的一项开创性研究**首次发现了认知脚本，研究人员发现，人们在类似的情况下（如去看医生或去餐厅）会遵循非常相似的脚本。从那时起，研究人员在你生活的各个领域都发现了这些认知脚本。

A cognitive script is an internalized behavioral pattern that tells us how we're supposed or at least how we think we're supposed to act in certain situations. They can be very helpful for routine tasks and decisions in everyday life. Cognitive scripts were first discovered in a seminal 1979 study, where researchers found that people are following very similar scripts in similar situations, such as going to the doctor or going to the restaurant. And since then, they have found those cognitive scripts in all areas of your life.

### 常规生活的“自动化导航”

对于日常的常规决策，认知脚本实际上非常实用且有益。例如，你知道当你去看医生时，你应该在候诊室等待，然后有人会喊你的名字。接着，你会进入医生办公室，并开始向他们陈述你的问题。你知道你应该按照什么顺序完成这些不同的动作。这很棒，也很有用，而且每次去看医生时你都不必过度思考，这确实是一件好事。

For routine everyday decisions, cognitive scripts are actually very practical and useful. For example, you know that when you're going to go to the doctor, you're supposed to wait in the waiting room and then someone is going to call your name. And then, you're going to go into doctor's office and this is where you're going to start telling them about whatever the issue is, right? And you know in which order you're supposed to do all of those different actions. Great, useful, and it's a pretty good thing that you don't have to overthink it every time you go to the doctor.

### 脚本如何限制重大人生抉择

认知脚本的问题在于，当我们使用它们来做生活中更重要的决策时——比如在我们的**职业生涯**（Careers）或**人际关系**（Relationships）中。我们没有问自己“这真的是我想做的吗？这是我的决定吗？”，而是让我们的选择被那些我们已经内化的故事所驱动，被那些告诉我们在某种情况下“应该”如何表现的脚本所驱动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The problem with cognitive scripts is when we use them to make more important decisions in our lives, in our careers, in our relationships, instead of asking ourselves, is that really what I want to do, is that my decision, we let our choices being driven by those stories that we have internalized by those scripts that tell us how we're supposed to behave in a certain situation.
</details>

### 续集脚本：对连贯性的执念

其中一个脚本是**续集脚本**（Sequel Script: 认为当下的行为必须与过去保持一致，以维持人生叙事连贯性的心理倾向）。在这个脚本中，我们觉得既然过去一直以某种方式行动，那么我们就必须继续以同样的方式行动。我们觉得叙事需要有合理性。正是这种脚本让人们选择与他们在大学所学专业相符的职业；也是这种脚本让人们不断地与以前约会过的同类人交往。总的来说，这个脚本让我们重复过去的相同行为和模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of these scripts is the Sequel Script. That's the script where we feel like we've always behaved in a certain way, so we're going to keep on behaving in the same way. We feel like the narrative needs to make sense. This is the script that makes people choose careers that are aligned with whatever they studied at university. That is the script that makes people keep on dating the same kind of people they've been dating before. And this is in general the script that makes us repeat the exact same behaviors and patterns that we've had in the past.
</details>

### 为何我们难以跳出旧模式？

在人际关系中，特别有趣的是我们希望“续集”能与之前的经历产生关联。这可能意味着寻找完全相同类型的人，或者根据前任的特质来选择下一个人。他们看起来可能完全相反，但事实是，我们仍然是基于与之前经历的**连贯性**（Continuity）来选择这个人的。续集脚本显然限制了我们在生活中探索的可能性，因为我们觉得接下来的任何决定都需要与过去的决定挂钩。我们忽略了许多更出人意料的决定，而那些决定可能是成长、探索和自我发现的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

In relationships in particular, what's very interesting is that we want the Sequel to connect to whatever the previous experience was. So, that might mean dating the exact same type of person or choosing the next person in response to whoever we were dating before. And they might look like the complete opposite, but the truth is we still pick this person based on the sense of continuity with whatever the previous experience was before. With the Sequel Script, it's quite obvious why it limits the possibilities that we might explore in life, because we feel like whatever decision we're making next needs to make sense in relation to the decisions we made in the past. We ignore a lot of more left field, unexpected type of decisions that might be opportunities for growth, and exploration, and self discovery.
</details>

### 取悦脚本：活在他人的期待里

另一个主宰我们生活的认知脚本是**取悦脚本**（Crowdpleaser Script: 优先满足他人需求或社会期待，而非自身真实愿望的心理模式）。在这个脚本中，我们根据什么最能取悦周围的人来做决定。通常，这些人是我们的**父母**。我们做决定可能是为了让他们觉得你很安全、很成功。但取悦脚本的观众也可以是你的朋友、伴侣或同事。当你遵循取悦脚本时，你没有意识到你并不是根据自己想要什么、什么能让自己快乐来做决定，而是基于什么能让周围的人快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Another cognitive script that rules our life is the Crowdpleaser Script. This is the script where we make decisions based on whatever is going to please people around us the most. Quite often, those are the people are our parents. We might make decisions based on whatever is going to make them feel like you're safe and successful. But the audience for the Crowdpleaser Script can also be your friends, can be your partner, can be your colleagues. And what you don't realize when you follow the Crowdpleaser Script is that you're not making decisions based on what you want and what would make you happy, but based on what will make others around you happy.
</details>

### 史诗脚本：成功学的陷阱

最后是**史诗脚本**（Epic Script: 认为人生必须取得宏大、非凡的成就才算有意义的极端价值观），这个脚本非常隐蔽，因为它在我们的社会中备受推崇。这个脚本告诉我们，无论你做什么，它必须是宏大的、充满野心的、有影响力的。任何程度稍差的事情都被视为失败。史诗脚本是“追随梦想”这一理念的极端版本。正因为如此，它在“平凡、简单的生活”周围制造了一种**病耻感**（Stigma）。一种专注于当下快乐、专注当下、建立连接和探索好奇心的生活被忽视了。因为如果你没有那些成功的外部标志，如果你没有追求伟大的激情，那么你真的在过有意义的生活吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Finally, there's the Epic Script, and this one is very insidious because it's actually celebrated in our society. It's the script that says that whatever you do, it needs to be big, it needs to be very ambitious, it needs to be impactful. Anything less than that is failure. The Epic Script is an extreme version of the idea of following your dreams. And because of that, it has created a form of stigma around having a small, simple life. A life that is focused on just being happy in the moment, being present, being connected, and exploring your curiosity. Because if you don't have those external signs of success, if you're not following your grant passion, then are you really living a meaningful life?
</details>

### 被神化的“使命感”

这种由史诗脚本创造的问题会诱发焦虑。细想一下，这是一种非常近视的成功定义，我们试图把所有的鸡蛋都放在同一个篮子里。我们选择这一件事并说：“如果我在这件事上成功了，那我的人生就成功了。”问题在于，如果我们在这个特定的项目或目标上失败了，我们会觉得整个生命都失败了。此外，把所有鸡蛋放进一个篮子的另一个问题是，有时篮子变得太重，我们会彻底失手。在现代高度互联的网络世界中，史诗脚本不幸地变得非常流行。我们变得过度痴迷于**寻找使命**（Finding purpose）。在过去的二十年里，书籍中“寻找你的使命”这一短语的使用量飙升了 **700%**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

This is the anxiety inducing question that is created by the Epic Script. When you think about it, this is a very myopic definition of success where we try to put all of our eggs in the same basket. We choose this one thing and we say, "If I succeed to this, then I'm successful in life." The problem with this is that if we fail at this particular project, this particular goal, we feel like we have failed at life entirely. And the other problem with putting all of our eggs in the same basket is that then sometimes the basket just becomes too heavy and we drop it all together. Our modern hyperconnected online world has made the Epic Script, unfortunately, very, very popular with people. We have become overly obsessed with finding our purpose. Mentions in books of the phrase, "find your purpose," have surged 700% in the past two decades only.

### 幸存者偏差的误导

我们看到了无数关于那些找到了激情并因此过得很幸福的人的成功故事。我们看到那些追随激情并获得巨大的成功的企业家，但我们没有看到成千上万尝试了同样的事情却失败的人。这被称为**幸存者偏差**（Survivorship Bias: 逻辑错误，指过度关注在某些过程中幸存的人或事，而忽略了那些没有幸存的人或事，从而导致错误的结论）。非常不幸的是，现在我们所有的决策甚至**自我价值**（Self-worth）都是基于这些不完整的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

We see all of those stories of success of people who have found their passion and who are very happy as a result of this. We see the entrepreneur that followed their passion and was very successful, but we don't see all of the thousands of other ones that have tried the exact same thing and failed. This is called survivorship bias, and it's very unfortunate how nowadays we are basing all of our decisions and even our self-worth based on that incomplete information.

### 从“我应该”到“我可以”

一旦你识别了主宰你生活的认知脚本，你就可以从中挣脱出来。这始于将它们视为我们告诉自己的“故事”，而不是我们必须盲目遵循的真理。一个很好的方法是，每当你听到自己说“**我应该**（I should）做某事”时，停下来思考一秒钟。“应该”这个词实际上是一个非常好的信号，表明这里可能存在某种认知脚本。一旦你确定了生活中使用这个词的情境，你就可以决定用另一个词“**我可以**（Might）”来代替它。我想做什么，而不是我应该做什么？我想探索什么？我想实验什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Once you have identified the cognitive scripts that rule your life, you can actually break free from them, and it really starts by seeing them as stories we tell ourselves rather than truth that we need to follow blindly. A really good way to do this is to stop for a second every time you hear yourself saying, "I should do this." This word should is actually a really good signal that there might be a cognitive script at play somewhere here. And once you've identified the places in your life and the situations in your life where you are using that word, should, you can then decide to replace that word with another word, might. What might I want to do instead of what should I do. What might I want to explore? What might I want to experiment with?

### 重新编写你的人生脚本

如果你想开始编写自己的人生脚本，在设计下一次尝试时，可以问自己三个问题：
1. 我是在**追随过去**，还是在**发现路径**？
2. 我是在**追随大众**，还是在**发现部落**？
3. 我是在**追随激情**，还是在**发现好奇心**？

这三个问题结合在一起，能让你拥抱我们所处的**阈限空间**（Liminal Space: 指一种过渡状态，处于“既非此处也非彼处”的中间地带），与不确定性交朋友，开始更多的尝试。更重要的是，去应对那三个在潜意识层面影响我们许多决定的强大认知脚本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

If you wanna start writing your own scripts in life, there are three questions that you can ask yourself while designing your next experiment. The first one is am I following my past or discovering my path? The second one is am I following the crowd or am I discovering my tribe? And then finally, am I following my passion or am I discovering my curiosity? Those three questions together allow you to embrace the liminal space we're all in, to make friends with uncertainty, to start experimenting more, and very importantly, to deal with those three powerful cognitive scripts that underlie a lot of our decisions on an unconscious level.
