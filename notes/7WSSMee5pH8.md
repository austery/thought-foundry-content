### 什么是认知脚本

认知脚本是一种内化的行为模式，告诉我们如何在特定情况下表现，或者至少我们认为自己应该如何表现。它们在日常生活中非常有用，可以帮助我们处理例行任务和决策。认知脚本首先在1979年的一项具有里程碑意义的研究中被发现，研究人员发现人们在类似情况下会遵循非常相似的脚本，比如去看医生或去餐厅。

### 续集脚本：延续过去的模式

续集脚本是一种脚本，我们觉得自己一直以某种方式表现，所以我们将继续以同样的方式表现。我们希望叙述有意义。这种脚本使人们选择与大学所学专业相符的职业。它使人们继续与以前交往过的类型的人约会。总的来说，这种脚本使我们重复过去曾经有的相同行为和模式。在人际关系中，我们希望续集与之前的经历相连。这可能意味着与完全相反的人约会，但实际上，我们仍然根据与之前经历的连续性选择这个人。

### 取悦脚本：寻求他人的认同

取悦脚本是一种脚本，我们根据周围的人最喜欢什么来做出决定。通常，这些人是我们的父母。我们可能会根据能让他们觉得安全和成功的事情来做出决定。但取悦脚本的受众也可能是你的朋友、伴侣或同事。当你遵循取悦脚本时，你并没有根据你想要什么、什么会让你快乐来做出决定，而是根据让周围的人快乐来决定。

### 史诗脚本：追求极致的成功

史诗脚本是一种脚本，它说无论你做什么，都需要伟大，需要非常有雄心，需要有影响力。任何低于这个标准的事情都是失败。史诗脚本是追逐梦想的极端版本。因此，它在我们的社会中造成了一种对简单生活的耻辱感。一个专注于当下快乐、存在、联系和探索好奇心的生活。如果没有这些外部成功的迹象，如果你没有追逐你的宏伟激情，那么你是否真正过着有意义的生活？

### 如何摆脱认知脚本

一旦你识别了控制你生活的认知脚本，你就可以摆脱它们，真正的做法是把它们看作我们告诉自己的故事，而不是我们盲目遵循的真相。一个很好的做法是，每当你听到自己说“我应该这样做”时停下来。这个“应该”实际上是一个很好的信号，表明可能存在认知脚本。识别出你生活中使用“应该”的地方和情况后，你可以决定用另一个词“可能”取代它。我可能想做什么，而不是我应该做什么。我可能想探索什么？我可能想尝试什么？

### 三个问题帮助你摆脱脚本

如果你想开始在生活中编写自己的脚本，有三个问题可以在设计下一个实验时问自己。第一个问题是，我是在遵循过去还是在发现我的道路？第二个问题是，我是在遵循大众还是在发现我的部落？第三个问题是，我是在遵循我的激情还是在发现我的好奇心？这三个问题一起让你拥抱我们都处于的过渡空间，与不确定性交朋友，开始更多地实验，并非常重要地处理那些在潜意识中影响我们许多决定的三个强大的认知脚本。

<summary>Original English</summary>
- A cognitive script is an internalized behavioral pattern that tells us how we're supposed or at least how we think we're supposed to act in certain situations. They can be very helpful for routine tasks and decisions in everyday life. Cognitive scripts were first discovered in a seminal 1979 study, where researchers found that people are following very similar scripts in similar situations, such as going to the doctor or going to the restaurant. And since then, they have found those cognitive scripts in all areas of your life.

For routine everyday decisions, cognitive scripts are actually very practical and useful. For example, you know that when you're going to go to the doctor, you're supposed to wait in the waiting room and then someone is going to call your name. And then, you're going to go into doctor's office and this is where you're going to start telling them about whatever the issue is, right? And you know in which order you're supposed to do all of those different actions. Great, useful, and it's a pretty good thing that you don't have to overthink it every time you go to the doctor.

The problem with cognitive scripts is when we use them to make more important decisions in our lives, in our careers, in our relationships, instead of asking ourselves, is that really what I want to do, is that my decision, we let our choices being driven by those stories that we have internalized by those scripts that tell us how we're supposed to behave in a certain situation.

One of these scripts is the Sequel Script. That's the script where we feel like we've always behaved in a certain way, so we're going to keep on behaving in the same way. We feel like the narrative needs to make sense. This is the script that makes people choose careers that are aligned with whatever they studied at university. That is the script that makes people keep on dating the same kind of people they've been dating before. And this is in general the script that makes us repeat the exact same behaviors and patterns that we've had in the past.

In relationships in particular, what's very interesting is that we want the Sequel to connect to whatever the previous experience was. So, that might mean dating the exact same type of person or choosing the next person in response to whoever we were dating before. And they might look like the complete opposite, but the truth is we still pick this person based on the sense of continuity with whatever the previous experience was before.

With the Sequel Script, it's quite obvious why it limits the possibilities that we might explore in life, because we feel like whatever decision we're making next needs to make sense in relation to the decisions we made in the past. We ignore a lot of more left field, unexpected type of decisions that might be opportunities for growth, and exploration, and self discovery.

Another cognitive script that rules our life is the Crowdpleaser Script. This is the script where we make decisions based on whatever is going to please people around us the most. Quite often, those are the people are our parents. We might make decisions based on whatever is going to make them feel like you're safe and successful. But the audience for the Crowdpleaser Script can also be your friends, can be your partner, can be your colleagues.

And what you don't realize when you follow the Crowdpleaser Script is that you're not making decisions based on what you want and what would make you happy, but based on what will make others around you happy.

Finally, there's the Epic Script, and this one is very insidious because it's actually celebrated in our society. It's the script that says that whatever you do, it needs to be big, it needs to be very ambitious, it needs to be impactful. Anything less than that is failure. The Epic Script is an extreme version of the idea of following your dreams. And because of that, it has created a form of stigma around having a small, simple life. A life that is focused on just being happy in the moment, being present, being connected, and exploring your curiosity.

Because if you don't have those external signs of success, if you're not following your grant passion, then are you really living a meaningful life? This is the anxiety inducing question that is created by the Epic Script.

When you think about it, this is a very myopic definition of success where we try to put all of our eggs in the same basket. We choose this one thing and we say, "If I succeed to this, then I'm successful in life." The problem with this is that if we fail at this particular project, this particular goal, we feel like we have failed at life entirely.

And the other problem with putting all of our eggs in the same basket is that then sometimes the basket just becomes too heavy and we drop it all together.

Our modern hyperconnected online world has made the Epic Script, unfortunately, very, very popular with people. We have become overly obsessed with finding our purpose. Mentions in books of the phrase, "find your purpose," have surged 700% in the past two decades only.

We see all of those stories of success of people who have found their passion and who are very happy as a result of this. We see the entrepreneur that followed their passion and was very successful, but we don't see all of the thousands of other ones that have tried the exact same thing and failed. This is called survivorship bias, and it's very unfortunate how nowadays we are basing all of our decisions and even our self-worth based on that incomplete information.

Once you have identified the cognitive scripts that rule your life, you can actually break free from them, and it really starts by seeing them as stories we tell ourselves rather than truth that we need to follow blindly.

A really good way to do this is to stop for a second every time you hear yourself saying, "I should do this." This word should is actually a really good signal that there might be a cognitive script at play somewhere here.

And once you've identified the places in your life and the situations in your life where you are using that word, should, you can then decide to replace that word with another word, might. What might I want to do instead of what should I do. What might I want to explore? What might I want to experiment with?

If you wanna start writing your own scripts in life, there are three questions that you can ask yourself while designing your next experiment. The first one is am I following my past or discovering my path? The second one is am I following the crowd or am I discovering my tribe? And then finally, am I following my passion or am I discovering my curiosity?

Those three questions together allow you to embrace the liminal space we're all in, to make friends with uncertainty, to start experimenting more, and very importantly, to deal with those three powerful cognitive scripts that underlie a lot of our decisions on an unconscious level.
