### 青春期的失明经历

**Molly Burke**: 很高兴你能来。你今天怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: Great to have you. How are you doing today?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 很好，非常感谢。我很期待这次聊天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: Good. Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to chatting.

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 我想以你书中的一句话开始我们的对话。书中写道：“仅仅因为我预见到有一天会发生这种情况，并不意味着我已经为此做好了准备，或者永远不可能做好准备。” 让我们面对现实吧，没有什么是去“失明”的容易时机，但我认为，在青春期中期失明，很有可能是最糟糕的。宇宙并没有对我格外开恩。作为一个经历这种改变人生的变化的青少年，那是什么样的感觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I want to start off our conversation uh with a quote from your book. It reads, "Just because I was aware this would happen someday doesn't mean I was ready for it or ever could be." And let's face it, there's no easy time to go blind, but I argue that doing it in the midst of puberty is quite possibly one of the worst. The universe was doing me no favors. What was it like as a teenager going through this lifealtering change?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 正如我在那句话中所说，这可能是我能选到的最糟糕的时机了。你知道，成为一个青少年本身就非常艰难。我们没有给青少年足够的宽容。从孩子到青少年再到青春期，这个转变过程真的很难。而我正处于那个阶段，你开始发现自己的风格，而不仅仅是你妈妈给你穿的衣服。你开始听自己的音乐，而不是仅仅听广播里播放的。你开始考虑约会和性。你满脸痘痘，荷尔蒙在作祟。然后，失去视力，感觉我的整个世界都颠倒了，我的同龄人很难理解，因为他们中的很多人觉得他们自己也在经历各种事情，很难让他们感同身受并理解失明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: As I said uh in that quote, like it's probably one of the worst times I could have picked. You know, being a teenager is so hard. We don't give teenagers enough grace. It's really hard going from that transition of kid to pre-teen to teen. And I was just in the midst of that, that time in your life when you're starting to discover your own sense of style, uh not just what your mom puts you in. You're starting to listen to your own music, not just what's playing in the on the radio. You're starting to maybe figure out dating and sexuality. You're full of acne and hormones erasing. Uh and and then to lose your vision, it's like my whole world was just flipped upside down and it was so difficult for my peers to understand because a lot of them felt like they were going through stuff and it was hard for them to empathize and understand blindness.

</details>

### 社会视角与歧视

**Molly Burke**: 你提到了你的同龄人，我想和他们聊聊。在你童年时期，你不仅遭受了一些同龄人的欺凌，还遭受了生活中一些成年人的欺凌，而你本应期望那里是一个安全的空间，一个你可以寻求帮助的地方。你是如何处理这些复杂的关系的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: You were talking about your peers. I want to talk about them. In your childhood, you not only faced a lot of bullying from some of them, but you also faced some from adults in your life where you would expect that would be sort of a safe space, a place that if you needed help, you can go to. How did you navigate those complex relationships?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 回顾过去，我常常觉得，失明最艰难的部分不是我再也看不见了。而是社会对我如此不同地对待，而我内心感觉自己还是那个人。我的热情、我的兴趣、我的智慧、我的幽默感，所有这些都还是老样子。但突然之间，我的同学们对待我的方式变了。我的老师对待我的方式变了。街上的陌生人对待我的方式也变了，因为他们看到我使用导盲犬或拐杖，或者阅读盲文。他们意识到“她是个盲人”。突然之间，他们好像看不见我了。不是我看不见他们，而是他们看不见我，看不见真正的我。而这非常难以适应。我认为，如果这个障碍被移除，我走向自我接纳、走向治愈、我的心理健康之旅将会容易得多。这也是为什么我现在做我现在的工作。因为我知道我经历的很多社会评判，我面对的很多**残障歧视**，并非出于仇恨，而是出于无知。人们历史上从未获得过关于**残障**、关于**失明**的准确信息。我希望改变这一点，以期改变社会的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: When I look back, I often think one of the hardest parts about going blind was not that I could no longer see. It was that society treated me so differently when inside I felt like the same person. My passions, my interests, my intelligence, my humor, all of that was still the same. But all of a sudden, my classmates are treating me differently. My teachers are treating me differently. Strangers on the street are treating me differently because they're seeing me using a guide dog or a cane or reading Braille. And they're realizing she's blind. And all of a sudden, it was like they couldn't see me. It wasn't just that I couldn't see them, they couldn't see me, the real me. And that was incredibly difficult to navigate. And I think if that barrier had been removed, my journey uh to self-acceptance, to healing, my mental health journey would have been a whole lot easier. Which is why I now do the work that I do. Because I know so much of the judgment I've experienced from society, so much of the ableism that I've faced is not out of hatred. It's out of ignorance. People have not historically been given accurate access to learning about disability, about blindness. And I want to change that in the hopes of changing societal perceptions.

### 医疗模式与社会模式

**Molly Burke**: 你谈到你的书，书中有一个你使用的说法叫“治愈文化”。请解释一下你对此的理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: You talk about your book, there's this saying you use called cure culture. Uh help us understand what do you mean by that?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 在社会中，我们倾向于遵循所谓的“**残障医疗模式**”。而我更倾向于“**残障社会模式**”。所以，医疗模式的理念是，每个残障人士都需要被治愈。他们需要被改变、修复、治愈、变得完整，以适应我们的社会。我认为这是极其有害的论调。现实是，大多数残障人士一生中都无法被治愈。因此，在这种假设下工作，即世界上每个人都认为你需要改变，而你对此无能为力，你如何能自信？如何能感到完整？如何能觉得自己足够好？所以我更倾向于**残障社会模式**，其理念是，**残障**的“治愈”在于**可及性**。**残障**的“治愈”在于改变社会观念。**残障**的“治愈”在于建立一个能够让所有生活在其中者蓬勃发展的世界。这样做的好处是，它不仅能释放我自身的能力，例如，如果我在餐厅拿到一份**盲文菜单**，我完全有能力选择我想要的，但如果我没有，那么我的伴侣、家人或朋友就必须为我读出来。突然之间，我变得“残障”了。我因什么而残障？我的视力损失？不。因为如果有盲文，我就可以读。我因**不可及性**而残障。所以，如果我们改变这一点，它对我有利，同样也使其他所有人受益。每一天，非残障人士都在受益于那些最初为残障人士创造的创新。比如你喝水的吸管，比如你推婴儿车过马路时路缘的坡道，让这一切都容易得多。那些都是为残障人士设计的创新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: In society, we kind of run under what's called the medical model of disability. And I more so lean on the social model of disability. So the medical model is the idea that everybody with a disability needs to be cured. They need to be changed, fixed, healed, made whole to fit into our society. And I believe that that is extremely damaging rhetoric. The reality is most people with disabilities will never be cured within their lifetime. And so to to work under the assumption that everybody in the world thinks you need to change and you're powerless to do anything about that. How can you be confident? How can you feel whole? How can you feel good enough? So I really run under the social model of disability, which is the idea that the cure for disability is accessibility. The cure for disability is changing societal attitudes. The cure for disability is building a world that allows everybody who's currently living in it to thrive. And what that does is it not only unlocks my own capabilities, for example, if I'm given a braille menu at a restaurant, I'm perfectly capable of picking what I want, but if I'm not, now my partner or my family or friends have to read it to me. All of a sudden, I am disabled. What am I What am I disabled by? My vision loss? No. Because if I have braille, I could read it. I'm disabled by the inaccessibility. And so if we change that, it benefits me, but equally it benefits everybody else. Every single day, non-disabled people are benefiting from innovations that were originally created for disabled people. Like the straw that you drink out of, like the slope in the curb when you cross the street with your stroller that makes it so much easier. Those were innovations for disabled people.

</details>

### 组织剥削与自我赋权

**Molly Burke**: 我想稍微谈谈，你的书反映了那些组织曾经利用、剥削你，并利用你渴望帮助他人的急切心情的经历。很明显，你已经走出了那些困境，并且仍在做你一直想做的事情，但有没有一个时刻，让你突然明白了什么？你知道，你四岁时就做了第一次公开演讲。所以，你做这件事已经很久了，但有没有一个时刻，让你突然明白了，关于那些组织，他们想要的和你的期望可能不匹配？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I want to talk uh a little bit about what your book reflects on is the experiences that um unfortunat that organizations sort of took advantage exploited you um and and prayed on your eagerness to help others. It is very clear that uh you have come on the other side of that and you were still doing what you've always wanted to do but was there a moment where it sort of clicked for you? you know, you I think it was you were four years old when you first did your first sort of public speaking. So, you've been doing this for quite a while, but was there a moment when it clicked uh in terms of the organizations and what they were looking for maybe didn't match with what you wanted?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 我觉得这是一个缓慢的揭示过程。而且我认为，即使是坐下来写我的书，也是在连接那些点滴的感悟。写书是一次非常大的情感体验，因为你被迫进行极其深刻的反思，你以一种我们通常不会坐下来去做的方式来审视你的人生。这让我产生了一些最终的领悟，这些领悟坦白说非常有治愈作用。写这本书很艰难，需要挖掘很多那些记忆，但同样，我觉得我需要这样做，来卸下这些记忆和故事的重担，真正地建立起那些为我带来治愈的联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I think it was really like a slow unraveling and I think even just in sitting down and writing my book, it was connecting some of those dots. Uh, writing a book is a very big emotional experience because you're forced to be so incredibly reflective and you're looking at your life as a whole in a way that we don't usually sit down and do. And it kind of made me have some of those like final realizations that were honestly extremely healing. Writing this book was very difficult to drudge up a lot of those memories, but it was equally something I feel like I needed to do to unbburden myself of these memories, these stories, and and really draw those connections that created healing for me.

</details>

### 品牌合作与价值坚守

**Molly Burke**: 你现在合作的品牌可能比你职业生涯中任何时候都要多。所以，我很想知道，你是如何确保自己不会处于那种境地，你知道，将来或者即使是现在？在我经营自己的公司之前，你知道，当我为其他组织和慈善机构工作时，我基本上就是一个傀儡。我就是一个发言人。我被付钱去做他们想让我做的事情。而现在，没有人能那样做。如果我觉得自己没有被倾听，如果我觉得有**代币化**（tokenism）的嫌疑，如果我觉得不被尊重，我就会放弃很多交易。我现在拥有完全的自主权，可以与完全符合我价值观的品牌、组织、公司合作，他们尊重我，他们找我是因为想要我的意见、我的声音。他们不是来找我说“我们要你像个小丑一样跳舞”，就像我感觉我童年和二十几岁时的大部分时间一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: You probably work with more brands now than you ever done in your career. So, I'm curious, how did you ensure that you're not in that position uh you know, in the future or even now? Prior to running my own business, you know, when I worked for for other organizations and charities, I was there essentially as a puppet. I was there as a talking head. I was being paid to do what they wanted me to do. And now, nobody can do that. the amount of times that I will walk away from a deal if I don't feel like I am being listened to, if I feel like tokenism is at play, um, if I don't feel respected, I have complete autonomy now to to work with brands, organizations, companies who completely align with my values, who respect me, who are coming to me because they want my opinion, my voice. They're not coming to me saying we want you to dance monkey dance the way I felt like so much of my childhood and early 20s was.

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 我很好奇，这种情况现在还会发生吗？品牌找到你，但仍然不了解**Molly Burke**是谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I am curious, does that still happen uh to this day where brands approach you but still don't understand who Molly Burke is?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 当然。我，你知道，我最近就遇到过这种情况，我尽了我最大的努力为自己辩护，解释我的立场，为什么这对我很重要，但最终我意识到，尽管客户口头上说“是的，我们同意你”，但他们的行为却表明了相反的意思。我不得不非常礼貌地说，我尊重你们的使命，但它与我的价值观和使命不同。所以，我认为最好是你们能找到另一个合作伙伴来完成你们真正想做的项目，这样我才能做我需要做的工作。而且，你知道，归根结底，是的，我需要付账单。我经营一家公司。生活需要花钱，但我也绝不会牺牲我的道德或我的价值观。我的工作不是一份工作。我不是在这里告诉你去买唇彩。我在这里是让你改变对**残障**的看法，改变我们对设计和营销的思考方式，改变我们说话和思考的方式。这具有巨大的分量，我不会轻视它，因为我知道我只能分享我作为一个**盲人**的视角和经历。我不能代表整个社群发言，但同时，我代表着一个社群，我非常认真地对待这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: Of course. I you know I was just recently in one of those situations where I did everything in my power to to advocate for myself to explain my stance why it was important to me and eventually I realized that as much as the the the client was kind of saying in words yes we agree with you their actions were showing otherwise and I had to very politely say like I respect your mission but it differs from my values and my mission. And so I think it's best that you find a different partner to pursue the project that you're really looking to do so that I can do the work that I need to do. And you know, at the end of the day, yes, I need to pay bills. I run a business. The world costs money, but also I will never sacrifice my morals or my values. My my work is not a job. I'm not here telling you to buy a lip gloss. I'm here telling you to change your perspective on disability, to change the way we think of design and marketing, uh to change the way we speak and think. And that holds so much weight and I don't take that lightly because I know that I can only share my perspective and my experience as a blind person. I can't speak for a whole community, but also I am representing a community and I take that extremely seriously.

</details>

### 财务独立的重要性

**Molly Burke**: 你提到了账单，所以我想问一点关于钱的问题。在财务独立方面，这是你在书中一直谈论的事情，你对此非常坦诚，你知道，早期你和父母住在一起，他们非常支持。但这对你来说为什么如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: You had mentioned bills, so I'm going to ask a little bit about money. Uh, in terms of financial independence, uh, that's something you talk about throughout your book and you're quite open about, you know, living with your parents in the early parts and how supportive they've been. But why is that so important for you?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 作为一个**盲人**女性，我缺乏很多自由。我缺乏很多独立。我缺乏很多自主权。我的身体无法像我们身体“应该”做的那样运作。所以，生活在一个没有考虑到这一点、没有为此设计的世界里，只会给我设置重重障碍。而**财务**是许多**残障人士**面临的巨大障碍。你知道，加拿大有80%的**盲人**失业。我目前居住的美国，有70%到80%的**盲人**失业。这是一个巨大的问题，而且大多数**残障人士**被迫依靠政府援助生活，但要说清楚的是，这根本无法维持生计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: Being a blind woman, I lack so much freedom. I lack so much independence. I lack so much autonomy. My body doesn't do what our bodies are, you know, supposed to do. And so living in a world that hasn't considered that and hasn't been designed for that, it just puts all these roadblocks in my way. And finance is a huge roadblock for so many with disabilities. You know, 80% of blind people in Canada are unemployed. 70 to 80% of blind people in the United States where I live now are unemployed. This is a massive issue and majority of disabled people are forced to live on government assistance which to be very clear is is not livable.

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 支付不了账单。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Does not pay the bills. Yeah.

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 无法维持生计，而且我向你保证，没有人会想靠这个生活。我知道，因为我曾靠这个生活，而且我有很多朋友现在还在靠这个生活，他们正努力摆脱它。这是一个恶性循环。这是一个系统性的问题，它让我们失败，并使我们**残障人士**处于被压迫的地位。我非常害怕这一点。从很小的时候起，我就一直致力于弄清楚如何才能不陷入这个循环并继续下去。我想认识到，我能够做到这一点是一种极大的**特权**，而那些做不到的**残障人士**，这并非他们自身的失败，而是社会的失败。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: It's not livable and nobody I guarantee you nobody who's on it wants to be on it. I know because I've been on it and I have many friends who are still on it who are trying so hard to get off. And it's it's a vicious cycle. It's it's a systemic issue that fails us and that keeps us in that oppressed position as disabled people. And I feared that so greatly. And I was really dedicated from a very young age to try to figure out how can I not fall under that cycle and continue it. And I want to recognize that it's an extreme privilege that I've been able to do that and that disabled people who are not able to do that, it is not a failing of themselves. It is a failing of society.

</details>

### 为自己发声的挑战

**Molly Burke**: 从一个取悦他人者到另一个，我必须问，你如何学会了坚持立场，为自己站出来，即使在不舒服的时候？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: From one people pleaser to another, I have to ask, uh, how have you learned to push, you know, aside and stand up for yourself even when it's uncomfortable?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 我会说实话，这仍然是一场战斗，而且是那种有时我赢有时我输的事情。我会说，在工作环境中，我发现为自己站出来要容易得多，因为在我看来，你看我的内容，你知道我的立场，你雇佣了我，或者我们在这里是因为我们都在同一条战线上。我愿意稍微“管教”一下别人，或者为自己站出来，直言不讳。但在现实的日常生活中，我仍然觉得困难得多。我认为这是因为我曾多次这样做，而人们却固执地坚持他们的无知、仇恨或对我的负面看法。你知道，当我被拒绝带**导盲犬**进入某个地方时，我为自己站出来，告诉他们法律规定以及我为什么需要我的狗，但他们仍然拒绝。每一次发生这种情况，一遍又一遍，它就会累积，让你更难继续这样做。你知道，你会感到疲惫。所以，这是我仍在不断应对的事情，但我是在有意识、有目的地应对。而且，归根结底，要学会选择你的战场。我不可能每一次、所有时间都为自己站出来，这太累人了。但当我做到了并且赢了，感觉真的很好，感觉我正朝着正确的方向前进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I'm going to be honest, it's still a battle and it's it's a it's one of those things where sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. I would say that I find it much easier in work environments to stand up for myself because in my mind it's like you see my content, you know my stance, you hired me or we're in this room because we all are on the same page. I'm willing to kind of like put people in their place a little or stand up for myself and say it as it is. But in like real day-to-day life, I honestly still find it much more difficult. And I think it comes from a position of doing it so many times and people just standing firm in their ignorance or their hatred or negativity towards me. Um, you know, stand when when I get denied access with my guide dog and I stand up for myself and I tell them the law and why I have my dog there and they still say no. Every single time that happens over and over and over again, it compounds and it becomes harder to keep doing that. You know, you get worn down. And so it's something I'm still constantly navigating, but I'm navigating it knowing and with intention. And at the end of the day, pick your battles. I can't stand up for myself every single time all the time, it gets exhausting. But when I do it and I win, that feels really good and it feels like I'm moving in the right direction.

</details>

### 《Allure》杂志拍摄事件

**Molly Burke**: 我想谈谈你书中的一个经历，这与一次在你家发生的拍摄有关，是《Allure》杂志。你能给我们讲讲那次拍摄，以及为什么站出来并带来改变如此重要吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I want to talk about a battle that you uh talk about in your book and it has to do with a shoot that happened in your house uh Allure Magazine. Can you tell us a little bit about that shoot and why it was important to to stand up and the change that came out of that?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 我热衷于利用我职业生涯建立的**特权**来为他人做好事。这对我意义重大，因为我觉得我一生中很少有人为我或我的社群站出来，我不能那样做。我不能延续那种循环。所以，当我获得为《**Allure**》杂志拍摄的机会时，我是一个化妆和时尚爱好者。我热爱一切关于美和时尚的事物，我对此谈论很多。我在美容领域做很多咨询工作。当《Allure》联系我进行拍摄时，我非常兴奋，然后出现了一个全是男性的团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: I'm really passionate about using the privilege that I've built with my career for good for other people. That means so much to me because I felt like so much of my life nobody was standing up for me or my community and I can't do that. I can't perpetuate that cycle. And so when I got the opportunity to do an Allure shoot, I'm a I'm a makeup and fashion girl. I love all things beauty and fashion and I talk a lot about it. I do a lot of consulting in the beauty space and when Allure reached out to do the shoot, I was so excited and then a crew of all men showed up

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 他们甚至不知道该问我什么。他们中没有人化妆。他们没有人了解化妆。我认为他们问的第一个问题是：“什么是眉笔？” 我当时想：“这可不妙。” 我知道，在我一生中做过这么多次采访后，他们没有得到他们需要的精彩片段来制作一个好的视频。这真的让我很沮丧，因为对我来说，这是一个绝佳的机会来谈论**可及性**与**美**、**通用设计**和化妆的交叉性。当你看不见时，你如何化妆？化妆过程中存在哪些障碍？我们如何改变它？而他们一个都没问。他们只问了“什么是眉笔？”。所以我立刻打电话给我的经纪人，我说：“取消吧。” 我不为这次采访感到自豪。我觉得这次采访没有带来任何进展，因为他们派了一群对拍摄内容一无所知的人来，这毫无意义。至少应该有一个女性在场，或者一个会化妆的男性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: and they didn't even know what to ask me. They none of them wore makeup. None of them knew anything about makeup. I think one of the first questions was, "What's an eyebrow pencil?" And I was like, "This is not good." And I knew after doing so many interviews in my life that they did not get the sound bites they needed to make that a good video. And that really frustrated me because to me that felt like such a huge opportunity to talk about the intersectionality of accessibility and beauty of universal design and makeup. How do you do your makeup when you can't see and what barriers are there to doing that and how can we change that? And they asked none of those. They asked what's an eyebrow pencil? And so I immediately called my manager and I was like squash it. Like I don't feel proud of that interview. I don't feel like that interview moved the needle forward

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 如果不是一个完整的团队，至少也应该有一个懂化妆的男性。而且，《Allure》杂志方面非常棒。他们给了我一个巨大的化妆品礼篮，并说：“你说得对。” 我接到了制片人的电话。他们安排了新的拍摄。拍摄团队是一位女性，她说：“我只想让你知道，我们女性在内部为此努力了很久，但直到我们的一位外部人才说出来，才真正推动了高层做出改变。我想向你保证，拍摄现场的每个人都将是女性，她们化妆，了解化妆，并对这个主题充满热情。” 这对我来说意义非凡。这充分说明了，为自己信仰的事业站出来，有力量产生你可能不知道的巨大涟漪效应，但值得冒这个险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: because they sent a group of people to shoot something that they know nothing about and that makes no sense. There should have been at bare minimum one woman in that room or one makeupwearing male um if not a whole crew, a full crew of them. And Allore to their credit was so incredible. They sent me a huge gift basket of makeup and said, "You're right." And I got this call from the the producer. They set up a new shoot. It was a woman and she said, "I just want you to know that we as women have been pushing for this for so long internally, but it took one of our external talent saying something to actually push people higher up to make a change. And I want to assure you that every single person on set is going to be a woman who wears makeup and knows about makeup and is passionate about this subject." And that just meant the world to me. And it just goes to show that standing up for what you believe in has the power to have such a ripple effect that you might not even know about, but it's worth taking that chance.

</details>

### 书籍设计的无障碍理念

**Molly Burke**: 这是一个很棒的故事。我们还有几分钟时间。我有两个问题想挤进去。第一个是，你在设计这本书时非常刻意。首先我要说，绿色是我最喜欢的颜色之一，这是完美的、美丽的绿色。但更重要的是，封面不仅有**盲文**，你还很注重字体选择，你没有使用斜体，而是加粗了特定的字体等等。我想知道，你是如何让《Unseen》对公众更具**可及性**的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: That's a fantastic story. We have a couple minutes left. I have two questions I want to squeeze in. The first one is you were very intentional intentional about the design choices for this book. The first thing that I'll say is green is one of my favorite colors and this is the right perfect beautiful shade of green. But more importantly, not only do you have braille on on the cover, but you were intentional with the font choices and how you you didn't italicize, you you bolded uh particular fonts and stuff. And I was wondering um how did you make Unseen more accessible to the public?

</details>

**Molly Burke**: 作为一名咨询企业**通用设计**的专家，我显然必须把所有精力都投入到以**可及性**为理念来设计我的书，以此向人们、向公司、向世界展示，你可以创造出既美观又**可及**的东西。所以，我使用了**盲文协会**的**超易读字体**，增加了字母和单词之间的字号和间距，使用了加粗而不是斜体。所有这些都使得低视力读者以及患有**阅读障碍**或语言处理障碍等**残障**的人更容易阅读。我的封面照片完全由**残障女性**拍摄。我的化妆师是**四肢瘫痪者**，我的发型师是**法律上的盲人**，我的摄影师是**截肢者**。如果我告诉人们要雇佣**残障人士**，我当然会雇佣**残障人士**，并向你们展示这是可能的。所以，所有这些对我来说都非常非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: As somebody who consults businesses on universal design, I obviously had to put all of the efforts into designing my book with accessibility in mind to show people to show companies and the world that you can make something look beautiful and aesthetic and be accessible. So, I use the Braille Institute hyperledible font, increased sizing and spacing between letters and words, bolding instead of italics. All of these things make it easier for low vision readers as well as those with disabilities like dyslexia or language processing disorders. My cover photo was shot entirely by disabled women. My makeup artist was quadriplegic. My hair stylist is legally blind. My photographer was an amputee. If I'm telling people to hire disabled people, I sure as hell I'm going to hire disabled people and show you that it's possible. Um, so all of those things were really, really important to me.

</details>

### 未来愿景与职业规划

**Molly Burke**: 最后一个问题。你在书中也谈到了**愿景板**，我对你未来的**愿景板**上的内容很好奇。它看起来是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Molly**: One last question for you. You talk about the vision board uh throughout your your book as well, and I am curious uh what's on that vision board for the future? What does it look like?

**Molly Burke**: 这是个好问题。你知道，2026年，我想实现所有这些新的机会。对我来说，我意识到的是，你知道，我在社交媒体上已经做了我能做的一切。我绝不会放弃社交媒体。我仍然热爱它。但我意识到，作为一个一生都在镜头前表演的人，镜头前的才华在房间里权力最小。我真的很想走到幕后，因为我们需要在娱乐界的各个层面都有代表。所以我真的很希望能开始成为一名制片人和导演，也许创作我自己的纪录片。我也希望继续写作。写作《Unseen》是一次非常棒的经历，我收到的反馈也很棒。所以，我希望继续为文学界带来更多的代表性。而且，说到这里，我还有第二本书要出版，这是一本儿童读物，教孩子们关于**失明**和**导盲犬**的知识。所以，这本书将于2026年秋季出版，我对此非常兴奋，因为在所有媒体中，**残障人士**的代表性最少，而在其中，儿童媒体的代表性最少。我坚信我们需要从小就接触孩子，从一开始就真正地培养理解、同情和怜悯，永远不要建立那种恐惧或无知。所以我对此非常兴奋。

**Molly**: That's a great question. You know, 2026, I want to manifest all these new opportunities. And for me, something I've realized is, you know, I've done I've done what I can on social media. And I'm not going to stop social media by any means. I still love it. But I've realized as somebody who's been talent my whole life, on camera talent, that talent has the least power in the room. And I really want to go behind the scenes because we need representation at every level in entertainment. And so I'm really hoping to start being more of a producer and director, creating my own documentaries perhaps. I also hope to continue writing. Uh, writing Unseen was such an incredible experience and the feedback I've received has been amazing. So, I hope to continue to bring more representation to the literary world. And I do have, speaking of that, a second book coming out that is a children's book teaching kids about blindness and guide dogs. So, that will be coming out in fall 2026, which I'm really excited about because in all media, disabled people have the least representation of all minority communities, and the least within that is children's media. And I really believe we need to get to children when they're young to really create understanding and empathy and compassion from the start and never build that fear or that ignorance. So, I'm really excited about that.
