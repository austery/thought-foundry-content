### 范式转移：编程语言的“同传翻译官”

过去，构建软件被视为极高门槛的技术壁垒，普通人往往望而却步。但从去年开始，这种认知已被彻底颠覆——即使你从未写过一行代码，也能在一个下午通过纯英文或日常自然语言，从空白屏幕直接构建出可实际运行的专属工具。无论你身处什么行业、担任什么职位，如今都能亲手打造工作中缺失的关键软件。

为了破除对 **Claude Code** 这类终端编程工具的心理畏惧，我们可以用一个直观的跨语言商业谈判来类比：假设你明天必须去北京谈判一笔重要交易，但你完全不会说中文，只要身边有一位顶级的同传翻译官，你依然可以自如对话、深入协商并最终拿下交易，全程无需精通中文。在此语境下，Python 或 JavaScript 等代码就像外语，而 Claude Code 正是你的“技术同传翻译官”。**Claude Chat** 负责辅助深度思考，而 **Claude Code** 则负责执行与工程构建。只要你能清晰表达意图，就无需了解具体的语法细节。

Most people still think building software is too hard. That was true until last year. I am not a programmer and I wanted a claw code tutorial that normal people could actually use. So I made this. If you've never written a single line of code, you will still go from a blank screen to something real in one afternoon in plain English. Whatever role or industry you're in, you can now build the exact tool your work was missing. Once you understand this simple four-step system in this video, you can build almost anything. So, let's get started.

If you look at claude code, it will feel intimidating at first. Everyone thinks you have to be a techie to build cool apps. They're wrong. Imagine tomorrow you have to negotiate an important deal in Beijing, but you don't speak a word of Mandarin, but you have a worldclass translator who converts it into Mandarin to your partners in Beijing. Now you can sit there, have a conversation, you can negotiate and close the deal without ever touching a single word of that language. software programming and building apps in Python or JavaScript. You know, they all feel like Mandarin if you've never seen them before. You can start building products, projects, and internal software tools without any coding today because Claude Code is your translator. If you can speak in English, you can get the deal done without knowing a single word of any programming language. Claude chat helps you think. Claude code work helps you do and claude code helps you build. So if you think that ah man coding is not for people like me, I want you to test that assumption in the next few minutes.

### 初次破冰：从管理代码到管理交付结果

要验证这一全新工作流，最简单的方式就是立刻上手实操。打开 Claude 桌面端应用，顶部清晰分布着 Chat 与 Code 两个核心模式。切换至 Code 模式后，只需在界面底部指定一个用于存放项目的本地文件夹，随后输入一句极其直观的自然语言指令：`“给我构建一个漂亮的 25 分钟专注计时器，包含开始、暂停、重置功能以及一个进度环。”`

提交指令后，Claude Code 会自动解析底层需求、创建工程文件、编写逻辑代码并组装各个组件。在短短几分钟内，一个包含完整按钮与交互界面的原生应用程序就呈现在眼前。这个体验标志着一次关键的认知转变：你不需要了解底层使用了什么编程语言，也无需理会终端中滚动的各类晦涩日志；如果不满意视觉设计，直接通过提示词追加微调即可。你不再需要去**管理代码细节**，而是直接**管理最终交付结果**。

What would you need to build your first simple app? Not a single line of code. Now this is the desktop version of clawed app. At the top you can see claude chat and code. Select code. By the way, this is the universal icon for code everywhere. Down here is where I tell Claude what I want. You'll see words like repositories sometimes or GitHub. Ignore them for now. For this first build, let's use clot code locally. Pick a folder where you want the project to live and then type build me a beautiful 25inut focus timer with start, pause, reset, and a progress ring. That's it. And watch what happens.

Cloud code starts figuring out what it needs. Creating the files, writing the code, putting the pieces together. And just in a few minutes, there will be an actual application built for you. Let's open it. Here's the timer. Looks good. Start, pause, reset. Okay, all the buttons are there. So, that's the first moment when you start feeling, wait a minute, I built that. I can build this thing. You don't need to know what programming language Claude used or what all those strange messages that scrolled on the screen meant. Now look at the final product. Do you like the way it looks? If not, you can change it by just prompting. It's really that simple. That's the first big shift of how you use clawed code. You don't have to manage the code. You can manage the outcome. Now, we cheated a little bit here. A timer is deliberately a simple app. What happens when the thing you want to build is slightly more complicated? Well, let's go there next.

### 规划的力量：影视制作隐喻与 BITE 框架

当面对更复杂的现实业务工具时，盲目让 AI 开始写代码往往会导致系统失控。以影视工业为例：制作成本高达 2 亿美元的好莱坞大片如果导演在片场临时撕毁剧本、花数小时在餐巾纸上现场重写（如《小丑2》的混乱制作），最终产物必然支离破碎；相反，《疯狂的麦克斯：狂暴之路》（Mad Max: Fury Road）看似是一场充斥荒漠狂飙的极致混乱动作片，但导演乔治·米勒（**George Miller**）团队在开拍前就绘制了约 3500 块精细的分镜脚本，正是凭借前期的严密规划，才成就了影史上调度最完美、最震撼的动作经典。

在运用 **自然流编程**（Vibe Coding: 借助大模型通过自然语言直觉驱动的软件开发模式）时，必须恪守“先规划、再小步构建、经测试后演进”的原则。这里推荐一套极简且实用的系统方法论——**BITE 框架**：
* **B - 需求梳理**（Briefing: 明确为谁构建、解决什么痛点、核心边界为何）
* **I - 极简实现**（Implement: 交付最小可行、真正可用的精简版本）
* **T - 实操测试**（Test: 在真实使用中暴露断裂点并寻找优化空间）
* **E - 持续演进**（Evolve: 伴随反馈使产品与构建者自身双向进化）

就像吃西瓜需要一口一口来，BITE 框架就是你的工程导航图。

We'll take our first bite. The best way to build software tools and apps is to stop thinking about software. Imagine you're the director of a $200 million Hollywood blockbuster. You show up on the set and while the entire crew is waiting outside, you tear up the script and spend 3 hours rewriting the entire scene on a paper napkin. That would be so chaotic. But that's exactly what happened during a movie called Joker 2. And the movie was a mess according to many people.

Now contrast that with Mad Max Fury Road. The entire movie is like one big car chase through the desert. So, the director, George Miller, and his team map the entire movie through roughly about 3,500 storyboard panels. Each scene, each stunt was meticulously planned. And the funny part is, it's one of the most chaotic action movies ever made, and ironically, one of the best planned ones. So before you start building on any of these vibe coding tools, plan something, build something small, test it, and improve it. I like a simpler version that I made. I call it bite. You don't eat the entire watermelon at once, right? You take one small bite at a time. Bite is your map.

B is briefing. What are you trying to build? For whom and why.
I is implement. Build the smallest useful version.
T is test. Use it and see where it breaks. How do you improve it?
And E is evolve. Good products evolve over time. And so do good builders. And by the way, if you like to get such tools and frameworks delivered to your inbox, please subscribe to my email. The link is below and it's totally free. I love writing it. All right, let's use this framework to build something slightly more useful.

### B与I实战：构建个人人脉系统 Orbit 与自主模式

在建立清晰的思维模型后，我们以构建一款名为 **Orbit** 的个人关系管理系统（Personal Relationship Manager）为例，深度实践 B 与 I 两个环节。

在 **需求梳理 (Briefing)** 阶段，AI 虽具备远超人类团队的编写速度，但极度依赖精准的方向指引。一份优秀的提示词必须回答四个关键问题：**目标受众是谁**、**解决什么核心问题**、**V1 版本的核心功能是什么**，以及**明确当前阶段坚决不做哪些功能**（例如暂不接入复杂外部接口）。更重要的是建立沟通边界：明确告知 AI 自身为非技术背景，要求其全权负责底层技术选型与数据库架构设计，不得抛出底层技术审批请求，且在写代码前先输出整体规划供人类推敲。当人类在审查计划时补充了具体布局要求（如 Apple 风格的三栏式设计：左侧分类、中间联系人列表、右侧详情展示）后，便可确认执行。

在 **极简实现 (Implement)** 阶段，Claude Code 自动进入文件创建、依赖安装和 JavaScript 代码编写流程。此时若开启 **Auto 模式**，AI 将在安全边界内自主连续执行指令，无需为每一步系统权限反复中断人类。在十余分钟内，它便能独立完成全栈编码、数据库初始化与自查，交付一个真正可搜索、多栏联动的高保真可用原型。

Let's build a simple relationship manager for people who matter the most to me professionally, personally, former colleagues, my mentors, my partners, people I want to stay close to, but I can't because I'm running around. So, why not build something that's your own that's focused on just one question? Who matters to me? and how am I staying in touch with them? So, let's get started.

We'll start with B for briefing. AI can build faster than any human team, but at that speed, it needs a lot of direction. In your briefing, answer four questions. Who is this for? What problem are we solving? What does the first version need to do? And just as importantly, what are we not building in this product? Let's do it for real. I open clot code and give it a simple prompt. I want to build a personal relationship manager called Orbit. I just named it Orbit. Here's the problem I want to solve. I want to track how I stay in touch with people who matter to me. For version one, use the sample data I provided. Show each person's name, company, when we spoke last, and notes. Make it look professional, sparse, and Applelike. Use a muted color palette. Don't build any email or LinkedIn integrations yet. Before writing code, make a plan and ask me anything important that I have missed. And this is the most important part of the prompt. I am not a techie or a software engineer. Don't ask me to approve or review any technical commands. Make all the technical decisions yourself and only ask me questions about what the app should do in plain language. That's your example prompt. But you get my point, right? You can write your own prompt that is better than the one you just saw.

First, it'll ask you a bunch of questions about what you want to build. It'll clarify if there are any tradeoffs you need to make. And depending on what you were building, it'll ask you different questions. But it won't ask you questions about what kind of programming language it should write in or what kind of database you want to design. You can decide what you want and it decides how to build it. If you don't understand a bunch of things in the plan, you can ask questions. You can make suggestions to change things in the plan. Claude can update the plan anytime you give it feedback. In my case, after I read the plan, I realized I had left out one very important detail in the original prompt. The actual user experience. My prompt said nothing about what the layout would look like and what to show where. So I type in plain English. It should look professional and slick as if it's designed by Apple. Make it a threepane layout. Left sidebar with my categories. Middle column with list of names. When I click on someone, their profile opens on the right side. And after adding a little bit of that, I approve the plan. And now cloud code starts building.

To see what happens next, we move to I for implement. The biggest mistake trying to build everything at once. We'll dig into that important concept once Claude finishes building the first version. But you'll see that right now it starts creating and editing files, running commands, installing whatever it needs. If none of that means anything to you, great. It doesn't have to. Now look at the bottom and see if auto mode is available on your account. And if it is, you can turn it on and it will keep working without stopping for every permission that it needs to ask from you. For anything sensitive, you can slow down and review what it's doing, but usually you can sit back and enjoy your coffee. In my case, it ran for about 10 to 15 minutes. It wrote the entire code. It was a JavaScript code. It checked its own work. It made its own database and then came back with its first version. Now, here's what it looks like. The search works. I can type and see the people. That's good. Three PES just like uh we asked. All good. Let's see. The categories on the left are all accurate. It's good. It's genuinely usable. That's version one of Orbit.

### T与E实战：MVP验证、双模型策略与三维能力演进

当 V1 原型诞生后，我们便获得了软件工程的核心抓手——**最小可行产品**（Minimum Viable Product, MVP: 能够满足早期用户核心诉求并用于收集反馈的最简系统形态）。所有优秀产品的演进都依赖于用户在实际触摸软件后产生的真实反馈。

在工程策略上，有一个极为高效的杠杆技巧：**双模型分工策略**——使用推理能力最强的旗舰模型来做顶层规划与架构设计，而调用轻量、高速且低成本的模型执行具体代码编写。这就像由资深架构师把控战略方向，由初级工程师负责繁琐的基础落地。

在进入 **实操测试 (Test)** 阶段后，通过实际试用很快能发现空白点：
1. **数据看板缺失**: 列表数据无法直接形成行动洞察，通过提示词追加顶部指标卡（需要重点关注的人数、久未联系的人数、本周待跟进人数），瞬间将静态数据库升级为决策看板。
2. **交互记录缺失**: 为每个联系人增加“记录互动”（Log Contact）按钮，支持快捷录入沟通方式（邮件、电话、短信、咖啡面谈）、时间与备忘。

在产品逐步完善的同时，也触发了最终的 **持续演进 (Evolve)** 阶段。根据 **Anthropic** 对约 40 万次真实 AI 辅助编程会话的研究统计，完全没有编程基础的初学者成功构建应用的概率几乎与受训工程师相当，而优秀的管理者由于具备清晰拆解需求、明确沟通意图的素养，在 AI 编程中的表现甚至微弱领先于专业程序员。这证明了**自然流编程的核心本质在于“想清楚自己要什么，并清晰地传达给作为下属的 AI”**。从这里出发，你可以向三个维度深度演进：
1. **系统化横向复用**: 将现有逻辑迁移改造为副业 CRM、球队管理系统或个人目标追踪面板；
2. **底层技术下潜**: 探索 API 对接、GitHub 协作与核心函数库原理，遇到盲区随时让 AI 进行大白话科普；
3. **拥抱构建文化**: 在软件构建门槛被 AI 彻底重塑的浪潮中，通过不断亲手尝试“构建、打破、重构”，在容错中找到属于自己的数字化创造力。

And this is what you should notice about our version one. It is the simplest thing that is still useful in tech. There is a concept called MVP. not most valuable player but minimum viable product and I love this concept because it can be applied to any business any career any output all technology startups are obsessed with this one question what is the smallest version you can put in someone's hands that actually solves their problem because then you can observe how they use it what works what breaks what parts they like what parts they actually use that feedback tells you what to build next. And one sidebar, but a useful trick, I like using the strongest reasoning model for the planning and a cheaper, faster model for the implementation. It's like having a senior person help you strategize and a junior person handling the leg work.

Let's go to T for test. We have our minimum viable product. Now, let's test it and make it even more useful. Your first version works. Congrats. Great. Once you start using it, though, you'll see what's missing. For instance, in this app that we just built live, you realize the the names are there, the data is all there, the dates are all there, but there are no real insights that are obvious or actionable. So, let's go back to the prompt. Put three cards at the top. How many of my connections need attention? How many of them have gone cold? And how many follow up this week? That's a nice prompt. A few minutes later, there they are. Now, I open the same app and I have some kind of a dashboard at the top, not just data. When you're using clot code or any vibe coding tools, your goal is to get to the answer and make whatever you're building more insightful and more useful to you or the actual user. Then after a little more testing, you might find other gaps. For instance, when I reach out to someone, there's no way to tell, at least in the app, how I did it and when I did it. So you can go back to the prompt and add this add a button called log contact to each person's profile. When I click it, let me pick how we talked. Email, call, text, coffee. Then let me pick the date and let me add a quick note. And now Claude Code will go back and change the code. It'll rebuild some of the parts. When it's ready, I click on it. I check it out. Nice. It's working. Now you have started inching toward your own relationship management system. It's not a spreadsheet anymore. It's how you keep in touch with those who are close to you, those in your closest orbit.

And now we go to the final step. E for evolve. The final step is not just to evolve what you build, but to make sure you evolve with it. Anthropic did a study that looked at roughly 400,000 real sessions of people building software apps with AI. And the results were surprising. They found that people who had never programmed before succeeded almost as often as trained engineers and managers actually scored slightly higher than even software engineers. Now, it was just a survey and not a super rigorous study, but it does point to an interesting fact. The whole skill of vibe coding boils down to knowing what you want and describing it clearly to your staff, which is your AI coder in this case. So, the best people managers become the best AI managers.

So from here you can evolve in three different directions. First, the app you build can evolve into a a system. You can reuse the code to make a CRM for your side hustle, a tracker for your kids soccer team, a dashboard for your goals, whatever comes to mind. Second, if you feel like it, you can go a bit deeper. You can learn about APIs and how to connect with other apps, how to use GitHub, and what those Python libraries actually do. And every time you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions. Open Claw Chat or any chat and ask it to explain it like you are a 10year-old. And the third direction is try to learn something about coding. Even if your career right now has almost nothing to do with software because of all the things AI will change, software building is one of the areas where AI will improve incredibly quickly in the coming years. And there are reasons for that. But that also means that anyone with the right tools can create absolute magic. The world is still going to need great software engineers to understand complex systems and architectures and security and much more. But this new way of working and building your digital life is coming at you at 100 miles an hour. So spend a weekend tinkering with claude code or lovable or replet or maybe take an online course because the real goal is to become comfortable building, breaking and rebuilding things. What you build today will tell you what to build next. So go ahead and make a bad version. That's the only way you'll know how to make the best one. Thank you and I love you.
