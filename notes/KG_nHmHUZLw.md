### Endeavor的崛起与娱乐业的演变

Ari Emanuel，这位搏击运动的新巨头和好莱坞最大的权力掮客之一，在最近的访谈中回顾了他非凡的职业生涯轨迹。他建立了一个令人瞩目的商业帝国，并通过一系列资产合并，使公司实现了指数级增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Ari Emanuel, the newest kingpin of combat sports, one of Hollywood's biggest power brokers. You have had an incredible arc. You've built an incredible business and recently you've had the opportunity to merge a bunch of assets and just the thing has just taken a a life of its own.</p>
</details>

他分享了**Endeavor**（一家全球性的娱乐、体育和内容公司）过去四五年的发展历程。大约31年前的3月29日，他带着对内容未来走向的独特见解创立了这家公司。这个想法来源于George Gilder的一本书，书中预测未来将有无限的分发渠道，内容将变得极其宝贵，并将以多种形式存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you maybe walk us through the last four or five years of the evolution of Endeavor and you know your process of first leaving building a business then scaling it up and just all of that action the tick tock of it all. So March 29th when I first came here I was making 15 cents a mile when I moved to LA went to work at CIA etc. then started the company March uh 29th on my birthday 30 almost 31 years ago. um had this idea about where uh content was going from George Gilder who wrote this book like for television and said there's going to be infinite distribution and then content's going to be really really valuable and there's going to be many forms of content and so we kind of went out and started growing the business and trying to get into every sector of the business.</p>
</details>

公司最初与**William Morris**（威廉·莫里斯经纪公司，历史悠久的艺人经纪公司）合并，他认为这是他最成功的交易之一。随后，在Teddy Forstmann去世后，他与**Silver Lake**（一家全球科技投资公司）收购了**IMG**（国际管理集团，全球领先的体育和娱乐营销公司），从而进入了体育领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">made a two- horse race with when we quote unquote merged with William Morris Um I think one of my best deals actually that merger and then um when Teddy Forceman passed away bought IMG with Silverlake who had come into the company and then we were in sports and then we realized it was all in the representation business and then.</p>
</details>

他们意识到，凭借所建立的基础设施、全球规模、制作能力和代理业务，他们可以开始拥有一些资产，而不仅仅是代理它们，从而创造更多价值。他们首先收购了Professional Bull Riders公司，并将其发展成为一项成功的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">realized that because of what we built the infrastructure we built in the global scale we had and the production and um representation we could start owning some of the assets as opposed to just representing them and kind of put them through our our filters and kind of create more value. And so the first thing we did is we bought uh this company called uh Professional Ball Riley that was I think making uh $3 million a year in profit. We turned it into a really nice business. It's still growing.</p>
</details>

由于他们每天都与各大网络和工作室进行谈判，当**UFC**（Ultimate Fighting Championship: 全球最大的综合格斗赛事）出现时，他们决定大胆一搏。有趣的是，当他们收购IMG时，人们说他们出价过高，但那却是史上最便宜的体育收购案。而当他们收购UFC时，情况也类似，当时看起来非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then because of that um and we had negot you know we negotiate every day against networks and studios. the UFC came up and we said, "Okay, let's take a big swing." The funny thing is when we bought IMG, they say we overpaid. It was the cheapest sports acquisition ever happened. And definitely when we bought uh UFC, they were like at 4. At the time, it looked incredibly expensive.</p>
</details>

他们通过达成一项广播协议，将估值倍数从20-30倍降至10倍以下。然而，将所有这些资产合并成一个综合企业（conglomerate）却是一个错误，市场无法理解其价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all we had to do was kind of make a broadcast deal that then took the multiple down from 30 20 times to kind of under 10. We then thought we could take all those assets. My big mistake here. Um, a conglomerate. The marketplace just didn't understand it.</p>
</details>

他们曾尝试在新冠疫情前上市，但失败了。最终，他们成功地将UFC整合到Endeavor中，但仍然没有获得足够的市场认可。直到Vince McMahon同意，他们合并了资产，将业务重心放在纯粹的体育和体育娱乐上，这在市场上获得了更好的反响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we tried to take it public right before CO failed. I didn't realize how hard it was to go back out. Finally got it back public. We we kind of rolled all of the UFC into Endeavor and um we still weren't getting any value. We then Vince said yes and we merged the assets. A pure play was in sports, sports entertainment was a better conversation with the street.</p>
</details>

### 内容分发与创作者经济的未来

Emanuel指出，内容分发已经变得极其广泛。从传统的有线电视网络到流媒体平台，再到YouTube、Instagram和TikTok等社交媒体，以及像Mr. Beast这样可以直接触达观众的创作者，整个生态系统变得非常“混沌”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean when you started we had the traditional cable networks then we had cable it was a very high hierarchical and easy to understand hierarchy and then you have the streamers and now you know this afternoon we'll have Neil Moan from YouTube then you have characters like the Mr. Beast of the world who can go direct so it's very chaotic. No it's actually just back to George Gilder. It's back to George Gilder. There's infinite distribution, right? Many forms of content. People consume podcasts. People consume, you know, stuff on Instagram and Tik Tok. People consume stuff now on the streamers. And so, and I do I don't believe that traditional business is going away for a long time because a lot of us sports guys have the NFL, the NBA has still sold stuff there plus also sold it to the Amazons of the world. And so you just have a vast kind of map of where distribution is.</p>
</details>

他认为，传统业务不会在短期内消失，因为像NFL和NBA这样的体育联盟仍然在传统渠道和Amazon等新平台进行内容销售。然而，有人认为当前的内容类型变得有些僵化，缺乏15-20年前的创意风险。Emanuel对此持不同意见，他认为现在的内容比以往任何时候都多，而且有许多令人难以置信的声音和作品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So distribution has gotten vast but a lot of people would say some people would say the kinds of content has gotten a little oified calcified rigid maybe. Um what does that mean? Meaning like you know you don't see like the broad swath of the content that you would see maybe 15 20 years ago. People I think there's more content now. But do you see people taking creative risk the way that they used to before? I don't know. I think I think I think I can't get enough content. I don't think I don't know about you. There's going to be more content than there's ever been. I think there's incredible voices out there. I think the content that's being made is it there's a vast majority and I think it's really incredible.</p>
</details>

关于播客和顶级人才的独立发展趋势，Emanuel认为这是一种行业内前所未有的现象。过去，行业有严格的“看门人”，创作者必须通过包装和代理才能进入。现在，像Megan Kelly和Tucker Carlson这样的独立创作者拥有庞大的受众，他们不再需要依赖传统网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ari, what do you think of podcast and the general movement of top talent Megan? Uh Tucker, you guys. Okay. Sure. we're we're a little bit behind them, but um the ability for them to be independent and not affiliated with the network, this is something we have not seen in the industry. There were gatekeepers. You used to have to get packaged, represented, and now, you know, people come to us all the time with different opportunities to join different networks. I won't talk about any specifics, but we've decided, well, why would we need them independent? Yeah. Why why would we need them if we have this amazing audience?</p>
</details>

他预测播客业务将演变成类似于过去的**节目联播**（syndication: 节目在不同电视台或平台同时或先后播出）模式，就像Oprah Winfrey、Dr. Phil和Dr. Oz曾经的成功一样。这意味着拥有强大受众的播客创作者未来可能会通过多渠道发行和开发人才来建立自己的网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Funny thing is I think the podcasting business is going to turn into the syndication business that used to be on the broadcast and the station groups. So Oprah was the king world kind of thing. Oprah was the behemoth and then Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz. She launched a bunch of you'll probably see that reincarnated through people with podcast if they want to. We saw that at Bartool. So you're saying we could then cable syndication model through this through the multiple channel. We should be a network and we should develop talent.</p>
</details>

### IP所有权与变现模式的转变

Emanuel观察到，大型独立创作者的变现模式正在从传统的商业广告转向赞助协议，并最终发展到拥有自己的业务。这种模式的价值要大得多，因为他们可以获得基于收入的倍数估值，而不仅仅是广告收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things that I've noticed has become a common kind of thread with these big independents is they move from what used to be kind of commercial ad placements to sponsor deals where they got one sponsor to eventually owning their own business. Correct. And the value there is so much greater cuz the multiple you get a multiple on revenue. You don't just get advertising the marketing line.</p>
</details>

他认为，未来创作者将拥有其播客的**知识产权**（IP: Intellectual Property）。大约十年前，他们公司在**William Morris Endeavor**（WME: 威廉·莫里斯奋进娱乐公司，全球最大的娱乐经纪公司之一）启动了名为“Talent Ventures”的业务。随着传统广播网络和有线电视频道的收视率下降，制造商需要直接触达受众。因此，他们开始向创作者提供股权，或者创作者自己推出各种产品，从酒精、香水到食品等。这种模式现在也开始在播客领域出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you're going to own the equity in your podcast, right? And then a lot of people and we started this business I don't know about 10 years ago we called we started at WMU called talent ventures where a lot of musicians actors started because you know it's with the broadcast networks and cable channels ratings going down you know manufacturers had to get to the audience and so that they used to do it through commercials when that rating went down they started then giving equity or people started launching you a lot of different products. Sometime was alcohol, sometimes perfume, sometime it was food, etc. That will now start happening with people like you, other podcasters.</p>
</details>

他强调，这是由于广播电视和有线电视的现状所导致的自然演变。制造商必须找到受众，而像《All-In Podcast》这样的节目拥有庞大而忠实的受众。创作者将面临选择：是接受赞助费，还是选择拥有产品的股权。这需要评估经济效益和对产品的信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If Paltro has done an exceptional job that that's just a natural evolution because of where broadcast television is and cable television is manufacturers going to have to get to an audience. You guys have a very big and loyal audience. events and things that you do on you know over the air. Um you know products will come to you. You you will make the decision are are you taking the sponsorship dollar or you taking the ownership dollar and that's just the pro evaluating the economics and and whether you believe in the product. There's a lot of things that go into that.</p>
</details>

过去，内容创作者的梦想是拥有自己的IP，但Netflix等平台会支付更高的费用来购买IP。Emanuel承认，现在创作者通过节目联播获得的收入可能不如Greg Daniels、Larry David或Aaron Sorkin等前辈，但如果他们有才华并取得成功，仍然可以获得非常可观的收入，达到数千万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ari, there was a time when the dream of content creators was being able to own their IP. Netflix came in and said, "Hey, we'll pay you much more, but you don't get to own the Simpsons anymore. You don't get to own this IP yet." Well, remember the syndication model as broadcast television started to fade away as this, but there was a at the beginning there was a third window which was Netflix. Now the cable and the station group window has kind of dissipated a little, right? But when you still when you make a deal at a broadcaster smaller now you do have a bidding war between Netflix whether it be if you're at NBC Peacock we just finished a big we're finishing up a big deal for the office which started on broadcast the new stuff they're buying out. Yes. Yeah. So you don't have this opportunity to do what you know the Simpsons did, to do what South Park did, to do what Seinfeld did. But you yourself deal I just made for South Park's pretty good for the guys. No, no, I know. But that seems to be the last generation to get that. This new generation seems to be just giving their IP over to Netflix. You yourself are saying, "I want to own the IP and you're choosing to buy them." So what is your advice to the clients because they can't become billionaires if they don't own IP. So there's a client I there's a client by the name of Noah Holly just had the Alien Earth show that it premiered on at Disney. Um he did Fargo also. Incredibly talented guy. I just signed him right. He's going to make a new deal. Now, back in the day, Greg Daniels or Larry David or Aaron Sorcin or Jim Brooks clients made an unbelievable amount of money. Jim did Jim did well. All of those people I said did very, very, very well. Yes, he will not make as much money as they did in syndication, but he will do very, very, very well. So, if you're really talented and you have success, you will do really well. And when it's when it gets reaired and re and resold, he'll do very very well. It's not if you have a show that goes into syndication and it gets $6 million an episode, you can't make five $600 million anymore. But you can make tens of millions. Yeah. More than that, but you can make you can do very very well.</p>
</details>

### AI、直播活动与未来工作周

Emanuel表示，他们正在**TKO Group Holdings**（TKO: 由UFC和WWE合并而成的体育娱乐公司）和William Morris Endeavor内部设立一个完整的项目，研究AI如何帮助他们。在制作方面，工作室和他们的客户也在积极探索AI的应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ari, how much of your time are you spending trying to figure out where like all these nextg AI tools either help you give you maybe operating leverage to actually go and be even more creative, own the content versus maybe disrupt some of the legacy folks you've worked with? You know, we have a whole program being set up at TKO and and and William Morris about kind of how AI can help us. On the production side, there's a whole another that the studios are doing and our clients are doing.</p>
</details>

尽管AI在许多领域具有颠覆性潜力，但Emanuel坦言自己对AI了解不足，因此他决定将重心放在自己擅长的领域——直播内容。他擅长将直播内容变现，并已建立了一个纯粹的体育和体育娱乐业务。他将在10月推出他认为是下一个大型直播活动业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I have I've made a decision. I I don't know enough about AI. I'm not smart enough to know enough about I've made a decision that live is content is where I'm going to sit. I'm really good at that. I'm really good at monetizing that. So, we have a pure play sports sports entertainment business. I just launched which will launch in October kind of what I believe is the next kind of live events business.</p>
</details>

他认为，如果AI代表着自动化和数据中心，那么其“反向押注”就是直播活动。人们渴望连接，因此会不断回归直播。他预测未来工作周可能缩短到三天，这意味着人们将有更多的空闲时间，而对连接的需求将更加强烈。他的核心理念就是“直播”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you have our sports business, you have Live Nation and Michael Rupinos and incredible. That's pure play music. And I think there's when we were a public company, now we're a private company, we had 700 events inside Endeavor. I have um it will be completed in first week in October. Bought a lot of those, raised about $2 billion and about 900. And I'm going to go pure play in events cuz I think it's the opposite. If you have AI over there, the opposite bet on AI is not data centers. It's live. Humans want connection. Keep going back to live. And I think it's kind of like a 4-day work week now. Probably going down to three. I was seeing Elon and seeing the robots. Probably 3-day work week for full employment. There going to be a lot of free time. We definitely all need connections as we can see right here. And so my whole thesis is live. Um, and I think on the William Morris side, which is incredible, there's only two representation business. William Morris is the biggest one of all of them. And there's going to be more room for content.</p>
</details>

Emanuel指出，目前美国人的平均通勤时间是11到4点，这意味着人们在周末的早晨或下午处理家务，其余时间则可以享受生活。酒店预订量大幅上升，表明三天周末已经成为趋势。他坚信，工作周的缩短将为娱乐活动带来更多时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I'm saying like, let's just say, yeah, we used to Monday through Friday. Saturday, you're slapping the kids to soccer. Sunday, you get a rest day, watch some football, then rinse and repeat. That's all a lie now. That's going away. No, no, no. Right now, drive times, average dry times in America, 11 to 4. So, people are doing their chores 11 to 4. Do doing their stuff that they have to do on the weekends in the morning or in the afternoon. They have their mobile phones. They're doing their stuff. Thursday, hotel bookings are way up. Way up. So, weekend 3-day weekends. I'm shocked. What? Please up from back there. You should start drinking coffee because if you just look at the data, we're at 4 day work weeks now. I think it's going to three-day work weeks, which means more time for entertainment is your key piece.</p>
</details>

他分享说，自己患有**ADHD**（Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: 注意力缺陷多动障碍），这帮助他同时处理多项事务。他回顾了**TKO**合并两年来的成功，公司股价从100美元涨到200美元，并且在整合业务、达成广播协议方面取得了显著进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank god I have ADHD. Um, listen, actually this Friday is two years since we um did the merger at TKO. We merged at I think $100 and then went down 79. Anybody says they don't look at their stock price, I look at it every like 19 times a day. Yesterday we hit 200. We're doing, I think, everything we said we were going to do with regard to kind of streamlining the two businesses, integrating them. We brought over in February uh PBR um on location and uh IMG, which kind of fills out the suite of what we do at TKO for everybody that wants sports. We made our broadcasting deals and we're just kind of powering away at what that, you know, focused on what we have to do.</p>
</details>

Emanuel强调，他仍然积极参与客户代理业务，因为这有助于他与YouTube、Amazon、Netflix等平台保持联系，从而推动TKO的业务发展。他认为，在未来5到10年，最重要的平台是那些能给客户带来最高收入并提供最大创作自由的平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you personally at this point just kind of out of representation? No, no, no. Or do you dip down sometimes and and help clients? How do you see that? you know, being in the representation business, whether it be Marty Scorsesi or Dwayne Johnson or Mark Wahlberg or Peterberg or a great a whole host of my clients. or enables me to make the deals over at TKO because I'm in the conversation right with YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, all the people I need to be in business and and I do that the running of that business now cuz I'm not in like you didn't call this person back. I don't do that anymore. But in the representation of my clients and the clients of the agency, I'm in it every day because it does help the other businesses. Which platform are you the most obsessed with? YouTube, Netflix, all. Okay. But which one, if you have a client, do you think is the most important over the next 5 or 10 years? Who's going to pay them the most amount of money and creatively enable them to do what they want?</p>
</details>

他驳斥了Netflix制作利润被压缩，导致创作者转向YouTube的说法，认为这不完全属实。他解释说，不同的平台适合不同阶段的创作者。YouTube适合初期创作者，而Netflix则适合制作半小时或一小时的节目或电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let let me ask you a question. This is a really important question. I was going to ask this of Neil as well. I've heard from a number of folks that have historically done production on Netflix that they want to move to YouTube because Netflix like the margins compressed and so they're offering and deals. That's not true. Okay, that's not true. And so I've heard a lot of folks say, "Well, if I go independent, I have unlimited upside. If I publish on YouTube, I just need financing." Is there an emerging? Listen, those are different. It depends on where you're at. If it's a YouTuber, right, and they want to scale up and they want to scale up and they have x amount, they'll probably start on YouTube or start on or start on at Facebook or start on Twitter. Once they get to a certain level, they'll make a decision. Is there is can do they have a product that's right for a half hour or an hour on on Netflix or a feature film, right? That's different from what YouTube's business plan is. And Neil will talk to you about that. So again, you can't generalize that conversation.</p>
</details>

### 个人生活与竞争精神

Emanuel来自一个非凡的家庭，他的兄弟Zeke是一位杰出的医生，Rahm曾是白宫幕僚长和芝加哥市长，现在是驻日本大使。他承认兄弟之间存在竞争，并开玩笑说这就是他们分居芝加哥、华盛顿和洛杉矶的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to I want to shift and ask a personal question. You come from an incredible family. Your brother Zeke is an incredible doctor. Your brother Rahm worked at the White House, was mayor of Chicago. You're incredible. Ambassador to Japan now. Yeah. You're an incredible entrepreneur and businessman. Is there competitiveness? Has there ever been competitiveness amongst the three of you as you guys? Why do you think one's in Chicago, one's in Washington, one's in LA? The cities are like when they come together like, you know, like they explode. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Where did it come where did it? Wait, but where did it come from? And let me just tell you something. I'm winning. Where? you know, but where did it come from and who did who did mom love most? You know, my mom says this all the time. My mom used to say, "You don't love me as much as you love Zeke." And Zeke is the my the doctor and the vice proess of pen. And she goes turns to him and she goes to all of us. She goes, "I hate you all equally." Ah, that's where it comes from. Still trying to get mom's love. I got it.</p>
</details>

他回忆起职业生涯早期，作为行业第五大经纪公司，必须非常努力地争取客户，因为人们认为他们是“软柿子”。他提到自己有**阅读障碍**（dyslexic），因此任何认为他愚蠢的人都会触及他的底线。这种早期的挑战塑造了他的竞争精神。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, like I just said, all um, no. I mean, listen, when when you're at the beginning of your career 30 years ago and you do not have the ability to change price and you have at the time you had William Morris, ICM, UTA, CAA, and you're the fifth and you you have to fight really hard because people just think you're a chump, right? And I don't Yeah. when people don't think because I'm dyslexic. I remember growing up anybody that thought I was stupid, they touched the third rail. And so when you were growing up in this business and everybody thinks, "Oh, you're just that pushover. You got I'm I'm not I'm not good there. Any chance?" No, but this is a and this is a serious question.</p>
</details>

当被问及是否能让《Entourage》重聚时，Emanuel开玩笑地让主持人联系David Zaslav，暗示HBO（华纳兄弟探索公司旗下的付费电视网络）掌握着决定权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bringing Entourage back. Why hasn't this happened? We love this. We grew up on it. How many people want to see the reunion? You're the guy who can make it happen. I'm friends with Adrian Grineer. I talk to him all the time about it and he says, "Not my choice." Are you guys having David Zazoff on this on this panel? No. No. I think you guys should call him. Is he holding the strings? Well, yeah. They HBO HBO. But you're Ari. You could go and just tell them to do it. Let's Let's help that deal happen. Please.</p>
</details>

他曾为Michael Ovitz工作，并认为Ovitz改变了行业，与Lew Wasserman一样是行业**拉什莫尔山**（Mount Rushmore: 比喻行业中的顶尖人物）级别的人物。Ovitz是一位有远见的领导者，但Emanuel认为他错失了收购Gray Advertising的机会，未能改变经纪公司的动态。Emanuel从ICM Partners的糟糕管理中吸取教训，决心建立一个拥有良好文化的公司，并在有机会时收购资产，改变经纪和代理业务的动态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On competition, was Michael Oitz a a mentor to you or a competitor? I worked for Mike for um I was in the mail room, then I was on a desk. Um he was you know you he was incredible and you he kind of changed the business. Before him was Louman. They would be on Mount Rushmore. I think Mike did a so many things right. I mean he was a visionary for the one thing when I was a young guy looking at it and looking back at it you know he started he took Coke. I think it was from Gray Advertising at the time. I think it was gray. And I always said to myself at the time like he had so much currency at the time. Why didn't he buy gray advertising and he could have changed the dynamic of the agency? He could either take it public and so that when and then I was at this company called Intertalent. They got bought by ICM. ICM like had the greatest agents all and it just was bad management. And then we started the firm and I just said, you know, I'm not going to have a bad culture like ICM and when the opportunity comes, I'm going to go for assets that I could own and change kind of the dynamic of what an agency and what representation and what and that's what no one had done before is think in terms of equity.</p>
</details>

Emanuel表示，他目前不打算收购工作室或体育团队，因为他正专注于他刚刚启动的、募集了20亿美元的大型活动公司。他认为TKO目前处于非常有利的位置，与David Ellison等合作伙伴一起，通过在MTV、CBS和流媒体平台同步播出VMAs等活动，获得了有史以来最大的观众群。他预计UFC和WWE在ESPN上的播出也将取得巨大成功。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Are there any assets that you don't own that you wish you did or or would you like to buy a studio? Would you like to buy sports teams? What? I I don't want to buy a studio. I don't want to buy a sports team. Okay. I just started this company. I raised about $2 billion. I'm going to start this big events company. So, my plate's really full. I'm loving life right now. And uh yeah, I mean, TKO is on it in a great place right now with all the deals we made. We have a great partner in um uh David Ellison and you saw what happened at the VMAs where our thought process, they put it on MTV, they put it on CBS, and they put on streaming. the largest audience they ever got. That's going to be the same thing for the UFC. And now Bob Iger and Jimmy Potara are gonna launch um the the WWE on ESPN. I think it's going to be incredible for that asset.</p>

他认为所有体育项目都必须适应时代变化，因为年轻一代的注意力持续时间更短，需要更快的节奏。像UFC和斗牛（Bull Riding）这样的运动节奏快，适合在手机上观看。WWE则提供家庭娱乐。他认为，除了NFL等少数例外，许多体育项目都需要调整定价，并且美国国内市场可能不再是曲棍球和棒球等大型运动的唯一重心。他赞扬了棒球在适应新环境方面所做的努力，例如将平均比赛时间缩短了40分钟，以及他们通过**BAM**（MLB Advanced Media: 美国职业棒球大联盟先进媒体）等创新走在行业前沿。

<p class="english-text">So do you think that all sports there's nothing left right now, right? We're launching, you know, we have a big fight this weekend, uh the Canelo fight with Netflix, so we're in good place. Ari, do you think that all sports continue to do well in the future? Or will some sports have to adapt for, you know, the fact that kids have a shorter attention span? They just need faster action. Like what happens to things like baseball? What happens to the maybe the slower, more prolonged sports? You know, I I think everybody's going to have to adapt. The thing I like about our sport is the it's like the UFC. It's fast. Bull riding, 8 seconds. You know, you get it, you can watch it on your phone. Um WWE is family entertainment and and all of them are um the both the UFC and the WWE are huge global brands. I think all of them except you know I had a conversation with Roger Goodell yesterday. I was like how many storylines can you get? It was an unbelievable weekend except for Monday night when the Bears lost. But um I think a bunch of them are going to have to adapt and I think for some of them pricing is going to have to come down because um I don't think uh the the US domestic market is the right place for them as it relates to hockey and baseball the big ones. Um they're do they've done an incredible job adapting to the kind of new environment. I think baseball's cut like 40 minutes off of the average. It's incredible what they've done. They've always been innovative. when they launched BAM and they've been ahead of the curve. So,</p>

<p class="english-text">what do you think about international markets? Obviously, India and China, huge markets. The NBA has done an exceptional job. They're probably going to have something in Europe, the Knicks, my Knicks, uh, which are going to win the chip this year. They're going to be playing in Abu Dhabi, their preseason games. How How do you view the internationalization of these live events? I mean, just look at that Brazil game for the NFL. Incredible. Look at what baseball did when they launched the Dodgers and the Cubs in Japan. Everybody's realizing the value that can happen now. We just had a UFC event in Shanghai, which we have a facility in a PI. Um, we're going to Abu Dhabi. We we've always in ours been international. It's a requirement for continued growth in the sports that you have to go international. So, all of them are going to adapt a little bit and try and figure that out.</p>
