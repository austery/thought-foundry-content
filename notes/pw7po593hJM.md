### 帕利塞德火灾与重建困局

**[主持人]**: Adam，很高兴见到你。感谢你来到我们的播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Adam, great to meet you. Thanks for being here on the podcast.

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 嘿，这对我来说太棒了。我是你的忠实粉丝。我在洛杉矶长大。在我十几岁的时候，在互联网还没普及之前，我就在 **K-Rock** 电台听你的 **《Loveline》**。你和 **Dr. Drew** 在节目中讨论的关于毒品、性、人类心理的内容，在我们的日常生活中是根本不存在的。你们的对话对我们这代在洛杉矶长大的人来说非常有启发性。我们学到了很多。所以，我想为此感谢你。我认为你在内容和媒体领域长期以来开辟了一个重要的角落。你已经在洛杉矶住了很久了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: Yeah, this is awesome for me. I'm a big fan. I grew up in LA. I listened to Loveline on K-Rock as a teenager pre-internet, like before the internet really took off. So, the content you and Dr. Drew put out on Loveline on drugs, sex, human psychology, this was stuff that didn't exist in our everyday lives and the discourse that you guys had. It was really kind of expansive for folks, at least in my cohort growing up in LA. We learned a lot. So, I want to thank you for that. I think you've pioneered an important corner of the world of content and media for a long time. So, thanks for that. You've lived in LA for a long time, right?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的，一辈子都住在这。所以，我们觉得在 **帕利塞德火灾 (Palisades fire)** 一周年之际进行这次对话非常合适，因为我们知道你一直对那次火灾后的行动和反应直言不讳。在聊这个的同时，我们也可以广泛地谈谈洛杉矶、加州、美国以及未来的走向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Yeah. Whole life. And so, you know, we thought this would be a great conversation to have on the one-year anniversary of the Palisades fire because we know that you've been an outspoken voice on the actions and the reactions to the Palisades fire. And while we're talking, we can also talk broadly about LA, about California, about the US, and where things are headed.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 让我们先简单回顾一下。一年前的帕利塞德火灾摧毁了 6,837 座建筑，其中包括约 5,000 栋房屋。截至 2025 年 11 月，**只有一栋房屋完成了重建**。你能谈谈火灾发生以来的看法吗？为什么过程如此缓慢？为什么火灾发生后几天和几周内做出的所有承诺都被遗忘了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Let's just do a quick recap. So, you know, the Palisades fire a year ago destroyed 6,837 structures, including about 5,000 homes, and as of November 2025, only one home has been rebuilt. Can you just give us your view on what's gone on since the fire? Why has this been such a slow process, and why have all of the promises that were made in the days and weeks after the fire forgotten about?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 我非常有资格谈论这个话题，因为我住在 **马里布 (Malibu)**，火灾开始那天早上我人就在日落大道上。我刚从 Equinox 健身房出来，抬头看向日落大道尽头的山里，就看到了烟雾。那是早上 9:45。我住在那里，当晚就被疏散了。而且我还有建筑背景，了解建筑、许可、城市法规之类的东西。

这让我联想到一个更大的话题：洛杉矶和加州为什么没有**负担得起的住房**？为什么他们建造的 400 平方英尺的流浪者安置房，每套造价要 90 万美元？我这辈子都住在加州，也一直从事建筑行业。后来我进入演艺界，我做的唯一一件事就是用演艺界赚的钱去资助更多的建筑项目。所以我从未离开过工地，只不过工地变成了我自己的家。作为业主兼建筑商，我总是要和城市的许可部门打交道。我一直知道这极其繁琐且昂贵，实际上弊大于利。这劝退了很多人。很多人会说：“我不想和这个城市打交道。” 如果你走正规渠道——工程设计、图纸审查、许可审批——不仅非常昂贵，而且极其耗时，基本上会让你想放弃项目。

我有个朋友叫 **Suzanne Summers** 和她的丈夫 **Allan Hamill**。他们以前住在马里布，但大约 20 年前一场大火烧掉了他们的房子。当他们想要重建时，**海岸委员会 (Coastal Commission)** 的要求极其苛刻，监管太多。他们当时已经 60 多岁快 70 岁了，没有 11 年的时间去重建一栋房子。最终，Allan 实在无法忍受海岸委员会了，他们收拾行李去了棕榈泉，在那儿盖了房子。这就是现状：它让很多人放弃了重建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: Well, I'm uniquely qualified to address this subject because I live in Malibu and I was physically there on Sunset the morning the fire started. I literally walked out of the Equinox gym and I looked up Sunset Boulevard up into the mountains and I saw smoke. It was at 9:45 in the morning. I live there, was evacuated that night, but also have a background in construction, building, permitting the city, regulation, that kind of stuff. Um, and I think it leads into a bigger conversation about Los Angeles and California and how come there's no affordable housing and how come when they build homeless units that are 400 square ft, they're $900,000 a unit and so on and so forth. I've lived in California my whole life and I was in construction my whole life. Um, then when I got into show business later, all I did was use the show business money to fund more building projects. So, I never got away from being on a job site. It just happened to be my own home versus other people's homes. And of course, as an owner, builder was always having to deal with permits in the city and so forth. Um, I always knew it was super cumbersome and super expensive and actually did more harm than good. It dissuaded a lot of people from building. A lot of people went, I don't want to deal with the city. I was friends with Suzanne Summers and her husband Allan Hamill and they live in Palm Springs and I said well you love Malibu so much I don't get why you don't live in Malibu and they said oh we lived in Malibu, but a fire came in and took the house down. That was probably 20 years ago. And then when we wanted to rebuild, the Coastal Commission was so burdensome and there was so much regulation. Eventually, they just packed up and they went to Palm Springs and they built a house there. So, that's essentially what it does. It dissuades a lot of people from rebuilding.

</details>

### 官僚主义与“安全至上”的代价

**Adam Carolla**: 火灾发生后的第二天早上，我做了一次紧急广播。我说：“不要指望任何重建。你们根本不知道许可流程是什么样的，不知道有多少红线和监管。” 洛杉矶市长是 **Karen Bass**，我保证什么都建不起来。顺便说一句，你们这些每年都投民主党票的蠢货，当你们拿不到许可时，也许该考虑换个政治方向了。现在一年过去了，马里布什么都没重建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: In that broadcast the following morning after the fire, I said, "Do not expect any rebuilding. You guys have no idea what the permitting process is. You have no idea how much red tape there is in regulation. This is Los Angeles. Karen Bass is the mayor. There will be nothing rebuilt. I guarantee you that. And then, by the way, all you asses that vote Democrat every year, when you don't get your permit, maybe you should think about a different direction politically. And that's what I said 8 hours after the fire and it's been a year. And there's nothing rebuilt in Malibu.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 你能帮我们诊断一下问题的根源吗？是裙带关系、腐败，还是某种为了保护环境而故意拖慢进度的动机？这种过度监管和繁文缛节背后的逻辑是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Can you just help diagnose the source of the problem? Is it cronyism, corruption by some sort of union or labor group or contractors? Is it an incompetency or is there a good motivation to save the planet and save the environment and slow things down? I mean, what is behind the overregulation and the red tape?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 我不认为这与工会或建筑商有关。我开始意识到，这基本上就是人们所说的 **“阴性法西斯主义” (Gynofascism)**，即有太多的女性处于权力位置，她们的目光死死盯着“安全”。**安全高于一切**。她们所做的一切都打着安全的旗号，并因此获得掌声，但她们没有意识到这会让一切停滞。

比如在新冠期间关闭学校，这可能是“最安全”的做法，但你伤害了孩子。你造成了大量的附带损害。她们躲在安全的盾牌后面，因为这听起来很崇高。这就像在说：“如果你的车里装了全套赛车级的防滚架，不是更安全吗？” 你会说：“大概吧。” “那再加上灭火系统呢？” “好吧。” “那把油箱换成防弹材料的燃料电池呢？” “是更安全，但现在一辆普锐斯要卖 15 万美元，没人买得起了。” 她们就躲在这种关于安全的废话后面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: I don't think any of it is connected to unions or builders. This is what I'm starting to learn is basically what people are calling gynofascism, which is way too many women in positions of power with an eye on safety. And it's safety Uber Alles. And everything they do is under the umbrella of safety. shutting schools down for COVID may be the safest thing to do, but you damage kids. But what did you do? You said, "Shut the schools, shut the churches, shut the small businesses, mask up. You want full safety." They hide behind the shield of safety because it makes them sound noble, but it's essentially like saying, "Look, wouldn't your car be safer if it had a full NASCAR style roll cage in it?" Yeah, but the Prius is going to be $150,000 and no one can afford one now.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 因为她们的职责就是增加安全性，而不是考虑对经济、负担能力或效率的二阶和三阶效应。这就像加州的**自动驾驶汽车**，每行驶一百万英里，自动驾驶能减少 95% 的死亡人数。但只要有一辆车出事，所有人都会叫停整个计划，说“机器人杀人了”，而忽视了它显著降低了整体死亡率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Because their job is to increase safety. Their job is not to think about the second and third order effects on the economy, on the affordability. This is sort of like the autonomous vehicle stuff in California. For every million miles, autonomous vehicles reduce fatalities by like 95%. But if there's one autonomous vehicle that crashes once, everyone shuts that entire program down and says, "Wait a second, we've got robots killing people." versus looking at the second order and third order effects which is significant reduction in overall fatalities.

</details>

### 领导力缺失与工会干预

**Adam Carolla**: 还有像 **Bill de Blasio** 这种笨蛋，说什么“只要死一个人就太多了”。当你听到这种话，你就知道这人不适合当领导。你不能当了将军或市长，然后宣布“只要死一个人就不行”。顺便说一句，就在你发表那番道貌岸然的讲话时，街上就有 8 个人死于**芬太尼**。所以闭嘴吧，务实一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: Well, it's like when you have these fools like Bill de Blasio saying, you know, if one person dies, that's one person too many. Whenever you hear that, you have to go, this person's a dope, and they shouldn't be in a leadership position. By the way, eight people died of fentanyl on the street in the time it took you to make that one pompous statement. So shut up and start being practical.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 没错。我在旧金山也看到了类似的情况，他们提供免费针头，为吸毒者创造所谓的“安全空间”，说是为了减少艾滋病毒的传播。但结果是更多的人死于芬太尼。这就是缺乏领导力，无法综合处理多个数据流。领导者的工作是看全局，做出如何赢得战争的决定，而不是只听一个安全专员的建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Totally. I saw this in San Francisco when they gave away needles and then they created this sort of safe space for people to do fentanyl. It's just very thoughtless in the overall view. A leader's job is to see the whole field and to make a decision on how do we win the game or how do we win the war versus listen to the one person that's the safety commissioner.

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 还有腐败问题，他们被**教师工会**控制了。州长 **Gavin Newsom** 拿了他们的钱才当选，所以他只能听命于他们。当 CDC 的 Rochelle Walensky 宣布应该开放学校时，很快就被工会压下去了，然后她不得不改口说那只是她的个人意见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: Well, also the corruption of being in the pockets of the school board union and the teachers union. Gavin Newsom, who they funnel their money to and get elected every year, do our bidding. And he's a coward. And so he does that and then at some point Rochelle Walensky of the CDC announces they should open schools, but that gets shut down really quickly by the school unions.

</details>

### 媒体偏见与新闻编辑室的演变

**[主持人]**: 谈谈媒体吧。为什么媒体变成了现在这样？这种偏见是对技术的反应吗？过去媒体控制着信息获取，但互联网出现后，纯粹的数据和报道变得无处不在。报纸和电视网是不是为了生存而不得不进化成别的东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Before we get back to the unions, I just want to hit on this point on media. Why has media gone this way? Is this bias a reaction to technology? When the internet came along, suddenly all of the information, pure data, just reporting became ubiquitous. Did they evolve, do you think, in reaction to the internet?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 我觉得有这方面的原因。但我之前提到的“阴性法西斯主义”也很关键。男人和女人是不同的，但我们现在似乎不想承认这一点。15 到 20 年前，新闻编辑室里女性只占 12%，但现在大学校长、新闻机构里大部分都是女性。

女性没有错，但如果你问：谁能更不带感情地评判一场棒球比赛？是父亲还是母亲？通常认为母亲会更倾向于保护自己的孩子。如果你现在有 57% 的女性在管理大学或《纽约时报》，她们会倾向于“选边站”。她们喜欢拜登，讨厌特朗普，于是打印出来的文章全都是这种导向。这变成了一个更加**情绪化**的过程。这就是为什么她们更适合当妈妈，因为妈妈会说“哦，宝贝过来，让我照顾你”，而爸爸会说“抹点土就好了，你没事”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: I think there's some of that. I brought up gynofascism earlier. Men and women are different and we don't seem to want to acknowledge that. 15-20 years ago newsrooms would be 12% female. Now, it's all women in these positions. If you have now 57% women running the colleges or 57% of the women at the New York Times, well then they're going to sort of pick a side and they're going to say we like Joe Biden and we hate Donald Trump. It's much more of an emotional process.

</details>

### 好莱坞的身份政治与 DEI 影响

**[主持人]**: 这种“觉醒” (Woke) 意识形态的渗透也是驱动力之一吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Is this part of the evolution of woke ideologies as they're called and that the permeation of those ideologies into media institutions seems to be a big part of the driver?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 很大程度上是。在好莱坞，我认识很多编剧，他们会说：“我接不到活儿，因为我是个中年白人男性。” 几年前，一些成功情景剧的编剧室被强行要求：“嘿，你们这儿没有年轻的拉丁裔女性。” 负责人说：“但没有年轻拉丁裔女性提交过好笑的东西啊，我们这儿全是老犹太人。” 结果他们被迫雇了几个，然后只能像保姆一样供着她们半年，因为她们写的东西根本没法播。

在追求帮助有色人种、女性和 LGBT 群体的过程中，你不可避免地会伤害到另一群人。UCLA 的名额是有限的，为了给某些人腾位置，你不得不踢走一些考试分数更高的亚裔。**DEI (多样性、公平与包容)** 雇佣正在损害产品。如果你为了政治正确限制了人才池，产品质量必然下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: A lot of it. I live in Hollywood. I can't tell you the amount of times guys had projects and stuff and just went, "Well, it's not going anywhere cuz I'm middle-aged white guy." In this neverending quest to help people of color and women and the LGBT community, at a certain point you can't just help one group without at a certain point hurting white males. All the DEI hires will hurt because the product is going to suffer.

</details>

### “避风港”与“八角笼”：美国的地理分化

**[主持人]**: 你认为这会成为未来政治的核心驱动力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Do you think that this is like what is now going to be the core driver of politics in this next cycle?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 大约 8 到 10 年前，我就对 Dr. Drew 说过：接下来会出现 **“避风港” (Safe spaces)** 和 **“八角笼” (Octagons)**。那些厌倦了“保姆国家”的人会自我隔离，搬到佛罗里达、德克萨斯或田纳西。而那些追求“避风港”的人会留在波特兰、西雅图和洛杉矶。

最终，“避风港”会崩溃，而“八角笼”会繁荣。看看那些免费发针头、不加评判的注射区，这些美好的幻想根本行不通。人性就是如此，如果你提供免费的东西且缺乏监管，系统很快就会被腐蚀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: About 8 or 10 years ago, I said, "What's next is going to be safe spaces and octagons." All the people that are tired of living in a nanny state, they're going to self-segregate. They're going to move to Florida, Texas, Tennessee. And then all the safe space people are going to end up in Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles. Eventually the safe space places are going to fall apart and the octagons are going to thrive.

</details>

### 财政危机与未来的政治走向

**[主持人]**: 但问题是，加州预计在 26-27 周期会有 180 亿的预算赤字，公共雇员的养老金缺口可能高达一万亿美元。美国有 40 万亿债务。虽然不同地区理念不同，但大家共享一张联邦资产负债表。这该如何解决？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: California is projected to have an 18 billion budget deficit. The pension shortfall in California is 600 billion, maybe as high as a trillion dollars. The United States is 40 trillion in debt. They all share the federal balance sheet. How does this resolve?

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 第一步是企业和家庭的物理搬迁。加州可以削减疯狂的开支，或者找更多的“存钱罐”来拿钱。民主党的一个根本缺陷就是：看看谁最有钱，然后看能从他们那儿拿走多少。当政府拿走你超过 50% 的收入时，我认为这就是终极的政府越权。

我们需要一个像商人一样思考的人来管理加州。无论是 **Rick Caruso** 还是 **Steve Hilton**，只要不是那些只会说“空话”的笨蛋就行。我们需要成年人站出来，停止担心下次选举，开始谈论**财政理性**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: The first part of this is going to be the physical relocation of businesses and of families. California could rein in some of its insane spending or they could just get more money. Taking more than 50% of your money, I would argue is the ultimate government overreach. Somebody's going to have to be the adult in the room at some point and stop worrying about their next election and start talking fiscal sanity.

</details>

**Adam Carolla**: 我认识的每一个被归类为“右翼”的人，他们真正想说的只是：**“请离我远点” (I just want to be left alone)**。我有自己的房产，我付了税，我想重建它，政府却说不行。我不想让政治介入我的生活，我只想做一个好邻居，过好自己的日子。但政府非要介入，干涉我们的炉灶、我们的卡车、我们的房产。当政府触及生活的每一个角落，破坏我们生活和经商的能力时，我们就达到了一个临界点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Adam Carolla**: Everybody I know who gets lumped into being a right-winger, all they say is I just want to be left alone. I have a property. I own it. I pay taxes on it. I would like to rebuild my property. And the government says no. I just want to be left alone. It's reached a breaking point because they now touch every part of our life, disrupt our ability to live our life, and we're constantly being prodded and poked in a way that feels really wrong.

</details>

**[主持人]**: Adam，感谢你今天的分享。这次对话非常棒。

**Adam Carolla**: 我的荣幸，我们很快再聊。
