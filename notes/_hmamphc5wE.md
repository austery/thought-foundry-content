### 引言与GLP-1药物革命

本周，我们将回顾今年最受欢迎的节目，重温内容，并听听自那时以来发生的变化。今天，我们回到一对已婚夫妇使用**格鲁鲁肽类药物**（GLP-1 drugs: 一种调节血糖和食欲的激素类似物，常用于治疗2型糖尿病和肥胖症）的经历，以及像**奥赛匹克**（Ozempic）这样的减肥药物如何影响人们对自身及其最亲密关系的看法。2025年12月26日，星期五。丽莎（Lisa）认为，毫不夸张地说，我们在2025年正经历一场美国国内的“**减肥革命**”。当然，我们谈论的是那些大家可能都听说过的药物，比如**奥赛匹克**（Ozempic）和**蒙扎罗**（Mounjaro）。我想大多数人都认识一些因此而改变的人，甚至很多人自己也有过使用经历。

Hey, it's Rachel. This week, we're revisiting some of our favorite shows from the year, listening back, and hearing what's happened in the time since then. Today, we return to the story of one married couple's experience with GLP-1 drugs and how the use of weight loss medications like Ozempic can impact how people see themselves and their closest relationships. It's Friday, December 26th. Lisa, I don't think it's an understatement to say that we in 2025 are in the middle of this what feels like kind of a weight loss revolution in the United States. And of course, we're talking about these drugs that everybody's probably heard of. Ompici Monaro. I think most people know somebody who's been transformed by them. Maybe a lot of people themselves have actually had some experience with them.

### 控制的幻觉与婚姻挑战

“是的。这是一场关于我们外表的革命，一场关于我们健康的革命。它具有巨大的潜力，可以帮助那些以前无法得到帮助的人。数据显示，八分之一的美国人尝试过这些药物之一。我有一个朋友在服用这种药物，他说，‘你知道，如果你能只吃五根炸薯条，而你以前却不能，这会让你觉得你可以控制生活中的一些你认为无法控制的事情。’” “那么，你还能控制什么呢？你能控制你与孩子相处的方式，你与老板谈话的方式吗？真正引起我兴趣的是，GLP-1药物如何影响婚姻，尤其是在一方服用药物而另一方不服用时。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> Yeah. It's a revolution in how we look. It's a revolution in our health. It's got gigantic potential to help people who have not been able to be helped before. The data show that one in eight Americans >> has tried one of these drugs. Like I have a friend who takes the medicine and he says, you know, if you are able to eat just five French fries >> and you used to not be able to eat just five French fries, it gives you grounding in the idea that you can control things in your life that you didn't think you could control. >> So what else can you control? >> [music] >> Can you control the way you relate [music] to your children, the way you talk to your boss? And what really interested [music] me was this question of how the GLP1 drugs affected a marriage, especially when one partner is on the drugs and [music] the other partner isn't.
</details>

### 寻找声音与初步反馈

“你是如何着手寻找合适的人来谈论并解答这个问题的？我们当时有一个‘公开征集’环节，向公众提出一个问题，然后收集反馈。问题是：‘像奥赛匹克（Ozempic）这样的GLP-1药物及其后续的体重减轻是否改变了你的关系？’我收到了很多回复，其中一个引起了我的注意。他写道：‘我相信它改变了一些事情。饮酒量减少，餐食份量变小，健康状况改善。但我想GLP-1影响了我妻子的性欲，让她对性失去兴趣，’‘可能部分是由于形象问题，也包括她情绪波动的增加。’”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
How did you go about trying to find the right people to talk to to to satisfy that question? Right. Well, we at the times have a thing called a call out where you ask the public a question >> and then we get responses to that question and the question was this. Has a GLP-1 drug like Ompic and subsequent weight loss changed your relationship? Um, and I was getting all of these responses and one jumped out at me. He wrote, "I believe it has changed a few things. Less alcohol consumption, smaller meal portions, improved health outcomes, but I believe GLP1 has affected my wife's libido, no interest in sex, >> perhaps due in part to image issues, also increased mood swings on her part."

### 珍与哈维尔：相遇与婚前

我当时想，这字里行间有很多信息。于是我打电话给他们，他们同意参与这个故事，只要我使用他们的中间名。他叫**哈维尔**（Javier），她叫**珍妮**（Jean）。他们住在新英格兰地区一个不错的郊区。几天前我们庆祝了结婚纪念日。他们结婚15年了。我认为，首先谈谈他们使用药物之前的关系是很有帮助的。这可以追溯到高中时期。我高二时遇到了她，那是在1987年。他们都成长在萨克拉门托。你注意到她什么？是什么让你喜欢她？“她的个性。非常外向，笑容很棒。”“嗯，我觉得他很帅。但是她当时身材比较丰满，并且对此感到极度不自信。所以，总是觉得自己很糟糕，从未觉得自己有吸引力。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
And I thought, there's a lot between the lines here. And so I called them up and they agreed to participate in the story as long as I used their middle names. >> Javier. >> Javier. So he is Javier and she is Jean. >> J E A N E. >> They live in New England in sort of a nice suburb. >> We celebrated our anniversary a few days ago. >> They had been married for 15 years. And I think maybe it's helpful to talk first about what their relationship was like before the drugs. And it goes back to high school. >> Junior year is when I met her. So that takes us to 1987. >> They both grew up in Sacramento. >> What did you notice about her? Like what what made you like her? >> Her personality. Very outgoing, great smile. >> Well, I I thought he was cute. Um, >> but she was like in a bigger body and excruciatingly self-conscious about that. >> So, always felt awful, never felt attractive.
</details>

### 重逢与婚姻生活

“他当时迷恋她。你知道，我生命中有过这样的时刻，有人实际上是在调情，或者试图接近我，但我就是无法察觉，因为我对自己身体感到非常不自在。所以，即使她也迷恋他，她也不会相信。”他们是高中时期的“**未遂恋人**”（unrequited high school sweethearts），并且他们各自都与其他人结婚了。“我当时的情况是，我的第一段婚姻即将结束。我的第一段婚姻刚刚结束。然后，我们的20周年同学聚会即将在秋季举行。我告诉她，很高兴能重新联系并喝杯咖啡。他们告诉我关于他们第一次约会的事。那杯咖啡最终变成了一顿晚餐和几杯啤酒，然后他们俩都告诉我了他们第一次发生性关系的事。”他谈论这件事的方式，简直就是一次“**不可思议的、毫无顾忌的**”互动。她没有说：“别看我。”或者，“我对此感到羞耻，”或者，“我的胸部太大了，”或者，“我的臀部太大了。”从没有过这样的谈论。所以，我当时觉得她对自己的身体很满意。“嗯。还有你和其他女性在一起的时候也是这样吗？”“我把这个故事讲给他们听。她说，‘我记不太清楚了。’现在，我们知道他们最终走到了一起，对吧？他们结婚了。是的。他们搬到了东海岸，她在那里的大公司里获得了重要的职位。她是主要的经济来源。你感觉到他们契合彼此的浪漫幻想，并且对对方有极强的性吸引力。这是他们作为夫妻身份认同的重要组成部分。他们有一个孩子。他们过上了两人都热爱食物、热爱葡萄酒的生活，并在餐厅里摆放了一个大酒柜。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> And he had a crush on her. >> You know, there have been times in my life where, you know, someone was actually flirting with me or trying to you come on to me and I I just don't register the signs because I feel so uncomfortable in my own body. So even though she had a crush on him too, she wouldn't believe [music] it. They were unrequited high school sweethearts and they each [music] married other people. >> What happened was that um my first marriage was coming to an end. >> My first marriage had just ended >> and then >> our 20-year reunion was coming up that fall >> and I told her that it'd be great to connect and have a cup of coffee. They told me about their first date. >> The cup of coffee ended up being a dinner and some beers and then >> and they both told me about the first time that they had sex. The way he talked about it was just as this unbelievably magical >> uninhibited interaction. She didn't say, "Don't look at me." Or, "I'm ashamed at this," or, "The other," or, "My boobs are too big," or, "My butt's too big." >> There was never any talk of that. So, >> I I kind of thought that she was happy in her body. >> Mhm. And other women that you [music] had been with like that. >> And I'm running the story by the both of them. [music] And she was like, I don't exactly remember it that way. Now, we know that they eventually get together, right? They get married. >> Yeah. They move to the east coast where she gets big jobs in corporations. She's the earner. You get the sense that they fit each other's romantic fantasies and they're extremely sexually attracted to each other. It's a big part of their identity as a couple. They have a child. They settle into a life where they both love food. They love wine and they get a big wine fridge in their dining room.
</details>

### 体重困扰与“食物噪音”

“过着梦想般的生活。”“完全是。他们是行动派，你知道吗？他们喜欢享受生活。但在此过程中，你知道，珍（Jean）一直与体重作斗争。“从**身体质量指数**（BMI: 衡量一个人体重相对于身高的指标，用于评估是否超重或肥胖）的角度来看，我曾肥胖，在她生下孩子后。她很胖。她讨厌它。她患有**产后抑郁**（postpartum depression: 产后女性可能经历的一种抑郁症）。她无法减掉体重。”“嗯。”“她会说，她一生中曾多次增重又减掉70磅，对她来说，这感觉就像一场无休止的挣扎。”“她有没有告诉你她为什么如此难以保持体重？她谈到了‘**食物噪音**’（food noise: 指大脑中持续存在的关于食物的想法和冲动，导致难以控制进食）。对我来说，‘食物噪音’感觉就像持续不断地想吃东西。我不觉得饿，也不觉得饱，所以我没有那些生理上的触发信号来知道何时该吃东西。”“以及她描述的那种因无法控制而产生的自我憎恨感，就像是意志力的失败，‘然后对我在吃的东西感到尴尬。所以我在家自己一个人时偷偷吃东西，吃一大桶冰淇淋，因为我能吃，而且我能藏起来。’”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> Living the dream. >> Totally. They're doers, you know. They like to embibe in life. But throughout this, you know, Jean struggled with her weight. >> I was obese um from a BMI perspective >> after she had her baby. She was heavy. She hated it. She had postpartum depression. She could not lose the weight. >> Mhm. >> And she would say she's gained and lost 70 lbs multiple times in her life and it just felt like an endless struggle to her. Did she tell you why she was having so much trouble keeping the weight off? She talked about food noise. >> Yeah, food noise to me feels like a constant need to eat. I don't feel hungry. I don't feel full, so I don't have those physiological triggers to know when to eat. >> And the feeling of self-loathing that she describes of not being able to control that, like it's a failure of will >> and then being embarrassed about the food that I was eating. So sneaking food when I was home by myself, having a pint of ice cream because I could and I could hide it just
</details>

### 健康问题与药物干预

“最终这会导致健康问题。我确实有一些其他的慢性病，这些病是随着时间发展而来的。我患有**非酒精性脂肪肝病**（non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: 肝脏中脂肪堆积，与酒精无关的疾病）。然后她说，‘那关于这些GLP-1药物呢？’‘他开了处方。丽莎（Lisa），你能提醒我们一下，这些药物到底是如何起作用的吗？’” “嗯，它们通过减少你的饥饿感来起作用。因此，人们会非常快速地减掉大量体重。那些一生都在节食并与体重作斗争的人，只要他们还在服用药物，就能保持体重不增加。她开始非常快速地减掉体重，你知道，10磅、20磅。我在八个月内减掉了60磅。然后，她注意到人们开始以不同的方式对待她。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> eventually this bleeds to health issues. >> Um I do have um other chronic conditions that it developed over time. I had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease >> and she says to her doctor, "How about one of these GLP1 drugs?" >> And he wrote the script. And can you just remind us, Lisa, how do these drugs actually work? >> Well, it they work by reducing your feeling of being hungry. And because of that, people lose a ton of weight really fast. And people who have been dieting their whole lives and struggling with their weight are able to keep their weight off as long as they're on the drugs. And, you know, she starts losing a lot of weight really fast. You know, 10 lbs, 20 pounds. I mean, she lost 60 pounds inside of eight months. And then, you know, she notices that like people start treating her differently.
</details>

### 感知变化与社会机遇

“是的，甚至在工作中。她一直是一位成功的职业人士。但我觉得营销团队现在把我推到前台更多了。现在突然在工作中，她获得了这些面向公众的机会，比如作为‘**发言人**’（talking head）接受媒体采访，这是她以前从未有过的。但我感觉大家对我的看法不同了。我还是同一个人，只是瘦了60磅。其他人也对这些药物说过类似的话：机会随之而来，很多人跟我谈话时都说，机会摆在他们面前，比如升职和约会。如果你已婚，这会带来一系列你必须突然开始弄清楚的事情，而你完全没有预料到。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> Well, and even at work, >> you know, she's a successful professional. She's always been a successful professional. >> But I feel like the marketing team is putting me out there more. Now suddenly at work she's getting these outward facing opportunities where she's being put forward as a talking head to talk to the media for example >> in a way that she hadn't been before. >> But I feel like there's this different perception of me. I'm the same person. I'm just 60 [music] lbs lighter. Now, this is a thing that others have said too about these drugs that doors open and a lot of the people I talked to for this story talk about the opportunities that get presented to them, promotions and dates. And if you're married, it presents a whole world of things that you have to suddenly start figuring out that you didn't anticipate at all.
</details>

### 关系张力与亲密疏远

这对**珍**（Jean）和**哈维尔**（Javier）来说确实如此。我们稍后回来。丽莎（Lisa），我非常好奇珍（Jean）正在经历的这些巨大的身心变化，是如何影响她与哈维尔（Javier）的关系的。我的意思是，首先发生的事情之一是她完全失去了对酒精的食欲。对珍（Jean）来说，食欲的丧失改变了她与丈夫享受乐趣的整个方式。她不再能像以前那样，在一天结束时一起窝在沙发上开一瓶酒，或者去当地的啤酒吧尝试新啤酒了。这些对她来说都不再有吸引力了。“我们去朋友家玩，比如玩游戏之夜之类的。我还是会去，只是不喝酒了。”“而且那样也挺好。”“是的。事实上，她有一个内向的一面，以前无法表达出来，因为她忙于做一个取悦他人的外向者，因为她身材丰满，她希望人们喜欢她。我不像我丈夫那样是夜猫子。我喜欢睡前在Kindle上读点书。而一旦她身材变小了，她就能坚持自己，说‘其实，我喜欢待在家里。’”但她也告诉哈维尔（Javier），她不想做那些他认为她喜欢、他们曾经一起喜欢的事情。“他们曾经一起喜欢，对吧？他对此很不高兴。”“不，不。我喜欢随遇而安，活在当下，享受社交活动或聚会。是的。他会说，‘不，我们不是这样的。我们是做这些事情的人。’”听起来，这种生活方式的改变导致了很多紧张关系，“比紧张还多。”我的意思是，我认为他们经历了一段非常、非常、非常艰难的时期。当我见到他们时，他们经常吵架。“嗯，以前是谈话，而现在变成了争吵，我们中的一个人会带着怒气离开，因为我们在某件事上意见不合。他们的争吵可能是响亮而难看的。所以我开始真正地想，‘我到底和谁在一起？’归根结底，这让我非常困惑，关于如何处理我们的关系。我甚至对她说，‘我需要，我认不出你了。我需要一张地图。我需要一条路。’”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
[music] And that was definitely true for Jean and Javier. [music] We'll be right back. Lisa, I'm so curious how these huge changes that Gene is going through, both physically and emotionally are affecting her relationship with Javier. I mean, one of the first things that happened was that she totally lost her appetite for alcohol. >> And for Jean, the loss of appetite just changed her whole approach to having fun with her husband. I mean, no longer could they sit on the couch and unccork a bottle of wine at the end of the day or go to the local brew pub and try out the new beer. None of it felt good to her anymore. >> We go over to a friend's house and we'll have a game night or something like that. I mean, we'll still go. I just won't drink. >> And that's fine. >> Yeah. In fact, >> she had an introverted side that hadn't been able to express herself because she was so busy being a pleaser extrovert cuz she was in a bigger body and she wanted people to like her. >> I am not as much of a night owl as my husband is. And I like to read my Kindle a little bit before I go to sleep at night. And >> once she was in a smaller body, she could assert herself and say like, "Actually, I like being at home." But she's also telling Javier she doesn't want to do the things that he thought that she loved and that they loved together. >> They love together, right? How does he respond to all this? How does he >> He does not like it. >> No, no. I like going with the flow. I mean, living in the moment and enjoying, you know, whatever's going on the in social aspects or social events. Yeah. I >> He was like, "No, this is not how we are. We are the people who do these things." >> I think he misses his drinking buddy, the person who is going to stay out late. It sounds like the lifestyle stuff led to a lot of tension, >> more than tension. I mean, I think they had a really, really, really hard time. And when I met them, they were fighting a lot. >> Um, before it was a conversation and you know, and now it's a fight and one of us is going to walk away angry um because we're not seeing eye to eye on something >> and their fights could be loud and ugly. So I started really um wondering who I was with. Bottom line is it became very confusing to me as far as as far as how to manage our relationship. I would even comment to her and say, you know, I need I don't recognize you. I need a road map. I need I need a road.
</details>

### 性生活停滞与身体认同

“改变最大的事情之一是，他们完全停止了性生活。我曾经喜欢在她身边感受她的身体，她丰满的身体躺在我身边。她身体的柔软，你知道，多出来的肚子和多出来的臀部，你知道，在我身边。”他们俩都谈到了失去臀部。“你怀念你以前身体的哪些方面吗？”“我的臀部。”他们俩都爱她以前的臀部。“所以，我怀念那种丰满感。能够靠在她身边，感受她，可以说，‘她像毯子一样覆盖在我身上。’现在这不再可能了。现在是拥抱，而且是尽可能紧密地拥抱。这就是亲密的全部程度。我不知道为什么没有身体上的亲密关系，或者说一直没有。他们曾经拥有的这种身体上的连接，已经完全变成了别的东西。他们俩都不知道该如何再次找回它。”“而这个新身体，我一直没有真正去触碰或探索。它对你来说不再那么容易接近了。”“是的。不。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
>> One of the biggest things that changed is that they completely stopped having sex. >> I used to love feeling her body, her big body next to me in bed. the softness uh of her body, you know, the extra tummy and the extra booty, you know, next to >> They both talk about the loss of her butt. >> Are there things you miss about your previous body? >> My butt. >> They both loved her butt. >> So, I I miss that that voluuptuousness. Uh being able to lean up next to her and feel her for lack of a better word, draping over me. That's no longer an option. Now it's it's cuddling and it's cuddling as tight and closely as we can or as I can. And that's that's the extent of the intimacy. I I'm at a loss for why there's no physical intimacy >> or hasn't been any. this like physical connection [music] that they had has completely changed [music] into something else. And neither one of them knows exactly how to find it again. >> And [music] this new body I haven't really been able to touch or or explore or anything like that. >> It's not as accessible to you. >> It's not. No.
</details>

### 理论、界限与自我重塑

“为什么他们没有发生性关系？这仅仅是药物减少的另一种食欲吗？我的意思是，那是**哈维尔**（Javier）的理论。也许**珍**（Jean）有不同的看法。她经历了更年期。她长期服用抗抑郁药。这两种情况都知道会抑制性欲。但我认为这里面还有更深层的原因。”“我还没告诉他。我以前只是不会说‘不’。嗯。所以，她开始能够区分‘为别人做他们想要的事情’和‘能够清晰地表达自己想要什么’。我正在设定界限。我不想发生性关系，但以前我会的。”“但他非常想成为她充满爱意的伴侣。”“嗯。听起来这些药物似乎‘**挖掘**’（unearthed）出了某些东西。它们挖掘出了他们性生活中某种他们可能只模糊意识到，但肯定没有能力去采取行动的动态，直到她对自己感觉不同。是的，我认为这是真的。我认为他们俩都被此‘**完全蒙蔽**’（blindsided）了。”“我觉得我们一直‘**目标一致**’（on the same page），并且一起前进，我们是一艘船。”“我们不是夜空中擦肩而过的两艘船，我们是一艘船。”“所以你在某种程度上获得了‘**赋权**’（empowered），可以占据空间，说出你想要什么，这迫使你必须弄清楚你想要什么。是的。是的。不仅仅是‘我想在晚上10点离开派对’，你知道，那很简单。‘我想要一段与我丈夫的性关系吗？我想要辞掉我的公司工作吗？我想要……’这些都是更宏大的问题。”“是的。是的。嗯，而且有点可悲的是，53岁了，我才开始思考这些。难道这些不应该是人们毕业后就会思考的事情吗？我一直是个‘**乖乖女**’（good girl），做着别人期望我做的事。嗯。在某种身材里。而现在你有了不同的……在某种身材里。”“是的。我仍然坚信这是我为自己做过的最棒的事情之一。就是这样。你知道，我减掉了体重，而且我会终生保持下去，我对此非常感激。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Why haven't they had sex? Like, was that just another appetite that the drugs reduced? I mean, that's what Javier's theory was. Is maybe >> Jean has different theories of the case. She's gone through menopause. She's been on anti-depressants for a really long time. And both of those things are known to suppress sex drive. But I think there's actually something bigger at work here. >> I haven't said this to him. I just didn't say no before. Mhm. So, >> she started to be able to draw boundaries between doing things for other people because they want them and being able to articulate what she wants. >> I'm setting the boundaries. I don't want to have sex, but before I would, >> but he very much wants to be her loving partner. >> Mhm. It sounds like the drugs kind of unearthed something. They unearthed some kind of dynamic in their sex life that Gene had only been maybe vaguely aware of, but certainly had not been in a position to act on before she felt differently about herself. Yes, I think that's true. I think they were both completely blindsided [music] by that. >> I felt that we were always on the same page and going on, you know, we're on the same [music] >> We weren't two ships in the night crossing paths. we were one >> one ship. >> So you're empowered in a way to take up space to say what you want and that forces you to have to figure out what you want. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Beyond just like I want to leave the party at 10:00, you know, that's in a way that's easy. Like do I want to have a sexual relationship with my husband? Do I want to leave my corporate job? Do I wanna like like these are much bigger questions? >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, and kind of sad that at 53 that I'm starting to have those thoughts. Aren't those the kinds of things that [music] most people think about when they've graduated from school? Right. I just I'm the good girl and I do what what's expected. >> Mhm. In a certain body. And now you have a different >> in a certain body. >> Yeah. >> I still feel very strongly that this is the one of the best things that I've done for myself. This is it. [music] you know, I I have lost the weight and I will maintain this for life and I'm just so grateful.

### 一年后的更新：重拾亲密

休息过后，丽莎（Lisa）再次联系了**珍**（Jean）和**哈维尔**（Javier），想了解在节目最初播出一年后，他们关系的变化情况。“嗨，你们好吗？”“能听到我吗？”“我们能听到你。所以，我们大约在一年前见面。是的。告诉我你们之间有什么变化？我不再是处女了。（笑声）你这是什么意思？你们在发生性关系吗？（笑声）是的。不经常，但是的。”“是的。我们……至少不再是‘**干旱期**’（dry spell: 指一段时间内缺乏某种活动或体验，此处指性生活）了。这么说吧。太棒了。珍（Jean），是什么促使你？你身上发生了什么变化？我做了一个‘**妈妈焕新术**’（mommy makeover: 指女性在生育后进行的整形手术组合，旨在恢复或改善体型和外貌）。我做了**腹部整形术**（tummy tuck: 一种整形手术，用于去除腹部多余的皮肤和脂肪，并收紧腹部肌肉），做了**乳房缩小和提升术**（breast reduction and lift: 整形手术，用于减小乳房尺寸并提升下垂的乳房）。还做了手臂手术，去除多余皮肤。所以，我当时感到充满爱意和感激。”“是的。突然之间，几周前，珍（Jean）说：‘嘿，我想谢谢你在我经历身体形象问题和恐惧的冒险过程中一直如此支持我。’我当时想，‘哇，好吧。不客气。’你知道，‘宝贝，我爱你。’事情就这样结束了。”“那么，具体说说吧。你在哪里？发生了什么？是什么让你有了心情？（笑声）好的。不，我是说早上在家的时候，珍（Jean）说：‘嘿，你知道，我们说过我们有一些时间，我现在感觉……我感觉很‘**情欲高涨**’（amorous: 指有性欲的，渴望亲密的）。你想……’‘是的，我……我想她说‘我对它持开放态度’。我当时想，‘好吧，衣服不用脱了。’（笑声）”
