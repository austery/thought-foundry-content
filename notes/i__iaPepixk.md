### 数据中心能源需求的逆向观点

**Andy DeVries**: 所有这些数据都集中在十年末，而新的太阳能发电现在就能压低电价。所以，未来几年你实际上会希望做空电力，然后转为做多。如果你能找出这个转变点，就能在远期电力曲线或天然气曲线中赚大钱。至于你最初的问题，我前面说过，数据中心需要两到三年建造，新的发电厂需要四到五年。但实际上，你并不需要像大家所说的那么多新发电厂。

**Constellation**的首席执行官前几天在电话会议上说，他以**德克萨斯州**市场为例，这是一个87吉瓦的峰值市场。他说，你明天就可以给**德克萨斯州**增加10吉瓦的电力，这相当于将**英伟达（Nvidia）**一整年的所有芯片都送到**德克萨斯州**，并让它们24/7运行。那就是10吉瓦。他说，你现在就可以运行它。现有的电网、现有的发电厂，除了每年40到50小时外，都能满足需求。我们进行了压力测试。有些燃煤电厂可以提高容量系数，也有很多燃气电厂可以做到。所以我不知道是40小时、100小时还是140小时，但与其让公用事业公司花费100亿美元连接遥远的风力发电场，不如每年支付给其他化工或炼油公司，让它们停运40到50小时，这更合理。这就是论点。我们有点处于中间立场，但电网上有充足的现有容量可以提升以满足需求。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So all this data set of numbers are weighted towards the end of the decade, whereas the new solar is right here, right now, crushing power prices. So you actually want to be a little short power for the next few years and then flip to being long. And if you can figure out when that flip is, you can make a lot of money in either the forward power curves or the natural gas curves. But as far as your original question, as I said, data centers, 2 or 3 years to build new power plants, 4 or 5. But then you don't need as many new power plants as everyone's saying. So **Constellation** CEO said on a call the other day, he said he use the **Texas** market. He said 87 gigawatt peak market. You could add ten gigawatts to **Texas** tomorrow, which would be the equivalent of sending every single **Nvidia** chip for an entire year to **Texas** and running them 24 over seven. That's ten gigawatts. He was you could run it right now. Existing grid, existing plants for all but 40 50 hours a year. We stress tested it. There are some coal plants that could ramp up capacity factor. There's plenty of gas plants I can so I don't know if it's 40 hours, 100 hours, 140 hours, but it makes more sense to pay someone else not to run their chemical company, the refinery company, for 40 50 hours a year, rather than have the utilities go out and spend $10 billion connecting far away wind farms. That's the argument. We're sort of come in the middle of it, but there is plenty of existing capacity on the grid that could ramp up to meet it.

### 公用事业分析师角色的转变

**Tracey Alloway**: 大家好，欢迎收听**Odd Lots**播客的又一期节目。我是**Tracey Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Hello, and welcome to another episode of the **Odd Lots** podcast. I'm **Tracey Alloway**.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我是**Joe Weisenthal**。**Joe**，想象你是一名公用事业分析师。多年来你一直在公用事业分析的领域辛勤工作。我们喜欢谈论公用事业，我们谈论能源，我们觉得几乎所有事情都很有趣。没错，我们是机会均等的兴趣爱好者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I'm **Joe Weisenthal**. Joe. Imagine you are a utilities analyst. Yeah. And for years you are laboring in the utility analysis mines. And you know, we like talking about utilities. We talk about energy. We find pretty much anything interesting. That's right. Equal opportunity. Interest people. We are.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 但你必须说公用事业有一段时间相对平静。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: But yes, you got to say utilities for a while. Some people would say it was a little more quiet.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。我的意思是，在我们职业生涯的大部分时间里，如果你是一名公用事业分析师，你工作的一个重要部分，也许我错了，但大众讨论的焦点是收益率相对于国债。它们被视为债券类工具，也许有一些增长，但大致上是可行的、避险的股息型投资。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No. That's right. I mean, for most of our careers, I think if you were a utilities analyst, a really big part of your job. And maybe I'm wrong, but I just didn't. The popular discourse was like talking about yield relative to treasuries, right? They were seen as sort of bond like instruments, etc. maybe a little bit of growth, but roughly viable, safe haven ish dividend plays like us. Totally.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 既然我知道我们这次谈话的方向，过去几年来的主题之一就是那些曾经稳定或周期性的传统行业，现在正以一种长期增长的方式发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: And since I know where we're going with this conversation, one of the themes of the last few years has been what I would say is the old industries that were either stable or cyclical, becoming secular in the way they grow.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我认为这是对的。所以现在发生的情况是，如果你曾经是一名，我不想说“卑微”的公用事业分析师，但也许是你的行业之外被遗忘的公用事业分析师，突然之间你变得非常抢手。因为现在大家都在谈论人工智能的建设及其能源限制。所以很显然，很多人都想从公用事业的角度来看待这个问题。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I think that's right. So what is happening now is if you were, I don't want to say a lowly utilities analyst, but you know maybe a sort of forgotten utilities analyst outside of your sector. Suddenly you are very in demand right. Because all you hear about nowadays is the I build out an energy constraints on that. And so obviously a lot of people want to look at it from a utilities perspective. Totally.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 我总觉得有些人在职业生涯中运气真好。你可以成为一名分析师，学习建模技能和各种知识，然后你被分配到某个领域，有人被分配到农机设备，另一个人在2022年被分配到公用事业。然后他们就经常上电视了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: I always think like, what a great look that some people have in their careers. You know, you could be an analyst and learn the modeling skills and all kinds of stuff, and then you get allocated and someone gets allocated, I don't know, farm equipment and another person gets allocated to they wind up in utilities in 2022. And it's like, man, they're on TV all the time.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我在**Business Insider**的老板**Henry Blodget**，他在90年代末是互联网分析师，那真是绝佳的时机和运气。这就像新闻业一样，完全一样。我一开始是报道航空公司的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: My old boss at **Business Insider**, **Henry Blodget**, it's like he was there is an internet analyst and like the late 90s, what amazing timing and luck. And so it's like journalism in the air. It's the same. It's the exact same thing. I started out covering airlines.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 是啊，各种各样的事情，但那些都很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Yeah, of all things, but those were interesting.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 总之，很高兴地说我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾。我们将与一位公用事业分析师交谈，他碰巧对数据中心的建设以及实际所需的能源量持非常逆向的看法。我们已经听到了很多对数据中心建设非常看好的人的观点。所以这将是一个很有用的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Anyway, I'm glad to say we do in fact have the perfect guest. So we're going to be speaking to a utilities analyst, someone who happens to have a very contrarian take on the data center buildout and how much energy is actually required. We've been hearing a lot from people who are very, very bullish on the data center buildout. So this will be a useful.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 我喜欢他们的观点，我喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: I love their point I love it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，事不宜迟，欢迎**CreditSights**的投资者关系、信贷主管兼公用事业和电力主管**Andy DeVries**。非常感谢你来**Odd Lots**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay, so without further ado, **Andy DeVries**, head of Investor and great credit and head of utilities and power over at **CreditSights**. Thank you so much for coming on. **Odd Lots**.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 谢谢，这是我的荣幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Thank you. The pleasure's mine.

### 公用事业分析师的黄金时代

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么，现在成为一名公用事业分析师是不是很棒？甚至更好。你的**Bloomberg News**记者**Josh Saul**写了一篇文章，关于现在数据中心出现后，大型公用事业分析师的工作发生了多大变化。但我们也有过史上最大的破产案，**安然（Enron）**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So is a great to be a utilities analyst right now. Even better. Your your **Bloomberg News** reporter, **Josh Saul** wrote an article about the how much it's changed for bigger utilities analysts now with the data centers are here. But the push back we did have the largest bankruptcy of all time. And **Enron**.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 哦，是的，史上最大的杠杆收购（LBO），**TXU**，后来破产了。以及史上最大的私募股权回报，**Calpine**的250亿美元，这超过了**Apollo**的**Lion ELP**交易和**Blackstone**的**Hilton**交易。所以我们一路走来也经历了很多乐趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Oh yeah, the largest LBO of all time. And **TXU**, which then went bankrupt and the largest private equity return ever. And **Calpine**, 25 billion, which exceeds **Apollo**'s **lion ELP** trade and **Blackstone**'s **Hilton** trade. So we have had a lot of fun along the way.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 你在整个时间线中一直是一名公用事业分析师吗？你做了多久了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Have you been a utilities analyst throughout that entire timeline? How long have you been doing it?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 我从第一次天然气破产开始，然后是第二次。现在我们已经与数据中心打了25年交道了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: I started with the first gas bankruptcy and then I went to the second. And here we are with data centers for 25 years.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 哇，那你真是见证了这一切。可以这么说。你说的完全正确。公用事业领域确实发生过一些灾难和巨大的成功。当然，它们也经常成为新闻焦点，比如几年前在**加利福尼亚州**发生的火灾，以及关于这些情况中风险分配的法庭审判。你提到了**安然**等等，但同样可以说，日常讨论中，它们更多被视为债券类工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Wow. So you really have seen it all. It is fair to say so. You're absolutely right. There have been some disasters and home runs and utilities. You know, they do get central in the news obviously with the fires, that we saw, for example, in California several years ago and the court trials about allocation of risk in those, situations. You mentioned **Enron**, etc., but it is also fair to say that much of the discourse in day to day has been like these are sort of bond like instruments.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Absolutely.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 在我们深入讨论之前，先跟我们聊聊，在数据中心出现之前，你作为公用事业分析师的日常工作是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Before we get into that, just like, sort of like talk to us about what a what a normal day is like. And when you're thinking about utility before, you know, centers.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的，在数据中心出现之前，五年前，或者更早，你主要关注大量的费率案件，研究很多当地新闻，关注立法，阅读枯燥的监管文件，然后追踪天然气价格并开始设定电价。在联邦层面，可再生能源显然正在取代煤炭，这现在产生了巨大的影响。所以我觉得这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yeah. Pre data centers five years ago whatever pre data centers you're looking at a lot of rate cases okay. Studying a lot of local news. You're looking at legislation. You're reading you know dry regulatory documents. And then you're tracking natural gas prices and start setting the price of power. Yeah. Right. On the federal level, you obviously have the renewables displacing coal. And that's, you know, obviously having a big impact now. So it's a little I actually think it's a lot of fun.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我的印象是，政策方面似乎一直是需要关注的最重要的事情。是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: My impression was always the policy aspect of it seemed kind of the most important thing to keep track of. Is that right?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 绝对是。这不仅是州级层面，联邦层面也一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Absolutely. And that's down to the state level, but also the federal as well.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我们做过几次能源节目。所以，我仍在努力理解似乎管理我们能源基础设施的这种规则拼凑。但无论如何，顺便说一句，这有点像，我尽量不说冒犯的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, we've done a few energy. Yeah. So it's still trying to wrap my head around the sort of patchwork of, rules that seem to govern our energy, infrastructure. But anyway, there's something, by the way, a little bit like I'm trying I'm going to try and not say an offensive word.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: **Joe**，说吧，说吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Do a Joe, do it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你应该稍微想想，当你和这个领域的人交谈时，他们会说：“这怎么定价的？”他们会问：“你是在谈论市场还是中央？”我不知道。他们会问：“你是在谈论费率委员会还是市场价格？”无论如何，尤其是在40分钟的播客中，很难概括。但我喜欢这些人，别误会，他们是我最喜欢的人。**Andy**，目前公用事业人员、分析师、投资者之间的情绪如何？最近不是有个会议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You should think a little Aspie about the way, like, you talk to people in this space and you're like, well, how is this get priced? And they're like, well, are you talking about market or central? It's like, okay, I don't know. You know, it's like, are you talking about a rate board or are you talking about market prices? It's so hard anyway, especially in a 40 minute podcast, to try to generalize that. But I love the people. Don't get me wrong, those are my favorite people anyway. Andy, what is the mood like at the moment among, utilities people, analysts, investors? Wasn't there a conference recently?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 每个人都对此充满热情。所以今年最大的会议是11月的**EEI**。会议座无虚席，有些演示甚至站满了人。你们在**CNBC**的竞争对手首次从现场直播。这可能是一个顶部的信号。所以，是的，人们非常高兴。量化一下，公用事业通常每年增长4%、5%、6%，然后增长到5%到7%，现在某些我们稍后会谈到的公司每年增长高达8%。这都是由数据中心增长推动的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Everyone's, gung ho on this. So the biggest conference of the year is **EEI** in November. And, it was packed. It was standing room only for some of these presentations. Wow. Your competitors at **CNBC** were broadcasting from the floor for the first time. That probably a sign of a top. So, yeah, people are very happy in it just to quantify it. Utilities have generally grown around 4 or 5, 6% a year, and then that's moved to 5 to 7% a year. And now certain names which we'll talk about later are up to 8% a year. And that's driven by data center growth.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 再跟我们多谈谈。我的意思是，我正在看**XLU ETF**的图表。我觉得它并没有那么疯狂。但跟我们谈谈，或许量化一下这种狂热。所以，我们不再仅仅是衡量债券代理和关注政策等等。现在有一个长期增长的驱动因素。跟我们谈谈看涨的情况，以及我们如何看待这种看涨情况，它如何体现在可交易工具中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Talk to us a little bit more about that. So what is the I mean, I'm like looking at a chart of the **XLU ETF**. I don't think it's like insane. But talk to us a little bit about like maybe quantify the exuberance for us. So it's like, okay, we we are no longer just in the business of measuring bond proxies and looking at policies, etc.. There was a secular growth driver. Talk to us about like the bull case, and then also how we would see the bull case, sort of like how it's manifesting into tradable instruments.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。你拉出了**XLU**的图表。显然，它仍然是一个对利率非常敏感的行业。是的，就像股息一样，你可以在其他固定收益工具中找到更高的收益率。没错。所以，去年可能表现不佳。但行业认为，随着每股收益增长率上升到中高个位数，它就不应该对利率那么敏感了。所以这是投资者目前正在进行的重大辩论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. And you pulled up the graph of the **XLU**. Obviously, it's still a very interest rate sensitive sector. Yeah. That's like dividends. You can find higher yields and other fixed income instruments. Yeah. Right. So you know maybe didn't do so well last year. But the industry argues that as this EPS growth rate goes up to the high single digits, mid to high single digits, that it shouldn't be as interest rate sensitive. So that's the big debate going on with investors right now in this talk.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我的意思是，**XLU**表现非常好。所以你获得了资本。它确实表现不错。如果你拉远看，它看起来相当好。它表现不错。顺便说一句，那是我对**比特币**投资者的印象。拉远看，就拉远看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I mean the **XLU** has done very well. So you have gotten both the capital. It has gone done well. If you zoom out, it looks pretty good. It's done well. That's my impression of a **bitcoin** investor, by the way. Zoom out. Just zoom.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 好的。你得到了那份息票。所以，在正常时期，你可能只对息票感到满意。你得到了息票。此外，美联储长期保持零利率，所以公用事业是首选。这只是数学问题。然后，一旦美联储开始加息，**ChatGPT**就出现了，突然之间就有了数据中心。所以现在你突然在增长方面取得了进展，而你不需要对利率那么敏感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: All right. You've got and you've gotten that coupon right. So like you get so like you might in normal times just be happy with the coupon. You're getting coupon. Plus I mean it worked out. The fed went zero interest rates for so long. So utilities are the place to be. That's just math. And then as soon as the fed starts jacking up rates, **ChatGPT** comes on the scene and all of a sudden there's data centers. So now all of a sudden you're taking the leg up on growth when you don't need to be so interest rate sensitive.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Interesting.

</details>

### 数据中心容量的简单数学

**Tracey Alloway**: 所以我们想和你谈谈的原因之一是，你对数据中心的建设持逆向观点，我们已经在**Odd Lots**通讯中写过，大家都应该订阅。你的分析引起了广泛关注，有趣的是，它只是基于一些非常简单的数学。那么，首先，你能否向我们解释一下你实际进行的计算，以分析公用事业公司为数据中心提供电力所承担的容量是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: So one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you is because you have that contrarian take on the data center built out, and we wrote it up in the **Odd Lots** newsletter, which everyone should subscribe to. It got a lot of attention. Your analysis, interestingly, is just based on some pretty simple math. So why don't you, just to start out with, why don't you walk us through the calculations that you're actually making to try to analyze how much capacity the utilities are taking on to actually power data centers?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。正如你所说，这里的数学非常简单。数据中心现在消耗大约45吉瓦的电力。你可以在容量和吞吐量之间切换，我将坚持使用容量。好的，45吉瓦的电力。然后有很多第三方估计，关于它们到2030年将达到多少。这些估计集中在大约90到95吉瓦。所以你需要为2035年增加50吉瓦。2035年的估计少得多，大约是160吉瓦。现在这些估计，它们来自卖方银行、咨询公司，来自所有人。**Benioff**有一个，我认为是最好的之一。所以谢谢你，我们经常使用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. So, as you said, it's pretty simple math here. So utility. So data centers now are consuming around 45GW of power. And you can switch between capacity and throughput I'm going to stick with capacity okay. So 45GW of power. And then there's lots and lots of third party estimates for where they're going to be in 2030. And they are centered around this, you know, 90 95GW. So you need to add 50 for 2035. There's a lot fewer estimates. You come around 160. Now these estimates, they you know, they're all over the place they come from cell side banks. They come from consultants. They come from everyone. **Benioff** has one. They're I think one of the best out there. So thank you. We use them a lot.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以这是需求方面，你将如何得出这些数字。然后你看看供应方面，每个人都在谈论需求。哦，是的。但当你看看供应方面，所有这些科技兄弟都太酷了，不屑于真正研究供应并进行公用事业分析。对吧？谁想成为公用事业分析师？我们之前还在取笑我们。但如果你看看这个，你很适合。但当我们意识到这些都放错了位置，但我们并没有取笑，这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So so that's on the demand side. I'm where you're going to come out on these. And then you look at the supply and everyone talks about the demand right. Oh yeah. But then you look at the supply and all these tech bros are too cool to actually look at the supply and do utility analysis. Right. Who wants to be a utility. And I'll see. We're making fun of us before. But if you look at this you're fitting you. But when we realize are pretty well misplaced but we're not making fun anyway, this is great.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以你看看供应方面，这些公用事业公司正在追踪所有这些连接到电网的数据中心，因为它们需要做大量工作，在输电、配电、新变电站、变压器上花费大量资金。这是一项繁重的工作，但可以提升它们的盈利增长。所以它们乐于谈论这些。所以你看看它们目前的情况以及它们预见到的未来。它们有大约140吉瓦的近期供应。值得称赞的是，公用事业公司会区分已签订的、已承诺的合同和背后的潜在项目，因为存在很多重复计算。所以如果你要在东南部建造一个数据中心，你会告诉**Duke**、**Southern**、**Dominion**你将建造一个。所以那是潜在的项目。但只看已签订的承诺，无论它们怎么称呼，大约是140吉瓦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So you look at the supply and these utilities are tracking all these data centers, connecting to the grid because they've got to do a lot of work, spend a lot of money in transmission, distribution, new substations, transformers. It's a lot of work but a boost their earnings growth. So they're happy to talk about this. And so you look at where they're at and where they're they see things coming. And they've got around 140GW of near-term supply. Now kudos to the utilities. They break out with firm committed signed contracted versus pipeline behind it because there's a lot of double, triple quadruple counting. So if you're going to build a data center in the southeast, you're going to tell **Duke**, you're going to sell **Southern**, you're going to sell **Dominion**, you're going to build one. So that's the pipeline potential. But looking just at the firm committed whatever they want to call it, around 140GW.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 现在你需要调整这个数字。当你连接两个数据集时，**PUE**。是的，当你将数据中心连接到电网时，你有照明，有冷却。我给你的那些第三方估计只是针对原始计算能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Now that's you got to adjust that. So when you connect two data sets peewee. Yes. When you connect a data center to the grid, you've got lights, you've got cooling. Those third party estimates I gave you are just for raw compute.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 你为什么要分开呢？我的意思是，所有数据中心都需要冷却，对吧？分开的意义何在？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Why did you split those out though? Because I mean, all data centers are going to need to be cooled down, right? What's the point of splitting it out?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 我没有分开。我只是向下调整，因为第三方估计只考虑计算能力。所以你连接到电网，你需要照明、冷却和所有其他东西。是的。所以我想与第三方进行同类比较。那么**PUE**代表什么？电力使用效率。很棒的电力使用效率。继续。所以他们有140吉瓦。所以同类比较后，这个电力需求下降到110吉瓦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: I'm not splitting up. I'm just adjusting it downward because a third party estimates are just compute. So you're connecting to the grid. You're going to ask the lights, the cooling and everything. Yeah. So I want to go apples to apples versus the third party. So what do we stand for. Power usage effectiveness. Great power usage efficiency. Keep go. So they're at 140. So that power is down to 110 on apples to apples.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以回顾一下，从现在到2030年，需求侧你只需要50吉瓦。而公用事业公司正在连接110吉瓦。所以公用事业公司已经在连接的容量，几乎相当于你到2035年所需的全部。所以再次强调，为了确保我们理解一致。第三方估计，数据中心目前是45吉瓦，将达到95吉瓦。这意味着需要增加50吉瓦。公用事业公司正在连接110吉瓦。它们没有给出具体时间，其中一些将在2030年之后。我想说的是，数据中心的供应量非常大。目前尚不清楚是否会有如此大的需求。所以这就是问题所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So just to go back you only need 50 on the demand side between now and 2030. And the utilities are working at connecting 110. So the utilities are working on already connecting almost as much as you need by 2035. So again, just to make sure are on the same page. Third party estimates 45GW for data centers now going to 95. That's 50 utilities are working on 110. They don't give timing for that. Some of it's going to be past 2030. What I'm trying to say is there is a lot of supply of data centers coming. And it's very unclear if there's going to be demand for this. So that's that's the issue there.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 然后，暂停一下，谈谈我们如何追踪这些事情可能是有价值的。是的。所以我们在需求侧使用最初的**AI**代理，也就是**Gmail**提醒。哦，它太棒了。所以任何不在我们交易弹出窗口、不在**Bloomberg News**上的东西，我们都会通过**Gmail**提醒收到。然后我们把所有这些都整理到电子表格中。这是需求侧。然后在供应侧，我们使用**Diego**。那不是一个大型语言模型。那是我的初级分析师，现在坐在我们西边几个街区。他追踪所有这些以及公用事业公司的电话会议。就在昨天，**NextEra**又将2吉瓦从潜在项目转为已承诺项目。这些公用事业公司都迫不及待地想签署更多的这些交易。我认为这将是供过于求。我们将过度建设这些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: And then it might be worth pausing that and just saying how we're tracking these things. Yeah. So what we do for the demand side is we use the original **AI** agent, you know, that is a **Gmail** alert. Oh it's the best. So we anything that's not on our trade pops, not on **Bloomberg News**, we got picked up by a **Gmail** alert. And so then we get all that in a spreadsheet. So that's on the demand side. And then on the supply side we use **Diego**. And that's not a large language model. That's my junior sitting several blocks west of us right now. So he tracks all this and utility calls. Just yesterday **NextEra** moved another two gigawatts from the potential into the committed. And these utilities are chomping at the bit to sign more and more of these deals. And I think it's just going to be oversupply. We're going to overbuild these things.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 明确一下，这些“坚定承诺”是指实际建设这些容量的已签署协议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Just to be clear, the firm commitments, those are signed agreements to actually build this capacity.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yes. Okay.

</details>

### 市场信号与远期曲线

**Andy DeVries**: 我和**Oncor**的首席财务官谈过，他们也在电话会议上发表了这些评论。他们公司归**Sempra**所有。我说，没有人真正相信这些数据和估计。**德克萨斯州**是一个封闭的市场，你们都知道，一个87吉瓦的峰值市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: And so I was talking with the CFO of **Oncor** and they made these comments on their call as well. They're owned by **Sempra**. And I said, you know, no one really believes these data and estimates **Texas** is a walled off market, as you guys know, 87 gigawatt peak market.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我对**德克萨斯州**唯一了解的就是它是一个封闭的市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That is the one thing I know about **Texas** is its own walled off market.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 没错。所以这是一个87吉瓦的峰值市场。需求估计是到2030年将增加30吉瓦。我告诉**Oncor**的首席财务官，这根本不可能。他说，可能不是30吉瓦，但会更接近30吉瓦而不是零。我说，远期电力曲线根本没有反映出这一点。他说，那它们就是定价错误了。所以对于整个市场，为了你们用户的利益，你们不能在**Interactive Brokers**上交易**德克萨斯州**的远期电力。我知道这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: There you go. So 87 gigawatt peak market. And the demand estimates are they're going to add 30GW by 2030. And I said to the CFO of **Oncor** said there's just no way. He said it might not be 30, but it's going to be closer to 30 than it is zero. And I said, I just the four power curves don't reflect that at all. And he said, then they're mispriced. So just for the entire market, just for the benefit of your users, you cannot trade forward power in **Texas** on **Interactive Brokers** I know that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，那观众可不高兴了。太糟糕了。每个人都想去查。不，但这很棒。这给了我们很多技术问题可以深入探讨。我们继续谈谈**德克萨斯州**。向我们解释一下远期电力曲线是什么，以及你如何根据这些远期电力曲线推断出交易员对未来需求量的隐含假设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, that's a bad audience. It's too bad. Everyone's like, look it up then. No, but this is great. And this gives us a bunch of, technical questions to get into some already. Let's just keep talking about **Texas**. Explain to us kind of what the forward power curves are and how you can back out the implicit, assumptions that traders or are making based on those forward power curves about how much demand there's going to be sure.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。我的意思是，显然你会从87吉瓦增加到15或30吉瓦，无论多少，你都会预期曲线会走高。但曲线衡量的是什么？好的。你说有远期电力。所以远期电力曲线是全天候的峰值或非峰值。有三条独立的曲线。峰值和非峰值之间的差异实际上已经缩小了，因为数据中心是24/7运行的。所以这取决于你在**德克萨斯州**北部还是南部。这些都在50多美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. So, I mean, obviously you're going to go from 87 to you're good at 15 or 30, whatever it is you'd expect that curve to go higher. But what's the curve measuring tool okay. You say there's a forward power. So the forward power curve is around the clock peak or off peak. There's three separate curves. And the difference between peak and off peak is actually you know yeah narrowed because data centers run 24 seven. So it depends on your north **Texas** or south **Texas**. And those are in the high 50s.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但我们在2030年的曲线中会看到什么？比如，2030年是否有交易发生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But what would we be seeing in the curves for like 20. Like are there or is there trading happening at the 2030.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 2030年可能流动性不那么好，但2027年和2028年肯定有。但还有其他能源市场。所以如果你看看天然气，尽管天然气交易员对天然气期货曲线非常奇怪，我不太理解。但如果你看看它，你会发现长期来看它是向下倾斜的，这表明需求不会那么多，或者未来供应会更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: 10 or 30 might not be so liquid, but 27 and 28 certainly are there. But there's an other energy market. So if you look at nat gas, for instance, although gas traders are really weird about the futures curve in gas, which I don't really understand. But if you look at that, you point out that over the longer term it's downward sloping, which suggests that there isn't going to be as much demand, or maybe there's going to be more supply out in the future.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 我喜欢。我们正在转向天然气，因为那是电价的主要驱动因素，尤其是在**德克萨斯州**。天然气的远期曲线比电力的流动性好得多，而且天然气的远期曲线是倒挂的。到十年末，它从3.70美元降到3.60美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: I love it. We're morphing into natural gas because that is the main driver of power prices, especially in **Texas**. And the forward curve for gas is much more liquid than it is for power, and the forward curve for gas is inverted. It goes from 370 to 360 by the end of the decade.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以正如我的能源分析师**Charles Johnson**所指出的，更大的驱动因素不是数据中心的需求。我们目前每天消耗60亿立方英尺。很多人都是，但10到120亿立方英尺，我们可以深入探讨。但液化天然气（**LNG**）出口我们每天出口180亿立方英尺。现在我们将再增加120亿立方英尺。你可能会认为这条曲线至少会上涨0.25美元到0.30美元。顺便说一句，你可以在你的**Interactive Brokers**账户中交易。所以这涉及到是否会有**LNG**过剩的问题。这超出了我的专业范围。但这就是问题所在。但我们上周在**纽约市**各地出差时，听到了很多客户的反馈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So as my energy analyst **Charles Johnson** points out, the bigger driver there isn't data center demand. We're at six BCF a day. There a lot of people are, but 1012, we can get into that. But **LNG** exports were exporting 18 BCF a day. Now we're going to add another 12. Like you'd think that curve would be at least upward sloping by $0.25. $0.30, by the way, you can trade that in your **Interactive Brokers** account. So that goes into is there going to be a glut of **LNG**? It starts getting outside of my expertise. But that's but we heard from a lot of clients last week when we went on the road all over **New York City**.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这非常有趣。我实际上想问另一个关于纯电力曲线的问题。但既然我们谈到了**LNG**，然后我们可以回到电力曲线，抛开数据中心等不谈。直观上，你会认为**美国**的增长业务是什么？**LNG**出口。事实上，围绕建设**LNG**接收站的整个政策辩论之一是，它将使**美国**消费者的天然气价格更高，因为我们现在将与欧洲买家竞争。而当我们没有**LNG**出口终端时，我们只是沉浸在其中，因为它无处可去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This is very interesting. I actually want to ask another question about the pure power curve. But since we are on **LNG** and then we can get back to the power curve, just setting aside data centers, etc. intuitively, you would think that what is a growth business in the **United States**? **LNG** exports, and in fact, one of the sort of policy debates around the whole question of building out **LNG** terminals is it's going to make gas more expensive for American consumers because now we're going to be competing with European buyers. Whereas when we didn't have **LNG** export terminals, we were just swimming in it because it had nowhere to go, nowhere to go.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 无处可去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Nowhere to go.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 所以听到即使每个人都承认国内需求蓬勃发展，以及国际需求的预期扩张，他们的天然气曲线仍在向下倾斜，这非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So it's very interesting to hear that even with everyone acknowledging a booming domestic demand and b the expected expansion of international demand, their downward sloping gas curve.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的，也许，我不知道，也许这反映了欧洲和**俄罗斯**的世界和平。**LNG**对世界其他地方来说是不可接受的。这可能是一个驱动因素。那他们就必须重建那条管道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yes, maybe, I don't know, maybe the reflecting world peace in Europe and Russia. **LNG** is unacceptable to the rest of the world. That could be a driver. Then they would have to rebuild that pipeline.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的，但回到我们最初关于需求的话题。我之所以和**Oncor**的首席财务官谈论这个问题，是因为他说他持有25亿美元的现金抵押品，来自其中一些需求。他说，你不是什么无名小卒的初创公司，如果你要投入25亿美元，我就会建造一个数据中心连接到你的电网。他说，这在他们的财报电话会议上也提到了，这确实是即将到来的真实需求。这确实很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yeah, but but back to our original conversation on demand. The reason I was talking to the **Oncor** CFO and asking him about this is he said he's holding $2.5 billion of cash collateral postings from some of that demand. And he's like, you're not some, you know, Joe Schmo startup. I'm going to build a data center to connect to your grid if you're posting $2.5 billion. And he says, and this is what he said in their earnings call as well, you know, that's real demand that is coming. It's it's material, I'm sure just now.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 现在回到电力曲线，我知道它的流动性要差得多。但确实有交易发生。这些是价格。你如何从价格推断出交易量？因为这些是价格，我们得不到交易量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: To go back to the power curve, which I get is much less liquid out there. But there are trades that happen. These are price like how do you infer volume from price. Because these are prices. We don't get the volume.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 但它是一条年度曲线。然后，在年初，它会分成12个月的曲线，然后变成每周曲线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: But it's a it's a yearly curve. And then right for the year starts it splits in the 12 month curves and then it goes into weekly.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但我的意思是，你如何从价格曲线推断出2028年的预期交易量？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But what I'm saying is how do you infer what expected volume in 2028 is going from a price curve?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。它是平的。从现在到2030年，它只上涨一美元。然而，如果你要增加20%的良好需求，你就会预期它会上涨几美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. It's it's flat. It goes up a dollar from here to 2030. Whereas if you're going to add 20% to your good demand than you'd expect it to go up, okay. Several dollars.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，我明白了。我希望看到0.40美元，0.50美元。我明白你的意思了。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right I see side I'd want to see $0.40, $0.50 I see what you're saying okay with that.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 然后回到**德克萨斯州**的远期价格，峰值时段是50多美元，低谷时段是60多美元。而数据中心公司支付95美元。所以**Vistra**以每兆瓦时95美元的价格签订了一份全天候交易。所以**Vistra**在**德克萨斯州**的**Comanche Peak**电厂以每兆瓦时95美元的价格签订了合同。所以大型科技公司支付了非常可观的费用。你可以说其中一部分是为了无二氧化碳的方面，一部分只是为了锁定供应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: And then just to go back to the fork in your upper 50s in **Texas**, low 60s for peak. And the data center companies are paying 95. So **Vistra** to sit a deal off $95 a megawatt hour okay. For round the clock. So **Vistra** contracted at its **Comanche Peak** plant in **Texas** $95 a megawatt hour. So Big Tech is paying a very pretty penny. You can argue some of that for the **CO2** free aspect of it, and some of it's just to lock in the supply.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 所以回到数学和你的整体论点，你的意思是公用事业公司已经承诺建设的容量，我猜是到2030年所需容量的两倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: So just to go back to the math and your overall argument, I mean, you're basically saying that utilities are already committed to building out, I guess, twice as much capacity as is forecast to be needed by 2030.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yes.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 对我来说，最大的不确定性似乎是需求预测。对吧？我们已经看到这些预测变化非常剧烈。我知道你提到了**Bloomberg NEF**，但他们已经提高了预测，因为数据中心的建设。所以他们提高了实际所需能源的预测。你对这些需求数据有多大信心？它们会如何随时间变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: The wild card to me seems to be the demand forecasts. Right. And we're already seeing those change pretty wildly. I know you mentioned **Bloomberg NEF**, but you know, they they've raised their forecast, because of the data center buildout. So they've raised their forecast of how much energy is actually needed. How much confidence do you have in those demand numbers, and how could they change over time.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 中等信心。但你看，我们现在，**OpenAI**用2吉瓦的电力建造了所有的**ChatGPT**。所有大型科技超大规模公司都还没有给出他们2025年的数据。但如果你拿他们2024年的数据然后翻倍，这是产出。所以我要把它转换回容量。你假设60%的容量系数。所有超大规模公司加起来大约15吉瓦。这必须超过数据中心需求的一半。所以谈论95吉瓦，我的意思是这是一个惊人的数字。然后你会有更多的进步，**英伟达**芯片的效率。是的，显然**杰文斯悖论（Jevons Paradox）**会起作用。你有很多嘉宾都谈过这个。这只是大量的电力，大量的电力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Moderate confidence. But like, look, we're right now like **OpenAI** built all the **ChatGPT** using two gigawatts, all the big tech hyperscalers, they haven't given their 2025 volumes yet. But if you take their 2024 volumes and then double it, and this is output. So I'm going to transfer it back to capacity. And you assume a 60% capacity factor. All the hyperscalers combine around 15GW. And that's got to be over half the data center demand. So to talk about 95GW I mean it's a staggering number. And then you get more advances and you know **Nvidia** chip efficiency. Yeah obviously **Jevons Paradox** kicks in. You've had numerous guests talk about that. It's just a lot of power a lot of power.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你能提醒我们一下，1吉瓦能为多少家庭供电吗？我喜欢这种比较。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Can you just remind us one gigawatt is enough to power what I like these comparison million homes.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 100万户家庭。但这取决于你是在**佛罗里达州**还是东北部。但一般来说，就是这个数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Million homes. But it depends if you're in Florida or the northeast. But generally speaking, that's where you're at.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我不仅觉得电力市场，以及电力市场结构，非常难以理解。即使经过所有这些对话，我也没有建立起任何启发式方法或直觉来理解这些吉瓦、千瓦、兆瓦是什么意思。你说这些词，我知道吉瓦比千瓦大，但它到底意味着什么？而且即使在那里，我们还在谈论吉瓦和吉瓦时之间的区别。我还没有形成那种直觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Not only do I find electricity market so in market structure and electricity, very difficult to wrap my head around. Even after all of these conversations, I have built no heuristics or intuition for what these are gigawatt kilowatt, megawatt like you say these things and I know gigawatts bigger than a kilowatt, but like what is actually me here? And then the fact that even there we're talking about the difference between a gigawatt and a gigawatt hour. And like, I've yet to develop the sort of intuitions that I have haven't seen.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 回到未来。是的，1.21吉瓦。哦，你看。我们打印出来，就像我们金融危机时信用评级那样，小小的一张。我们需要把它放在那里。实际上，从公用事业的角度来看，信用评级也会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Back to the future. Yeah. 1.1GW. Oh, there you go. We got a print out, you know, a little teeny tiny that like the way we used to do for credit ratings in the financial crisis. We need that up there. And actually credit ratings are going to be interesting from a utilities perspective as well.

</details>

### 数据中心建设的成本与消费者影响

**Tracey Alloway**: 我可以问一下吗？显然，关于数据中心和公用事业的一切，其中一个敏感点是这种观点。我认为这有点夸大其词。他们会说：“哦，普通纳税人最终会为大量数据中心买单吗？或者我们会提高电费吗？”我理解这些是复杂的问题，数学并不那么清晰。而且，据我所知，数据中心的出现实际上可以降低消费者的电费，因为有一个简单的数学道理：如果有更多的买家分摊建设成本，那么你的价格标签实际上可以下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Can I just ask, you know, obviously one of the sensitivities in general, with all things data center and utilities is this view. And I think it's kind of overstated. They're like, oh, or other, is the average ratepayer going to end up paying for a lot of, data centers or we'll raise our electricity bill. And I understand, like, these are complex questions and the math isn't so clear. And also, from what I understand, the emergence of a data center can actually lower the consumer's electricity bill, because there's just that simple math, which is if there's more buyers splitting the cost of the buildout, then actually your, price tag can go down.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 但在你描述的场景中，存在大量前期资本投资，每个人都非常兴奋地进行建设，并且需要购买变压器和设备等所有这些东西。如果需求未能如预期般实现，那听起来就像是消费者电价可能上涨的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: But in the scenario you're laying out in which there's a bunch of upfront capital investments and everyone's very excited to build it out, and that credit wires and you have to buy transformers and gear and all this stuff. If the demand is does not materialize as expected. That does sound like conditions in which we could see consumer rates go up.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 绝对是。所以这就是我们所有时间都在关注的问题。而且是州与州之间不同。即使在同一个州，也有很多不同的司法管辖区。所以它是立法强制的，还是通过费率案件完成的？或者在**印第安纳州**北部的情况下，数据中心公司自己是否已经提前行动，并表示我们将提供一个解决方案，让纳税人得到绝对保护并获得资金返还？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Absolutely. So that's what we're spending all our time on. And it's state by state. And even within the same state, you've got numerous jurisdictions. So is it legislatively mandated or is it done by a rate case or in the case of northern **Indiana**, have the companies themselves data center companies themselves gotten ahead of it and said, we're going to put in a solution where ratepayers are absolutely protected and get money back.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以你看看**NiSource**，这家中西部公用事业公司，他们拥有**Northern Indiana Public Service (Nipsco)**。他们有一个协议，其中有一个内部费率基础，他们有一个独立的发电公司（**Genco**），所以他们出售。这个**Genco**正在与**亚马逊（Amazon）**进行一项交易，他们将在15年内向纳税人返还10亿美元。所以，与其争论谁在资助什么，不如直接解决。你每年能得到6700万美元。这就是蓝图，这就是黄金标准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So you look at **NiSource** with the Midwestern utility, they own **Northern Indiana public Service Nipsco**, and they've got a deal where they've got an inside rate base, they've got a separate **Genco**, so they sell. And that **Genco** is doing a deal with **Amazon**, and they're going to kick back $1 billion over 15 years to ratepayers. So rather than have a debate oh is who's funding what. It's like done. And you get $67 million a year. And that's the blueprint. That's the gold standard.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 是的。请记住，在那个**Genco**成立六个月前，**NiSource**将**Nipsco**的20%出售给了**Blackstone**。所以你可以说**Blackstone**说：“嘿，我们来做这个吧。”然后**印第安纳州**北部或东北部的公用事业公司是**俄亥俄州**的**First Energy**。**First Energy**的首席执行官是前**Blackstone**的人。所以也许他们会考虑做**Genco**之类的。这纯粹是猜测，我不知道。**PAC Gas**，**Pacific Gas Electric**。他们已经达成了一项协议，制定了保护现有纳税人的费率。**Amarin**也有，但很多公用事业公司没有。他们没有这些保护措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Yeah. I keep in mind six months before that, **Genco** was launched, nice or sold 20% of **Nipsco** two **Blackstone**. So you could argue **Blackstone** said, hey, let's go ahead and do this. And then the utility right north of **Indiana** or northeast **Indiana** is **Ohio**. And the CEO of **First Energy** is an ex **Blackstone** guy. So maybe they look at doing a **Genco** or something like that. That's pure speculation I have no idea. **PAC Gas**, **Pacific Gas Electric**. They've done a deal where they've got rates in place that protect President ratepayers. **Amarin** has but a lot of utilities don't. They don't have these protection.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 关键是，如果最终出现过度建设，并且需求不如预期，总会有人为此买单。要么是消费者，要么可能是公用事业公司的股东。我的意思是，让普通民众为**马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）**、**杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）**买单的政治风险，这根本不可能发生。但再说一次，六个月前这还在电话会议的末尾提及。现在这些公用事业公司的首席执行官们在他们的准备好的发言中都会提到。所以我非常有信心他们会解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: The point is, someone if it turns out that there's an overbuild and there is not as much demand for it, someone's paying for it. And it either is going to be the customers or perhaps utility shareholders. I mean, you just the political risk of having mom and pop bail out. Yeah. You know, **Mark Zuckerberg**, **Jeff Bezos**, it's just you can't have that happen. But again, six months ago this was coming up on the tail end of conference calls. And now these utility CEOs are having in their prepared remarks. So I'm pretty confident they're going to figure it out.

</details>

### 建设延误与通胀成本

**Tracey Alloway**: 你刚才提到了**Blackstone**。我想谈谈目前谁从数据中心建设中赚了很多钱，但为了进一步检验这个论点，因为它是一个逆向观点，所以我想我们应该问很多问题。它是否考虑了项目的时间滞后？我认为，能源行业的产能建设以官僚主义著称。这是**Joe**和我确实了解这个行业的一点。是否有可能这些已承诺的项目实际上需要比目前预测更长的时间才能在实地投入运营？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: You mentioned **Blackstone** just then. I do want to talk about who is currently making a lot of money from the data center buildout, but just to stress test the thesis a little bit more because it is a contrarian take. And so I think we should ask a bunch of questions about it. But does it take into account time lags for projects. So I think, you know, capacity build out in the energy sector is notoriously bureaucratic. That is one thing that **Joe** and I do actually know about the sector. Is it possible that a lot of these committed projects actually take much longer to get working on the ground than currently forecast?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 我认为延误将出现在建设新一代发电厂上，而不是数据中心。数据中心需要两到三年，即使延长到四到五年。发电厂需要六到七年。而且你知道，你几年内都买不到**GE Ivanova**燃气轮机，这显然是一个看涨的背景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: I think the delays will be on building the new generation, not the data centers. So data center takes 2 or 3 years, even if that slips to 4 or 5 years. The power plants take 6 or 7 years. And as you know, you can't get a **GE Ivanova** gas turbine for years and years, which is obviously a bullish backdrop here.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 再跟我们多谈谈这方面。因为如果你生产过剩，那本身就是个问题。如果你在生产过剩的同时，因为大规模通货膨胀和生产建设行业，成本变得非常高昂，那问题就更大了。跟我们谈谈，公用事业方面，每单位生产能力的成本增加了多少，你对此有何预测？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Talk to us more about that element of it all because building out if you overshoot on production then that's a problem in itself. If you overshoot on production at a time when it's gotten really expensive because there's massive inflation and the, the production, construction sector, that's an even greater problem. Talk to us just about like, per any given unit of productive capacity on the utility side, how much more expensive is it gotten and what are you forecasting for that?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。十年前建造一个联合循环燃气电厂需要1000到1200美元/千瓦。后来涨到2000美元。然后像我这样的公用事业分析师会说：“哇，这太疯狂了。”现在我们涨到了3000美元。然后大家会问：“谁会花这么多钱？”但对于一个新的燃气电厂来说，每年3000美元的成本与数据中心本身的40000美元成本相比，简直不值一提。

<details>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. So it's a build a combined cycle gas plant ten years ago is 1000 1200 a kW to build. Then it got to 2000. Then utility analyst like myself was like, whoa, that's insane. Now we're up to 3000. Then it's like, who? Who's actually spending this? But that $3,000 a year for a new gas plant compares to the data center itself. The cost $40,000.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, yes.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 微不足道。这又回到了电力的产出是55到60美元，而大型科技公司支付95美元。从大局来看，数据中心的成本微不足道。所以这就是为什么公用事业公司会感到震惊，大型科技公司竟然愿意支付这些金额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: De minimis, which goes back to the output for power is 5560 and big tax paying 95 in the grand scheme of things. So the cost of data center is nothing. So that's why the utility and I'll, I'll just jaw dropping on how shocking it is. Big Tech's willing to pay these amounts.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 如果你不以美元来衡量新电厂的生产，而是以时间来衡量呢？再说一次，如果你在谈论。好吧，如果我们拿不到这个涡轮机，而几年前我们下个月就能拿到，那么这些项目需要多长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: What about if you don't measure, production of new plants in dollars, but new plants in time and again, if you're talking about. Okay, well, if we can't get this turbine and that is several years ago, we could have got delivered next month, how much longer are these projects taking?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以如果你能弄清楚这一点，我想你是在暗示这个。如果你弄清楚这一点，你就能赚大钱。好的。因为显然**《通胀削减法案》（Inflation Reduction Act）**对可再生能源有巨大的税收抵免。是的。然后那个宏伟的法案显然会削减那些，如果你没有在某个日期前对齐。所以所有这些数据都集中在十年末。而新的太阳能现在就在这里，正在压低电价。所以你实际上会希望在未来几年做空电力，然后转为做多。如果你能找出这个转变点，你就能在远期电力曲线或天然气曲线中赚大钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So if you can figure this out, I think you're alluding this. If you figure this out, you can make a lot of money. Okay. Because obviously **Inflation Reduction Act** had enormous I'm going to vibe code a thing to figure it out. Keep going and **inflation reduction act** enormous tax credits for renewables. Yeah. And then the one big beautiful bill obviously clip those if you're not aligned by a certain date. So all this data set of numbers are weighted towards the end of the decade. Whereas the new solar is right here right now crushing power prices. So you actually want to be a little short power for the next few years and then flip to being long. And if you can figure out when that flip is, you can make a lot of money, neither the forward power curves or the natural gas curves.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 但就你最初的问题而言，我前面说过，数据中心需要两到三年建造，新的发电厂需要四到五年。但实际上，你并不需要像大家所说的那么多新发电厂。**Constellation**的首席执行官前几天在电话会议上说，他以**德克萨斯州**市场为例。他说这是一个87吉瓦的峰值市场。你明天就可以给**德克萨斯州**增加10吉瓦的电力，这相当于将**英伟达**一整年的所有芯片都送到**德克萨斯州**，并让它们24/7运行。那就是10吉瓦。他说，你现在就可以运行它。现有的电网、现有的发电厂，除了每年40到50小时外，都能满足需求。我们进行了压力测试。有些燃煤电厂可以提高容量系数。有很多燃气电厂可以做到，所以我不知道是40小时、100小时还是140小时，但与其让公用事业公司花费100亿美元连接遥远的风力发电场，不如每年支付给其他化工或炼油公司，让它们停运40到50小时，这更合理。这就是论点。我们有点处于中间立场，但电网上有充足的现有容量可以提升以满足需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: But as far as your original question, as I said, data centers 2 or 3 years to build new power plants, 4 or 5. But then you don't need as many new power plants as everyone's saying. So **Constellation** CEO said on a call the other day. He said he use the **Texas** market. He said 87 gigawatt peak market. You could add ten gigawatts to **Texas** tomorrow, which would be the equivalent of sending every single **Nvidia** chip for an entire year to **Texas** and running them 24 over seven. That's ten gigawatts. He was. You could run it right now, existing grid, existing plants for all but 40 50 hours a year. We stress tested it. There are some coal plants that could ramp up capacity factor. There's plenty of gas plants I can so I don't know if it's 40 hours, 100 hours, 140 hours, but it makes more sense to pay someone else not to run their chemical company, the refinery company, for 40 50 hours a year, rather than have the utilities go out and spend $10 billion connecting faraway wind farms. That's the argument. We're sort of come in the middle of it, but there is plenty of existing capacity on the grid that could ramp up to meet it.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 然后还有其他天然气，他指出，电网的峰值需求是850吉瓦。电网的总规模是1200太瓦，然后是吉瓦，然后你每年增加50吉瓦的太阳能，然后你将开始增加20吉瓦的天然气。我的意思是，我们会处理好的。我真的不担心任何利益或其他事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: And then of others gas to point it out. And Abbott's, you know, the peak demand of the grid is 850GW. The overall size of the grid is are 1200, terawatts, and then it gigawatts, and then you're adding 50GW a year or solar, and then you're going to start adding 20GW of gas. I mean, we're going to handle it. I'm not really worried about any interests or anything.

### 区域输电与AI竞赛

**Joe Weisenthal**: 哦，是的。跟我们谈谈区域输电，因为这是我们经常听到的。这里的问题不一定是发电，而是输电，**美国**在这方面似乎有些力不从心，说得委婉一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Oh, yeah. Talk to us about regional transmission because this is something that we hear a lot. It's not necessarily the power generation that's an issue here. It's the transmission which the US you know, seems to struggle with, to put it mildly.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以有区域市场。我自己，中西部地区，**Midcontinent ISO**，这些人淘汰了最多的煤炭。所以我认为他们的情况会最糟糕。然后是**德克萨斯州**，然后就看情况了。如果有人在**新英格兰**建造任何东西，**新英格兰**的电价更高，达到70美元。全国其他地区，你知道，我非常清楚。是的，我必须知道，因为我住在**康涅狄格州**。所以如果有人在**新英格兰**建造数据中心，他们将是最紧张的。但之后，主要是我自己。没有人会在**佛蒙特州**建造数据中心，那里偶尔需要切换到石油和木材发电。对吧？我的意思是，**新英格兰ISO**应用程序，我们手机上都有，对吧？他们40%的电力来自石油。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So there's regional markets myself. Midwest's the **Midcontinent ISO** these guys are tired the most amount of coal. So I think they're going to be in the worst shape. And then **Texas** and then it depends. If anyone builds anything in **New England**, **New England**'s got the faraway, more expensive power prices $70. The rest of the countries, you know, I am well aware. Yes, I have to because I live in **Connecticut**. So if anyone builds a data center in **New England**, they're going to be the tightest. But after that, it's really myself. No one's building data centers in **Vermont** where they occasionally have to switch over to oil and wood. Right? I mean, they **iso New England** app, which we all have on our phone, right? They were getting 40% of their power from, oil.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，是的，前几天天气骤冷，但现在谈论**新英格兰**的电力离不开政治。我们不会深入讨论那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, yeah, the cold snapped the other day, but now it's tough to talk about **New England** power without talking politics. And we're not going to go down that.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以，输电非常重要，因为你必须将所有这些遥远的可再生能源连接到电网。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So, so transmission is very important because you've got to connect all these far away renewables to the grid.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 你说了一些我认为实际上很重要的事。或者说，这个叙事迷因，人们谈论**美国**与**中国**的**AI**竞赛，我看到有人说**中国**会赢，因为他们可以比我们更容易地建设电力。听起来，我知道你不是**AI**分析师，但从你的角度来看，我们不知道这意味着什么，或者谁会赢得**美国**与**中国**的竞赛。但从你的角度来看，电力不会是这里的决定因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: You said something that I think is actually kind of important. Or is this, narrative meme, you know, people talk about the **I** race **U.S.** versus **China** and that one of the things I've seen people say **China** is going to win because they could just build out power more easily than we can. It sounds like, I know you're not an **AI** analyst, but it sounds like from your perspective, we don't know, like what it means or who's going to win **U.S.** versus **China**. But then from your perspective, power is not going to be the decider here.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 在**中国**不是。但它确实如此。你说过，我们可以在现有容量下运送所有东西。我们今天可以将所有**英伟达**芯片运到**德克萨斯州**，除了夏天少数几个非常热的时段，我们可以让它们运行50小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Not in **China**. It's not. But it does it. You said like you know, that we could ship every current with existing capacity. We could put every **Nvidia** chip in **Texas** today and we could run them for 50 hours for with the exception of a few really hot hours in the summer, I,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我喜欢所有**英伟达**芯片去**德克萨斯州**实地考察的画面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I like the imagery of all the **Nvidia** chips going on a field trip to **Texas**, to **Texas**.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 但从你的观点来看，这在美国的角度来看，真的不会是决定性限制因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: But it sounds like to your view, that really isn't going to be from the **U.S.** perspective, that won't be the binding constraint.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 会有点紧张，但我不是那些末日论者。哦，这绝对是限制因素。一切都会停止。我去年在**中国深圳**，一个机器人上了一层楼，电梯上去了，然后它又下了另一层楼。我当时想，这是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: It's it's going to be a little tight, but I'm not one of these doomsayers. Oh, it's the absolute gating factor. It's all going to stop. I was in **Shenzhen**, **China**, last year, and a robot got on the one floor and the elevator went up and they got off another one. And I was like, what is going on here?

</details>

### 私募信贷与数据中心融资风险

**Tracey Alloway**: 我们想和你谈谈的另一个原因，除了你的容量分析之外，是信贷市场发生的一些有趣的事情。显然，私募信贷在过去几年里一直是一个大新闻，但现在私募信贷也开始涉足数据中心建设。这有点像，我猜，侵入了你在公共债券市场的地盘。但你看到了什么样的活动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: There's another reason we wanted to talk to you, aside from your capacity analysis, which is one of the interesting things that's been happening in the credit market is obviously private credit has been a big story for the past few years, but now private credit is getting in on the data center buildout as well. There's sort of, I guess, getting on your turf a little bit in the public bond market. But what sort of activity have you seen there?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。所以我们认为风险将发生在那里。坦率地说，**Bloomberg News**报道了**Pimco**的故事，他们在第一天就通过向**路易斯安那州**的**Meta**数据中心贷款赚了20亿美元。所以他们以比国债高220个基点的价格发行了250亿美元的债务。它立即开始以140个基点交易，并为**Pimco**带来了20亿美元。对**Pimco**来说很棒，但其他人呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. So we think that's where the risk is going to is going to happen. And frankly, **Bloomberg News** broke the story on **Pimco**, made $2 billion on day one, loaning to the **Meta** data center in **Louisiana**. So they price $25 billion of that debt at 220 over treasuries. And it immediately started trading at 140 and handed **Pimco** 2 billion. Great for **Pimco**, but then everyone else.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 成为**Pimco**真好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Nice to be **Pimco**.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 成为**Pimco**是不是很好，尤其是在**纽波特海滩**的天气下。但私募信贷领域的其他人都在想：“哦，这些人刚赚了20亿美元。我们需要开始向数据中心放贷了。”我们都知道这会如何结束。契约开始放松，利率开始下降。再说一次，如果你是大型科技公司，如果你过度支出，你认为**AI**是万能的，你就会过度支出。当你进入第二梯队时，关键是像**Vantage**这样的公司。然后你再往下看，就会看到像**CoreWeave**和**Bias**这样的公司。而且，有很多针对**Equinox**的做空。显然，**Jim Chanos**也参与其中，一切都围绕着芯片。我不想深入芯片的辩论，但这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Isn't that nice to be **Pimco**, especially the weather in **Newport Beach**, but everyone else in private credit is like, oh, these guys just make $2 billion. We need to start lending to data centers. And we all know how this ends. Covenants start falling, rates start falling. And again, if you're big tech, who cares if you overspend like you think **AI**'s the be all end all. You're going to overspend when you get down to the second tier. The key is the **Vantage**s of the world. And then you get down to sort of the ones below that and you get like, you know, the **CoreWeave**s and the **Bias**es of the world. And, you know, there's a lot of shorts going out on **Equinox**. And obviously you're getting **Jim Chanos** and it's all about the chips. I'm not going to get into the chip debate, but it's interesting.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 你看看**CoreWeave**，他们有500亿美元的市值。那是一家真正的公司。他们会存在很长时间。但债券市场说，我们希望以10%的收益率借给你2030年的票据，你可能不是一家真正的公司。如果你看看我们的供需展望，我们有点站在债券市场这边。但时机，你之前提到的**Joe**，非常关键，因为这些数据中心，你会在几年内加速发展，而供过于求真正是2030年的事件。所以祝你好运，把握好时机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: You look at a **CoreWeave** and they got a $50 billion market cap. That's a real company. You're going to be around for a long time. But the bond market saying we want a 10% yield to lend you 2030 paper, you might not be a real company. And if you look at our supply demand outlooks, we're kind of in the camp of the bond market. But timing, which you mentioned earlier, Joe, is so key because this data centers, you're going to ramp for a couple of years, and the oversupply is really a 2030 event. So good luck timing that one.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你提到了**Pimco**和**Meta**的交易，这个问题也出现了。我仍然认为没有一个完全令人满意的答案。**Meta**是一家评级很高的公司，从你作为信贷分析师的角度来看。私募信贷有什么特别之处？他们会说：“哦，它很灵活，等等。”但比国债高220个基点的利差可不是小数目。那么，这220个基点的利差真的值得吗，为了多一点灵活性等等？他们到底在私募信贷市场支付什么，而这些在公共债券市场无法以更便宜的价格获得？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You said something you talked about that **Pimco** met a deal and this question has come up. And I still don't think it's got a totally satisfactory answer to it. **Matt**, is a, you know, very highly rated company from here, as you see it, as a credit analyst. What is it about the private credit? You know, they'll talk about, oh, it's flexible, etc., but you 220 spread over treasuries is not nothing at all. And is that is their 220 spread really like worth it for like a little bit more flexibility etc.. Like what are they paying for exactly where in the private credit market that they couldn't get cheaper?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 我不知道，但我可以猜测。有几个原因。如果问题是，你为什么要把它放在资产负债表外？是的。好的。所以你拥有最先进的数据中心，拥有最好的**英伟达**芯片。你是一家科技公司，**AI**是万能的。你把它从资产负债表上剔除，是因为你不想损害你的资产负债表吗？但评级机构会将其归入。但也许量化基金在运行他们的筛选时不会将其归入。所以这可能有所帮助。或者你可能不想让折旧通过你的损益表。也许这有所帮助。或者你可能想在五年后摆脱这个东西。我不知道，但其中一个肯定就是原因。因为否则你为什么要支付比他们借款成本高出150个基点这么大的利差呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: I would think in the public bond market, I don't know, but I could speculate. There's a couple. If the question is why did you put this off balance sheet? Yeah. All right. So you've got the state of the art data center with the best **Nvidia** chips out there. And you're a tech company and **AI** is the be all end all for everything. Did you kick it off your balance sheet because you didn't want to damage your balance sheet. But the agencies are imputing it. But maybe quant funds running their screens, they don't impute that. So maybe that helps. Or maybe you didn't want the depreciation running through your income statement. Maybe that helps. Or maybe you want to walk from this thing in five years. I don't know, but one of those is definitely the reasons. Because why else would you pay that much bigger spread 150 bips over their borrowing costs.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 但这里的关键是，当你谈论**Pimco**和**Meta**的交易时，从技术上讲，这不是**Meta**的债务。它不是。好的。这不是对的。好的。所以他们创建了一个特殊目的载体。他们不会。好的。我认为这是一个重要因素，他们不是随意支付更多的钱，只是因为他们是表外交易。如果你阅读信贷文件，他们已经担保了这笔债务。是的。即使数据中心关闭。但我们对文件的理解是，如果他们出售它，那么担保就会消失。这会带来一点风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: But so the key thing is here, when you talk about that **Pimco**, a deal technically this is not **Meta** debt. It is not. It's okay. This is not right. Okay. So they create a vehicle. They're not going to okay. That's a I think that's an important element that they're not just arbitrarily paying a lot more for like a sort of though, that they're off balance. And if you read the credit docs, they've guaranteed this debt. Yeah. Even if the data center shuts down. But our understanding of the docs is if they sell it, then the guarantee goes away. And so that would create a little risk.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 但回到我的公用事业根源。如果数据中心关闭，对纳税人会发生什么？他们实际上有**Meta**的明确担保来保护纳税人。所以他们有这个，很多其他公用事业公司没有。所以很多州，**路易斯安那州**、**密西西比州**、**田纳西州**、**德克萨斯州**，他们需要更好地保护纳税人。顺便说一句，这只是文件中可能随时瓦解的一句话，以及其他新的数据中心。这就是我们花时间研究的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: But back to my utility roots please. What happens if data center shuts down for ratepayers. And they actually have an explicit guarantee from **Meta** to protect ratepayers. So they have that a lot of other utilities don't. So a lot of states **Louisiana**, **Mississippi**, **Tennessee**, **Texas**, they need to do a better job protecting the ratepayers. And by the way, that's just one line in the doc that could fall apart way and other new data centers. And that's what we spend our time looking at.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你刚才提到了信用评级。所以评级机构，他们会查看表外载体，即使它不是公司正式的一部分，他们也会推算租赁付款。好的。并将其作为债务包含在内。我明白了，特别是对于**Meta**。他们要等到租赁开始，也就是上线后才会这样做。但每个人都在这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You mentioned the credit ratings just then. So the rating agencies, they they look at the off balance sheet vehicles, even though it's not officially part of the companies, they impute the lease payments. Okay. And include that as debt. I see for **Meta** specifically. They won't do that until the lease starts when it comes online. But everyone's doing it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 然后我只是在想，我不想过多地纠结于这个类比，但你一开始谈到了作为公用事业分析师历史上所有激动人心的时刻，其中之一就是**安然**，我想这意味着你对循环交易有一些经验。但你如何看待数据中心行业所有参与者之间似乎正在发生的这种“乱伦”融资交易？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And then I was just thinking, I don't mean to labor this analogy too much, but, you know, you started out by talking about all the exciting moments in the history of being a utilities analyst, and one of those was **Enron**, which I assume means, you know, you have some experience with circular deals. But what do you think about all the sort of incestuous financing deals that seem to be happening between all the various players in the data center, industry?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 你是说我们会购买你的股权，这样你就可以购买我们的芯片？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: You mean we'll buy your equity so you can buy our chips?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, yeah.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 再说一次，我在这方面是站在债券持有人一边的。只要看看市值，看看债券收益率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Again, I'm on the side of bondholders in that one. Just look at the market caps, look at the bond yields and the,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你能为那些甚至不了解**Bloomberg Core**的人解释一下你的意思吗？我们有一些拥有**Bloomberg**但太懒的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I explain what you mean by that for so like, for people who don't even know **Bloomberg Core**, we've got people like me who have a **Bloomberg** but are too lazy.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 所以这些公司正在出去。是的。**OpenAI**或**英伟达**正在出去购买这些新云公司的股权。然后这些公司就可以向**OpenAI**提供计算能力，并从**英伟达**购买芯片。所以这都是非常循环的。我认为20年前人们使用的例子是**北电（Nortel）**在做这种事。所有这些供应商融资。所以对此有很多怀疑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: So these names are going out and. Yeah. And either **OpenAI** or **Nvidia** is going out and buying equity in these neo cloud companies. So then they can go out and either supply the compute to **OpenAI** and buy the chips from **Nvidia**. So it's all very circular. And I think the example people used 20 years ago was **Nortel** was doing this. All the vendor financing. So there's a little lot of skepticism on that.

</details>

### 核能与小型模块化反应堆（SMRs）

**Tracey Alloway**: 好的。我们不能做一期公用事业节目，我知道我们一直专注于数据中心，但我们不能不做一期不提核电的公用事业节目。要真正获得一些核能容量需要什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Okay. So we can't do a utilities episode. I know we've been focused on data centers, but we can't do a utilities episode without mentioning nuclear power. What's it going to take to actually get, you know, some capacity from nuclear?

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。显然，**Vogel**电厂是最后一个大型核电站，原计划成本140亿美元，最终花费了320亿美元。它晚了十年才上线。没有公用事业公司愿意承担这种风险。现在大家都在谈论这些**小型模块化反应堆（SMRs）**。我认为你将开始看到更多关于这些的讨论。我们认为**小型模块化反应堆**能够做出最终投资决策的唯一方式是，大型科技公司同意做两件事。他们同意购买一些**SMRs**，并且他们投资这些小型制造商的股权，为他们提供建造的资本支出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: Sure. So obviously the **Vogel** plant was the last big nuclear plant in the line of supposed to cost 14 billion and ended up costing 32 billion. It came on line ten years late. And no utility wants to take that risk. Now everyone's talking about these **Small Modular Reactors**. And I think that's what you're going to start seeing is more talk of these. The only way we think of **Small Modular Reactors** goes final investment decision **Fiddy** is if Big Tech agrees to do two things. They agree to buy some smashers and they invest equity in those smaller manufacturers to give them the CapEx to build,

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 老实说，这听起来像是他们会做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Which sounds like something they would do, to be honest.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 当然。我认为这是你让其中一个项目启动的唯一方式。而且我认为如果这些股票因为那笔交易而上涨，它们都是做空对象，因为它们已经反映了几笔这样的交易正在发生。所以主要的有**Nuscale**和**Oklo**。**OpenAI**的**Sam Altman**曾经是**Oklo**的董事长。然后他辞职了，这样他们就可以做一笔交易。所以类似的事情会发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: For sure. And I think that's the only way you get one of these off the ground. And I think if those stocks rally on that deal, they're all shorts because they're already reflecting several of those deals happening. So the big ones are our **Nuscale** and **Oklo**. And **Sam Altman** of **OpenAI**, I used to be the chairman of **Oklo**. And then he stepped down so they could do a deal. So something along those lines would happen.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 话虽如此，**唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）**曾谈到与**西屋电气（Westinghouse）**合作，并持有股权以建造另一个**AP1000**。显然，**特朗普**总统非常热衷于持有股权。但我所覆盖的公用事业公司中，没有一家会在没有任何支持的情况下建造任何东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: That being said, **Donald Trump** has talked about doing work with **Westinghouse** and taking equity ownership to build another **Ap1000**. And obviously President **Trump** is all about taking equity. But none of the utilities in my coverage are going to build something without some sort of backstop.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们最近和一位基础设施投资者做了一期节目，我，你知道，我是一名记者。我关注过去，我不谈论未来。但我当时被问到，我说，我认为在未来20年里，如果非要我说，我们再也不会有另一个**Vogel**了，或者说我们不会再有**美国**那样的项目了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We we did an episode recently with an infrastructure investor and I, you know, I'm a journalist. I look at the past, I don't talk about the future. But I was put on the spot and I said, I think in the next 20 years, gun to my head, we will never have another **Vogel** or we're not going to have another project like that in America.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 听起来你同意。我同意。我确实认为你会看到一些**SMRs**。好的。我的意思是，坦率地说，我们国家制造核潜艇已经67年了。那就是一个**SMR**。所以我认为这就是发生的方式，大型科技公司介入并这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: And it sounds like you agree, I agree. I do think you see some smears. Okay. I mean, frankly, our country's been making nuclear submarines for 67 years. That's an **SMR** right there. So I think that's the way it happens is big tech goes in and does that for sure.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 20年后，我们会请你回来，看看你们俩的预测是否准确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: In 20 years, we'll have you back on to see whether or not both of you.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这是我唯一正确的预测。我对未来一无所知。这是我唯一的预测，我只是认为我们永远不会再有那样的项目了。我们不会再有那么多那样的项目了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This is my only right. I don't know nothing about the future. This is my only one call is I just don't think we're going to ever get that right. That's we're not going to get a bunch of those.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 这就是为什么我同意你的看法。20年后，我希望我能从海滩上打电话进来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Andy DeVries**: That's why I'm with you on that. And in 20 years, hopefully, I can dial in from the beach.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。20年后见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right. See you in 20 years.

</details>

**Andy DeVries**: 不，可能更早，因为这是一次很棒的对话。

### 市场炒作与效率提升

**Tracey Alloway**: 那真是一次非常有趣的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: That was a really fun conversation.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 太有趣了。我喜欢我的观点重构，我正在形成一个观点，那就是我可以同时被低估和被高估，对吧？实际上，纵观历史，我们对变革性技术就是这样看的，对吧？想想互联网泡沫。互联网改变了世界，但它是一个泡沫。想想铁路。19世纪的铁路改变了世界，但也是一个泡沫。所以我认为这有点像，我认为关键问题是**Andy**和你们都提到了时机，对吧？时机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's super fun. I love that my the opinion reframing that I'm sort of coalescing around is that I can be simultaneously under hyped and overvalued, right? And actually throughout history, that's kind of what we've seen with transformative technology, right? Like think about the internet bubble. The internet changed the world, but it was a bubble. Think about railroads. Railroads in the 1800s changed the world, but also a bubble. So I think that's kind of it's kind of what I think the key issue, which **Andy** and you both touched on is the timing, right? The timing.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 是的，我的意思是，我认为这非常有趣，因为他的论点甚至不依赖于任何当前的估值。他的意思是，有所有这些建设的预期。他所说的，有一个数据中心需求量的数字。有一个正在建设的量，第二个数字看起来更大，那将是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: And yeah, I mean, I think it's a it's very interesting because of course, his argument doesn't even, you know, doesn't even rest on any valuations right now. It's like there is all of this expectation for build out there. Is it. You know, as he put it, there is a number for the amount of, the volume of data center demand. There is an amount that's being built up and it's like the second number looks bigger, and that's going to be a that's going to be a problem.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 就你所说的时间点，我认为你有一个非常有趣的观察，这与他的核心思想有点不相干，但这个想法是，我们的一些能源政策正在鼓励现在大量生产，特别是即将到期的太阳能税收抵免。是的。同时，很多这种需求将在后期上线。等等。我确实认为，这似乎是一个非常有趣的领域。它与我们之前谈论的公用事业作为利率代理，为老年人提供收入的时代相去甚远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And the time to your point, like I thought, you know, really interesting observation you had is a little bit not tangential to his core idea, but this idea that some of our energy policies are encouraging a lot of production right now, particularly the expiring solar credits. Yeah. At the same time, a lot of this demand is going to come online in the back end, etc.. I do think that, you know, it seems like a really it definitely seems like a fun space. It's very far from when we were just talking about, like, utilities as, as rate proxy. Right. Something for old people to get, income.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 另一方面，我在需求侧思考的是，我认为**AI**多头，也就是像你这样的代码爱好者，倾向于认为需求只会朝一个方向发展。对吧？所以对**AI**的需求会增加，因为，我不知道，每一段软件都将通过云代码或其他方式复制。所以电力需求也会上升。但到目前为止我们看到的是，这些东西变得越来越高效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Well, the other thing I was thinking about on the demand side is I think there's a tendency among **AI** bulls via coders such as yourself. That's right. To think that demand is just going to go one way. Right? So there's going to be more demand for **AI** because I don't know, every piece of software is going to be replicated through cloud code or whatever. And so power demand is going to go up as well. But what we've seen so far is that these things are getting more and more efficient.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 它们确实变得越来越高效，而且比任何人预期的都要快。是的。你知道，这有点偏离主题，但我确实认为，我们在这个行业中看到的一个反复出现的现象是，每个，我的意思是，这可能是一个看涨的案例，那就是即使是乐观主义者也总是被证明过于悲观。例如，处理一个**token**的成本效率提升速度比人们预期的要快。今天早上，1月28日，**ASML**，这家大型芯片设备公司，业绩远超预期。模型的评估和基准测试，乐观主义者说可能到2027年才能达到这个水平，结果到2026年初就达到了。等等。所以，如果你想，我在这里不做任何论断，但如果你想提出一个看涨的案例，那就是即使是乐观主义者，也总是被意外地惊喜到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: They're definitely getting more and more efficient and like faster than anyone expected. Yeah. You know, this is a little bit, tangential to the point, but I do think like one of the recurring phenomena is that we're seeing across this, industry is that every I mean, and this is, I guess it's a bull case, which is that, you know, even the optimists keep getting, turned out to be too pessimistic. The pace of, say, like, efficiency gains for the cost of processing a token dropping faster than people expected this morning. Recording to this January 28th **ASML**, the big chip, equipment company way better than expected. The evals, the benchmarks for the models where it's like the optimists say like maybe it could code at this level by 2027. Turns out it hits there by like, you know, early 2026, etc.. So like if you want to just make I'm not making any case here, but if you just want to like make a bull case, it's like even the optimists, keep getting surprised to the upside.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 另一方面，听到他说“看看市场在说什么”真是太棒了。他们没有将任何这些预期定价进去。我特别惊讶，因为我没有意识到这一点，即使是关于**LNG**出口终端的所有讨论，天然气预计在几年后会比现在便宜。这与流行的叙事之间存在非常有趣的差异。也许天然气交易员还不是“氛围编码员”。那时他们就会确切地了解这到底有多少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: On the other hand, it's fascinating to hear him say look at what the markets are saying. They're not pricing in any of these expectations. And I was particularly surprised because I didn't realize this, that even like, you know, for all of the talk of **LNG** export terminals, etc., that gas is expected to be cheaper a few years, you know, than it is right now. Very interesting dissonance between that and the popular narrative. Maybe, gas traders just aren't vibe coders yet. That's when they would understand exactly how much more of this.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 但从能源角度来看，这里存在推拉因素，对吧？一方面，每个人都可以使用**AI**，需求增加；但另一方面，它可能会变得非常非常高效，然后需求下降。我认为这就是困难所在，或者说，有一个数字，通过一些合理的推断，可以知道它会走向何方。而且这个数字非常高。听他谈论那些超大规模公司的数字时，确实非常令人震惊，因为这会到哪里结束呢？对吧？正如他所指出的，好吧，你像2吉瓦那样出现了，等等，大量的**GPT**在那里。对吧？那是计算最密集的事情之一。也许有理由认为这一切都会很棒。**AI**会赚很多钱，但你不能真正地得到这个数字。我不知道，我认为他，是的，这是一个非常有用的视角，只是关于一些简单的数学。而且数学听起来像是减法。这听起来像是。对，儿子正在学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: But we're going to just from an energy perspective, though, there is a push and pull factor here. Right? So on the one hand everyone could use **AI** and demand goes up, but on the other hand, maybe it gets super, super efficient and then demand goes down. I think that's that's the difficulty or it's just there is a number that's out there with like sort of like some reasonable inferences about where it's going to go. And it's very high. And it was actually very striking listening to him talk about some of those super, the Hyperscaler numbers, because it's like, where does it end up? Right? Like as he pointed out, okay, you like, came out two gigawatts, etc. like a ton of **GPT** is out there. Right. And that's one of the most computationally intensive things. Like maybe there are reasons to think this is all going to go great. There's going to be a ton of money made in **AI**, but you can't really just like get to the number. I don't know, I think he yeah, it was a this was a very useful perspective, just sort of on some of the simple math. And the math sounds like it's subtraction. Like this sounds like. Right. Son is learning.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 另外一件我认为非常有趣的事情是，你问到如果你是这家拥有大量现金的科技巨头，为什么要将这些东西进行表外融资？他给出的建议是，嗯，也许在未来某个时候，比如五年后，你需要摆脱这项负债，或者你不想处理它。这就是我们做那期节目的原因，那个做法律文件的公司的人，等等。这就是为什么理解这些事情非常关键，因为有些问题听起来像是**Facebook**或**Meta**的退出选择权。对吧？隐含着某种退出选择权，等等。他们如何、在什么情况下允许这样做，对于这项表外票据的任何投资者来说，显然都将非常关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Well, the other thing I thought was really interesting was the response to your question about why would you finance these things off balance sheet if you're, you know, this massive cash rich technology giant? And the suggestion there was, well, maybe at some point in the future, like five years down the line, you need to get rid of this liability or you don't want to deal with it. This is why we did that episode with the guy who has, you know, the company doing the legal docs, right? Etc. this is why, it's pretty crucial to understand some of these things, because some of the questions sound like the, **Facebook**'s or **Meadow**'s option to walk away. Right? There's some call option implicitly to walk away, etc.. And they, they how they, what they could what scenarios and what they would allow it to be do is obviously going to be pretty crucial for any investors in this off balance sheet paper.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 我直到你问这个问题才知道，评级机构虽然不将其视为债务，但他们确实会扣除租赁成本，因此这可以影响他们的整体信用可持续性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: I did not know until you asked this whole idea that, the ratings agency is, well, they don't look at it as debt. They do back out a lease cost and therefore it can inform their overall, credit sustainability.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 另外，我们提到了这一点，但投资者对数据中心债务的需求越来越多。对吧？出于某种原因，这个领域变得越来越有竞争力。所以自然而然地，你在历史上任何其他信贷周期中都会看到，随着需求增长和人们争夺交易，文件和保护措施往往会变得不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, the other thing, you know, we touched on this, but there's more and more demand from investors for data center debt. Right. Like the space is getting more for some reason. The space is getting more competitive. And so naturally, what you see in any other credit cycle throughout history is as demand grows and people are competing for deals, the documentation and the protections tend to different.

</details>

**Tracey Alloway**: 奇怪的是，我觉得债务的炒作周期有点奇怪，因为我明白，哦，我真的很想进入**AI**股票市场，对吧？因为明年它可能会涨100倍，对吧？然后，哦，我真的很兴奋进入数据中心债务市场，因为它可能会多给我50个基点，我觉得这很奇怪，或者多100个基点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracey Alloway**: Weird, you know, I find the existence of hype cycles for debt to be a little bit weird because I get like, oh, I really want to get into **AI** equity, right? Because that could 100 x next year, right? And it's like, oh, I'm really excited about getting into data center debt because it might pay me 50 bips more I find to be very strange or 100 bips more.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 就像如果我有一个固定的，你看，我是一个简单的人，但如果我有一个固定收益分配，我只关心最小化下行风险。我真的不在乎它是什么行业。我不参与上行。你不会变得贪婪。你不会变得超级富有。我只是不想亏钱，对于固定收益来说，我只是不想亏钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It's like if I have a fixed look, I'm a simple, simple guy, but if I have a fixed income allocation, all I care about is minimizing downside. And I don't really care like what sector it is. I'm not participating in the upside. You're not going to get greedy. You're not going to get rich. You're going to get super rich on like, I just don't lose my like, for fixed income. I just don't lose my money.
