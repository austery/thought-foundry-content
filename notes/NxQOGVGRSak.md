title: 标普500逼近历史新高，AMD发布激进增长预测，Michael Burry再发“大空头”式警告
summary: 市场情绪高涨，标普500指数在盘前交易中距离历史高点仅一步之遥，受政府关门有望结束和潜在的“圣诞老人行情”预期提振。AMD发布了未来五年35%的年收入增长预测，点燃了半导体板块。与此同时，特朗普政府正考虑发放2000美元补贴并降低关税以应对生活成本问题。然而，著名投资人Michael Burry发出警告，将当前市场与2008年金融危机前夕相提并论，暗示AI领域存在巨大泡沫。文章深入探讨了企业盈利强劲与消费者财务困境并存的“分裂经济”现象，并分析了其对投资策略的深远影响。

### 市场开盘：标普500逼近历史高位

早上好，各位。欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月12日，星期三。感谢大家的到来。说实话，我每天的一大乐趣，就是在我准备开播前一分钟，阅读评论区里关于我为什么迟到的留言。我简直无法形容这些评论有多搞笑，你们总能想出各种新奇的理由来解释我为什么会迟到一分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, November 12th. Thank you everybody for being here. You know, one of the highlights of my day, legitimately, one of the highlights of my day, and quite frankly, I I blame you guys for this for making this a highlight, and you're not really uh helping incentivize me to be early, is reading the comments a minute before I'm supposed to start about why I'm late. I mean, I cannot explain how hilarious some of these he's on Grinder, he's with the dentist, he's with this, and it's like it's it's like you find a new way to figure out why I'm one minute late.</p>
</details>

但我们现在已经就位，直播开始了。感谢各位的到来。我们有很多内容要谈。盘前市场一片大好。我说的“大好”，是指在盘前交易中，标普500指数距离历史最高点已经不到半个百分点，这非常令人兴奋。英伟达股价在195美元，标普500指数在685点。要知道，上周五我们还在661点，而在10月份市场最艰难的时候，我们曾跌至647点。所以，我们现在能达到685点，离历史高点689点仅几美元之遥，这确实非常激动人心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we're here. We're live. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about, folks. We got a green pre-market. And when I mean green, I mean I mean we are less than half a percent away from alltime highs on this S&P 500 in the pre-market, which is very exciting to see. Nvidia right here at 195, S&P 500 at 685. Folks, we were at 661 last Friday and uh we were at 647 in the depths of October when things were getting rough. So, the fact that we are at 685, couple bucks away from 689, which is alltime highs, very exciting to see.</p>
</details>

### 宏观因素：政府关门结束与圣诞行情预期

市场上涨背后有一些宏观原因。我认为我们正在接近所谓的**圣诞老人行情**（Santa Claus rally: 指每年年底最后五个交易日和新年头两个交易日期间，股市通常会上涨的现象）。我不确定它具体会是什么样子，甚至不确定它是否会发生，但如果它要发生，很可能会在政府关门结束后出现。参议院的共和党人和民主党人今天将进行投票，这次投票很可能最终结束政府关门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's some macro reasons why we're getting there. I also think we are getting close to this Santa Claus rally. I don't know exactly what it's going to look like. I don't know if it's even going to happen, but if it were to happen, it probably would take place at the end of a shutdown. The Republicans in the Senate and the Democrats are going to be voting uh today and that vote will likely culminate into the end of the shutdown.</p>
</details>

下周我们还有英伟达的财报。所以，政府关门的结束、英伟达的财报，再加上普遍的年终追涨情绪，这些都可能引发一波上涨行情。当然，我们最近也经历了很多市场震荡。昨天是退伍军人节，债券市场休市，所以流动性不足。我们需要观察今天市场开盘后的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have Nvidia earnings next week. So you have the end of the shutdown, Nvidia earnings and then general sort of endofear chasing that could lead to this type of rally. Now granted, we've had ton of we have had a ton of whipsaws across the entire board. Yesterday we uh had Veterans Day, so the bond markets were closed, so there wasn't that much liquidity. So we're going to see how the market ends up opening up today.</p>
</details>

总的来说，我认为昨天最令人兴奋的是，尽管英伟达下跌，许多数据中心概念股也下跌，但亚马逊、苹果却表现不错，标普500指数也是上涨的。这意味着市场很大一部分是下跌的，比如数据中心、科技股、半导体，而金融股却在上涨。礼来公司（Eli Lilly）股价创下历史新高。医药股、防御性股票都有所表现，市场出现了某种程度的普涨。我认为看到这种市场广度的拓宽并非坏事，这对于牛市的健康发展是有利的。昨天发生的这一切都是非常积极的信号。如果这种势头今天能够延续，即使科技股没有大幅上涨——尽管盘前它们表现强劲——那也不是什么坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the most exciting thing about yesterday is that Nvidia was down. You had a bunch a bunch of data center plays down. Amazon, Apple were kind of green. The S&P 500 was green. So, you had a large part of the market that was red. Data centers, tech, semiconductors, and you had financials that were up. Lily hit all-time highs. Um, pharmaceuticals, defensives, you had a little bit of a broadening, and I don't think that's the worst thing for us to see. Uh, as of, you know, this idea in terms of this idea of actually being able to broaden out the bull market, but the fact that it did happen yesterday is very positive signs. I mean, if that can compound and continue today, even if you don't have a massive move in tech, which you are seeing in the pre-market pound right there, 19160, Robin at 133, then that would not be the worst thing in the world.</p>
</details>

我们有很多要谈论的话题。**13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会要求机构投资者披露其持股情况的季度报告）文件今天应该会开始披露。我们还没有拿到，但今天或明天收盘后，我们应该会看到大量13F和13G文件。届时我们就能知道过去90天里，许多超级投资者都做了些什么。我们还看到了Michael Burry的一条新推文，昨晚我看到时相当惊讶。我们会讨论这个。他提前披露了信息，但最迟到周五，我们应该能得到很多细节，看看哪些是投资者买入和卖出最多的前三名股票。记住，上个季度是联合健康（UNH）、亚马逊和谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. 13Fs, I think, will start to get disclosed today. Uh, we don't have them yet. Either today or tomorrow after the close, we should get a decent amount of these 13Fs and 13Gs, and we're going to see what a lot of these super investors did over the past 90 days. We do have a new tweet from Mr. from Michael Bur, which was quite surprising last night when I uh saw his tweet. So, we'll talk about that. He disclosed it early, but latest Friday, we should get a lot of details and then we're going to see what are the top three stocks that people bought and sold. Remember, last quarter it was UNH, Amazon, and Google. So, you had a decent chunk of uh those names getting bid up right now.</p>
</details>

到目前为止我们收到了多少份报告？在我们关注的82份13F报告中，目前只收到了大约7份。买入最多的前三名是Fiserv、Baxter International和联合健康（UNH），这其实不是最好的消息，因为Fiserv遭受了重创。联合健康依然在列。第四名是MetLife。然后是伯克希尔哈撒韦、台积电（TSM）、应用材料、Adobe，以及FIS（Fidelity National Information Services）。我们还有更多数据有待公布，但目前这就是排名前几位的公司。我们很快，可能就在未来48小时内，就能看到这些13F文件的全貌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many did we get so far? So far, we got like seven out of the 82 13Fs that we're looking for. And the top three buys were Fiserve, Baxter International, and UNH, which actually is not the best thing because Fiser got hit really bad. UNH continues to be there. And then Met is number four. Then you have Birchar, TSM, Applied Materials, um, Adobe, and then FIS, Fidelity, National Information Services. So, we have a lot more data to come to see what that looks like. But right now, those are the top three. And we'll see coming soon, probably in literally the next 48 hours, what these 13 apps look like.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普的经济刺激计划与关税政策

好了，让我们进入正题。感谢大家的到来。我想我们先从今天早上的核心头条新闻开始，然后再谈谈AMD。昨晚AMD的消息很重要，它继续提振了数据中心板块。今天早上，有消息称，我们一直在讨论的2000美元刺激支票真的要来了。消息人士引用称：“2000美元的退税将面向年收入低于10万美元的人群，但具体方案尚未最终确定。”所以，这证实了政府确实在考虑发放2000美元的退税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Thank you everybody for being here. I think we'll get started with the kind of core headline that I'm seeing this morning and then we'll get into AMD. That was a big piece of news last night, which continued to help the data center players. Here's what Basen said this morning, which again, we've been talking about, hey, is this $2,000 steamy check actually coming through? Bent said, quote, "A $2,000 rebate would be for those making less than $100,000, but it has not yet been decided." So, you got Bent confirming this morning, we are legitimately thinking of a $2,000 rebate.</p>
</details>

我想这会是一种刺激措施，对吧？无论是直接发支票还是以退税形式，如果你在这个国家收入低于10万美元，你就能额外获得2000美元现金。这笔钱你总会以某种方式花掉。现在，如果不是支票而是退税，问题就变成了政府、鲍威尔和美联储如何看待它。但无论如何，特朗普似乎对那2000美元的“关税红利”是认真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That would be, I imagine, a form of stimulus, right? Whether it's a direct check or whether it's a tax refund, if you're going to get an extra $2,000 cash, if you make less than uh 4,000 or $100,000 in this country, I mean, then there you go. that's an extra 2,000 bucks that you're going to be using in some way. Now, again, if it's not a check, but it's a form of rebate, the question simply becomes how the government sort of thinks of it, how JPAL thinks of it, how the Fed thinks of it. But nonetheless, it does seem like Trump was serious about that $2,000 tariff dividend.</p>
</details>

他还说：“我们将在未来几天内公布对咖啡、香蕉和其他几种商品的大幅关税削减。”这与特朗普总统昨晚的说法是一致的。这里有一段他谈论降低关税的片段。在我看来，这要么是因为他们看到了需求下降，所以需要降低关税；要么是他们确实看到了成本上升，因此需要降低关税。但这与总统过去几天的想法是一致的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He also said, "We are going to unveil substantial tariff reductions over the coming days on coffee, bananas, and several other items." And that is consistent with what President Trump has said last night. Here's a clip of him talking about reducing tariffs, which in my opinion is based on either they're seeing less demand, so they need to reduce tariffs, or they are genuinely seeing higher costs, therefore they need to reduce tariffs. But it is consistent with what the president has been thinking about over the past couple days.</p>
</details>

特朗普的讲话中有几个非常有趣的关键点。第一，他说的和今天早上的消息一样，即他们将专注于降低一些关税。显然，像咖啡、香蕉等某些商品的价格可能开始变得过高，这也许是他们考虑降低关税的原因，他们只是意识到对这些商品征收这类关税毫无意义。第二，这2000美元的红利，最终都回到了“可负担性”这个问题上，无论它是退税、刺激支票还是其他形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you got a couple key points here that is really interesting from Trump. Number one, he is saying the same thing that Bes said this morning, which is that we are going to be focusing on lowering some tariffs. Obviously, there's some certain prices on uh goods like coffee, bananas, etc. that are starting to get too high and maybe that's why they're thinking of lowering tariffs and you know, they're just realizing it doesn't make any sense for us to have these types of tariffs on these types of goods. And number two, again, this $2,000 dividend, it all goes back down to this question of affordability, whether it's a rebate, a stimulus check, or what it looks like.</p>
</details>

今天早上还有消息称，预计美国民众将在2026年第一和第二季度开始对经济感觉更好。此外，政府希望引进技术工人，为期三到七年，以培训美国人，然后他们可以回国。所以，他们在解决劳动力市场、关税、可负担性以及最终美国人将感受到的整体刺激等多个问题，无论是通过支票还是通过关税退税的形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the other thing Bent said this morning is that expect American people will start feeling better about the economy in Q1 and Q2 of 2026. And then number two, I want to bring in or you I being the the administration want to bring in skilled workers for 3 to seven years to train Americans and then they can go home. So, they're attacking a lot of different issues around the labor market, tariffs, affordability, and then the overall stimulus that Americans will eventually feel, whether it's through a check or whether it's through a rebate when it comes through uh when it comes to the tariffs and, you know, the actual impact it should have on the American people.</p>
</details>

我认为这一切都源于特朗普对最高法院案件的担忧，我们昨天谈到过，看起来情况对他不利。我不知道这会对经济产生什么影响。昨天的一个重大进展是，商品进口商在口头听证会上告诉最高法院，如果推翻关税，他们“非常容易”退还已收取的关税。这等于他们为最高法院排除了一个最大的担忧。我原以为最高法院会说，“嘿，退还数千亿美元会非常困难。”但昨天来到最高法院的进口商们却说：“不，没那么难。就像按一个按钮一样，我们已经准备好了文件。”听到这个消息真是令人难以置信，这可能会极大地影响他们对最终裁决的思考方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this all comes down to the fear that Trump has around the Supreme Court case, which we talked about yesterday, not looking like it's going to go in his favor. I don't know what's going to be the economic impact of it. The big update yesterday was that the importers of goods told the Supreme Court in an oral hearing that if you were to reverse the tariffs, it would be quote unquote very easy for us to pay back the tariffs that we have collected. Aka they they they took one of the biggest concerns from the Supreme Court off the table, which I thought the Supreme Court would say, "Hey, it's going to be really hard to like refund hundreds of billions of dollars." And the importers that came to the Supreme Court yesterday, they were like, "No, it's not that hard. It's just like one button. We press it and we have the paperwork ready." It's like so it it was quite incredible hearing that yesterday and you know that could again significantly influence the way they're thinking about the overall decision for how it's going to go.</p>
</details>

据彭博社报道，关于政府关门的投票将在今晚7点进行。因此，大约在东部时间晚上9点或10点，众议院多数党领袖表示，众议院将在周三晚上7点前就结束关门的法案进行投票。我们应该就能知道这次关门是否结束了。我认为这也是市场目前上涨的原因之一。坦率地说，这些消息对市场意味着什么？是利好。如果你要降低关税，市场从来就不喜欢关税，所以这是利好。然后，如果你真的要给人们2000美元的退税，即使这会引发通胀，那也是以后要解决的问题。短期内，如果大量收入低于10万美元的人能额外得到2000美元用于消费，这无疑会刺激经济，这对市场来说是相当利好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the government shutdown will be voted on uh tonight at 7 p.m. at least that's what Bloomberg is reporting and so by around I would say 9 or 10 p.m. US House majority leader said that the House will vote on the bill to the shutdown by Wednesday 7 p.m. Eastern. We should know probably around 9 or 10 p.m. Eastern if this shutdown is done. That is why I think the market is also running right now. And then quite frankly, what are the implications of what the scent is saying on the market? It's bullish. I mean, if you're going to lower tariffs, the market never liked tariffs. That's bullish. And then if you're actually going to give a $2,000 rebate to people, even if it's inflationary, that's a problem for another day. Uh but in the short term, it'd be pretty damn bullish if a bunch of people making under $100,000 got an extra 2,000 bucks that they can spend and it obviously would stimulate the economy.</p>
</details>

所以，如果有人认为这是卖出信号或是牛市陷阱，想要离场，当然，在年底前获利了结、进行税务亏损收割等都是个人决定。但我认为，我们很有可能迎来这波上涨。这波涨势会到695点、7000点还是7200点？还是在680到685之间震荡？没人知道。但考虑到我们即将讨论的围绕AI的宏观交易，以及关税红利和政府关门结束的细节，我认为现在做多市场并不是最悲观的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think if people are thinking that this is a sell or this is a bull trap or you want to get out of the market obviously taking profits going into the end of the year tax loss harvesting all that stuff is a personal decision but I think there is a shot that we end up getting this rally is that rally to 695 is it to 7,000 7200 is it oscillating between 680 and 685 no one knows but given the macro trade round AI that we're about to talk about and some of this uh tariff dividend details around the shutdown ending I don't think it's the most bearish to kind of be long this market right now.</p>
</details>

### AMD发布激进增长预测，点燃AI板块

话虽如此，让我们来谈谈AI。昨天，苏姿丰（Lisa Su）确实让人们兴奋不已。她说了四件事：对AI计算基础设施的需求依然很高；客户没有减少投资；他们预计未来5年年收入增长35%；数据中心业务增长将超过80%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, let's get into AI. So, Lisa Sue really got people excited yesterday. Four things she said. Demand for AI computing infrastructure remains high. Customers are not reducing their investments. They're projecting annual revenue growth of 35% over the next 5 years and data center growth exceeding 80%.</p>
</details>

该股在盘前上涨的原因并非收入目标，尽管这些目标非常可观，能看到他们计划未来5年增长35%是件好事。AMD股价现在是252美元，上周还曾跌至224美元。上涨的主要原因是他们的毛利率。这是在昨天盘后披露的，所以你看到了4%的涨幅，并带动了其他许多数据中心概念股。他们给出了相当强劲的毛利率增长指引，我相信大约在55%到58%之间。而市场的预期是51%到53%。考虑到AMD销售的硬件数量，这额外的3.5%毛利率是相当可观的。结果，人们都兴奋起来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason why the stock is up in the pre-market is not because of the revenue targets, which are really substantial and nice to see that they're thinking of growing 35% over the next 5 years. 252 on AMD. Again, it got to 224 last week. Um, the main reason is their gross margins apparently. And this was disclosed yesterday after hours, which is why you saw that 4% bump and it helped a lot of the other data center plays. Um, they're guiding for some pretty strong gross margin growth. Uh, I believe it's around 55 to 58%. The street thought it was going to be 51 to 53%. That extra three and a half% on uh, gross margins is substantial given the amount of hardware that AMD is selling. And as a result, you got people excited.</p>
</details>

Melius分析师将AMD目标价定为380美元，并表示“毛利率指引是真正的积极惊喜。35%的收入增长意味着在AI半导体和网络领域占据两位数的市场份额。AMD似乎明确地以1万亿美元的市值为目标。这将是目前市值的两倍多。尽管要实现这一目标需要大量的执行力和OpenAI的资金支持，但10%的市场份额看起来是现实的。我们正在上调我们的预期和目标价，从300美元上调至380美元。”这显然也提振了昨天表现挣扎的整个半导体行业以及数据中心概念股。当AMD说他们未来5年将增长35%时，这是个强有力的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Melius 380 by AMD. The margin guide was the real positive surprise. 35% revenue growth cracks a double digit share in AI semis and networking. AMD seems to clearly be targeting a $1 trillion market cap with these aspirations. That would be more than a 2x from here. Although there's a lot of execution and open AI funding needed to get there. A share of 10% seems realistic. We are raising our estimates and target 380 from 300. And obviously that helped the entire semiconductor se sector that was struggling yesterday along with the data center plays. when you have an AMD saying that we're going to grow 35% over the next 5 years.</p>
</details>

苏姿丰在采访中表示，市场正以前所未有的速度加速发展。几年前，他们认为AI加速器市场规模可能是3000亿美元，这已经是个大数字了。但现在回过头看，他们看到了一个巨大的机遇，到2030年，整体市场规模将超过一万亿美元。这是一个所有人都需要技术的领域。你可以把计算等同于智能，如果你能获得更多智能，为什么不想要更多计算呢？这就是我们所处的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the market is accelerating at a pace that we you know just did not understand until uh you know over the last few years. Um I think we started a couple of years ago we thought you know the AI accelerator town might be you know $300 billion and that sounded like a really big number. Um and then each year we took it up and now when we take a step back you know we see this massive opportunity um you know really uh over a trillion dollar um you know overall market as we get through 2030. Um and it's a place where everybody needs technology. You know, think about it as you can think about computing as equating to intelligence. And if you can get more intelligence, why wouldn't you want more computing? And that's kind of the market that we're in.</p>
</details>

她还提到，他们与全球所有最大的**超大规模数据中心**（Hyperscalers: 指拥有超大规模计算基础设施的公司，如亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure）和企业合作。在过去12个月里，他们看到每一位大客户都表示，他们现在看到了需求的拐点，因为人们开始从AI用例中获得真正的生产力提升。所有最大的超大规模数据中心都在增加**资本支出**（Capex, Capital Expenditures: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产（如设备、技术、建筑物）的资金），因为他们能看到另一端的回报。市场信号表明，我们仍处于这项技术的非常初级阶段，但已经开始看到显著的生产力提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we work with all of the largest hyperscalers in the world, all of the largest enterprises. And if you looked at, you know, sort of the AI trajectory over the last couple of years, I think people started with tremendous excitement. You know, chat GPT came on board. Everyone was like, "Wow, you know, this is pretty good." Um, and then enterprises started using it and and frankly, uh, the early enterprise usage was, uh, a little bit slow. I mean, people were kind of just trying to figure out what to do. Uh but if I tell you what we've seen in the last 12 months uh we've seen uh every one of our largest customers say we can see the inflection point now Lisa like we can see you know demand is accelerating because people are now starting to get real productivity um out of the AI use cases and you know we have all of the largest hyperscalers in the world saying they're investing more in capex because they can see the uh return on the other side of it. So it it is uh something that we always are looking for the signals in the market but the signals in the market right now say that we're still at the very beginning of the technology but you're starting to see significant productivity</p>
</details>

### Michael Burry的“大空头”式警告：AI是下一个泡沫？

那么，是谁在对这一切表示怀疑呢？是谁说苏姿丰刚才说的一切都是无稽之谈，都不是真的，或者不会像他们在收入和每股收益目标中预测的那样实现呢？这个人不是别人，正是Michael Burry先生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now who is calling BS on all of this who is saying that everything Lisa Sue just said is nonsense none of it's real and it's not panning out or it's not going to pan out in the way that they're projecting in their revenue and EPS targets it is none none other than Mr. Michael Bur. Now, the reason this post yesterday was so surprising to me is because last night, you know what I did last night after I came back from the gym... I said, "You know what? I want to watch the big short." I kind of felt like watch because Michael Bur's been on the news. I kind of felt like watching the Big Short again. I've watched it already like five times.</p>
</details>

昨晚，我心血来潮又看了一遍电影《大空头》。然后我就看到了这条推文弹出来。这是一张克里斯蒂安·贝尔在《大空头》中扮演Michael Burry的剧照。配文是：“那时的我，现在的我。哦，好吧，它成功了。它将会成功。”他说的“那时的我，现在的我”，指的是照片中Burry在他做空房地产泡沫的中途，因为市场不理解即将发生的事情而感到极度烦躁，决定躺下的那一刻。他当时做空亏损了130%，直到最后才成功。他很恼火，但同时也认识到时间最终会证明一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I started watching The Big Short and I was skipping around because like I've seen it so many times. I skip a lot of different scenes. And then I see this tweet pop up and this is a picture of um Christian Bale from The Big Short who played Michael Bur. The caption is me then, me now. Oh well, it worked out. It will work out. when he's saying me then, me now. This is a picture when Bur basically in the middle of his short on the housing bubble kind of just like uh you know decided to lay down because he was so annoyed that the market didn't understand what was about to happen. And again, he had to have that short on for two he was down like 130% of the short before it finally worked out. Um and he was annoyed, right? So he it was it was not like he gave up, but it was almost like he was just like, "Wow, I can't believe the market doesn't get it."

现在的配文是：“它成功了。它将会成功。”在我看来，他这是在暗示，过去他被当成傻瓜两年，最终却被证明是天才，现在可能也是同样的情况，最终会成功的。他公开发布这张照片和配文，对我来说意味着他开始对这笔交易感到害怕。

I mean, the fact that he posted this to imply that it will work out, like, oh, it worked out in the past. I I was seen as the idiot for two years and then eventually I was seen as the genius and now it's probably the same thing but eventually it's going to work out. And the fact that he's publicly stating that on social media... to me means that he's getting scared of this trade.</p>

因为如果你对做空英伟达、做空Palantir，怀疑苏姿丰和黄仁勋所做的一切都如此自信，认为一切都是骗局、都是胡扯，那么你根本就不会说什么。你会持有你的空头头寸，过你的日子，因为最终每个泡沫都会破裂。你想要为你的做空吸引注意力，意味着你认为它有可能对你不利，你正试图让其他人也加入你的交易，要么是为了获得退出流动性，要么是你害怕没有足够多的人理解正在发生的事情，你认为你有责任教育人们你有多么看空。

<p class="english-text">Because if you are so confident that shorting Nvidia and shorting pounder and doubting Lisa Sue and Jensen Hang about everything that's going on, I'm not saying there are not things to be skeptical about. I'm just saying to say that everything's a sham. It's all BS. It's not real. If you were so confident in that, then you would just not say anything. You would have your short position and you would go about your day because eventually every bubble pops and it you know like we end up having some cataclysmic fall and after that you can tell the story. for you to want to get attention for being short means that you think there's a chance it goes against you and you are trying to get other people to pile into the trade with you either to get exit liquidity... or uh you are afraid that not enough people understand what's going on and you think you have a role to educate people about how short you are.</p>

有趣的是，他的个人简介也变了。上面写着：“《大空头》Michael Burry的官方X账户，被沃伦·巴菲特称为‘卡珊德拉’。未被束缚的十月。《卡珊德拉解放》将于11月25日推出。”这听起来像是一本书。如果他要推出一本书，那么他就需要大量的关注。也可能是一个播客，尽管他不太爱说话。

<p class="english-text">I mean, even his bio, he's like, um, official exac account for the big short Michael Bur dubbed Cassandra by Warren Buffett. Unchained October. Cassandra Unchained launches. Oh my goodness. Hold on. This is different from last night. This is different from last night. Last night you didn't have this part of the bio, guys. I think it's a book. I think it's a book. I think I was right. I think I think it's Last night you had something else. He changes his bio every day, too. Again, this guy's like kind of crazy how cryptic he is. Unchained October. Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th. Dude, tell me that's not a book. That has to be a book. What? What else could that be? It's like a Substack article about how short he is on AI. Like, there's no other way. That's not a book. I think that's a book. Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th. So, the broader point is here. I think he's crashing out. He's upset about the way the short is going. And obviously, he's trying to get a lot of people to be upset about it as well. or he's launching a book. And if he's launching a book, then you need a lot of attention. A podcast potentially, even though he's not really a talker.</p>

这条推文昨晚疯传，因为很多人说，“好吧，这正式表明他认为这是第二次‘大空头’事件。”如果你把他2008年的操作和他现在围绕AI所做的事情相提并论，那么他就是在公开宣称这是他的下一个大赌注，并且他对赌注目前不顺利感到不安。但如果这只是营销手段，那可能就是另一回事了。

<p class="english-text">So that tweet went viral last night because, you know, a lot of people were saying, "Okay, this is officially him saying it is the second big short, right? If you're comparing it to what you did in 2008 to what you're doing right now around whatever you think is going on with AI, then boom, that is he's publicly saying this is my next big bet." and he's upset that it's not working. But if it's just marketing, then you know, it might be a different perspective. So that's what I got on Bur.</p>

总的来说，我认为这对市场是利好的。你需要一堵“忧虑之墙”。Burry让更多人看空，这实际上是件好事。越多的悲观情绪，如果盈利能够跟上，我们可能涨得越高。如果盈利持续增长，最终很多空头会转为多头，最终追逐这波涨势。

### “分裂的经济”：企业盈利强劲与消费者困境并存

现在，让我们来谈谈我们的每日环节——“分裂的经济”。我们有一些事情需要讨论。首先，看看这个。两天前，“第二份工作”的搜索量达到了历史新高。其次，**房利美**（Fannie Mae: 即联邦国民抵押贷款协会，是美国政府赞助的企业，旨在为抵押贷款市场提供流动性）正在考虑取消其620分的最低信用分数要求。这家抵押贷款巨头将使用自己的风险因素分析。这是旨在在美国创造购房机会的一系列政策变化中的最新一项。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Let's do our segment on the bifurcated economy because we do this segment every day. There are some things that we got to talk about in regards to this bifrocated economy. So, first of all, take a look at this. Searches for second job have reached an all-time high as of two days ago. ... This is from homes.com. Fanny May is set to drop its 620 credit score minimum. The mortgage giant will use its own analysis of risk factors. Quote, "It's just the latest in a series of policy changes aimed at creating home ownership opportunities in the United States."</p>
</details>

坦白说，昨天这对我来说是一个明显的危险信号。尽管我对很多事情都持乐观态度，但这并不乐观。因为我们正在谈论50年期抵押贷款、15年期汽车贷款，然后是这个。你知道2008年金融危机是怎么造成的吗？就是把有问题的抵押贷款发放给那些无力偿还的人。然后你又陷入了金融工程的泥潭，那些合成设计的**担保债务凭证**（CDO, Collateralized Debt Obligation: 一种复杂的结构性金融产品，将各种债务（如抵押贷款、债券）打包成资产池，并向投资者出售不同风险级别的证券），最终导致了我们见过的最大泡沫之一。但其核心是，那些无力承担2500美元月供的人却能轻易获批。

<p class="english-text">Now, I'm not going to lie, this was a glaring red flag yesterday. There's no way to, you know, mince my words about it. I mean, as bullish as I am about a variety of things, and we're going to look at some bullish parts of the bifrocated economy. This is not bullish because at the end of the day, you talking about 50-year mortgages, 15-year car loans, and then, ... you get this Fanny May update of thinking they're going to lower credit scores. You know what caused 2008? Giving faulty mortgage mortgages to people that couldn't afford them. I mean, and then then you get into the whole financial engineering of these syn synthetically designed CDOS's that had bonds inside of bonds inside of bonds, and that ended up leading to just one of the biggest bubbles we've ever seen. But at its core, it was people that could not afford a $2,500 payment that were easily getting approved for these payments.</p>

但这种分裂体现在哪里呢？体现在美国企业盈利增长正在蓬勃发展。到目前为止，标普500公司的盈利是自2021年第三季度以来最高的。11个标普500行业中有6个报告了平均每股收益正增长。罗素3000指数的利润中位数同比增长11%，是自2021年第三季度以来的最高水平，比第二季度增长了6%。到目前为止，已经报告业绩的公司中，近80%的公司盈利超出预期，平均超出8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, what's the bifurcation? Well, the bifurcation is that US corporate earnings growth is booming. The S&P 500 so far has put up earnings that are the highest since Q3 of 2021. Six of the 11 S&P 500 uh sectors reported positive average EPS growth. And the medium profit growth in the Russell 3000 hit 11% year-over-year, that's the highest from Q3 2021 and up 6% in Q2. Almost 80% of the companies that have reported so far, Nvidia is going to be the big one in a couple of weeks, uh have beat earnings by an average of 8%.</p>
</details>

所以，你看到房利美认为我们需要给那些信用评级不佳、无法获得贷款的人提供贷款。你看到50年期抵押贷款。你看到谷歌上“第二份工作”的搜索量创下历史新高。但与此同时，你又看到企业盈利达到了有史以来的最佳水平。这里的矛盾之处在于，当这些盈利可能因劳动力市场而下降时会发生什么？或者劳动力市场是否会恶化到足以对盈利造成重大影响，从而导致我们的投资组合因股价下跌而大幅缩水？或者，如果我们确实遭遇了非常糟糕的经济，降息是否足以拯救股市？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're seeing Fanny May think that we need to give loans to people that can't qualify for loans because their credit rating is bad. You're seeing fifth year mortgages. You're seeing job uh you're seeing searches for a second job at an all-time high on Google. But then you're seeing corporate earnings being the best it's ever been. ... The dichotomy here, the bifurcation here is what's going to happen when these earnings decline potentially based on the labor market or is the labor market even going to get to the point where it has that much of an impact to cause a meaningful decline in earnings, which would cause a meaningful decline in our portfolios given stock prices will go down. Or if we do get a really bad economy, will the rate cuts be enough to save the stock market?</p>

### 市场观点：分化的经济对投资意味着什么？

我不知道这个问题的答案。我认为Burry做空AI的逻辑，如果他说“嘿，宏观经济中存在一些裂缝”，那么他的分析可能在某种程度上是有道理的。如果我们看到宏观经济出现裂缝，我们是否会看到AI交易也出现裂缝？如果Meta的股价腰斩，人们不再投放广告，也许Meta会说，我们真的没有计划用这么多钱。扎克伯格已经承认，如果我们超支，我们只会使用一些多余的GPU。如果他说我们将停止在资本支出上花钱，英伟达就会遭受重创。这就是所有这些问题不再是分裂的，而是开始汇集在一起的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know what the answer to that question is. I think Bur short on AI does not make as much sense if he was saying, "Hey, there's some cracks in the broader economy." I think that, you know, obviously we are seeing some cracks in the broad economy. I don't know if it's enough to go full-on short, but the one sort of intersection of his analysis could make sense. If we see cracks in the broader economy, could we see cracks in the AI trade, which would not be a good thing to see because obviously if Meta, you know, stock price gets cut in half and people aren't advertising anymore, maybe Meta says, you know, we don't really even have a plan for all this money. Zux already admitted that if we overspend, then we're just going to be using some of the excess GPUs. If he says we're going to stop spending on capex, Nvidia takes a nice little haircut. So that's where all of this gets not bifrocated. That's when everything starts to come together and ultimately time will tell to see you know what happens longterm.</p>

美国银行的一位分析师对7000万消费者的信贷和借记卡支出进行了深入研究。她指出，高收入家庭是支出的主要驱动力。低收入家庭的支出仍在增长，但增速远低于高收入家庭。两者之间最大的差距体现在大宗商品、机票、住宿和家具上。在这些类别中，并非高收入者支出更多，而是低收入者在缩减开支。

<p class="english-text">Here is one of the analysts at Bank of America that takes a uh hard look at a lot of the credit and debit spending through 70 million consumers. And here's what she had to say about what's going on with the lower-end consumer. ... it's the higher income households that are really driving the spending. ... So, the lower end spending is still growing. So, if you look at at lower income spending, last month it was up 7/10. Higher income spending though was up, you know, almost four times that at 2.7. What's interesting is though what the gaps are in terms of what the difference between the spending growth between the higher and the lower income consumer and where we're seeing the biggest gaps are in bigger ticket items in airlines in lodging in furniture. To a lesser extent, we're also seeing it in clothing. But in each of those categories, it's not that the higher income is really spending a lot more. It's that lower income is pulling back.</p>

对于投资者来说，这意味着什么？我认为有两点。第一，我们谈论它是为了确保人们明白，并非一切都完美无瑕。第二，这是否意味着你应该卖出？在我看来，不是。如果你想减持一些仓位，我认为完全可以。对我来说，这更广泛地意味着，当我们开始看到企业盈利趋势朝相反方向发展时，也就是盈利不再是自2021年以来最好的时候，那将是实体经济开始影响股市的第一个信号。因为目前，有很多细微的原因导致股市并没有真正感受到那种痛苦。

<p class="english-text">The takeaway for investors, I know a lot of people might be saying, look, we've been talking about this bifrocated economy for a long time. What does it mean? Like what does that mean for my investments? I think two things. Number one, the reason we talk about it is just to make sure people understand that not everything is perfect. ... But number two, does it mean you sell? In my opinion, no. If I if it if it means, you know, you want to take some chips off the table, I think that's totally fine. ... What it more broadly means to me is when we start to see the trend on corporate earnings go the opposite direction, aka earnings are not the best they've been since 2021. When we start to see this chart go down, that's when it should be the first sign that the actual economy is affecting the stock market because right now there's a lot of different nuances for why the stock market is not really feeling that type of pain.</p>

坦率地说，**分裂的经济**（Bifurcated economy: 指经济体中一部分表现强劲，而另一部分则表现疲软的现象）可能会在很长一段时间内成为新常态。我个人认为，AI正在以前所未有的方式改变行业。例如，有一家名为GMA的初创公司，为PowerPoint提供AI服务。他们刚刚以21亿美元的市值融资，年经常性收入达到1亿美元，而他们只有50名员工。我们生活在一个公司可以雇佣50人，每位员工平均创造200万美元收入，并在不到一年内从零增长到1亿美元的时代。这就是AI带来的变革。

<p class="english-text">Quite frankly, the bifurcated economy might be the new normal for a very long time. time. I mean, it's been the new normal basically for the past three years, ever since this bull market started and it might continue to be the new normal. So, I think it's just very important to keep up with what's happening here. I don't think it is a go short sell everything because I personally believe that the way AI is transforming industries is something that we've never seen before. And again, I'll go back to the example I shared a couple days ago. There's a startup call it AI for PowerPoints name is GMA. They just raised at a $2.1 billion market cap. They're doing a hundred million in ARR and they have 50 employees. I mean, we are living in a time where a company can have 50 people employed have $2 million average per employee and go from zero to 100 million in less than a year. Like that is happening because of AI.</p>

### 盘中动态与个股分析

Alex Karp在一次采访中说：“我目前正与做空者进行一场战斗，主要是因为他们可以去做空一些致癌公司，但他们偏偏要来做空这个国家乃至全世界按任何标准衡量都是最好的公司。顺便说一句，用我们的敌人来评判我们。看看谁恨我们。我的意思是，上网看看，看看谁恨Palantir，谁恨我，然后用那个标准来评判我们。基于那个标准，我们的市值应该是多少？”

我喜欢Karp的一点是，他把这看作是个人恩怨。他说：“我正在和做空者进行一场个人战斗。”任何其他CEO可能会说，“好吧，他们做空我们的股票，无所谓，这是市场的一部分。”但他却说：“不，我正在和这些混蛋战斗。”我喜欢这一点，因为他是在说，不要仅仅用传统的市销率或市盈率来评判我们的市值，而要从我们为客户创造了多少价值的角度来思考。

He's like, "Nope, I'm in a battle with these motherfers." And I love it because he's saying, "Don't judge our market cap from just like the conventional way of how you think about a price to sales or PE ratio. Think about it in the context of how much value we create for our clients and judge our market cap from that perspective versus other perspectives."</p>

在市场开盘后，AMD的走势非常强劲，其毛利率指引远超预期，股价上涨了7.25%。英伟达、亚马逊、Meta等也纷纷上涨。与此同时，有一种被称为**一月效应**（January effect: 一种市场现象，指股票，特别是小盘股，在一月份的回报率通常高于其他月份）的市场现象，即小盘股在一月份的回报率通常更高。这可能是因为投资者在12月为税务目的出售亏损股票，然后在1月买回，从而推高价格。
