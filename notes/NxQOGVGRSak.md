### 市场接近历史高点，“圣诞老人行情”可期？

大家早上好，欢迎回到“市场开盘”节目。今天是11月12日，星期三，我们正在直播。感谢各位的到来。

我们今天有很多内容要谈。盘前市场一片绿色，我的意思是，标普500指数在盘前距离历史高点只差不到半个百分点，这非常令人兴奋。英伟达股价在195美元，标普500指数在685点。要知道，上周五我们还在661点，而在10月份市场最艰难的时候，我们曾跌至647点。所以，现在能达到685点，离历史高点689点仅几美元之遥，确实非常激动人心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, November 12th. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about, folks. We got a green pre-market. And when I mean green, I mean we are less than half a percent away from all-time highs on this S&P 500 in the pre-market, which is very exciting to see. Nvidia right here at 195, S&P 500 at 685. Folks, we were at 661 last Friday and we were at 647 in the depths of October when things were getting rough. So, the fact that we are at 685, couple bucks away from 689, which is all-time highs, very exciting to see.</p>
</details>

这背后有一些宏观原因。我也认为我们正在接近所谓的**圣诞老人行情**（Santa Claus rally: 指每年最后五个交易日和新年头两个交易日期间，股市通常上涨的现象）。我不确定它具体会是什么样子，甚至不确定它是否会发生，但如果发生，很可能会在政府停摆结束后出现。参议院的共和党人和民主党人今天将进行投票，这次投票很可能最终结束政府停摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's some macro reasons why we're getting there. I also think we are getting close to this Santa Claus rally. I don't know exactly what it's going to look like. I don't know if it's even going to happen, but if it were to happen, it probably would take place at the end of a shutdown. The Republicans in the Senate and the Democrats are going to be voting today and that vote will likely culminate into the end of the shutdown.</p>
</details>

下周还有英伟达的财报。所以，政府停摆的结束、英伟达的财报，再加上普遍的年终追涨情绪，这些都可能引发这种行情。当然，我们整个市场经历了大量的剧烈波动。昨天是退伍军人节，债券市场休市，所以流动性不是很高。我们将看看今天市场开盘后的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have Nvidia earnings next week. So you have the end of the shutdown, Nvidia earnings and then general sort of end-of-year chasing that could lead to this type of rally. Now granted, we've had a ton of whipsaws across the entire board. Yesterday we had Veterans Day, so the bond markets were closed, so there wasn't that much liquidity. So we're going to see how the market ends up opening up today.</p>
</details>

### 市场广度改善与13F报告前瞻

总的来说，我认为昨天最令人兴奋的是，尽管英伟达下跌，许多数据中心概念股也下跌，但亚马逊和苹果却表现不错，标普500指数也是绿色的。所以，市场有很大一部分是红色的，比如数据中心、科技股、半导体，但金融股却上涨了。礼来公司（Eli Lilly）股价创下历史新高。医药股、防御性股票都有所上涨，市场出现了一定程度的普涨。我认为这对我们来说不是坏事，这种牛市的扩大实际上是积极的信号。如果这种势头今天能够延续，即使科技股没有大幅上涨——尽管盘前已经有所表现——那也不是什么坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the most exciting thing about yesterday is that Nvidia was down. You had a bunch of data center plays down. Amazon, Apple were kind of green. The S&P 500 was green. So, you had a large part of the market that was red. Data centers, tech, semiconductors, and you had financials that were up. Lily hit all-time highs. Pharmaceuticals, defensives, you had a little bit of a broadening, and I don't think that's the worst thing for us to see. As of this idea of actually being able to broaden out the bull market, the fact that it did happen yesterday is very positive signs. I mean, if that can compound and continue today, even if you don't have a massive move in tech, which you are seeing in the pre-market, then that would not be the worst thing in the world.</p>
</details>

我们有很多要谈论的话题。我认为**13F报告**（13F Report: 美国证券交易委员会(SEC)要求管理资产超过1亿美元的机构投资者每季度披露其持股情况的报告）今天会开始披露。我们还没有拿到，但今天或明天收盘后，我们应该会看到大量的13F和13G文件，届时我们将看到许多超级投资者在过去90天里做了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. 13Fs, I think, will start to get disclosed today. We don't have them yet. Either today or tomorrow after the close, we should get a decent amount of these 13Fs and 13Gs, and we're going to see what a lot of these super investors did over the past 90 days.</p>
</details>

我们确实收到了迈克尔·贝瑞先生的一条新推文，昨晚看到时相当惊讶。我们会讨论这个。他提前披露了信息，但最迟到周五，我们应该会得到很多细节，然后我们会看到人们买入和卖出的前三大股票是什么。记住，上个季度是联合健康（UNH）、亚马逊和谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have a new tweet from Mr. Michael Burry, which was quite surprising last night when I saw his tweet. So, we'll talk about that. He disclosed it early, but latest Friday, we should get a lot of details and then we're going to see what are the top three stocks that people bought and sold. Remember, last quarter it was UNH, Amazon, and Google.</p>
</details>

到目前为止，我们追踪的82份13F报告中只收到了大约7份。前三大买入的股票是Fiserv、Baxter International和联合健康（UNH），这其实不是最好的消息，因为Fiserv遭受了重创。联合健康则继续在列。第四是MetLife。然后是伯克希尔哈撒韦、台积电（TSM）、应用材料、Adobe和FIS（Fidelity National Information Services）。我们还有更多数据待公布，但目前这就是排名前三的股票。我们大概在接下来的48小时内就能看到这些13F报告的全貌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far, we got like seven out of the 82 13Fs that we're looking for. And the top three buys were Fiserv, Baxter International, and UNH, which actually is not the best thing because Fiserv got hit really bad. UNH continues to be there. And then Met is number four. Then you have Berkshire, TSM, Applied Materials, Adobe, and then FIS, Fidelity, National Information Services. So, we have a lot more data to come to see what that looks like. But right now, those are the top three. And we'll see coming soon, probably in literally the next 48 hours, what these 13Fs look like.</p>
</details>

### 经济刺激与关税政策新动向

好了，让我们进入正题。感谢大家的到来。我想我们先从今天早上我看到的核心头条新闻开始，然后再谈谈AMD，这是昨晚的一个大新闻，继续为数据中心板块提供了支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Thank you everybody for being here. I think we'll get started with the kind of core headline that I'm seeing this morning and then we'll get into AMD. That was a big piece of news last night, which continued to help the data center players.</p>
</details>

今天早上，一位白宫官员表示，我们一直在讨论的2000美元刺激支票是否真的会兑现。他引用说：“2000美元的退税将针对年收入低于10万美元的人，但具体方案尚未决定。”所以，这位官员今天早上确认，他们确实在考虑2000美元的退税。我想这会是一种刺激形式，对吧？无论是直接支票还是退税，如果你在这个国家年收入低于10万美元，你就能额外获得2000美元现金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what was said this morning, which again, we've been talking about, hey, is this $2,000 stimulus check actually coming through? It was said, quote, "A $2,000 rebate would be for those making less than $100,000, but it has not yet been decided." So, you got confirmation this morning, we are legitimately thinking of a $2,000 rebate. That would be, I imagine, a form of stimulus, right? Whether it's a direct check or whether it's a tax refund, if you're going to get an extra $2,000 cash, if you make less than $100,000 in this country, then there you go.</p>
</details>

他还说：“我们将在未来几天内公布对咖啡、香蕉和其他几种商品的大幅关税削减。”这与特朗普总统昨晚的说法是一致的。这里有一段他谈论降低关税的片段，在我看来，这要么是因为他们看到了需求减少，所以需要降低关税，要么是他们确实看到了成本上升，因此需要降低关税。但这与总统过去几天的想法是一致的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He also said, "We are going to unveil substantial tariff reductions over the coming days on coffee, bananas, and several other items." And that is consistent with what President Trump has said last night. Here's a clip of him talking about reducing tariffs, which in my opinion is based on either they're seeing less demand, so they need to reduce tariffs, or they are genuinely seeing higher costs, therefore they need to reduce tariffs. But it is consistent with what the president has been thinking about over the past couple of days.</p>
</details>

特朗普这里有几个非常有趣的关键点。第一，他说的和今天早上白宫官员说的一样，那就是他们将专注于降低一些关税。显然，像咖啡、香蕉等某些商品的价格可能开始变得过高，也许这就是他们考虑降低关税的原因。第二，再次提到这2000美元的“红利”，这一切都回到了可负担性（affordability）的问题上，无论是退税、刺激支票还是其他形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you got a couple key points here that is really interesting from Trump. Number one, he is saying the same thing that was said this morning, which is that we are going to be focusing on lowering some tariffs. Obviously, there's some certain prices on goods like coffee, bananas, etc. that are starting to potentially get too high and maybe that's why they're thinking of lowering tariffs. And number two, again, this $2,000 dividend, it all goes back down to this question of affordability, whether it's a rebate, a stimulus check, or what it looks like.</p>
</details>

今天早上白宫官员还表示，预计美国人民将在2026年第一和第二季度开始对经济感觉更好。此外，政府希望引进技术工人，为期3到7年，以培训美国人，然后他们可以回国。所以，他们在解决劳动力市场、关税、可负担性以及最终美国人将感受到的整体刺激等多个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing said this morning is that expect American people will start feeling better about the economy in Q1 and Q2 of 2026. And then number two, the administration wants to bring in skilled workers for 3 to seven years to train Americans and then they can go home. So, they're attacking a lot of different issues around the labor market, tariffs, affordability, and then the overall stimulus that Americans will eventually feel.</p>
</details>

我认为这一切都源于特朗普对最高法院案件的担忧，我们昨天谈到过，看起来情况对他不利。我不知道这会对经济产生什么影响。昨天的一个重大进展是，商品进口商在口头听证会上告诉最高法院，如果推翻关税，他们“非常容易”退还已收取的关税。这基本上消除了最高法院最大的担忧之一。这可能会显著影响他们对最终裁决的思考方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this all comes down to the fear that Trump has around the Supreme Court case, which we talked about yesterday, not looking like it's going to go in his favor. I don't know what's going to be the economic impact of it. The big update yesterday was that the importers of goods told the Supreme Court in an oral hearing that if you were to reverse the tariffs, it would be quote unquote very easy for us to pay back the tariffs that we have collected. Aka they took one of the biggest concerns from the Supreme Court off the table. That could again significantly influence the way they're thinking about the overall decision.</p>
</details>

政府停摆问题将在今晚7点进行投票。据彭博社报道，到东部时间晚上9点或10点左右，我们应该就能知道停摆是否结束。我认为这也是市场目前上涨的原因之一。坦率地说，这些政策对市场意味着什么？是利好。如果你要降低关税，市场从来就不喜欢关税，这是利好。如果你真的要给人们2000美元的退税，即使这会引发通胀，那也是以后要解决的问题。短期内，如果大量收入低于10万美元的人额外获得2000美元用于消费，这将极大地刺激经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government shutdown will be voted on tonight at 7 p.m. at least that's what Bloomberg is reporting and so by around I would say 9 or 10 p.m. US House majority leader said that the House will vote on the bill to the shutdown by Wednesday 7 p.m. Eastern. We should know probably around 9 or 10 p.m. Eastern if this shutdown is done. That is why I think the market is also running right now. And then quite frankly, what are the implications of what is being said on the market? It's bullish. I mean, if you're going to lower tariffs, the market never liked tariffs. That's bullish. And then if you're actually going to give a $2,000 rebate to people, even if it's inflationary, that's a problem for another day. But in the short term, it'd be pretty damn bullish if a bunch of people making under $100,000 got an extra 2,000 bucks that they can spend and it obviously would stimulate the economy.</p>
</details>

因此，我认为，考虑到我们即将讨论的围绕AI的宏观交易，以及关税红利和停摆结束的细节，现在做多市场并非最悲观的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think if people are thinking that this is a sell or this is a bull trap or you want to get out of the market, obviously taking profits going into the end of the year tax loss harvesting all that stuff is a personal decision but I think there is a shot that we end up getting this rally. Given the macro trade round AI that we're about to talk about and some of this tariff dividend details around the shutdown ending I don't think it's the most bearish to kind of be long this market right now.</p>
</details>

### AMD发布强劲增长预期，提振AI板块

话虽如此，让我们来谈谈AI。苏姿丰（Lisa Su）昨天确实让人们兴奋不已。她说了四件事：AI计算基础设施的需求依然很高；客户没有减少投资；他们预计未来5年年收入增长35%，数据中心业务增长超过80%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, let's get into AI. So, Lisa Su really got people excited yesterday. Four things she said. Demand for AI computing infrastructure remains high. Customers are not reducing their investments. They're projecting annual revenue growth of 35% over the next 5 years and data center growth exceeding 80%.</p>
</details>

该股在盘前上涨的原因并非收入目标，尽管这些目标非常可观，而是他们的毛利率。这在昨天盘后披露，这也是为什么你看到股价上涨了4%，并带动了其他数据中心概念股。他们给出的毛利率增长指引相当强劲，大约在55%到58%之间，而华尔街的预期是51%到53%。这额外的3.5%毛利率，考虑到AMD销售的硬件数量，是相当可观的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason why the stock is up in the pre-market is not because of the revenue targets, which are really substantial and nice to see that they're thinking of growing 35% over the next 5 years. The main reason is their gross margins apparently. And this was disclosed yesterday after hours, which is why you saw that 4% bump and it helped a lot of the other data center plays. They're guiding for some pretty strong gross margin growth. I believe it's around 55 to 58%. The street thought it was going to be 51 to 53%. That extra three and a half% on gross margins is substantial given the amount of hardware that AMD is selling.</p>
</details>

结果，人们变得兴奋起来。Melius将AMD目标价从300美元上调至380美元，称“利润率指引是真正的积极惊喜。35%的收入增长意味着在AI半导体和网络领域占据两位数的市场份额。AMD似乎明确地以1万亿美元市值为目标。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, you got people excited. Melius 380 by AMD. The margin guide was the real positive surprise. 35% revenue growth cracks a double digit share in AI semis and networking. AMD seems to clearly be targeting a $1 trillion market cap with these aspirations. That would be more than a 2x from here. We are raising our estimates and target 380 from 300.</p>
</details>

苏姿丰在分析师日上谈到这些预测时表示：“我们正处在一个惊人的技术周期中，尤其是在AI领域。市场的加速速度是我们过去几年才意识到的。几年前我们认为AI加速器市场可能是3000亿美元，这听起来是个很大的数字。现在我们回过头看，我们看到了一个巨大的机会，到2030年，整体市场规模将超过一万亿美元。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's Lisa Su this morning speaking about those projections she gave yesterday at the analyst day. "We're in just an amazing cycle for technology and specifically around AI. The market is accelerating at a pace that we just did not understand until over the last few years. I think we started a couple of years ago we thought the AI accelerator town might be $300 billion and that sounded like a really big number. And then each year we took it up and now when we take a step back, we see this massive opportunity, really over a trillion dollar overall market as we get through 2030."</p>
</details>

当被问及为何对需求如此有信心时，她回答说：“我们与全球所有最大的**超大规模数据中心运营商**（Hyperscalers: 指像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样运营着庞大规模数据中心的公司）和最大的企业合作。在过去12个月里，我们看到每一位大客户都说他们现在看到了拐点。因为人们现在开始从AI用例中获得真正的生产力提升。所有最大的超大规模数据中心运营商都表示他们正在增加**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure, Capex: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产（如设备、技术或新建筑）的资金），因为他们能看到另一端的回报。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Well, we spend a lot of time in the ecosystem. We work with all of the largest hyperscalers in the world, all of the largest enterprises. And if I tell you what we've seen in the last 12 months, we've seen every one of our largest customers say we can see the inflection point now Lisa. Like we can see demand is accelerating because people are now starting to get real productivity out of the AI use cases and you know we have all of the largest hyperscalers in the world saying they're investing more in capex because they can see the return on the other side of it. So the signals in the market right now say that we're still at the very beginning of the technology but you're starting to see significant productivity."</p>
</details>

### 迈克尔·贝瑞的“世纪大空头 2.0”？

那么，是谁在对这一切表示怀疑？是谁在说苏姿丰刚才说的一切都是无稽之谈，根本不会实现？不是别人，正是迈克尔·贝瑞先生。昨晚，我心血来潮想重温电影**《大空头》**（The Big Short: 一部描述2008年金融危机前少数投资者做空房地产市场的电影和书籍，主角原型之一就是迈克尔·贝瑞）。然后我就看到了这条推文。这是一张克里斯蒂安·贝尔在《大空头》中扮演迈克尔·贝瑞的照片，配文是：“那时的我，现在的我。哦好吧，它成功了。它将会成功。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now who is calling BS on all of this who is saying that everything Lisa Sue just said is nonsense none of it's real and it's not going to pan out in the way that they're projecting? It is none other than Mr. Michael Burry. Last night I said, "You know what? I want to watch the big short." And then I see this tweet pop up and this is a picture of Christian Bale from The Big Short who played Michael Burry. The caption is me then, me now. Oh well, it worked out. It will work out.</p>
</details>

这张照片的场景是贝瑞在做空房地产泡沫的过程中，因为市场不理解即将发生的事情而感到极度烦躁。他当时做空亏损了130%，最终才成功。他用这张图暗示，过去他被看作是傻瓜，但最终被证明是天才，现在可能也是同样的情况，最终会成功的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a picture when Burry basically in the middle of his short on the housing bubble kind of just decided to lay down because he was so annoyed that the market didn't understand what was about to happen. And again, he had to have that short on for two he was down like 130% of the short before it finally worked out. The fact that he posted this to imply that it will work out, like, oh, it worked out in the past. I was seen as the idiot for two years and then eventually I was seen as the genius and now it's probably the same thing but eventually it's going to work out.</p>
</details>

在我看来，他发布这张照片和配文，意味着他开始对这笔交易感到害怕。如果你对做空英伟达、做空Palantir，怀疑苏姿丰和黄仁勋所说的一切都那么有信心，你就不会说任何话。你会持有你的空头头寸，过你的日子。你之所以想为做空吸引注意力，是因为你认为它有可能对你不利，你试图让其他人也加入你的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that he posted that picture with that caption to me means that he's getting scared of this trade. Because if you are so confident that shorting Nvidia and shorting Palantir and doubting Lisa Su and Jensen Huang about everything that's going on, then you would just not say anything. You would have your short position and you would go about your day. For you to want to get attention for being short means that you think there's a chance it goes against you and you are trying to get other people to pile into the trade with you.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，他的个人简介也变了，写着“《卡珊德拉解放》11月25日发布”（Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th）。这听起来像是一本书。所以，他可能是在为新书造势。但无论如何，我认为这对多头来说其实是利好。你需要一堵“忧虑之墙”。贝瑞让更多人看空，这实际上是好事。你得到的看空情绪越多，如果盈利能跟上，我们可能涨得越高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even his bio, he's like, "Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th." Dude, tell me that's not a book. So, the broader point is here. I think he's crashing out. He's upset about the way the short is going. Or he's launching a book. Again, I think it's bullish. You need a wall of worry. Burry making more people bearish I think is actually really good. And the more bearishness you get likely means the higher we can go if earnings can keep up with that picture.</p>
</details>

### 深入剖析“分化经济”

让我们来谈谈**分化经济**（Bifurcated Economy: 指经济体中不同部分表现出截然不同趋势的现象，例如高收入群体消费强劲而低收入群体处境艰难）。首先，谷歌趋势显示，搜索“第二份工作”的人数在两天前达到了历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's do our segment on the bifurcated economy. First of all, take a look at this. Searches for second job have reached an all-time high as of two days ago, as per Google trends.</p>
</details>

其次，房利美（Fannie Mae）正准备取消其620分的最低信用分要求。抵押贷款巨头将使用其自身的风险因素分析。这不禁让人想起2008年的情况，当时就是向无力负担的人发放有问题的抵押贷款。当时还涉及到金融工程，比如那些包含层层债券的合成**CDO**（Collateralized Debt Obligations, 担保债务凭证: 一种复杂的结构性金融产品，它将各种债务打包成资产池，并根据风险分层出售给投资者，是2008年金融危机的核心），最终导致了我们见过的最大泡沫之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing that's really important to understand around this bifurcated economy is what Fannie Mae is thinking about. Fannie Mae is set to drop its 620 credit score minimum. The mortgage giant will use its own analysis of risk factors. You know what caused 2008? Giving faulty mortgages to people that couldn't afford them. And then you get into the whole financial engineering of these synthetically designed CDOs that had bonds inside of bonds inside of bonds, and that ended up leading to just one of the biggest bubbles we've ever seen.</p>
</details>

但分化的另一面是什么呢？是美国企业盈利增长正在蓬勃发展。到目前为止，标普500公司的盈利是自2021年第三季度以来最高的。罗素3000指数的利润中位数同比增长11%。近80%已公布财报的公司平均超出盈利预期8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, what's the bifurcation? Well, the bifurcation is that US corporate earnings growth is booming. The S&P 500 so far has put up earnings that are the highest since Q3 of 2021. The medium profit growth in the Russell 3000 hit 11% year-over-year, that's the highest from Q3 2021. Almost 80% of the companies that have reported so far have beat earnings by an average of 8%.</p>
</details>

所以，你看到房利美在考虑给信用评级差的人贷款，你看到人们在谷歌上搜索第二份工作达到历史新高。但同时，你又看到企业盈利是有史以来最好的。这种二分法，这种分化，引出了一个问题：当这些盈利可能因劳动力市场而下降时会发生什么？或者，如果我们真的陷入非常糟糕的经济，降息是否足以拯救股市？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're seeing Fannie Mae think that we need to give loans to people that can't qualify for loans because their credit rating is bad. You're seeing searches for a second job at an all-time high on Google. But then you're seeing corporate earnings being the best it's ever been. The dichotomy here, the bifurcation here is what's going to happen when these earnings decline potentially based on the labor market? Or if we do get a really bad economy, will the rate cuts be enough to save the stock market?</p>

美国银行的一位分析师通过对7000万消费者的信贷和借记卡支出进行分析，也证实了这一点。她指出，消费支出增长主要是由高收入家庭推动的。低收入家庭的支出仍在增长，但速度远低于高收入家庭。在高价商品如机票、住宿和家具方面，差距最大，这主要是因为低收入消费者在缩减开支。

<p class="english-text">Here is one of the analysts at Bank of America that takes a hard look at a lot of the credit and debit spending through 70 million consumers. It's the higher income households that are really driving the spending. At the lower end, spending is still growing. Last month it was up 7/10. Higher income spending though was up almost four times that at 2.7. Where we're seeing the biggest gaps are in bigger ticket items in airlines in lodging in furniture. It's not that the higher income is really spending a lot more. It's that lower income is pulling back.</p>

### 投资启示与AI的变革力量

那么，这对投资者意味着什么？我认为有两点。第一，我们谈论它是为了确保人们明白并非一切都完美无瑕。第二，这是否意味着你应该卖出？在我看来，不是。对我来说，更广泛的意义在于，当我们开始看到企业盈利的趋势朝相反方向发展时，那才是经济真正影响股市的第一个信号。

<p class="english-text">The takeaway for investors, I know a lot of people might be saying, what does it mean for my investments? I think two things. Number one, the reason we talk about it is just to make sure people understand that not everything is perfect. But number two, does it mean you sell? In my opinion, no. What it more broadly means to me is when we start to see the trend on corporate earnings go the opposite direction, that's when it should be the a first sign that the actual economy is affecting the stock market.</p>

坦率地说，这种分化经济可能在很长一段时间内成为新常态。我个人相信，AI正在以我们前所未见的方式改变行业。举个例子，有一家名为Glean的AI制作PPT的初创公司，刚刚以21亿美元的市值融资。他们的**年经常性收入**（Annual Recurring Revenue, ARR: 衡量订阅业务健康状况的关键指标，表示每年从客户那里获得的经常性收入总额）达到1亿美元，却只有50名员工。我们正生活在一个公司可以用50名员工，实现人均200万美元的收入，并在不到一年的时间里从零增长到1亿美元的时代。这就是AI带来的变革。

<p class="english-text">Quite frankly, the bifurcated economy might be the new normal for a very long time. I personally believe that the way AI is transforming industries is something that we've never seen before. There's a startup call it AI for PowerPoints name is Glean. They just raised at a $2.1 billion market cap. They're doing a hundred million in ARR and they have 50 employees. I mean, we are living in a time where a company can have 50 people employed have $2 million average per employee and go from zero to 100 million in less than a year. Like that is happening because of AI.</p>

### Palantir CEO 的“战争”与市场开盘

Palantir的CEO亚历克斯·卡普（Alex Karp）在最近的采访中也展现了极大的信心。他表示：“我目前正与做空者进行一场战斗。他们本可以去做空一些致癌的公司，但他们却非要做空这个国家乃至全世界按任何标准衡量都是最好的公司。看看谁恨我们，就凭这个标准来评判我们。”

<p class="english-text">Here's another one of Karp speaking about why he's in a war with these short sellers. "I'm currently in a battle with, you know, short sellers primarily because they could go short some carcinogenic company, but they have to short arguably the best company in this country and in the world by any metric. And by the way, judge us by our enemies. Look who hates us."</p>

我喜欢卡普的一点是，他把这看作是个人恩怨。他说：“我正在与做空者进行一场个人战斗。”任何其他CEO可能会说，这是市场的一部分。但他不，他把它看得很重。这表明他对公司投入了多少，以及他在情感上多么在乎胜利的过程。

<p class="english-text">One of the things I love about Karp is that he takes it personally dude. He takes it personally. Look at what he said. He said I am in a personal battle with short sellers right now. I love that a CEO that I'm invested in takes it so seriously and actually wants to prove everyone wrong because I think it just goes to show how much he's invested in the company and how much he emotionally cares about the process of winning.</p>
