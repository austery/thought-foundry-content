title: 标普500逼近历史新高，AMD发布超预期指引，而“大空头”原型Michael Burry为何愈发不安？
summary: 市场情绪高涨，标普500指数在盘前交易中距离历史高点仅一步之遥，部分归因于对“圣诞老人行情”的预期。AMD发布了未来五年35%的年收入增长预测，提振了半导体板块。然而，并非所有人都持乐观态度，“大空头”原型Michael Burry通过社交媒体暗示，当前的市场狂热与2008年金融危机前夕有相似之处。与此同时，美国经济呈现出明显的“分叉”现象：企业盈利创下新高，而低收入群体正面临越来越大的生活压力，特朗普政府正试图通过关税股息等政策应对“可负担性”问题。

### 市场概览：标普500逼近历史新高

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是11月12日，星期三。感谢各位的到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, November 12th. Thank you everybody for being here.</p>
</details>

坦白说，我每天的一大乐趣就是在开播前一分钟，阅读你们评论我为什么迟到的留言。我无法形容其中一些评论有多好笑，说我在用Grindr，在看牙医，或者干别的什么。你们总能想出新理由来解释我为什么会迟到一分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, one of the highlights of my day, legitimately, one of the highlights of my day, and quite frankly, I I blame you guys for this for making this a highlight, and you're not really uh helping incentivize me to be early, is reading the comments a minute before I'm supposed to start about why I'm late. I mean, I cannot explain how hilarious some of these he's on Grinder, he's with the dentist, he's with this, and it's like it's it's like you find a new way to figure out why I'm one minute late.</p>
</details>

但我们现在已经就位，开始直播了。感谢大家。今天有很多内容要聊。盘前市场一片绿色。我说的绿色，是指标普500指数在盘前交易中距离历史高点不到半个百分点，这非常令人兴奋。英伟达股价在195美元，标普500指数在685点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we're here. We're live. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about, folks. We got a green pre-market. And when I mean green, I mean I mean we are less than half a percent away from alltime highs on this S&P 500 in the pre-market, which is very exciting to see. Nvidia right here at 195, S&P 500 at 685.</p>
</details>

要知道，上周五我们还在661点，而在10月份市场最糟糕的时候，我们曾跌至647点。所以，现在能达到685点，距离历史高点689点仅几美元之遥，这确实令人振奋。这背后有一些宏观原因。我也认为我们正在接近所谓的**圣诞老人行情**（Santa Claus rally：指每年最后五个交易日和次年头两个交易日期间，股市通常表现强劲的现象）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Folks, we were at 661 last Friday and uh we were at 647 in the depths of October when things were getting rough. So, the fact that we are at 685, couple bucks away from 689, which is alltime highs, very exciting to see. There's some macro reasons why we're getting there. I also think we are getting close to this Santa Claus rally.</p>
</details>

我不知道它具体会是什么样子，甚至不确定它是否会发生，但如果真的发生，很可能会在政府关门结束后出现。参议院的共和党人和民主党人今天将进行投票，这次投票很可能最终结束政府关门。下周还有英伟达的财报。所以，政府关门结束、英伟达财报，再加上普遍的年终追涨情绪，都可能引发这类行情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know exactly what it's going to look like. I don't know if it's even going to happen, but if it were to happen, it probably would take place at the end of a shutdown. The Republicans in the Senate and the Democrats are going to be voting uh today and that vote will likely culminate into the end of the shutdown. We have Nvidia earnings next week. So you have the end of the shutdown, Nvidia earnings and then general sort of endofear chasing that could lead to this type of rally.</p>
</details>

当然，我们整个市场经历了大量的剧烈波动。昨天是退伍军人节，债券市场休市，所以流动性不强。我们得看看今天市场开盘后的情况。但总的来说，我认为昨天最令人兴奋的是，英伟达下跌了。许多数据中心概念股也下跌了。亚马逊、苹果则略微上涨。标普500指数是上涨的。所以，市场有很大一部分是下跌的，包括数据中心、科技股、半导体，而金融股却上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, we've had ton of we have had a ton of whipsaws across the entire board. Yesterday we uh had Veterans Day, so the bond markets were closed, so there wasn't that much liquidity. So we're going to see how the market ends up opening up today. But overall, I think the most exciting thing about yesterday is that Nvidia was down. You had a bunch a bunch of data center plays down. Amazon, Apple were kind of green. The S&P 500 was green. So, you had a large part of the market that was red. Data centers, tech, semiconductors, and you had financials that were up.</p>
</details>

礼来公司（Eli Lilly）股价创下历史新高。医药股、防御性股票都有所表现，市场出现了一定程度的普涨。我认为这对我们来说不是坏事，尤其是在真正拓宽牛市范围这个想法上。昨天发生的这种情况是非常积极的信号。如果这种势头今天能够延续，即使科技股没有大幅上涨——尽管盘前交易中你确实看到了科技股的强势，比如Palantir在191.60美元，Robinhood在133美元——那也不是什么坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lily hit all-time highs. Um, pharmaceuticals, defensives, you had a little bit of a broadening, and I don't think that's the worst thing for us to see. Uh, as of, you know, this idea in terms of this idea of actually being able to broaden out the bull market, but the fact that it did happen yesterday is very positive signs. I mean, if that can compound and continue today, even if you don't have a massive move in tech, which you are seeing in the pre-market pound right there, 19160, Robin at 133, then that would not be the worst thing in the world.</p>
</details>

### 宏观动态：13F报告、特朗普经济政策与政府关门

我们有很多要谈论和深入探讨的话题。我认为**13F**（13F报告：美国证券交易委员会规定，管理超过1亿美元资产的机构投资者需在每季度结束后45天内披露其持仓）报告今天会开始披露。我们还没拿到，但今天或明天收盘后，我们应该会看到大量13F和13G报告，届时我们就能知道许多超级投资者在过去90天里做了些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. 13Fs, I think, will start to get disclosed today. Uh, we don't have them yet. Either today or tomorrow after the close, we should get a decent amount of these 13Fs and 13Gs, and we're going to see what a lot of these super investors did over the past 90 days.</p>
</details>

我们确实收到了Michael Burry先生的一条新推文，昨晚我看到时相当惊讶。他提前披露了信息。但最迟到周五，我们应该会得到很多细节，然后我们就能看到人们买入和卖出最多的前三只股票是什么。记住，上个季度是联合健康（UNH）、亚马逊和谷歌。所以，这些股票中有相当一部分现在正在被追捧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have a new tweet from Mr. from Michael Bur, which was quite surprising last night when I uh saw his tweet. So, we'll talk about that. He disclosed it early, but latest Friday, we should get a lot of details and then we're going to see what are the top three stocks that people bought and sold. Remember, last quarter it was UNH, Amazon, and Google. So, you had a decent chunk of uh those names getting bid up right now.</p>
</details>

到目前为止我们收到了多少份报告？在我们关注的82份13F报告中，目前收到了大约7份。买入最多的前三名是Fiserv、Baxter International和联合健康（UNH），这其实不是什么好事，因为Fiserv遭受了重创。联合健康则继续在列。第四名是MetLife。然后是伯克希尔哈撒韦、台积电（TSM）、应用材料、Adobe，以及FIS（Fidelity National Information Services）。我们还有更多数据有待公布，但目前这就是排名前三的股票。我们很快，可能就在接下来的48小时内，就会看到这些13F报告的全貌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many did we get so far? So far, we got like seven out of the 82 13Fs that we're looking for. And the top three buys were Fiserve, Baxter International, and UNH, which actually is not the best thing because Fiser got hit really bad. UNH continues to be there. And then Met is number four. Then you have Birchar, TSM, Applied Materials, um, Adobe, and then FIS, Fidelity, National Information Services. So, we have a lot more data to come to see what that looks like. But right now, those are the top three. And we'll see coming soon, probably in literally the next 48 hours, what these 13 apps look like.</p>
</details>

好的，让我们进入正题。感谢大家来到这里。我想我们先从今天早上我看到的核心头条新闻开始，然后再谈谈AMD。昨晚AMD的消息很重要，它继续为数据中心板块提供了支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Thank you everybody for being here. I think we'll get started with the kind of core headline that I'm seeing this morning and then we'll get into AMD. That was a big piece of news last night, which continued to help the data center players.</p>
</details>

这是今天早上Basen的言论，我们一直在讨论，那2000美元的刺激支票真的会兑现吗？Bent引用说：“2000美元的退税将提供给收入低于10万美元的人，但这尚未最终决定。”所以，Bent今早确认，他们确实在考虑2000美元的退税。我想这会是一种刺激措施，对吧？无论是直接支票还是退税，如果你在这个国家收入低于10万美元，就能额外获得2000美元现金，那你就会以某种方式把它花掉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what Basen said this morning, which again, we've been talking about, hey, is this $2,000 steamy check actually coming through? Bent said, quote, "A $2,000 rebate would be for those making less than $100,000, but it has not yet been decided." So, you got Bent confirming this morning, we are legitimately thinking of a $2,000 rebate. That would be, I imagine, a form of stimulus, right? Whether it's a direct check or whether it's a tax refund, if you're going to get an extra $2,000 cash, if you make less than uh 4,000 or $100,000 in this country, I mean, then there you go. that's an extra 2,000 bucks that you're going to be using in some way.</p>
</details>

现在，如果它不是支票，而是一种退税形式，问题就变成了政府、鲍威尔和美联储如何看待它。但无论如何，特朗普似乎对那2000美元的“关税股息”是认真的。他还说：“我们将在未来几天公布对咖啡、香蕉和其他几种商品的大幅关税削减。”这与特朗普总统昨晚所说的相符。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, again, if it's not a check, but it's a form of rebate, the question simply becomes how the government sort of thinks of it, how JPAL thinks of it, how the Fed thinks of it. But nonetheless, it does seem like Trump was serious about that $2,000 tariff dividend. He also said, "We are going to unveil substantial tariff reductions over the coming days on coffee, bananas, and several other items." And that is consistent with what President Trump has said last night.</p>
</details>

这里有一段他谈论降低关税的片段。在我看来，这要么是因为他们看到了需求减少，所以需要降低关税；要么是他们确实看到了成本上升，因此需要降低关税。但这与总统过去几天的想法是一致的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's a clip of him talking about reducing tariffs, which in my opinion is based on either they're seeing less demand, so they need to reduce tariffs, or they are genuinely seeing higher costs, therefore they need to reduce tariffs. But it is consistent with what the president has been thinking about over the past couple days.</p>
</details>

（视频片段中特朗普讲话）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wouldn't want to say because that gives that person an immediate boost. It's like when they say, "Are you going to attack Venezuela? Are you going to attack this one? Are you going to attack?" >> See, I'm not going to tell you whether or not I am. So I don't want to really give you but I think this we are doing phenomenally well. This is the greatest economy we've ever had. They're talking points. Oh, course. By the way, the only thing is beef. Beef. >> Coffee >> is a little high because the ranchers are doing great. Coffee. Coffee. We're going to lower some tariffs. We're going to have some coffee come in. Um we're going to take care of all the stuff very quickly, very easily. It's surgical. It's beautiful to watch. But our costs are way lower. Now, Walmart came out with a statement that they do every year for many, many decades, and they said that a Thanksgiving meal cost 25% less this Thanksgiving coming up, think of that, than it did last Thanksgiving under Sleepy Joe Biden. That's a 25% reduction. I think that's right. And if you remember when I first came in, the first two days I had a news conference, eggs, they were hitting me with eggs. Eggs had quadrupled in price and they're screaming at me. I just got here. I didn't know about eggs. And Brooke Rollins, our agricultural commissioner, did a secretary did a great job. And now eggs are what they were. We got eggs down. We get it all down. But our prices is much are much lower. Their line is price is affordability. That's the new word, affordability. It's much less expensive under Trump. And you'll and I haven't been here long. Nine months is not a long time. But look at what I've done to energy. Look at the price of gasoline. Going from$450 to$ 250 or 270. It's going to be $2 gasoline. >> People want affordable. >> Well, the economy is my thing. And we have the greatest economy in history. >> Are Republicans not selling it enough for >> the Republicans don't talk about it. >> Yeah. So, they need to do a better job on Capitol Hill. >> The Democrats.</p>
</details>

从特朗普的讲话中可以得出几个非常有趣的关键点。第一，他说的和今天早上Bentsen说的一样，即他们将专注于降低一些关税。显然，像咖啡、香蕉等某些商品的价格可能开始变得过高，这或许是他们考虑降低关税的原因，他们也意识到对这类商品征收这些关税没有任何意义。第二，这2000美元的股息，最终都回到了“可负担性”这个问题上，无论是退税、刺激支票还是其他形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, you got a couple key points here that is really interesting from Trump. Number one, he is saying the same thing that Bes said this morning, which is that we are going to be focusing on lowering some tariffs. Obviously, there's some certain prices on uh goods like coffee, bananas, etc. that are starting to potentially get too high and maybe that's why they're thinking of lowering tariffs and you know, they're just realizing it doesn't make any sense for us to have these types of tariffs on these types of goods. And number two, again, this $2,000 dividend, it all goes back down to this question of affordability, whether it's a rebate, a stimulus check, or what it looks like.</p>
</details>

Bentsen今天早上还说了另一件事，他预计美国人民将在2026年第一和第二季度开始对经济感觉更好。其次，他（指政府）希望引进技术工人，为期3到7年，来培训美国人，然后他们可以回国。所以，他们在解决劳动力市场、关税、可负担性等多个问题，以及最终美国人将感受到的整体刺激措施，无论是通过支票还是通过关税退税，以及这对美国人民应有的实际影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the other thing Bent said this morning is that expect American people will start feeling better about the economy in Q1 and Q2 of 2026. And then number two, I want to bring in or you I being the the administration want to bring in skilled workers for 3 to seven years to train Americans and then they can go home. So, they're attacking a lot of different issues around the labor market, tariffs, affordability, and then the overall stimulus that Americans will eventually feel, whether it's through a check or whether it's through a rebate when it comes through uh when it comes to the tariffs and, you know, the actual impact it should have on the American people.</p>
</details>

我认为这一切都源于特朗普对最高法院案件的担忧，我们昨天谈到过，看起来结果对他不利。我不知道这会对经济产生什么影响。昨天的一大进展是，商品进口商在口头听证会上告诉最高法院，如果推翻关税，他们“非常容易”退还已收取的关税。也就是说，他们消除了最高法院最大的担忧之一。我原以为最高法院会说，“嘿，退还数千亿美元会非常困难。”而昨天来到最高法院的进口商们却说：“不，没那么难。就像按一个按钮一样，我们已经准备好了文件。”昨天听到这个消息真是令人难以置信，这可能再次显著影响他们对最终裁决的思考方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this all comes down to the fear that Trump has around the Supreme Court case, which we talked about yesterday, not looking like it's going to go in his favor. I don't know what's going to be the economic impact of it. The big update yesterday was that the importers of goods told the Supreme Court in an oral hearing that if you were to reverse the tariffs, it would be quote unquote very easy for us to pay back the tariffs that we have collected. Aka they they they took one of the biggest concerns from the Supreme Court off the table, which I thought the Supreme Court would say, "Hey, it's going to be really hard to like refund hundreds of billions of dollars." And the importers that came to the Supreme Court yesterday, they were like, "No, it's not that hard. It's just like one button. We press it and we have the paperwork ready." It's like so it it it was quite incredible hearing that yesterday and you know that could again significantly influence the way they're thinking about the overall decision for how it's going to go.</p>
</details>

据彭博社报道，关于政府关门的投票将于今晚7点进行。因此，大约在晚上9点或10点，美国众议院多数党领袖表示，众议院将在周三晚上7点东部时间对结束关门的法案进行投票。我们大概在东部时间晚上9点或10点就能知道这次关门是否结束。我认为这也是市场目前上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the government shutdown will be voted on uh tonight at 7 p.m. at least that's what Bloomberg is reporting and so by around I would say 9 or 10 p.m. US House majority leader said that the House will vote on the bill to the shutdown by Wednesday 7 p.m. Eastern. We should know probably around 9 or 10 p.m. Eastern if this shutdown is done. That is why I think the market is also running right now.</p>
</details>

坦率地说，这些言论对市场意味着什么？是利好。如果你要降低关税，市场从来就不喜欢关税，所以这是利好。然后，如果你真的给人们2000美元的退税，即使这会引发通胀，那也是以后要解决的问题。但在短期内，如果大量收入低于10万美元的人能额外得到2000美元用于消费，那将是相当大的利好，并且显然会刺激经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then quite frankly, what are the implications of what the scent is saying on the market? It's bullish. I mean, if you're going to lower tariffs, the market never liked tariffs. That's bullish. And then if you're actually going to give a $2,000 rebate to people, even if it's inflationary, that's a problem for another day. Uh but in the short term, it'd be pretty damn bullish if a bunch of people making under $100,000 got an extra 2,000 bucks that they can spend and it obviously would stimulate the economy.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，如果人们认为这是一个卖出信号或是牛市陷阱，或者你想离场——当然，在年底前获利了结、进行税损收割等都是个人决定——但我认为我们很有可能迎来这波反弹。这波反弹会到695点吗？会到7000点、7200点吗？还是在680到685之间震荡？没人知道。但考虑到我们即将讨论的围绕人工智能的宏观交易，以及一些关于关税股息和政府关门结束的细节，我认为现在做多这个市场并不是最悲观的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think if people are thinking that this is a sell or this is a bull trap or you want to get out of the market obviously taking profits going into the end of the year tax loss harvesting all that stuff is a personal decision but I think there is a shot that we end up getting this rally is that rally to 695 is it to 7,000 7200 is it oscillating between 680 and 685 no one knows but given the macro trade round AI that we're about to talk about and some of this uh tariff dividend details around the shutdown ending I don't think it's the most bearish to kind of be long this market right now.</p>

### AI行业风向标：AMD发布强劲增长预测

话虽如此，让我们来谈谈人工智能。苏姿丰（Lisa Su）昨天确实让人们兴奋不已。她说了四件事：人工智能计算基础设施的需求依然很高；客户没有减少投资；他们预计未来5年年收入增长35%，数据中心业务增长超过80%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, let's get into AI. So, Lisa Sue really got people excited yesterday. Four things she said. Demand for AI computing infrastructure remains high. Customers are not reducing their investments. They're projecting annual revenue growth of 35% over the next 5 years and data center growth exceeding 80%.</p>
</details>

现在，该股在盘前上涨的原因并非其收入目标——尽管这些目标非常可观，看到他们计划在未来5年增长35%也很不错。AMD股价目前为252美元，上周曾跌至224美元。上涨的主要原因显然是他们的毛利率。这是在昨天盘后披露的，所以你看到了4%的涨幅，并带动了许多其他数据中心概念股。他们给出的毛利率增长指引相当强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason why the stock is up in the pre-market is not because of the revenue targets, which are really substantial and nice to see that they're thinking of growing 35% over the next 5 years. 252 on AMD. Again, it got to 224 last week. Um, the main reason is their gross margins apparently. And this was disclosed yesterday after hours, which is why you saw that 4% bump and it helped a lot of the other data center plays.</p>
</details>

我相信大约在55%到58%之间。而市场普遍预期是51%到53%。这额外的3.5%毛利率，考虑到AMD销售的硬件数量，是非常可观的。结果，人们都兴奋起来了。Melius将AMD目标价上调至380美元，并表示：“利润率指引是真正的积极惊喜。35%的收入增长意味着在人工智能半导体和网络领域占据两位数的市场份额。AMD似乎明确地以1万亿美元市值为目标。这将是目前市值的两倍多，尽管要实现这一目标还需要大量的执行和开放AI资金。10%的份额似乎是现实的。我们正在上调我们的估计和目标价，从300美元上调至380美元。”这显然也帮助了昨天 struggling 的整个半导体行业以及数据中心概念股。当AMD说我们未来5年将增长35%时，这无疑是个好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, they're guiding for some pretty strong gross margin growth. Uh, I believe it's around 55 to 58%. The street thought it was going to be 51 to 53%. That extra three and a half% on uh, gross margins is substantial given the amount of hardware that AMD is selling. And as a result, you got people excited. Uh Melius 380 by AMD. The margin guide was the real positive surprise. 35% revenue growth cracks a double digit share in AI semis and networking. AMD seems to clearly be targeting a $1 trillion market cap with these aspirations. That would be more than a 2x from here. Although there's a lot of execution and open AI funding needed to get there. A share of 10% seems realistic. We are raising our estimates and target 380 from 300. And obviously that helped the entire semiconductor se sector that was struggling yesterday along with the data center plays. when you have an AMD saying that we're going to grow 35% over the next 5 years.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's great to see you too. Last week you had earnings that came out that uh beat all expectations and yet the stock actually declined. I think people were waiting to see what you said at the investor day. They liked what they heard especially when it came to the revenue the annualized growth that you're expecting 35%. I think most people were looking for closer to 30%. Um, predictions are hard though, especially about the future. And I guess the big question is what makes you so confident? >> Well, you know, first of all, it was a great day yesterday. It's always nice to sometimes take a step back from just, you know, what's happening on a quarterly basis to really talk about long-term strategy. And it has been, you know, as you said, it's been three years since we've hosted an analyst day. But what we thought is like there's been so much that's changed in the market just over the last you know 12 18 24 months that we kind of needed to kind of just take a step back and talk about the company as a whole and frankly I mean we're in just an amazing cycle um for you know technology and spec specifically around AI. So you know back to you know the major points I mean the the market is accelerating at a pace that we you know just did not understand until uh you know over the last few years. Um I think we started a couple of years ago we thought you know the AI accelerator town might be you know $300 billion and that sounded like a really big number. Um and then each year we took it up and now when we take a step back you know we see this massive opportunity um you know really uh over a trillion dollar um you know overall market as we get through 2030. Um and it's a place where everybody needs technology. You know, think about it as you can think about computing as equating to intelligence. And if you can get more intelligence, why wouldn't you want more computing? And that's kind of the market that we're in. And so, um, you know, from that standpoint, um, you know, we're really excited about what we have. It's a product portfolio. It's a set of partnerships. Um, but it's also a vision for, you know, where computing is going in the future. >> What What makes you so sure of that demand? What do you see that makes you think not only that this demand is going to be big, but that it's real and that it's not going to disappear? >> Well, uh, you know, Becky, we spend a lot of time, um, in the ecosystem and, you know, being in this industry for as long as I've been in this industry over 30 years, I think you see a lot of cycles and you see, you know, a lot of technologies take off. Um, the key is, uh, what people are saying as they're actually utilizing the technology. So we work with all of the largest hyperscalers in the world, all of the largest enterprises. And if you looked at, you know, sort of the AI trajectory over the last couple of years, I think people started with tremendous excitement. You know, chat GPT came on board. Everyone was like, "Wow, you know, this is pretty good." Um, and then enterprises started using it and and frankly, uh, the early enterprise usage was, uh, a little bit slow. I mean, people were kind of just trying to figure out what to do. Uh but if I tell you what we've seen in the last 12 months uh we've seen uh every one of our largest customers say we can see the inflection point now Lisa like we can see you know demand is accelerating because people are now starting to get real productivity um out of the AI use cases and you know we have all of the largest hyperscalers in the world saying they're investing more in capex because they can see the uh return on the other side of it. So it it is uh something that we always are looking for the signals in the market but the signals in the market right now say that we're still at the very beginning of the technology but you're starting to see significant productivity >> really think that</p>

### “大空头”的警示：Michael Burry的看空立场

那么，谁在对这一切说“胡扯”呢？谁在说苏姿丰刚才说的一切都是无稽之谈，都不是真的，而且不会像他们在收入和每股收益目标中预测的那样实现？这个人不是别人，正是Michael Burry先生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> now who is calling BS on all of this who is saying that everything Lisa Sue just said is nonsense none of it's real and it's not panning out or it's not going to pan out in the way that they're projecting in their revenue and EPS targets it is none none other than Mr. Michael Bur.</p>
</details>

昨晚，我从健身房回来后，你知道我做了什么吗？我决定看《大空头》。因为Michael Burry最近新闻不断，我就想再看一遍《大空头》。我已经看过五遍了。我跳着看，因为很多场景我已经很熟悉了。然后，我看到这条推文弹了出来。这是一张克里斯蒂安·贝尔在《大空头》中扮演Michael Burry的照片。配文是：“那时的我，现在的我。哦，好吧，它成功了。它将会成功。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason this post yesterday was so surprising to me is because last night, you know what I did last night after I came back from the gym and I actually have a funny story of um of of going to the sauna after the gym and there were people talking about core even and it was actually ridiculous. I like I go to the gym to not think about the stock market and the the fact that people I'll tell you guys the stories of the fact that people were talking about core and video in the sauna it was ridiculous. But I came back after the gym and I said, "You know what? I want to watch the big short." I kind of felt like watch because Michael Bur's been on the news. I kind of felt like watching the Big Short again. I've watched it already like five times. And so I started watching The Big Short and I was skipping around because like I've seen it so many times. I skip a lot of different scenes. And then I see this tweet pop up and this is a picture of um Christian Bale from The Big Short who played Michael Bur. The caption is me then, me now. Oh well, it worked out. It will work out.</p>
</details>

当他说“那时的我，现在的我”时，这张照片是Burry在做空房地产泡沫的中途，因为市场不理解即将发生的事情而感到非常恼火，于是躺了下来。他做空了两年，在最终成功前，他的空头头寸一度亏损了130%。他当时很烦躁，不是放弃了，而是像在说：“哇，我不敢相信市场还不明白。”这表明他非常沮丧，但也认识到时间最终会证明一切。而现在的配文是：“它成功了。它将会成功。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when he's saying me then, me now. This is a picture when Bur basically in the middle of his short on the housing bubble kind of just like uh you know decided to lay down because he was so annoyed that the market didn't understand what was about to happen. And again, he had to have that short on for two he was down like 130% of the short before it finally worked out. Um and he was annoyed, right? So he it was it was not like he gave up, but it was almost like he was just like, "Wow, I can't believe the market doesn't get it." And it's this sign of him being so upset, but also recognizing that time will have to eventually take place. And the caption now is, "It worked out. It will work out."</p>
</details>

在我看来，就像现在的年轻人说的，他有点“崩溃”了。他发布这张照片暗示它将会成功，就像在说：“哦，过去成功了。我被当成傻子两年，但最终被看作是天才。现在可能也是一样，但最终会成功的。”他在社交媒体上公开这么说，每次他公开发帖，我都觉得很有趣，因为他不是一个喜欢公开发言的人，所以他显然是在试图吸引注意力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And to me, as the kids would say today, he's kind of crashing out. He's kind of crashing out. I mean, the fact that he posted this to imply that it will work out, like, oh, it worked out in the past. I I was seen as the idiot for two years and then eventually I was seen as the genius and now it's probably the same thing but eventually it's going to work out. And the fact that he's publicly stating that on social media again every time he publicly posts on social media I think it's like very interesting to me because this is a guy who doesn't post publicly so he's obviously trying to garner attention.</p>
</details>

他发布那张带有那种配文的图片，对我来说意味着他开始对这笔交易感到害怕。因为如果你对做空英伟达和Palantir，怀疑苏姿丰和黄仁勋所说的一切都那么有信心，我不是说没有值得怀疑的地方，我只是说，如果你那么自信地认为这一切都是骗局，都是胡扯，都不是真的，那么你就不会说任何话。你会持有你的空头头寸，过你的日子，因为最终每个泡沫都会破裂，我们最终都会经历一些灾难性的下跌，之后你就可以讲述你的故事了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that he posted that picture with that caption to me means that he's getting scared of this trade. Because if you are so confident that shorting Nvidia and shorting pounder and doubting Lisa Sue and Jensen Hang about everything that's going on, I'm not saying there are not things to be skeptical about. I'm just saying to say that everything's a sham. It's all BS. It's not real. If you were so confident in that, then you would just not say anything. You would have your short position and you would go about your day because eventually every bubble pops and it you know like we end up having some cataclysmic fall and after that you can tell the story.</p>
</details>

你想要因为做空而获得关注，意味着你认为这笔交易有可能对你不利，你正试图让其他人也加入你的交易，要么是为了获得退出流动性，就像Alex Karp所说的那样，这就是为什么Karp一直说这显然是一种市场操纵，特别是因为他比预期提前两周披露了13F报告，这是十年来的第一次；要么是你担心没有足够多的人理解正在发生的事情，你认为你有责任教育人们你有多么看空。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for you to want to get attention for being short means that you think there's a chance it goes against you and you are trying to get other people to pile into the trade with you either to get exit liquidity as Alex Karp was saying that's why you know Karp keeps saying that this was obviously a form of market manipulation especially because he disclosed the 13F two weeks earlier than expected for the first time in a decade or uh you are afraid that not enough people understand what's going on and you think you have a role to educate people about how short you are.</p>
</details>

而这正是我觉得，对于多头来说，有像Burry这样的人存在实际上是相当利好的。他过去15年一直都错了。是的，他2008年做对了，但自那以后每次他说做空都错了。他在2023年12月有空头头寸，他在2023年1月说卖出。对他来说，再次公开做空并没有奏效。顺便说一句，那时候他并没有那么公开。他当时发了几条推文，但远不及他现在所说的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's the part where I'm like It's actually pretty bullish, I think, for the Bulls to have someone like Bur who's been wrong for the past 15 years. Again, he did get 2008 right, but he's been wrong every other time since he said, you know, go short. He had shorts in December of 2023. He said sell in January of 2023. It just hasn't worked out for him to be this short again publicly. And those times he wasn't that public, by the way. I mean, he had a couple tweets back then, but it was nothing to the extent of what he's saying right here.</p>
</details>

甚至他的个人简介，他写着：“《大空头》Michael Burry官方X账户，被沃伦·巴菲特称为‘卡珊德拉’。Unchained October。Cassandra Unchained 11月25日发布。”我的天，等等。这和昨晚不一样。这和昨晚不一样。昨晚他的简介里没有这部分，伙计们。我觉得是本书。我觉得是本书。我想我猜对了。昨晚是别的内容。他每天都换简介。这家伙真是神秘得有点疯狂。“Unchained October。Cassandra Unchained 11月25日发布。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, even his bio, he's like, um, official exac account for the big short Michael Bur dubbed Cassandra by Warren Buffett. Unchained October. Cassandra Unchained launches. Oh my goodness. Hold on. This is different from last night. This is different from last night. Last night you didn't have this part of the bio, guys. I think it's a book. I think it's a book. I think I was right. I think I think it's Last night you had something else. He changes his bio every day, too. Again, this guy's like kind of crazy how cryptic he is. Unchained October. Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th.</p>
</details>

伙计，告诉我那不是一本书。那肯定是一本书。还能是什么？一篇关于他多看空AI的Substack文章？没有别的可能了。我认为那是一本书。《Cassandra Unchained》11月25日发布。所以，更广泛的观点是，我认为他正在崩溃。他对空头交易的进展感到不安。显然，他想让很多人也对此感到不安。或者，他正在推出一本书。如果他要出书，那么就需要大量的关注。也可能是个播客，尽管他不太爱说话。我的意思是，他过去十年里只接受过一次采访，所以我很怀疑是播客。但如果是一本书，那也许就是这么回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dude, tell me that's not a book. That has to be a book. What? What else could that be? It's like a Substack article about how short he is on AI. Like, there's no other way. That's not a book. I think that's a book. Cassandra Unchained launches November 25th. So, the broader point is here. I think he's crashing out. He's upset about the way the short is going. And obviously, he's trying to get a lot of people to be upset about it as well. or he's launching a book. And if he's launching a book, then you need a lot of attention. A podcast potentially, even though he's not really a talker. I mean, he's done like one interview in the past 10 years, so I really doubt it's a podcast. But if it is a book, then maybe that's what you got going on.</p>
</details>

那条推文昨晚火了，因为很多人说，“好吧，这正式表明他认为这是第二次‘大空头’，对吧？”如果你把他现在围绕AI所做的事情与2008年所做的事情相比较，那么，他就是在公开宣称这是他的下一个大赌注。他对这笔交易不顺利感到不安。但如果这只是营销，那么，你知道，这可能是另一种看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that tweet went viral last night because, you know, a lot of people were saying, "Okay, this is officially him saying it is the second big short, right? If you're comparing it to what you did in 2008 to what you're doing right now around whatever you think is going on with AI, then boom, that is he's publicly saying this is my next big bet." and he's upset that it's not working. But if it's just marketing, then you know, it might be a different perspective.</p>
</details>

这就是我对Burry的看法。总的来说，我认为这是利好的。你需要一堵“忧虑之墙”。Burry让更多人看涨或看跌，我认为这实际上是件好事。你得到的看跌情绪越多，如果盈利能跟上，我们可能就能走得更高。如果盈利能跟上，你知道，最终很多空头会转为多头，他们最终会追逐这波反弹。我真的认为这是一本书。他从我昨晚看到的样子改变了他的简介。他说11月发布，昨晚他的简介里没有“发布”这个词。这对我来说很明显，那将是一本书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's what I got on Bur. Again, I think it's bullish. You need a wall of worry. Bur making more people bullish or bearish I think is actually really good. And the more bearishness you get likely means the higher we can go if earnings can keep up with that picture. And if earnings keep up with that picture, you know, eventually a lot of those bears turn into bulls and they end up chasing this rally. I really do think it's a book, dude. He he changed his bio from what I saw last night. The fact that he says launching November, he didn't have the word launching in his bio last night. That to me makes it kind of obvious that it's going to be a book.</p>

### 冰火两重天：深入剖析“分叉经济”

好吧，让我们来谈谈我们的“分叉经济”环节，因为我们每天都做这个环节。关于这个**分叉经济**（Bifurcated economy：指经济体中不同部分或群体出现显著不同增长轨迹的现象，例如富人消费强劲而穷人消费疲软），有一些事情我们必须谈谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Let's do our segment on the bifurcated economy because we do this segment every day. There are some things that we got to talk about in regards to this bifrocated economy.</p>
</details>

首先，看看这个。截至两天前，对“第二份工作”的搜索量达到了历史新高。Kali现在估计，2026年出现经济衰退的几率为34%。衰退是不可避免的。我们不知道它何时会发生，也不知道它是否必然会影响股市。再说一次，两个季度的负GDP增长就可能造成衰退。但根据谷歌趋势，谷歌上对第二份工作的搜索量达到了历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, take a look at this. Searches for second job have reached an all-time high as of two days ago. Kali is now estimating there will be a 34% chance of a recession in 2026. A recession is inevitable. We don't know what's when it's going to happen. We don't know if it necessarily has to affect the stock market. Again, two quarters of negative GDP growth could create a recession. But you have searches for a second job on Google reaching an all-time high as per Google trends.</p>
</details>

第二件关于这个分叉经济非常重要的事情是房利美（Fannie Mae）的想法。这是来自homes.com的消息。房利美将取消其620分的最低信用分要求。这家抵押贷款巨头将使用自己的风险因素分析。引用原文：“这只是旨在为美国创造购房机会的一系列政策变化中的最新一项。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing that's really important to understand around this bifrocated economy is what Fanny May is thinking about. This is from homes.com. Fanny May is set to drop its 620 credit score minimum. The mortgage giant will use its own analysis of risk factors. Quote, "It's just the latest in a series of policy changes aimed at creating home ownership opportunities in the United States."</p>
</details>

我不会说谎，昨天这是一个明显的危险信号。我无法粉饰它。尽管我对各种事情都持乐观态度，我们也会看到分叉经济中一些乐观的方面，但这并不乐观。因为归根结底，你在谈论50年期抵押贷款、15年期汽车贷款，然后，顺便说一句，特朗普对他收到的50年期抵押贷款的强烈反对并不高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I'm not going to lie, this was a glaring red flag yesterday. There's no way to, you know, mince my words about it. I mean, as bullish as I am about a variety of things, and we're going to look at some bullish parts of the bifrocated economy. This is not bullish because at the end of the day, you talking about 50-year mortgages, 15-year car loans, and then, and by the way, Trump is not happy about this 50-year mortgage backlash he's been getting.</p>
</details>

然后你又看到了房利美（Fannie Mae）准备降低信用分要求的消息。你知道2008年金融危机是怎么造成的吗？就是把有问题的抵押贷款发放给那些负担不起的人。当然，后来还涉及到金融工程，比如那些债券套债券再套债券的合成CDO，最终导致了我们见过的最大泡沫之一。但其核心是，那些负担不起每月2500美元还款的人，却能轻易地获批这些贷款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you get this Fanny May update of thinking they're going to lower credit scores. You know what caused 2008? Giving faulty mortgage mortgages to people that couldn't afford them. I mean, and then then you get into the whole financial engineering of these syn synthetically designed CDOS's that had bonds inside of bonds inside of bonds, and that ended up leading to just one of the biggest bubbles we've ever seen. But at its core, it was people that could not afford a $2,500 payment that were easily getting approved for these payments.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，分叉在哪里？分叉在于美国企业盈利增长正在蓬勃发展。到目前为止，标普500指数公布的盈利是自2021年第三季度以来的最高水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, what's the bifurcation? Well, the bifurcation is that US corporate earnings growth is booming. The S&P 500 so far has put up earnings that are the highest since Q3 of 2021.</p>
</details>

标普500指数的11个板块中有6个报告了正的平均每股收益增长。罗素3000指数的中位数利润同比增长达到11%，这是自2021年第三季度以来的最高水平，比第二季度增长了6%。到目前为止，已公布财报的公司中，近80%的公司盈利超出预期，平均超出8%。英伟达将是几周后的大头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Six of the 11 S&P 500 uh sectors reported positive average EPS growth. And the medium profit growth in the Russell 3000 hit 11% year-over-year, that's the highest from Q3 2021 and up 6% in Q2. Almost 80% of the companies that have reported so far, Nvidia is going to be the big one in a couple of weeks, uh have beat earnings by an average of 8%.</p>
</details>

所以，你看到房利美认为我们需要给那些信用评级不佳而无法获得贷款的人提供贷款。你看到50年期抵押贷款。你看到谷歌上对第二份工作的搜索量达到历史新高。但同时，你又看到企业盈利达到了有史以来的最佳水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're seeing Fanny May think that we need to give loans to people that can't qualify for loans because their credit rating is bad. You're seeing fifth year mortgages. You're seeing job uh you're seeing searches for a second job at an all-time high on Google. But then you're seeing corporate earnings being the best it's ever been.</p>
</details>

这种二元对立，这种分叉，引出了一个问题：当这些盈利可能因劳动力市场而下降时，会发生什么？或者说，劳动力市场是否会恶化到足以对盈利造成重大影响，从而导致我们的投资组合因股价下跌而出现重大下滑？或者，如果我们真的遇到非常糟糕的经济，降息是否足以拯救股市？因为归根结底，利率降低意味着资本成本变得更便宜，保证金也更便宜，即使经济不一定表现最好，人们也会更愿意承担风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dichotomy here, the bifurcation here is what's going to happen when these earnings decline potentially based on the labor market or is the labor market even going to get to the point where it has that much of an impact to cause a meaningful decline in earnings, which would cause a meaningful decline in our portfolios given stock prices will go down. Or if we do get a really bad economy, will the rate cuts be enough to save the stock market? Because at the end of the day, lower uh rates means that the cost of capital becomes cheaper and margin becomes cheaper and people get more risk on even if the economy is not necessarily doing the best.</p>
</details>

（视频片段中美银分析师讲话）

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> The strongest in almost two years and 20 months. If we look at it seasonally adjusted, it was up for the fifth month in a row. So you are continuing to see consumer spending power. But I pull out two things on this. First, while retail spending did go up, the number of transactions didn't. So one of the things driving that strengthening the consumer spending number is inflations. It's m maybe tariffs. It's not that consumption is necessarily increasing. And then the other thing that I pull out is it's the higher income households that are really driving the spending. That gap between >> we've heard that argument a lot, right? Like if the wealth effect, if you feel richer, you're more likely to buy a new car. Uh you can see that through Ford and GM earnings. It seems like Bank of America is kind of confirming that's a lot of what we're seeing in the credit card and debit card transaction data as well. between spending growth between higher and lower income households is certainly continuing. >> At the lower end, what are you seeing? >> So, the lower end spending is still growing. So, if you look at at lower income spending, last month it was up 7/10. Higher income spending though was up, you know, almost four times that at 2.7. What's interesting is though what the gaps are in terms of what the difference between the spending growth between the higher and the lower income consumer and where we're seeing the biggest gaps are in bigger ticket items in airlines in lodging in furniture. To a lesser extent, we're also seeing it in clothing. But in each of those categories, it's not that the higher income is really spending a lot more. It's that lower income is pulling back. So >> I mean a lot of those are discretionary items. >> A lot of them are discretionary items. And then the other thing that's interesting to look at is where are we not seeing a big gap between the higher and the lower income spending. It's in general merchandise. It's in online retail. And and the one category where we're actually seeing lower income go up and higher income pull back is in groceries. >> Now, when I first saw that, my first inclination was, okay, this is an impact of SNAP benefits because people are putting more groceries on their card. But this data is only through the end of October, so it wouldn't necessarily have that impact. What we think that the is driving that differential is that lower income consumers are already purchasing the value items whereas higher income consumers have the ability to pull back a bit. So you're seeing on the grocery side them pull back to go to more value. >> You know if you hear if you listen to some of the the fast casual dining restaurants they've seen a pullback in the consumer there. Is does that mean maybe those those income people are spending more at the grocery store and less? you know, we haven't seen that and actually in our data we're seeing both higher and lower income consumers spend more at restaurants. So, so that doesn't necessarily tie in, but I do think that there is certainly we are seeing evidence particularly at the lower end that those consumers are under a bit more stress and some of it always comes and I say this all the time, a lot of it always comes back to the labor market and what we're seeing in the labor market, labor market is still expanding according to our data, you know, and we look at the number of households receiving income that was up 510 last month. So the labor market is still expanding, but the wages that the lower income consumers are pulling in are growing at a much slower rate than at the higher income consumer. And in fact, that disparity between wage growth is at the the largest level between higher and lower that we've seen since we started the series in 2016.</p>
</details>

我认为不可否认的是，经济确实存在分化。我知道我们一直在用这个词，但在低端和高端经济之间确实存在分裂。在低端经济正在发生什么，以及高端经济可能如何补贴这种经济性质之间，存在许多不同的细微差别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So look, I don't think it's deniable that there is a bifurcation. I know we keep using that word, but there is a split between the economy between the lower end and the higher end. And there's a lot of different nuances between what's going on with the lower end and how the higher end is potentially subsidizing the nature of this economy.</p>
</details>

对于投资者来说，这意味着什么？我知道很多人可能会说，我们已经谈论这个分叉经济很长时间了，这到底意味着什么？对我的投资有什么影响？我认为有两点。第一，我们谈论它是为了确保人们明白，并非一切都完美无缺。确实存在问题。我认为，要成为一个全面的投资者，你必须跟上一些宏观数据，以便理解。如果我们确实遇到市场下跌，这也有助于理解，哦，并非一切都完美，这就是为什么股市可能会有点恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The takeaway for investors, I know a lot of people might be saying, look, we've been talking about this bifrocated economy for a long time. What does it mean? Like what does that mean for my investments? I think two things. Number one, the reason we talk about it is just to make sure people understand that not everything is perfect. Like not everything is perfect. Like there are issues going on. And I think to be a well-rounded investor, you just have to keep up with some of that macro data to understand and and you know, if we do get a market decline, it can help also understand, well, not everything was perfect, which is why the equity markets might be freaking out a little bit.</p>
</details>

但第二点，这是否意味着你应该卖出？在我看来，不是。如果这意味着你想减持一些仓位，我认为那完全没问题。而且，你并不需要一个分叉的经济来做这件事，这可能只是你通常想稍微降低风险敞口。对我来说，更广泛的意义是，当我们开始看到企业盈利的趋势朝相反方向发展时，也就是盈利不再是自2021年以来最好的时候，当我们开始看到这张图表下降时，那才应该是实体经济正在影响股市的第一个信号。因为现在，有很多不同的细微原因为什么股市并没有真正感受到那种痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But number two, does it mean you sell? In my opinion, no. If I if it if it means, you know, you want to take some chips off the table, I think that's totally fine. And, you know, I don't think you need a bifrocated economy to necessarily do that. That could just be in general. You know, you want to derisk a little bit of exposure. What it more broadly means to me is when we start to see the trend on corporate earnings go the opposite direction, aka earnings are not the best they've been since 2021. When we start to see this chart go down, that's when it should be the first sign that the actual economy is affecting the stock market because right now there's a lot of different nuances for why the stock market is not really feeling that type of pain.</p>
</details>

最重要的是，我们已经一个月没有政府数据了。所以一旦我们得到这些政府数据，它将非常重要。初请失业金人数怎么样？失业率如何？它们是否会攀升到27.5万以上？我们是否还停留在22万？因为如果所有这些从数字角度看都没有达到危险信号的水平，那么从轶事角度看，人们可以对经济有任何感觉。但如果你在一些数据中没有看到明显的危险信号，那么你可能就不必对整个分叉经济的想法那么害怕。坦率地说，分叉经济可能在很长一段时间内成为新常态。我的意思是，基本上自这个牛市开始以来的过去三年里，它一直是新常态，而且可能会继续是新常态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, again, we haven't had government data in a month. So once we get this government data, it's going to be really important. How are initial jobless claims? What is the unemployment rate like? Are they peing up above 275,000? Are we still at 220? Because if all those things are not sort of red flag levels from a numerical perspective, anecdotally, people can feel whatever they want about the economy. But if you are not seeing the obvious red flags in some of the data, then you might not have to be as scared about this whole idea of the bifurcated economy. Quite frankly, the bifurcated economy might be the new normal for a very long time. time. I mean, it's been the new normal basically for the past three years, ever since this bull market started and it might continue to be the new normal.</p>

That that that uh that got you got a lot of captions on that one. as I think the funniest one was uh when when you tell your bro to not be weird in front of the hose and then your and then your bro pulls out his sword. I thought that was hilarious. Uh here's another one of Karp speaking about why he's in a war with these short sellers. I mean my version externally is we gave venture returns not just venture returns we gave venture returns as if you're like you know I don't know you're you like Peter Thiel Seoia Kosla returns to the average person who is willing to do their own work and stand up against uh uh kind of tried but not true ideas like playbooks. So, we're like the anti-playbook company and then, you know, I mean, you know, I'm currently in a battle with, you know, short sellers primarily because they could go short some carcinogenic company, but they have to short arguably the best company in this country and in the world by any metric. And by the way, judge us by our enemies. Look who hates us. Like, I mean, like, go online. I mean, I guess people here have gone on X. Like, just forget any, you don't need to know anything else. just look at like who hates power chair and look who hates me and then judge us by that standard. What should our market cap be based on that standard? So,</p>

你知道，我喜欢Karp的一点是，其他人可能会不同意这一点。顺便说一下，市场还有两分钟开盘。Triple V，谢谢你200美元的超级留言。感谢你来到这里。我告诉过你们，我正在探索一个新的职业机会，几周后会和你们谈谈。昨晚我给Triple V先生打了电话，就这个机会征求他的专业商业建议，他非常非常有帮助。所以谢谢你Triple V来到这里。感谢你，也感谢昨天的电话，因为我确实需要一些建议。

我喜欢Karp的一点是，他把这事看得很个人化。他把这事看得很个人化。看他说的。他说我现在正在和空头进行一场个人战争。我的意思是，任何其他CEO都会说，好吧，他们在做空我们的股票，无所谓，这是市场的一部分。他却说：“不，我正在和这些混蛋战斗。”我喜欢这样，因为他在说：“不要仅仅用传统的市销率或市盈率来判断我们的市值。要从我们为客户创造了多少价值的角度来考虑，并从那个角度来判断我们的市值，而不是其他角度。”

<p class="english-text">One of the things I love about Karp is that he takes it personally dude. He takes it personally. Look at what he said. He said I am in a personal battle with short sellers right now. I mean any other CEO would be like okay they're shorting our stock whatever like you know that's part of the market down. He's like, "Nope, I'm in a battle with these motherfers." And I love it because he's saying, "Don't judge our market cap from just like the conventional way of how you think about a price to sales or PE ratio. Think about it in the context of how much value we create for our clients and judge our market cap from that perspective versus other perspectives."</p>

现在，会有很多人说，“看，这不是思考市值的方式。这不是思考数字的方式。他，你知道，他从根本上有一个不同的范式。”我的观点是，Palantir是一家独一无二的公司，他们之所以能获得这样的估值，是因为他们创造的价值，也因为Karp把这当成一项个人使命。你做空一家美国公司，是的，可能非常昂贵，但它实际上在为世界创造价值，保护作战人员。Karp对此非常认真，他不会让这种事轻易过去。所以我个人喜欢这样。我知道有些人不喜欢。我喜欢我投资的公司的CEO如此认真，并真心想证明所有人都错了，因为我认为这恰恰说明了他对公司投入了多少，以及他在情感上多么关心赢得这场胜利的过程。

<p class="english-text">Now, you'll have a lot of people saying, "Look, that's not the way to think about market caps. That's not the way to think about numbers. He's he's, you know, he's fundamentally having a different paradigm." My perspective is Pounder is a one ofone company and the reason they're getting this multiple is because of the value they're creating and because Karp makes it a mission to take it personally. You short an American company that's yes potentially very expensive but is actually creating value in the world protecting the war fighter. Karp takes that seriously and he's not going to let that slide. So I personally like it. I know some people don't. I love that a CEO that I'm invested in takes it so seriously and actually wants to prove everyone wrong because I think I think it just goes to show how much he's invested in the company and and how much he emotionally cares about the process of winning.</p>

桑拿房的故事是怎样的？好吧，桑拿房的故事其实很简单。我从健身房回来，去了桑拿房，我通常会待15分钟。里面有几个人，我戴着耳机听音乐。在桑拿房里待了五分钟，我听到他们大声交谈，出于好奇，我就关掉了音乐，想听听他们在聊什么。

<p class="english-text">What's the sauna story? Okay, so the sauna story I mean it's really simple. I I came back from the gym. I went to the sauna and like I usually try to spend 15 minutes in the sauna and there were a couple guys in there and I had my headphones on. when I was listening to music and I'm in the sauna and within five minutes like I hear them like talking loudly and so I just I turn off my music because I was just curious like as a human I was like what are they talking about</p>
</details>

然后我听他们说：“兄弟，你看到今天Core Weave的暴跌了吗？”我当时就想，这不可能发生吧。我从来没在桑拿房里听人谈论股票。其中一个人是个投资银行家，他交易了一些股票但没有披露，他所在银行的合规团队给他发了邮件，说如果再犯就会被解雇。他却公开谈论这些，还说他的Core Weave看涨期权涨了。我听着觉得这太疯狂了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and then I'm listening to them and they're like bro did you see the core weave drop today and I'm like this can't be happening it's like like I never hear people talking about stocks in the sauna and then one of these guys um he's a freaking investment banker and he ended up trading some of these stocks without disclosing the trades and his compliance team at whatever bank he worked at sent him an email and they were like, "Hey, if you do this again, you're going to get fired because like you you have to report every single trade. You're not allowed to like do these trades without telling us and he was just openly talking about it and he was talking about these core calls that went up and I'm just listening to it and I'm like this is crazy, bro."</p>
</details>

他们还在谈论英伟达。我本想插话，但我只是听着，因为首先，我已经厌倦了谈论股票，我每天谈八个小时，只想在桑拿房里放松一下。其次，我也不知道该说什么。我可能会说：“是啊，Core Weave的下跌很糟糕。”或者“是啊，那次下跌太糟了。”没什么可说的。我不认为这是市场见顶的信号。我觉得这些人可能在金融行业工作，至少其中一个是的，所以他们才会谈论这些。但他们三个人都在热烈讨论英伟达和CoreWeave发生的事情，这本身就很说明问题。

<p class="english-text">But they were talking about Nvidia. I wanted to intervene in the conversation but I had I was just like I'm just going to listen because first of all I'm tired of talking about stocks. I talked about socks for eight hours and I'm trying to just like chill in the sauna. And then number two, I'd be like, I don't even know what I would say. Like I'd be like, "Yeah, the core drop was bad." I'd be like, "Yeah, the core drop sucked." Like there's nothing to say in that conversation. I don't think that's toppy. I think these people probably work in, you know, finance, at least one of these guys does and that's why they were talking about it. But the fact that all three were like, you know, really discussing what went on with Nvidia and Cororeweave.</p>

哇。SoFi试图冲击32.50美元，一度达到32.45美元。好的，这对数据中心概念股来说是相当好的消息。我的意思是，你希望看到基础模型公司花更多的钱。CoreWeave略微持平。Nebius 99.96美元，略低于100美元，在57.08美元。但花在这些数据中心上的钱越多，显然对很多这些公司越有利。

<p class="english-text">Wow. SoFi trying to go for 3250. Got to 3245. All right. That's pretty good news for the data center plays. I mean you want to see the foundation model spend more money. Cororee slightly flat. Nebius 99.96 just under 100 at 5708. But the more money getting spent on these data centers obviously the more beneficial for a lot of these names.</p>

SoFi创下历史新高，朋友们。她做到了。她正在做到。SoFi股价达到32.70美元。突破了32.50美元。她正在这里做到。33美元的阻力位仍然有大约105,000股。但你看到了，SoFi正式创下历史新高。那是一次从32.20美元的大幅上涨。32.57美元。今天上涨了5.1%。
