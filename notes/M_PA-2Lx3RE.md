title: 投资与决策中的退出艺术：为何我们难以割舍，又如何明智放手
---
### 决策中的不确定性与退出选项

大家好，很高兴能以线上形式来到这里。今天，我将和大家探讨“退出”这个话题，特别是我们如何改进退出决策，以及为什么我们真的需要这样做。作为决策者，我们面临的问题是，不确定性使得启动任何事情都变得非常困难，因为有两种形式的不确定性会影响我们做出的任何决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm so happy to be here virtually. Today, I'm going to talk to you about quitting, specifically how we can improve our exit decisions and why we really want to do that. The problem we face as decision-makers is that uncertainty makes it very hard to start things, because two forms of uncertainty exert themselves on any decision we make.</p>
</details>

第一种是纯粹的运气，这意味着我们可能做出一个很好的决策，一个有90%成功概率的决策，但仍有10%的概率它不会成功。当我们观察到这10%的结果时，它完全是由运气决定的，这使得我们很难开始新的事物，因为我们试图对结果获得比实际更多的控制，而结果本质上是概率性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is just plain luck, which means that we can make a great decision, we can make a decision that's going to work out 90% of the time, but 10% of the time it's not going to work out. And when we observe that 10% is wholly determined by luck, and that makes it very hard for us to start things because we're trying to get more control than we actually have over what the outcome might be, which is probabilistic in nature.</p>
</details>

另一种使启动决策变得困难的不确定性形式是，我们所知甚少，与所有应知之事相比微不足道。这可能导致我们过度放慢决策速度，以一种实际上没有效率的方式，试图达到一个实际上无法实现的确信程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other form of uncertainty that makes the decision to start things hard is that we know very little in comparison to all there is to be known. And so this can make it so that we really slow our decisions down in a way that isn't actually productive, trying to get to a level of certainty that is actually unattainable.</p>
</details>

因此，这两种不确定性使得启动新事物变得困难。对我们来说的好消息是，对于我们决定做的大多数事情，我们都有“稍后退出”的选择。尽管退出可能伴随着不同的成本，但几乎任何我们决定开始的事情，我们都可以选择退出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So those two forms of uncertainty are making starting things hard. The good news for us is that for most things that we decide to do, we have the option to quit later. That quit might have varying costs associated with it, but almost anything that we decide to start, we can actually quit.</p>
</details>

这意味着，那些使我们难以开始事情的不确定性，因为有了“稍后退出”的选项，反而让开始变得更容易。因为我们可以预见到，当世界没有按我们的方向发展，或者当我们观察到新的信号，学到新东西告诉我们最初的选择并不那么好时，我们有能力退出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what that means is that the uncertainty that makes it really hard for us to start things, this option to quit later makes that start easier, because we can anticipate the ability to exit when we observe that the world isn't going in our direction or when we observe that we're getting signals that we're learning new things that tell us that our choice wasn't actually that good.</p>
</details>

你可以这样想：我们都有过“要是当时就知道现在所知道的一切就好了”的感觉。退出的选项实际上让我们能够在获得新信息时，根据这种感觉采取行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you can think about it like we've all had that feeling of I wish I knew then what I know now. The option to quit actually makes it so that we can act on that feeling when we learn new information.</p>
</details>

### 我们为何难以及时退出：承诺升级与认知偏误

但这里有一个非常大的问题：尽管我们拥有这个极其宝贵的选项，我甚至会说它是我们在决策中最有价值的单一选项——这个“走开”的选项，但问题是我们实际上非常不擅长退出。我们倾向于在事情上“走开”得太晚，远迟于如果仅凭预期价值判断时，本应是正确退出的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here's the really big problem is that even though we have this incredibly valuable option, and I would actually argue that it's the single most valuable option that we have in decision-making, is this option to walk away, the problem is that we actually are quite bad at quitting. We tend to walk away from things much too late compared to when, if you were just judging expected value, would be the correct time to actually walk away.</p>
</details>

所以，我们将讨论我们退出时遇到的这个问题，探讨为什么我们在这方面有如此大的困难，然后我希望能给大家提供一些解决方案，让这一切变得更容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we're going to talk about this problem that we have with quitting, we're going to talk about why it is that we have such a problem with quitting, and then I'm going to hopefully give you some solutions that are going to make this all a little bit easier for you.</p>
</details>

好的，这里有一个重要的事情。还记得我说过，当我们开始做事情之后，我们会获得新的信息，我们有一种强烈的直觉，认为当我们从外界获得信息，得知事情进展不顺利时，我们就会真正地注意并离开。也就是说，当我们收到那些不利信号时，我们就会停止正在做的事情——我们都这么认为，但这种直觉实际上是错误的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so here's the important thing. Remember I said, after we start things, we get new information and we have this very strong intuition that when we get information from the world that things aren't going that well, we'll actually pay attention and walk away. So when we get those adverse signals, we're going to stop what we're doing and that's what we all think, but that intuition is actually wrong.</p>
</details>

相反，面对这些负面信号，我们反而会**承诺升级**（Escalation of Commitment: 即使面对负面证据，也增加对失败项目的投入）。实际上，提到上一位演讲者，我用登山作为例子。我们都听说过“登顶狂热”，我们直觉上认为，如果天黑了我们还在攀登，或者暴风雪即将来临，我们都会停止攀登。但事实证明我们并没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, in the face of those negative signals, we escalate our commitment. And actually, in reference to the previous speaker, I use mountain climbing as an example for this. We've all heard of summit fever, we have the intuition that if it gets dark and we're still climbing, or if a blizzard is coming in, that we're all going to stop climbing. And it turns out that we don't.</p>
</details>

你可以看看1996年珠穆朗玛峰的例子，就知道人们会在已经收到不利信号之后，仍然继续前进。1996年是Rob Hall和Doug Hansen不幸遇难的悲剧之年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you can just look to for example, 1996 on Mount Everest to know that people will continue past the point when they already have adverse signals, 1996 being that tragic year when Rob Hall and Doug Hansen died.</p>
</details>

这是一种众所周知的效应，称为**承诺升级**。我们收到这些信号，但我们并没有减少对目标的投入，反而增加了投入。当然，继续做一件不再值得的事情，不仅会带来负面预期的成本，还会带来机会成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is a well-known effect, it's called escalation of commitment, that we get these signals and instead of actually reducing our commitment to the cause, having gotten those adverse signals, we actually escalate our commitment to the cause. And of course, continuing to do something that is no longer worthwhile doesn't just have costs associated with doing something that's negative expectancy itself, but there are also opportunity costs associated with it.</p>
</details>

因此，我们未能及时止损，导致了额外的失败成本，我们无法将我们的资本、时间、注意力、金钱和精力投入到真正有价值的事情上。所以，我们可以把“坚持”和“退出”看作并非对立，而是同一种决策。我们应该坚持那些有价值的事情，并退出那些没有价值的事情。未能退出那些不再有价值的事情，同样会带来机会成本。因此，正确处理“退出”与“坚持”的决策变得更加重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have this added cost of failure to cut our losses that we can't take that Capital, our time, attention, our money, our effort and put it into something that would actually be worthwhile. So one of the ways that we can think about the grit and quit is not as oppositional, but as kind of the same decision. We should stick to things that are worthwhile and we should quit things that aren't. And the failure to quit things that are no longer worthwhile also has opportunity costs associated with it. So this becomes even more important to get this quit grit quit decision down.</p>
</details>

专家也无法幸免于**承诺升级**。他们也无法幸免于未能及时退出。有大量数据显示，专家投资者在承担风险时是**阿尔法收益创造者**（Alpha Generators: 能够持续跑赢市场基准的投资者），但在退出决策上却会把阿尔法收益还回去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is really important, experts are in no way immune to escalation of commitment. They're no way in no way immune to this failure to quit things on time. There is lots and lots of data and I've got three studies shown here, G. Garvey and Murphy, Woodcock, so on so forth, that show that while expert investors are alpha generators when putting risk on, they give Alpha back on their exit decisions.</p>
</details>

事实上，2023年的一篇论文显示，捐赠基金在建仓时能产生120到180个**基点**（Bips: Basis Points，衡量利率或收益率变动的单位，1个基点等于0.01%）的阿尔法收益，但在退出决策上，他们实际上会回吐大约70到80个基点。Woodcock以及Garvey和Murphy也谈到，日内交易者也面临同样的问题，Alex Emus也证实了这一点：他们在入场时表现出色，但在退出时却回吐了大部分阿尔法收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in fact, this 2023 paper showed that endowments when they put positions on are generating between 120 and 180 bips on those an alpha on those decisions, but their exit decisions they're actually giving about 70 to 80 bips back. Woodcock and then also Garvey and Murphy talk about the the fact that intraday traders are also finding this and Alex Emus has shown this as well, very very good on the entry giving a lot of that Alpha back on the exit.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么我认为“退出”这个选项如此宝贵，因为这是我们能够真正超越竞争对手，创造大量阿尔法收益的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why I think this option to quit is so incredibly valuable because this is the place where we can actually pick up, we can generate a lot of alpha compared to our to compared to our competitors.</p>
</details>

那么，为什么我们这么难退出呢？事实证明，有许多认知偏误会堆积起来，让我们迟迟不愿退出。我将快速介绍其中一些，但不会涵盖所有。这些偏误包括：**沉没成本效应**（Sunk Cost Effect: 考虑已投入成本而继续投资的倾向）、**禀赋效应**（Endowment Effect: 对自己拥有的物品赋予更高价值的倾向）、**现状偏误**（Status Quo Bias: 偏好维持当前状态的倾向）、**不作为/作为偏误**（Omission/Commission Bias: 对因不作为造成的损失比因作为造成的损失更宽容）、乐观偏误、损失厌恶以及**确定损失厌恶**（Sure Loss Aversion: 避免将纸面亏损转化为实际亏损的倾向）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why is it that it's so hard for us to quit things? Well, it turns out that there's a lot of cognitive biases that kind of pile up on top of us that make us slow to quit. I'm going to walk through some of them pretty quickly, I'm not going to cover every single one of them, but we the sunk cost effect, endowment, status quo bias, Omission commission bias, optimism bias, loss aversion and sure loss aversion. So I'm going to walk through these somewhat quickly.</p>
</details>

### 深入分析阻碍退出的认知偏误

**沉没成本效应**是指我们在决定是否继续投入更多时，会考虑已经投入的成本。换句话说，我们会有一种“想要把钱赚回来”或“不想浪费已经投入的东西”的感觉。当然，问题在于浪费不是一个回顾性的问题，而是一个前瞻性的问题。理想情况下，如果某件事我们今天会开始做，那么我们就应该愿意继续做；如果某件事我们今天不会开始做，那么我们就不应该继续做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The sunk cost effect is when we take into account what we've already spent on something and deciding whether to continue on and spend more. In other words, what happens is that we have that feeling of we want to get our money back or don't want to have wasted what we already put into something. The problem of course is that waste is not a retrospective problem, it's a prospective problem. What we'd ideally like to do is if it is something that we would start today, then we should be willing to continue it. If it is not something that we would start today, then we should not continue it.</p>
</details>

但**沉没成本效应**导致我们不是向前看，不是问“这是我们今天会开始做的事情吗？我们今天会建立这个仓位吗？”而是考虑我们已经投入了什么，并据此决定是否继续投入更多。问题是，在你做出决策的那一刻，之前损失了多少并不重要，重要的是我们投入的下一美元或下一份努力是否具有正向预期。所以，**沉没成本效应**导致我们继续做那些不再值得的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what happens with sunk cost is that instead of this Forward Thinking where we're saying is this something that we would actually do start today? Would we put this position on today for example? We take into account what we've already put into it and deciding whether to continue on and spend more. Now the problem is it doesn't really matter what you've lost coming up to that moment of the decision. What matters is whether the next dollar or the next unit of effort that we put into something is positive expectancy. So the sunk cost effect causes us to continue things that are no longer worthwhile.</p>
</details>

我们还有**禀赋效应**，即我们对自己拥有的东西比对相同但不属于我们的东西评价更高。所以，我们投资组合中已有的东西，我们已经建立的仓位，甚至我们自己的想法，我们正在交易的理论，我们所持有的观点，我们都比不属于我们的东西评价更高。显然，当我们决定是否值得继续时，我们会扭曲对预期价值的看法，仅仅因为我们认为自己拥有的东西更有价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also have the endowment effect, which is just we value things that we own more than identical things that we don't own. So the things that we already have in our portfolio, the positions that we already have on, this is even true of our own ideas, the thesis that we're trading, the ideas that we have, we value more than things that don't we don't own. So obviously when we're making that decision about whether it's worthwhile to continue on, we're going to distort our view of what the expected value is, just because we think that the things that we own are more valuable that they have more value to them.</p>
</details>

然后是**确定损失厌恶**，这源于已故的Danny Kahneman和Amos Tversky，本质上是这样一种问题：我们倾向于避免将纸面亏损转化为实际亏损，甚至愿意付出代价来避免这样做。这来自他们1979年关于**前景理论**（Prospect Theory: 描述人们在不确定性下如何做决策的心理学理论）的原始论文，该理论表明，当人们在赌博中处于亏损状态时（比如我输了100美元），如果我被提供一个公平的抛硬币机会，我可以赢回100美元，或者输掉220美元，他们会选择抛硬币。换句话说，他们愿意支付10美元来争取扳平的机会，这是因为他们厌恶将纸面亏损转化为确定损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then we have sure loss aversion. This comes from the late Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky, which is essentially this problem that we're biased against converting paper losses into realized losses and we actually pay to avoid having to do so. So this is from their original 1979 paper on prospect theory, which shows that when people are in the losses on a gamble, say I've lost $100, and I'm offered a fair coin flip, where I can either get even or I'll lose $220, that they'll prefer to take the flip. There, in other words, they're paying $10 for the opportunity to try to get even, and that's because of this aversion to turning a paper loss into a sure loss.</p>
</details>

显然，当我们持有的仓位处于亏损状态时，这是一个巨大的问题。我们可以将所有这些偏误归结为一点：我们不喜欢关闭亏损的账户。这不仅仅是纸面账户，也与我们的心理账户有关。如果我们在纸面账户上是盈利的，但心理账户却是亏损的，比如我们以50美元买入一只股票，涨到75美元，然后跌到60美元，尽管在我们的纸面账本上是盈利的，但心理上我们是亏损的。因此，这种不愿关闭亏损账户的问题，使我们退出得非常缓慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And obviously that's a huge problem when we're in the losses on a position that we're holding and we can kind of think of all of those under this umbrella of we just don't like to close accounts in the losses. And it's not just paper accounts, this has to do with our mental accounts. So we can have a paper account that's in the gains and yet our mental account is in the losses. If we buy a stock at 50, it goes up to 75, and then it goes down to 60, mentally we're in the losses even though on our paper Ledger we're in the gains. And so this problem with not wanting to close accounts in the losses makes us very slow to quit.</p>
</details>

我们还有**现状偏误**，即偏好维持现状。以及**不作为/作为偏误**，我们对因维持现状而造成的损失（即决定不改变）比因改变而造成的损失（即决定改变）更为宽容。所以，如果我们持有一个仓位，我们对其可能产生的损失会更宽容，而不是对我们从该仓位切换到新事物所产生的损失更宽容，这也使我们退出得非常缓慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also have status quo bias, a preference for sticking with the status quo. Omission commission bias, we're much more tolerant of losses that come from sticking with the status quo, in other words, making a decision not to switch as opposed to making a decision to switch. So if we're holding a position, we're going to be more tolerant of the losses that might generate from that, than we are going to be tolerant of generating from losses that come from us switching from that position to something new, which also makes us very slow to quit.</p>
</details>

最后是**认知失调**（Cognitive Dissonance: 当人们的态度、信念或行为之间存在不一致时，会产生心理上的不适感），以及身份和有效性问题，这关乎我们如何看待自己以及他人如何看待我们。我们希望被视为长期保持一致的个体。我们做出的某些决策构成了我们身份的一部分，如果这些决策让我们在人群中脱颖而出，尤其如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the last thing is just cognitive dissonance, identity and validity, both the way we view ourselves and the way that other people view us. We want to be seen as consistent individuals over time. Part of the decisions that we make create part of our identity and that's particularly true if those decisions are making us stand out from the crowd.</p>
</details>

Bers和Milkman的研究表明，当分析师对盈利预测采取非共识立场时，如果市场走势与他们预测相反，并提供信息表明他们的预测不正确，他们实际上会加倍坚持自己的预测。但当他们做出共识预测时，他们完全愿意根据市场信息进行调整。这是因为非共识预测实际上更能体现一个人的身份。显然，作为交易员或投资者，我们是在与市场博弈，所以我们经常试图在人群中脱颖而出，做一些我们认为市场效率不高的事情。这实际上使我们更难退出，因为如果我们不得不“跳船”，那就像是对我们身份的攻击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Bers and Milkman showed that when analysts take positions that are non-consensus on earnings forecasts, when they're non-consensus and the world turns against them and gives them information that their forecast actually wasn't correct, they'll actually double down on the forecast. But when they make when they make forecasts that are in consensus, they're perfectly willing to change according to what the world tells them. And that's because the non-consensus forecasts are actually much more part of somebody's identity. And obviously as Traders or as investors, we're investing against the market, so we're often trying to stand out from the crowd, do something where we think that the market is not efficient, and that makes it actually much harder for us to walk away because it's an attack on our identity if we actually have to jump ship.</p>
</details>

### 改进退出决策的实用策略

好的，我讲了很多我们不愿停止的原因，现在我想快速给出一些帮助你更好地做出停止决策的方法。第一是设定非常具体的**终止标准**（Kill Criteria: 预设的、用于决定何时终止项目、止损或改变计划的标准）。这些标准就是用于终止项目、止损或改变计划的准则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so I told you a lot of the reasons why we don't stop. Now I want to give you quickly a few reasons how we can help you to get better at these stopping decisions. The first is to set very specific kill criteria, which are just criteria for killing a project, cutting your losses, or changing a plan.</p>
</details>

所以，第一步是识别事情可能出错或成功的方向，然后识别早期预警信号，制定一份**终止标准**清单。换句话说，哪些信号是我认为未来可能会忽略，但它们会告诉我该是时候退出了？然后，预先承诺你对这些标准的反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the first step is to identify the way that things might go wrong or right, and then identify the early warning signals to develop a list of kill criteria. In other words, what are those signals that I think I might ignore in the future that would tell me that it's time to walk away? And then pre-commit to your reaction to those criteria.</p>
</details>

我与许多投资者合作过，他们都有这样的直觉：我有一个理论，比如这个理论与利率的方向性变动有关，他们的理论是利率将超过某个点，或者保持在某个特定区间内，或者下降，无论理论是什么。他们直觉上认为，当利率走势与他们不利时，他们会平仓，会降低风险。但我们知道他们不会，他们倾向于出现“理论漂移”，或者**承诺升级**，或者他们会说“现在真的很便宜，我知道我的预测仍然是正确的”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I've worked with a lot of investors and they have that intuition while I have a thesis, and let's say the thesis has to do with the directional movement of interest rates. So they their thesis is that interest rates are going to go above above a certain point, or stay within a particular band, or go down, whatever that thesis is. They have the intuitions that that when interest rates move against them that they will get off the position that they will take risk off, but we know that they don't. They tend to get thesis creep or they escalate our commitment or they say now it's really cheap, I know my forecast is still correct.</p>
</details>

所以，我在这里说的是：如果你有一个理论，这个理论暗示着未来世界会是什么样子，那就写下你的理论实际暗示着什么，然后制定**终止标准**。换句话说，如果利率超出某个区间，那么我将采取X、Y或Z行动。如果它们超过某个区间，也许我会增加风险；但如果它们低于某个区间，这意味着世界已经与我的理论背道而驰，我需要实际降低风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what I'm doing here is saying, okay, if you have a thesis, that thesis is implying certain things about what the world is going to look like in the future, right down what that thesis is actually implying, and then develop kill criteria. In other words, if interest rates move out of a certain band, then I will do X, Y, or Z. So if they go above a certain band, maybe I'll put more risk on, but if they go below a certain band, that means that the world has moved against my thesis, and I need to actually take the risk off.</p>
</details>

这看起来可能没什么区别，如果我有一个理论，它预测了未来的某些事情，那么我只是把这些事情写下来并预先承诺，这有什么不同呢？事实证明，从认知角度来看，这会产生巨大的差异。提前思考，实际识别出这些**终止标准**，然后预先承诺当你看到这些信号出现时将采取的行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that might seem like a distinction without a difference. If I have a thesis, it's predicting certain things about the future, why is it different if I just write those things down and pre-commit to them? And it turns out just cognitively that makes a huge difference, to think ahead, actually identify what those kill criteria are, and then and then pre-commit to to the actions that you're going to take when you see those signals develop.</p>
</details>

第二件事是创建更好的**反馈循环**（Feedback Loops: 系统中将输出信息返回输入端，以影响后续行为的机制）。我们在退出时面临的一个问题是，当我们降低风险时，我们并没有一个好的反馈循环来衡量这些决策与基准相比如何。我们持续跟踪我们持有的仓位，显然，因为它们在我们的投资组合中，我们甚至会跟踪我们正在考虑建立的仓位，因为我们会创建影子账本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The next thing is to create better feedback loops. One of the problems that we have on the quits when we take risk off is that we really don't have a good feedback loop on how those decisions compare to a benchmark. So we consistently track positions we have on, and obviously because they're in our portfolio, we also even track positions that we're considering putting on because we'll create Shadow books.</p>
</details>

但我们没有做的是持续跟踪我们平掉的仓位。所以我们要做的是创建一个基准，我们可以根据它来衡量我们退出决策的质量。我们可以通过几种方式实现这一点。例如，如果我们正在释放资本，我们可以创建一个基准，即如果我随机从投资组合的任何地方释放这笔资本，并在一段时间内根据这个基准来判断我的退出决策质量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what we don't do is consistently track positions that we take off. So what we want to do is create a benchmark against which we can actually measure the quality of our quitting decisions. So we can do that in a couple ways. One thing is for example, if we're freeing up Capital, we can create a benchmark which is what if I randomly freed this Capital up from anywhere in my portfolio and actually judge my quit decision against that over the course of a period of time.</p>
</details>

你也可以开始跟踪你持有的东西，看看如果我早些时候在我考虑卖出的时候卖掉这些东西会发生什么。但要发挥创造力，尝试实际创建基准，以便你可以开始判断你的退出决策，从而获得关于你是否在这些退出决策中创造阿尔法收益，或者回吐阿尔法收益的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can also actually start to track your things that you hold and look at what would have happened if I had actually sold those things earlier at the time that I considered it. But be creative and try to actually create benchmarks against which you can actually start to judge your quitting decisions so that you can start to get feedback on whether you're generating Alpha on those exit decisions or giving Alpha back on those exit decisions.</p>
</details>

最后一点，这是我非常喜欢的一点：找一个**退出教练**（Quitting Coach: 帮助个人或团队设定退出标准、克服偏误并执行退出计划的外部顾问）。因为一个**公正的中间人**（Honest Broker: 能够客观公正地看待问题，不受个人偏见影响的人），一个站在外部观察你情况的人，会比你更清楚地看到你的情况。原因在于他们没有背负所有的**沉没成本**，他们没有**禀赋效应**，他们没有那些堆积在他们身上，使他们无法清晰看待情况的偏误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the last is this is a big favorite of mine, go get yourself a quitting coach, because an honest broker, someone who's standing on the outside looking in on your situation is going to see your situation more clearly than you can. And the reason is that they're not carrying all of the sunk cost, they're not carrying the endowment, they don't they don't have the same kind of biases piled up on them that are making them not be able to see that situation so clearly.</p>
</details>

所以，一个从外部观察的人会比你更清楚地看到你的情况。如果你与他们合作，预先承诺一个退出计划，有**退出教练**的帮助，实际上会让你更有可能坚持执行。所以他们既能比你更清楚地看到决策，又能创造问责制，让你真正执行这些退出计划。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So someone from the outside looking in is going to see your situation more clearly than you can. And so if you work with them to pre-commit to an exit plan with a quitting coach, it actually makes it more likely that you'll follow through. So they can both see the decision more clearly than you can and they create accountability that are going to make you actually follow through on those quitting plans.</p>

实际上，当我与例如独立基金经理（Solo PMs）合作时，我会将他们配对，以便他们可以在这些退出决策上互相指导。所以我希望这段关于退出的内容对你有所帮助。我真的相信，这可能是你目前在投资生活中最大的阿尔法收益来源，因为我们在这方面表现太差，而且没有人真正关注这些退出决策有多好。所以，如果你能更好地做出这些退出决策，我认为这将极大地提高你的回报。非常感谢大家。

<p class="english-text">So actually when I've worked with for example solo PMs, I've paired them together so that they can coach each other on these exit decisions. So I hope that this bit about exiting you're going to find helpful. I really believe that this could be the single biggest Alpha generator for you right now in your own investing life, because we are so bad at it and nobody's really paying attention to how good these exit decisions are. So if you can get better at these exit decisions, I think this is going this will vastly improve your returns. Thank you so much.</p>
