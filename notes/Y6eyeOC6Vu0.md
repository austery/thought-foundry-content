### 特朗普的选区划分计划受阻

昨天在印第安纳州，足够多的共和党人背离了总统的意愿，挫败了他在此地的选区划分计划。通常，选区划分是在每十年一次的人口普查之后进行的。但特朗普一直在推动提前进行，敦促‘红色州’（共和党占优势的州）的立法者**操纵**（gerrymander: 操纵选区划分以谋取政治利益）其选区地图，以帮助共和党在国会中期选举中赢得更多席位。特朗普在德克萨斯州、密苏里州和北卡罗来纳州取得了一些早期成功，但在其他州遇到了阻力。在内布拉斯加州和堪萨斯州的努力未能启动，而他在印第安纳州的所有说服策略似乎都无效。他试图‘胡萝卜加大棒’（恩威并施）：在白宫宴请立法者，并在社交媒体上猛烈抨击他们。但特朗普未能获得他所需的票数。一些共和党‘钉子户’表示，他们担心选区划分会破坏民众对选举公正性的信心。一位共和党州参议员说：“是时候对那些试图干预我们州事务的外部人士说不了。”特朗普的整体选区划分努力可能适得其反，因为它引发了‘蓝色州’（民主党占优势的州）的对策行动，旨在重新绘制更有利于民主党的选区地图。其中许多努力仍在进行中。

<p class="english-text">President Trump's push for Republicans to redraw congressional maps in their favor has hit a roadblock. >> All right, the machine is now closed. Clerk will tally the roll. 19 eyes, 31 nos. This bill has been defeated. In Indiana yesterday, enough Republicans broke from the president to quash his redistricting effort there. Normally, redistricting happens at the start of each decade after the census. But Trump's been pushing for it early, urging lawmakers in red states to gerrymander their maps to help the GOP pick up seats in the House in the midterms. Trump had some early success with that in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, but he's hit resistance in other states. efforts in Nebraska and Kansas didn't get off the ground and none of his persuasion tactics seemed to work in Indiana. He tried the carrot, hosting lawmakers at the White House and the stick, raging against them on social media. But Trump couldn't get the numbers he needed. Some of the Republican holdouts said they were worried the redistricting would undermine people's faith in the integrity of elections. And one Republican state senator said, quote, "It's time to say no to outsiders who are trying to run our state." It's possible Trump's overall redistricting effort may backfire against the GOP since it set off a counter campaign in blue states to redraw maps to be more favorable to Democrats. Many of those efforts are still in the works.</p>

### 国际网红兄弟Tate的释放与特朗普政府的影响

《纽约时报》的一项新调查发现，特朗普政府官员的支持在释放Andrew和Tristan Tate兄弟的过程中起到了关键作用。这两位网红是所谓的**‘男性至上主义社群’**（Manosphere: 指由男性主导、宣扬男性优越论和厌女观点的在线社群），他们助长了一种在全球范围内猖獗的沙文主义运动。自2022年以来，这对拥有美国公民身份的兄弟一直在罗马尼亚接受刑事调查。他们被指控胁迫数十名女性从事色情活动。Andrew还被指控强奸。直到今年早些时候，两人都被禁止离开罗马尼亚，部分原因是当地检察官认为他们对公众构成风险。我们采访了数十人，并审阅了数百页的私人信息和法庭文件，发现解除他们的旅行禁令是Andrew Tate多年来努力与特朗普总统的顾问和家人建立联盟的最终成果。《纽约时报》调查记者Megan Tui表示，在兄弟俩被捕后，Andrew Tate巧妙地迎合了Tucker Carlson、Candace Owens以及其他右翼媒体明星，他们对他进行了同情的采访。Andrew还与特朗普家族成员建立了关系，首先是Donald Trump Jr.，然后是他的弟弟Baron。Baron很钦佩Andrew，并于去年通过Zoom与他进行了交谈。据一位当时在通话中的共同朋友透露，在特朗普再次当选后，一些Tate的支持者进入了新政府。其中一人，外交特使Richard Grenell，与至少两名罗马尼亚官员讨论了他们的案件。不久之后，旅行禁令就被解除了。检察官们，据与我们交谈的消息人士称，对此感到非常愤怒。他们不愿意这样做。但罗马尼亚总理认为特朗普政府会对这一结果感到满意。兄弟俩利用新获得的自由，恢复了他们奢华的生活方式并提升了品牌影响力。他们已前往多个国家，包括美国。在美国期间，一名女子指控Andrew在3月份抵达后不久殴打并勒死她，尽管他否认了这一指控。针对《纽约时报》的提问，一位白宫官员表示，政府并未介入Tate兄弟的法律事务。罗马尼亚检察官办公室则表示，其所有行动均合法。您可以在 nytimes.com 上阅读Megan和同事Isabella Quai的完整调查报道。

<p class="english-text">A new investigation from the Times has found that support from Trump administration officials played a crucial role in the release of Andrew and Tristan Tate, two influencers in the so-called Manosphere, who've helped fuel a brazenly chauvinistic movement around the world. Since 2022, the brothers, who have American citizenship, have been under criminal investigation in Romania. They're accused of coercing dozens of women into pornography. Andrew has also been accused of rape. And until earlier this year, the two had been forbidden from leaving Romania, in part because prosecutors there considered them a risk to the public. So, we interviewed dozens of people and reviewed hundreds of pages of private messages and court documents, and we found that the lifting of their travel bans was the culmination of a years'slong effort by Andrew Tate to forge alliances with President Trump's adviserss and family members. >> Megan Tui is a Times investigative reporter. After the brothers were arrested, Andrew Tate shrewdly courted Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and other media stars of the right who conducted sympathetic interviews with him. Andrew nurtured relationships with members of the Trump family, first with Donald Trump Jr. and then his younger brother, Baron. Baron admired Andrew and spoke with him over Zoom last year. According to a mutual friend who was on the call and after Trump was reelected, some of the Tate supporters ascended into the new administration. One of them, the diplomatic envoy Richard Grenell, discussed their case with at least two Romanian officials. And soon after the travel bans were lifted. You know, the prosecutors, according to sources who spoke with us, were outraged. They didn't want to do this. But the Romanian prime minister thought the Trump administration would be happy with the outcome. The brothers have used their newfound freedom to resume their jet setting lifestyle and juice their brand. They have traveled to multiple countries, including the United States, and their visit to the States resulted in a new assault allegation from a woman who said Andrew beat and strangled her in March, shortly after his arrival, an accusation he's denied. In response to questions from the Times, a White House official said the administration is not involved in the Tate's legal matters. And the Romanian prosecutor's office said all of its actions have been legal. You can read the full investigation from Megan and our colleague Isabella Quai at nytimes.com.</p>

### 医疗保健政策僵局可能导致保费上涨

民主党人知道《平价医疗法案》（Obamacare）已失败，他们自己也承认了。但随着最后期限的临近，他们表示别无选择，只能再次延长这项失败的政策。昨天在参议院，立法者们在如何应对即将大幅上涨的数百万美国人的医疗保健费用问题上陷入僵局。他们会告诉选民，他们投票使他们的月保费翻倍吗？他们会告诉选民：“我投票让你们生病并破产”吗？几乎所有共和党人都投票反对民主党延长本月底到期的《平价医疗法案》补贴的努力。所有民主党人都投票反对一项共和党法案，该法案将用每年1500美元或更少的补贴取代，提供给最基本的健康保险计划的投保人。由于两项提案都陷入停滞，且国会将在下周休会度假，几乎可以肯定的是，明年许多人的保费将大幅上涨，甚至可能翻倍或更多。

<p class="english-text">Now, two more quick political updates. >> Democrats know that Obamacare has failed. They themselves have said so. But with a deadline quickly approaching, they say we have no choice but to extend this failed policy one more time. In the Senate yesterday, lawmakers deadlocked on what to do about health care costs, which are about to jump for millions of Americans. Are they going to tell their constituents they voted to double their monthly premiums? Are they going to tell their constituents, "I voted to get you sick and go broke." >> Nearly every Republican voted to block a Democratic effort to extend Obamacare subsidies that expire at the end of the month. And every Democrat voted against a Republican bill that would have replaced the subsidies with payments of $1,500 or less to people on the most basic health insurance plans. With both proposals dead in the water, and Congress preparing to leave for the holidays after next week, it's all but certain that many people will see their premiums shoot up next year, potentially doubling or more.</p>

### 美国统一AI监管行政令

“你有50个州，各自朝着50个不同的方向前进。这根本说不通。我们正在制造一种令人困惑的监管拼凑，而我们需要的是一个统一的联邦标准。”政府的AI主管David Saxs，与特朗普总统一起签署了一项旨在废除限制人工智能行业的州法律的行政命令。由于没有联邦AI监管，全国各州都在争相制定自己的法律，例如禁止**深度伪造视频**（Deep fake videos：利用人工智能技术制作的虚假音视频内容，看起来非常逼真）或要求ChatGPT等主要应用程序对其产品进行安全测试。现在，这项新命令赋予了美国司法部长广泛的权力，可以起诉各州违反这些法律，并推翻那些不支持国家实现“全球AI主导地位”的法律。这对人工智能公司来说是一次重大胜利，它们一直在华盛顿进行激烈的游说活动以废除州级法规。但这很可能会面临各州和消费者团体的法律挑战，因为它已经引发了广泛的两党反对。

<p class="english-text">And at the White House, >> you've got 50 states running in 50 different directions. It just doesn't make sense. We're creating a confusing patchwork of regulation and what we need is a single federal standard. >> David Saxs, the administration's AISAR, joined President Trump as he signed an executive order designed to knock down state laws limiting the artificial intelligence industry. Because there's no federal AI regulation, every state in the country has raced to set up its own laws, doing things like banning deep fake videos or requiring major apps like ChatGpt to do safety tests of their products. Now, the new order gives the US Attorney General the broad authority to sue states over those laws and overturn those that don't support helping the country achieve quote global AI dominance. It's a major win for AI companies who've carried out a fierce lobbying campaign in DC to throw out state regulations. But it's likely to face legal challenges by states and consumer groups since it's already sparked widespread bipartisan opposition.</p>

### 美国多地麻疹疫情蔓延

“无论您住在哪里，如果您对麻疹没有免疫力，我认为您就有感染麻疹的风险，因为我们正在一个地区看到病毒传播，这很容易蔓延到其他地方。”在南卡罗来纳州，数百人目前正处于隔离状态，卫生官员称一场新的麻疹疫情正在蔓延。这是自二十多年前美国宣布消灭麻疹以来，该病毒今年最严重的一次爆发。南卡罗来纳州州流行病学家表示，自感恩节以来，疫情有所加速，当时许多人在聚会中暴露于病毒。“此外，我们的人口疫苗接种覆盖率低于预期。”她说，快速传播很可能是由于疫苗接种率滞后造成的。在疫情中心县，约90%的学生接种了麻疹疫苗。这低于专家认为阻止病毒传播所需的95%的阈值。到目前为止，人们在几所当地学校、一家教堂和一个医疗机构暴露于病毒。地方领导人担心，随着更多的节日聚会，病例可能会进一步激增。该病毒可引起肺炎，在罕见情况下还会导致脑肿胀，可能导致失明、耳聋和智力障碍。根据美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）的数据，今年全国已报告近2000例麻疹病例，三名未接种疫苗者（包括两名儿童）已死亡。

<p class="english-text">Regardless of where you live, if you do not have immunity to measles, I consider that there is a risk of contracting measles because we're seeing transmission in one area of the state and that can easily go elsewhere. >> In South Carolina, hundreds of people are currently in quarantine as health officials say a new measles outbreak is spreading. It's the latest flare up in what has already been one of the country's worst years for the virus since it was declared eliminated in the US more than two decades ago. South Carolina's state epidemiologist says the outbreak has accelerated since Thanksgiving when many people were exposed at gatherings. >> In addition to that, we have lower than hoped for vaccination coverage in the population. >> She says the fast spread has likely been caused by lagging vaccination rates. About 90% of students in the county at the center of the outbreak have been vaccinated against measles. That's below the 95% threshold that experts say is needed to stop the virus from spreading. So far, people have been exposed at several local schools along with a church and a healthc are facility. And local leaders worried that cases could spike even more with more holiday gatherings. The virus can cause pneumonia and in rare cases, brain swelling, leading to possible blindness, deafness, and intellectual disabilities. Nationally, the US has seen nearly 2,000 measles cases this year, according to data from the CDC, and three unvaccinated people, including two children, have died.</p>

### 联合国教科文组织新增非物质文化遗产

最后，世界上一些最著名的地标是联合国教科文组织世界遗产。例如泰姬陵、中国长城、大堡礁。‘世界遗产’的称号旨在表彰应被颂扬和保护的地点。但联合国教科文组织也致力于保护那些无法简单地在地图上标出的事物，例如构成文化的独特传统。本周，该联合国组织公布了其新增的**‘非物质文化遗产’**（Intangible cultural heritage: 指被认为对文化认同和传承至关重要的、非实体的文化表现形式，如口头传统、表演艺术、社会实践、仪式、节庆活动、有关自然界和宇宙的知识与实践，以及传统手工艺技能）项目。瑞士一项悠久的消遣活动——约德尔唱法（Yodelling）——榜上有名。还有来自加纳的High Life音乐和舞蹈，以及塔吉克斯坦的Suminac（一种需要数小时烹饪的炖菜，人们在烹饪过程中会唱歌跳舞）。传说歌声能为食物增添风味。此外，新入选的还有日本手工纸制作、阿拉伯煤炭眼线妆容以及意大利烹饪等。‘非物质文化遗产’的称号有助于吸引游客前来体验文化瑰宝。然而，也有另一面：过度推广可能导致‘联合国教科文组织效应’（UNESCO side），即当人群过度涌入导致被列入名录的地点不堪重负。所以，让我们都多加留意，不要一下子都去学约德尔唱法。

<p class="english-text">And finally, some of the most famous landmarks in the world are UNESCO World Heritage sites. the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, the Great Barrier Reef. The designation is intended to mark places that should be celebrated and protected. But UNESCO also tries to preserve things that you can't just point to on a map, like the unique traditions that make up a culture. This week, the UN group announced what's been added to its list of intangible cultural heritage. >> Yodelling, a storied pastime in Switzerland, made the cut. Let me go to the P. This is High life music. Play something for me. Calm down. Calm down. >> So did High Life music and dance from Ghana and also Suminac, >> which is a meal from Tajjikstan that's cooked for hours while people sing and dance. The story goes that the singing seasons the food. Also new to the list are handmade Japanese paper, wearing Arabic coal eyeliner, and Italian cooking, among others. The designation can help drive tourism with people traveling to experience the cultural gems. Though, there's also the flip side of making something too popular. A journalist coined the term UNESCO side for that, when crowds can overrun something that's made the UN lists. So, let's just all be mindful and don't everybody go yodelling all at once.</p>

### 新闻测验

“好的。你看到西雅图国际足联世界杯委员会刚做了什么吗？本周，即将到来的世界杯引发了争议，特别是关于六月将在西雅图举行的一场埃及与伊朗之间比赛的主题。两国球队官员最近表示，他们对该主题感到愤怒，并认为围绕它的庆祝活动和展示应被取消。这场比赛的计划主题是什么？”答案是：一场世界杯骄傲赛（World Cup pride match）。涉及伊朗和埃及的LGBTQ骄傲活动。在两国，同性恋是非法的，人们可能面临严厉惩罚。国际足联（FIFA）尚未对这场由当地组织者选定主题的骄傲赛发表评论。国际足联禁止球员支持任何政治或社会问题。在上一届卡塔尔世界杯之前，它曾警告球员不要穿彩虹装备支持同性恋权利，并表示他们可能会被出示黄牌。

“特朗普总统经常谈论要在美国迎来黄金时代，我指的是交通运输的黄金时代。本周，交通部长Shawn Duffy和卫生部长Robert F. Kennedy Jr.提出了一个关于美国机场的非同寻常的想法。他们说，应该为人们在等待航班时提供一个空间来做什么。”提示。是的，看起来不错。是的。二。三。Duffy在宣布这一想法时，在弗吉尼亚州的一家机场演示了这项活动。“答案是：Duffy和Kennedy希望设立健身站，让人们可以在候机厅锻炼身体。这发生在Duffy还曾呼吁美国人在乘飞机时穿着更得体，以提升整体格调之后。所以，我猜你得准备好与一位刚在头等舱里做了30个引体向上、穿着羊绒衫的汗流浃背的邻座乘客同行了。”
