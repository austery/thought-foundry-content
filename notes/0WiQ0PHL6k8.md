title: 英伟达回应谷歌TPU挑战，戴尔财报超预期，市场情绪回暖
---

### 市场概览与财报预告

好了，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘节目。我们正在直播，今天是11月25日，星期二。朋友们，今天我们有一大堆财报要公布，接下来的15分钟内，我们会逐一分析这些财报更新。我们有利好消息的公司包括戴尔、Workday、CleanSpark、Autodesk、惠普以及其他几家公司。我刚刚在聊天区发起了一个投票，看看你们认为哪家公司会表现出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. It is Tuesday, November 25th. Folks, we got a bunch of earnings today that we're going to go through in the next 15 minutes as we get those earnings updates. We got Dell, Workday, CleanSpark, Autodesk, HP, and a couple other names. I'm putting a poll right here in the chat to see which one you guys think outperforms.</p>
</details>

我们还关注英伟达的故事，并且在这方面有很多新的进展。事实上，如果你今天早些时候在英伟达上小试牛刀，你现在已经得到了回报。英伟达目前股价为177.52美元，收复了相当一部分的跌幅，此前一度跌至169美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've got a lot of updates in terms of what happened with that story. In fact, if you took a bit of a stab here on Nvidia early in the day, you are being rewarded. Nvidia right here at 177.52 recovering a decent chunk of loss, it got to 169.</p>
</details>

（技术调整）不管怎样，是的，我是个新手主播。你可能会觉得我做这个已经很久了，但实际上我快要做满三年了。到2026年初，我做这个就满三年了，但我们每天还是会犯错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, yes, rookie streamer. You think I do this after, you know, I'm coming on three years on doing this. This is going to be by starting 2026 be three years of doing this and every day we still make a mistake.</p>
</details>

总之，英伟达股价为177.42美元。我今天早上在170.8美元的位置抄了一点底。我知道聊天室里有很多人，我想当 Jose 在线的时候，股价跌到了169美元，很多人都在那个价位抄了底。现在股价已经收复了相当一部分跌幅。我们有一些关于股价回升原因的分析，稍后会在第二个视频中详细说明。目前股价仍下跌约2.8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, Nvidia 177.42. I did buy the dip a little bit at 170.8. Bought that live this morning. I know a bunch of you in the chat. I think when Jose was on, we got to 169 and a bunch of people bought that dip at 169. Recovering a decent amount of the dip. We have some reasons for why they're recovering some of the dip and we'll in a second video right there. Still down about 2.8.</p>
</details>

### 标普500指数反弹，市场广度扩大

至于标普500指数，我们已经收复了**50日移动平均线**（50-day moving average: 一种技术分析工具，通过计算特定时期内（此处为50天）的平均股价来平滑价格数据，以识别趋势方向）。我再说一遍，我们已经收复了50日移动平均线。但我们还没有完全脱离险境。稍后 Jason 会加入我们，进入“技术星期二”环节，听听他对各种不同股票移动平均线走势的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P, we have reclaimed the 50-day moving average. Let me repeat, we have reclaimed the 50-day moving average. We are not out of the woods yet. We will have Jason on later and we'll get into technical Tuesday and get his thoughts on what's going on with the moving averages on a variety of different names.</p>
</details>

标普500指数今天上涨了1%。记住，昨天我们上涨了1.5%。这意味着在过去的48小时内，市场上涨了2.5%。上周五，我们从高点下跌了5%。现在我们已经收复了50%的跌幅。如果再上涨1%，就几乎收复了75%的跌幅。所以，这是标普500指数非常好的价格走势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the fact that the S&P is up 1% on the day. Remember yesterday we were up 1.5%. That means in the past 48 hours, that is a 2 and a half% move. We were down 5% from the highs last Friday. We are recovering 50% of what we were down. If we get another 1% move, it's recovering almost 75% of what we're down. So, this is really good price action to see from the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

你正看到市场上涨的广度在扩大，而不仅仅是由科技股带动。因为标普500指数中最重要的公司，占整个指数8.3%的英伟达，下跌了2.7%，但标普500指数却上涨了。那么是什么在领涨呢？联合健康（UNH）上涨了2.4%。谷歌虽然没到330美元，但仍上涨了1.24%，表现不错。Meta 股价635美元，当天上涨3.6%。Arista、思科、博通也都在上涨。除了英伟达，还有各种不同的公司加入了上涨行列。甚至Robinhood（Hoodie）也涨到了116.55美元，盘中一度接近117美元。所以看到市场广度有所扩大，非常令人兴奋，标普500指数也因此达到了675点。苹果公司当天也触及280美元，现在从280美元略有回落，报277.54美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You are seeing it broaden out a bit and not just being led by tech because the most important company in the S&P 500 that is 8.3% of the entire index is down 2.7% but the S&P 500 is up. So what's leading it? UNH that's up 2.4%. Google not at 330 but still up 1.24% so not too bad. Meta 635 that's up 3.6% on the day. You got Arista that's up. Cisco that's up. Broadcom that's up. They have a variety of different names coming into the picture outside of just Nvidia. Even Hoodie is getting 116.55. Hood almost got to 117. So very exciting to see a little bit more of the broadening out and as a result the S&P 500 right there at 675. Apple as well touched 280 on the day. A little bit down from that 280 now at 277.54.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达回应谷歌TPU挑战

很高兴看到苹果也获得了一些上涨动力。那么今天到底发生了什么？英伟达和谷歌的故事又是怎么回事？我们将深入探讨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nice to see that Apple is getting some of that momentum. So what happened today and what is going on with this Nvidia Google story? And we're going to get deeper into it.</p>
</details>

（技术调整）我认为今天的第一件大事是英伟达做出了回应。正是因为英伟达的回应，市场才稍微安定下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so I think the first thing today was that Nvidia responded. Nvidia responded and as a result of Nvidia responding, that was at least what got the market to be a little bit taken care of.</p>
</details>

那么英伟达说了什么？他们发布了一份完整的声明作为回应。他们说：“我们为谷歌的成功感到高兴。他们在人工智能领域取得了巨大进步，我们将继续为谷歌供货。英伟达领先行业一代。它是唯一能够运行所有AI模型，并且在任何计算环境中都能做到的平台。” 他们还表示，英伟达提供的性能、通用性和可替代性都优于**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 为特定用途设计的集成电路），后者是为特定AI框架和功能设计的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what did Nvidia say? They issued a full-on statement with their response. They said, "We're delighted by Google's success. They've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google. Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry. It's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done." Um, and Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks and functions.</p>
</details>

英伟达今天发布的这份声明，正如 Robert 在聊天中所说，就像在说：“我为你们感到高兴，但我们更强。” 这件事已经被各种方式做成了表情包，因为这确实有点好笑。英伟达就像在说：“嘿，恭喜谷歌。我们很高兴你们做得这么好，但我们还在这里。” 这至少让市场稍微冷静了下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that announcement coming out today by Nvidia. Yeah, as Robert says in the chat, Nvidia is like, I'm so happy for you guys, but we're better. I mean, it's been memed in a variety of different ways because obviously it's kind of funny. Nvidia is like, hey, congrats Google. We love that you're doing so well, but you know, we're still here. That got the market to at least calm down a little bit.</p>
</details>

### 市场对英伟达回应的多元解读

我知道很多人持看空观点，他们会说：“英伟达为什么要回应？他们是一家4万亿美元的公司。他们发信说自己不是下一个安然。他们回应 Michael Burry。他们为什么要回应这些**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路）？” 我认为，从核心上讲，我们必须记住 Deepseek 事件。我还记得当时我们直播时，英伟达就 Deepseek 发表了一句声明，基本上是说需求只增不减。所以，他们实际上是在暗示“抄底吧”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I know there's the bear case from a lot of people saying, "Why the hell is Nvidia responding? They're a $4 trillion company. They're sending letters saying that they're not the next Enron. They're responding to Michael Burry. Why are they responding to these TPUs?" I think at its core, we got to remember what happened with Deepseek. I still remember when we were live and Nvidia issued like a one-sentence statement on Deepseek and basically they were like reasoning demand is only going up. So, I mean implicitly they were like buy the dip.</p>
</details>

我认为这就是黄仁勋（Jensen）在这种事情发生时的态度。黄仁勋希望采取主动攻势，尽管从表面上看这似乎是一种防御性举动。他想把自己的观点传达出去，你不能怪他。他是一家数万亿美元公司的CEO。他明白整个经济和整个人工智能交易都压在英伟达的肩上。所以，他站出来回应，并希望积极应对，尽管有些人可能会对此产生错误的看法，但我认为这并非世界上最疯狂的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, I think this is what Jensen's sort of attitude is when this type of stuff happens. Jensen wants to be on the offense, although it might perceptually seem like it's a defensive move. He wants to get his perspective out there, and you can't blame him. He's a CEO of a multi-trillion dollar company. He understands that the entire economy and the entire AI trade is resting on Nvidia's shoulders. So, for him to come out with a response and want to actively respond, although you're going to have some people perceive it in the wrong way. I don't think that's the craziest idea in the world.</p>
</details>

因此，英伟达的抛售并没有那么猛烈，大约下跌了2.4%。它一度下跌了近8%。市场显然抄了底，他们认为这不会是什么大问题。标普500指数目前在675点。我今天早上读到的所有分析师报告，无论是美国银行还是伯恩斯坦，都表示：“嘿，我们认为你应该购买英伟达、博通和AMD。我们不认为谷歌会凭借这些TPU占领整个市场。这些是我们应该警惕的事情，但不应该害怕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the Nvidia sell-off, I mean, not being as aggressive as a sell-off, down about 2.4%. It was down almost 8% at one point. The market obviously bought the dip and they didn't think it was going to be that big of a deal. S&P 500 right there 675. All the analyst reports I read this morning whether it's Bank of America, Bernstein, all of them came out and said, "Hey, we think you should buy Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD. We don't think Google is just going to take over the entire market with these TPUs. These are things we should be cautious of, but it's not something we should be scared of."</p>
</details>

然后，谷歌 DeepMind 的一位研究科学家，他是谷歌 TPU 的首席协同设计师之一，也就是引发这次市场波动的那个东西，有人说这是一个完全不理性的市场，他引用了一条关于英伟达、AMD、甲骨文等芯片股（除了甲骨文）当天全线下跌的帖子。这位名叫 Amir Yazdan 的人说，这次抛售显示了市场对硬件和需求是多么无知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you had a Google DeepMind research scientist who works as a head co-designer on the TPUs at Google the thing that's been causing all this market volatility and someone said this is a completely irrational market and they were quote tweeting a post of Nvidia AMD Oracle all being down on the day all the chip stocks outside of Oracle and this guy Amir Yazdan says the sell-off shows how clueless the market is about hardware and demand.</p>
</details>

所以，你看到一个真正在谷歌从事 TPU 协同设计工作的人说市场是愚蠢的，因为需求如此之大，数据中心的整体建设是如此必然。是的，如果这个 TPU 项目开始成功，并且他们能让其他超大规模云服务商加入（这是一个很大的假设），谷歌可能会占据一部分市场。但即便如此，好吧，就算拿走英伟达10%的收入，也许这会让股价下跌一点。但市场上90%的需求仍然需要被满足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you've got someone literally from Google who if we go to his profile right here works on TPU codesigns at the company saying the market is stupid because there is so much demand there is so much inevitability of overall data center buildout that yeah Google's going to take a chunk of that market or Google potentially can take a chunk of that market if this TPU thing starts to succeed and they get other hyperscalers on board which is a big if. But even if that's the case, all right, take away 10% of Nvidia's revenues and yeah, maybe that dips the stock a little bit. 90% of the market still needs to be fulfilled.</p>
</details>

标普500指数创下当日新高676点，英伟达也参与其中。所以，我不知道，老兄。今天整个下跌感觉并不像人们想象的那么严重。看看Meta，上涨了3.8%，达到636美元。它可能是从获得更便宜的TPU而非GPU中受益，市场可能喜欢这一点。但随后英伟达试图回到178美元，或许能收复今天失去的一些势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P 500 high of day at 676 and that enters in Nvidia. So, I don't know, dude. Like the entire dip today, it's just felt like it's not as serious as maybe people thought it needed to be. Meta, look at that. Up 3.8% 636 on today. That one being a beneficiary potentially of getting some cheaper um TPUs versus GPUs and the market potentially liking that. But then Nvidia trying to get back to 178 and maybe recover on some of the momentum that we lost today.</p>
</details>

我读了很多不同的观点。肯定有很多人对这个TPU的事情持悲观态度。我只是认为这不足以削弱英伟达的护城河。所以，从这个角度来看，我认为长期来看这是没问题的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, I read a lot of different perspectives. You definitely have a ton of people that are bearish on this TPU thing. I just think it's not enough to discount Nvidia's mode. And so, from that perspective, I think that this is going to be okay over the long term.</p>
</details>

### 宏观数据与市场情绪

其他一些宏观数据。距离收盘还有六分钟。我们有大量的财报。我甚至不知道今天有这么多财报，但确实有很多。英伟达股价回到178美元。首先，盈透证券（Interactive Brokers）显示今天交易最活跃的股票是：英伟达、特斯拉、AMD、Palantir、Meta、谷歌、TQQQ、QQQ、亚马逊和SOXL（杠杆半导体ETF）。散户投资者仍然坚守科技股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A couple other macro stats. We got six minutes until the market closes. We have a ton of earnings. I didn't even know we had these many earnings today, but we do have a ton of different earnings. Nvidia right there back to 178. First of all, Interactive Brokers showing the most actively traded names today. Nvidia, Tesla, AMD, Palantir, Meta, Google, TQQQ, QQQ, Amazon, and SOXL, which is the leveraged semiconductors ETF. Retail is sticking with technology.</p>
</details>

因此，面对一些人工智能泡沫的担忧，尽管标普500指数开始从之前的恐惧中恢复，人工智能交易又重新活跃起来，你开始看到更多的动力涌入这些股票。我相信我们聊天室里的很多人，今天早上我们中的许多人都买了英伟达，我们是那些基本上说“我们要抄底”的散户中的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, in the face of some of these AI bubble concerns, although the S&P 500 is starting to recover some of the fears that it had before, that AI trade comes back on and you're starting to see some more momentum head into those names. I'm sure plenty of us in the chat, you know, many of us in this morning um bought Nvidia and we were part of that part of retail that essentially said, "Hey, we're going to buy the dip on this."</p>
</details>

这也与这张图表相符。期权市场活动持续飙升。上周，标普500指数期权的日均名义交易额达到了创纪录的3.5万亿美元。根据高盛的数据，上周的期权交易量创下历史新高，达到9500万份合约。这绝对是惊人的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it and it goes forward to this graph right here as well. Options market activity continues to skyrocket. The average daily notional trading volume in the S&P 500 options hit a record $3.5 trillion last week. The highest options volume in history according to Goldman Sachs was last week 95 million contracts. I mean it's absolutely exceptional.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为市场中的那种“动物精神”和兴奋情绪，尽管上周是糟糕的一周，很多人的投资组合都出现了下跌，但有很多人抄了底，也有很多人可能在他们觉得超卖的股票上买了一些看涨合约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think the sort of animal spirits and the excitement in the markets although last week was an ugly week and you had a lot of people that took a downfall in their portfolios. Um, you had a lot of people buy the dip and you had a lot of people probably buy some lead contracts on these names that they felt were a bit too oversold.</p>
</details>

英伟达股价177.83美元，苹果277美元，Meta 636美元，当天上涨3.8%。标普500指数试图收于675点。如果我们能收于675点以上，那将是非常好的。然后是Robinhood。礼来公司（Eli Lilly）又上涨了3%，市值远超1万亿美元。Nebius 当天下跌约3.4%。Iron 下跌约2.4%。Core 一度下跌10%，现在只下跌了3.5%。所以一些数据中心相关的股票仍然受到冲击，因为英伟达下跌了，但受到的冲击没有早上英伟达跌破170美元时那么严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Nvidia right there 177.83, Apple at 277, Meta 636 up 3.8% on the day. S&P 500 trying to go for that 675 close. If we closed above 675, it would be very nice to see. Uh, and then you got Robinhood right here. Eli Lilly up another 3% now well above that $1 trillion market cap. Nebius down about 3.4% on the day. Iron down about 2.4%. Core was down 10% now. It's only down 3.5. So some of the data center names still getting hit as Nvidia is down but not getting hit as badly as they were before earlier in the morning when Nvidia was below 170 at one point.</p>
</details>

再说一次，跌破170美元不仅仅是心理上的“哦天哪，跌破170了，这很糟糕”。而是在财报发布后，英伟达今天市值蒸发了近4000亿美元，这才是最令人惊讶的部分。考虑到我们现在看到的某种程度的复苏，我认为有些人只是觉得英伟达的跌势可能已经足够了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again the below 170 is not just like a psychological like oh my goodness it's below 170 that's bad. It's after those earnings for Nvidia to dump basically $400 billion in market cap today is the most surprising part. And given somewhat of the recovery that we're seeing, I think you have some people that just said enough was probably enough when it came to Nvidia.</p>
</details>

MSNBC曾报道称特朗普将解雇卡什·帕特尔（Kash Patel）。白宫出面表示情况并非如此。事实上，他们还拍了一张特朗普和卡什·帕特尔的合影，并称这是假新闻。所以，对于那些想知道我们是否会有一位新FBI局长的人来说，根据白宫的说法，这似乎不会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh there was a report by MSNBC that Kash Patel was going to be fired by Trump. Uh the White House came out and said that's not the case. In fact, they took a picture of Trump and Kash Patel together and they said that was fake news. So for those wondering if we're going to get a new FBI director, seems like that is not going to happen as per what the White House said.</p>
</details>

今天早上的就业市场数据并不理想。我们看到 ADP 私营部门就业人数减少了13500个，这实际上将降息的概率提高到了82.7%。昨天这个数字还是75%。所以降息的几率增加了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, the job market this morning, we looked at some of that data and it wasn't the best. Uh we had 13,500 jobs to the negative that we saw from ADP private payrolls, which actually increased the rate cut probabilities to now 82.7%. This was at 75% yesterday. So you got an increase on those rate cut odds.</p>
</details>

多位美联储主席发表了讲话。事实上，前达拉斯联储主席两小时前表示，如果他还在委员会，他会投票支持降息。他的论点是，劳动力市场是我们不能忽视的，不能仅仅因为通胀可能出现逐步上升就置之不理。尽管今天早上的PPI数据中通胀确实有逐步上升，但比9月份的预期要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had a bunch of Fed presidents come out. In fact, the former Dallas Fed president two hours ago said if he was on the committee, he would vote to cut rates. His argument was the labor market is something that we cannot ignore just because there might be a gradual increase in inflation which there was a gradual increase in inflation in this morning's PPI data although it was better than expectations for September.</p>
</details>

大约一小时前，我们得到了美国10月份预算赤字的另一组数据，为2840亿美元。2024年10月，赤字为2570亿美元。所以，这额外增加了300亿美元。美国10月份的预算支出为6890亿美元，而2024年10月为5840亿美元。我们从关税中获得了多少收入？314亿美元，而2024年为73亿美元。所以我们的关税收入增加了4倍多，但赤字却增加了300亿美元，因为我们的支出仍然远远超过我们的收入，即使在关税收入增加了4倍之后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we got some other data about an hour ago from the October budget deficit for the United States. 284 billion. In October of 2024, the deficit was 257 billion. So, that's 30 billion extra. US October budget outlays 689 billion versus 584 billion. In October 2024, how much did we bring in from tariffs? 31.4 billion versus 7.3 billion in 2024. So we increased the tariff revenues by more than 4x but the deficit increased by 30 billion because we are still spending way more than we are bringing in even after 4xing the custom duties that were bringing in from tariffs.</p>
</details>

这意味着国家显然存在支出问题，而讽刺的是，这对**比特币**（Bitcoin: 一种去中心化的数字货币）来说是看涨的理由，尽管比特币的表现并非如此。Bitmine 当天下跌约6.4%。比特币一度达到89000美元，现在是87400美元。但即使关税收入增加，赤字仍在持续扩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which means obviously the country has a spending problem and ironically that is your bull case for Bitcoin even though Bitcoin's not acting like that. Bit mine right there is down on the day by about 6.4%. Bitcoin right here was at 89 at one point now at 87.4 but you do have that deficit that continues to widen even with the increase of custom receipts that we are getting in from the tariffs.</p>
</details>

### 财报季速览

Reddit 今天也表现出色。我不知道 Reddit 有什么头条新闻，但哇，上涨了12%。相当惊人。Reddit 上涨了12%，距离收盘还有两分钟。标普500指数675点，Duolingo 今天也上涨了1.78%。英伟达今天可能会收跌，但会高于早上时的低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Reddit as well great day. I don't know what the headline is on Reddit but wow 12%. Pretty incredible. 12% right there on Reddit as we have two minutes into the close. S&P 500 675, Duolingo even is up today 1.78% and then Nvidia is probably going to be red on the day but will be higher than where it was earlier in the morning.</p>

如果非要我选，我猜我也会选戴尔。我对这些公司不是特别了解。再说，戴尔在两三周前已经大幅提高了他们的盈利预测。那时候股价上涨了大约7%。所以，我认为他们能继续表现出色吗？是的。对于戴尔来说，利润率总是个问题，但尽管如此，它会是今天一个重要的关注点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, if I had to pick, I guess I would pick Dell as well. Uh I don't know these names as intimately. Then again, Dell already increased a lot of their earnings projections um last week or not last week, like two, three weeks ago. That's when the stock was up like 7%. So, do I think they could continue to outperform? Yes. The margins always become an issue when it comes to Dell, but nonetheless, that one would be an important one for the day.</p>
</details>

网络安全公司最近表现其实相当不错。我是说，CrowdStrike 几周前创下历史新高，Palo Alto 我知道他们下跌了，但他们也进行了一些盘整。甚至特斯拉的419美元看起来也会收涨。所以，想象一下它今天表现不错也并非不可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Zscaler, the cyber security names have actually been doing pretty well. I mean, Crowd Strike was hitting all time highs a couple weeks ago and PaloAlto, I know they went down, but they did have some consolidation as well. Even Tesla 419 looks like it's ending green. So, it wouldn't be crazy to imagine that that one has a good day.</p>
</details>

好了，我们开始吧。我们有一大堆财报。感谢大家的到来。我们将深入探讨这些财报，然后进入“技术星期二”环节，看看市场最终会如何收盘。11月25日，星期二，下午4点，股市现已收盘。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, here we go. We got a bunch of earnings. Thank you everybody for being here. We will get into these earnings and then we will get into technical Tuesday and we will see how this market ends up closing out. Tuesday, November 25th, 4 p.m. the stock market is now closed.</p>

### 市场收盘总结

好了，今天收盘了。这是相当不错的一天。在昨天上涨1.5%之后，标普指数今天又上涨了1%。所以两天累计上涨2.5%。考虑到上周的情况，我想没有人会对这样的表现感到太失望。标普500指数收于674.96点，当天上涨约0.95%。比特币87,000美元。以太坊2920美元。特斯拉419美元，当天仍上涨约0.32%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, we're done for the day. It is a pretty good day. Up 1% on the S&P after being up 1.5% yesterday. So 2.5%. I mean, I'll take it after the week we had last week. I don't think anyone can be too upset about that type of performance. S&P 500 right there 674.96 closes on the day green by about 0.95%. Bitcoin right there 87,000. Ethereum at 2920. Tesla 419 still up about.32% on the day.</p>
</details>

英伟达收盘价是177.82美元。我认为这是谷歌有史以来的最高收盘价，323美元，市值3.9万亿美元。它需要达到331.48美元才能达到4万亿美元的水平。Grab 当天基本持平。Rocket Lab 上涨约0.35%。美光上涨0.27%。SoFi 今天表现出色，上涨了3.5%。Robinhood 也一样，回到了115美元，盘后达到116美元，也上涨了0.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia did we get 177? We got 177.82 on Nvidia. I think this is Google's highest close ever at 323. $3.9 trillion market cap. It needs to be at $331.48 to get to that $4 trillion level. Grab right there was basically flat on the day. Rocket Lab was up about.35%. Micron up.27. SoFi actually had a great day up three and a half%. Same thing with Hoodie which got back to 115. 115.57, 116 after hours that was also up half a percent.</p>
</details>

联合健康（UNH）上涨了2%。Figma 当天持平。Coinbase 略有下跌。MicroStrategy 我想也略有下跌。是的，下跌了约3.4%。CrowdStrike 今天表现如何？上涨了1%。Lemonade 回到70美元区间，报74美元。Oscar Health 守住了昨天特朗普可能提议延长补贴所带来的 ACA（平价医疗法案）利好，上涨了1.49%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UNH was up 2%. Figma was flat on the day. Coinbase was slightly down. Micro Strategy I think was slightly down as well. MSTR yep down about 3.4%. Where is Crowd Strike on today? Crowd Strike was up 1%. Uh Lemonade back in the 70s, 74 on Lemonade. Oscar holding on to that ACA pump that we heard um yesterday with Trump extending or potentially proposing to extend those subsidies. So Oscar is up 1.49%.</p>
</details>

Zeta 提高了业绩指引，并保持了大约5%的涨幅。是的，上涨了3%。Nubank 也恭喜持有者，创下历史新高。我不知道今天的催化剂是什么，但他们几周前的财报非常出色。Nubank 股价16.61美元，当天上涨4.3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then Zeta increased guidance and Zeta kind of held on I think to about a 5% move. Yeah, 3% move on. New Bank also congrats to those in New Bank all-time highs. I don't know what the catalyst was today for this, but they had a great earnings a couple weeks ago. New bank right there 16.61 up 4.3% on the day for New Bank.</p>
</details>

Dan Ives 也与 Zeta 的 David Steinberg 进行了访谈。我看了一点那次访谈。所以 Zeta 在提高业绩指引后表现非常好。Nebius 下跌约3.3%。Chipotle 略有上涨。哇，Chipotle 当天上涨了7%。这看起来有点奇怪。我会试着找出 Chipotle 发生了什么。然后麦当劳上涨了约1.82%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Dan Ives also did sit down with David Steinberg from Zeta. I saw a little bit of that interview. Um, so you got Zeta having some really good performance on that increase of guidance. Nebius was down about 3.3%. Chipotle was up a little bit. Wow, Chipotle 7% on the day. That seems a little weird. I'll try to find out what happened with Chipotle. And then McDonald's was up about 1.82%.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报分析

好了，财报。我们来看看。Workday 盘后上涨。CleanSpark 盘后也上涨。CleanSpark 上涨了4.3%。Workday 上涨了4.3%。Autodesk 也上涨了4%。好了，一些公布的财报数字相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, earnings. Let's get into it. Uh, workday, that's green after hours. Clean Spark, that is also green after hours. Got CleanSpark up 4.3%. Workday is up uh 4.3%. Autodesk as well up 4%. All right, some of these earnings that are coming in, pretty decent numbers.</p>
</details>

Crowdstrike 今天没有财报，所以我们不会听到他们的消息。我们还将关注惠普和 NetApp。惠普盘后下跌。NetApp，那个还没有，哦，NetApp 也上涨了5%。哇，你看到几乎所有这些公司盘后都上涨了大约4%到5%。戴尔将是重头戏。哇，NetApp 上涨了6%。戴尔仍然持平。CleanSpark 上涨4%。Autodesk 上涨5%。CleanSpark 再次转型为一家人工智能公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Crowdstrike does not have earnings today, so we're not going to hear from Crowd Strike. We also have HP and NetApp that we'll be looking at as well. HP is red after hours. NetApp, that one don't have No, NetApp's also 5%. Wow, you got pretty much most of these names going green after hours by about four to 5%. Dell is going to be the big one. Wow. NetApp up 6%. Dell still flat. CleanSpark up four. Autodesk up five. CleanSpark again pivoted to be an AI company.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，Kohl's 当天上涨了42%。有人交易了这波行情吗？天哪，Kohl's 42%。Workday 上涨3%。然后 Autodesk 也上涨4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, uh Kohl's, by the way, was up 42% on the day. Did anyone trade that move? Goodness. Kohl's 42%. Workday up 3%. And then Autodesk up 4% as well.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，Vlad 的人工智能初创公司 Harmonic 刚刚又融资了1.2亿美元。所以现在它的估值是14.5亿美元。所以他不仅拥有 Robinhood，现在还拥有他的数学大语言模型公司，这基本上是一家独角兽公司，价值14.5亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Vlad's uh AI startup, Harmonic, just raised another 120 million. So now it's worth 1.45 billion. So not only does he have Robin Hood, but now he has his mathematical LLM company that is worth uh that's a unicorn basically 1.45 billion.</p>
</details>

好了，我们先看 Autodesk。他们在营收和每股收益上都超出了预期。每股收益超出7%，为2.67美元，预期为2.50美元。营收超出2%。营收同比增长18%。每股收益同比增长20%。Autodesk 上涨2.69%。所以这是一个双重超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Autodesk, let's look at that first. Autodesk, they beat on the top and the bottom. Beat by 7% on EPS. 2.67 versus 2.50. Beat by 2% on revenue. Revenue is up 18% year-over-year. EPS is up 20% year-over-year. Autodesk is up 2.69%. So that is a double beat.</p>
</details>

Abercrombie 今天也大涨。很多零售ETF（XRT）都经历了自2025年5月以来最好的一天。所以零售股今天表现非常强劲，我们早上也看了一些财报，比如 Best Buy 和 Burlington，表现也相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Abercrombie, yeah, massive day. A lot of the XRT, which is the retail ETF, had one of its best days since May of 2025. So we had a really strong day for the retail stocks and we looked at some of those earnings this morning with Best Buy in Burlington that were also pretty good.</p>
</details>

Workday 每股收益超出7%，为2.32美元，预期为2.17美元。营收为24亿美元，与预期持平。营收同比增长13%。每股收益同比增长23%。Workday 盘后上涨2.68%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Workday beat by 7% on EPS 2.32 versus 2.17. Revenue 2.4 versus 2.4. That was in line with expectations. Revenue is up 13%. EPS is up 23% year-over-year. Workday is up 2.68% after hours.</p>
</details>

戴尔上涨了2%。不，是1%。还没有他们的数字。CleanSpark 上涨了9%。我试着获取 CleanSpark 的数字看看。Nutanix 今天也有财报。这是另一家软件公司。他们的每股收益与预期持平，为41美分。营收为6.7亿美元，预期为6.76亿美元。营收……哇，Nutanix 下跌了11%。营收未达预期1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Dell is up 2%. No, it's up 1%. Don't have their numbers. Clean Sparks up 9%. I'll try to get Clean Sparks numbers and see what we've got there. Nutanix also had earnings today. This is another software company. They were in line with expectations on EPS 41 cents versus 41 cents. 670 versus 676 million on revenue. Revenue was wow. Nutanic's down 11%. Revenue missed by 1%.</p>
</details>

戴尔上涨了。我们上涨了吗？哦，我们有个跳涨。我们有个跳涨。让我们看看。戴尔上涨了5%。这是重头戏。这也对服务器机架、SMCI、潜在的英伟达需求等有影响。所以，这些都很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dell's up. Are we up? Oh, we got a pop. We got a pop. Let's see. Dell's up 5%. This is the big one. This also has implications for server racks, SMCI, potential Nvidia demand, etc. So, that stuff is important.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，CleanSpark 的每股收益未达预期100%。华尔街预期为44美分，他们实际为零。营收未达预期2%，但华尔街似乎并不太在意。Zscaler 刚刚转跌。我们稍后会看那些财报。Zscaler 下跌了7%。戴尔一度上涨6%，现在上涨2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cleansspark, by the way, they missed on EPS by 100%. Street wanted 44 cents, they came in at zero. They missed by revenue by 2% but Street somehow is not too upset. Zcaler just went red. We'll get those earnings in a second. Zcaler down 7%. Dell, it was up six. Now it's up two.</p>
</details>

Zscaler 在营收和每股收益上都超出了预期。每股收益超出12%，营收超出2%。营收同比增长26%，每股收益同比增长25%。营收为7.88亿美元，预期为7.73亿美元。每股收益为96美分，预期为86美分。所以 Zscaler 是双重超预期，但股价仍然下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zcaler beat on the top to bottom. Beat by 12% on EPS. beat by 2% on revenue. Revenue is up 26% year-over-year. EPS is up 25% year-over-year. 7.88 versus 7.73 on revs. 96 versus 86 cents on EPS. So, Zcaler at double beat, but still down.</p>
</details>

戴尔，我有他们的数字。他们的营收未达预期1%。270亿美元，预期为272亿美元。但每股收益超出预期4%。2.59美元，预期为2.48美元。所以是营收未达预期，每股收益超出预期。股价上涨了4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dell, I have their numbers. They missed on revenue by 1%. 27 billion versus 27.2. They beat on EPS by 4%. 2.59 versus 2.48. Uh, that's a beat and a miss. The stock is up 4% right here.</p>
</details>

我们来看看指引。指引可能是最重要的。戴尔预计2026财年调整后每股收益中点为9.92美元。华尔街的预期是9.55美元。这是利好。然后是2026财年的营收。哇。他们说低端是1110亿美元。华尔街的预期是1050亿到1090亿美元。高端是1120亿美元。所以他们2026年的营收至少超出30亿美元，每股收益预期超出约35到40美分。然而，股价并没有真正做出相应的反应，试图守住2%的涨幅，但仍然相对疲软。这是相当不错的指引，老兄。我们知道他们的指引会很好，基于他们几周前的投资者日。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's see the guidance. The guidance is probably the most important. Dell sees fiscal year 2026 adjusted EPS midpoint at 9.92. The street thought it was going to be 9.55. That's bullish. And then fiscal year revenue for 2026. Wow. They're saying 111 billion on the on the low end. Street thought it would be 105 to 109 on the high end. 112. So, they're beating by at least three billion on revenue for 2026, and they're beating by about 40 cents, 35 cents on EPS expectations for 2026. Yet, the stock is not really reciprocating as it's trying to hold a 2% move, but still relatively red. That's decent guidance, dude. And we know their guidance was going to be good based on the investor day they had a couple weeks ago.</p>
</details>

> 戴尔发布了一份喜忧参半的报告。每股收益强劲，为2.59美元，超出预期。但270.1亿美元的营收略低于预期。不过，毛利率为20.7%，超出了预期，尽管内存价格上涨，这在财报前引起了许多担忧。故事的重点在于其两大业务部门的分化。基础设施解决方案集团，即服务器、网络和存储业务，超出了预期，但客户端解决方案集团，即个人电脑和笔记本电脑业务，则略有不足。戴尔全面上调了业绩指引。他们现在预计全年营收在1112亿至1122亿美元之间，远高于华尔街的预期。同样，每股收益指引也更高，为9.92美元。最后，关于人工智能业务，首席财务官在新闻稿中表示，他们将人工智能出货量指引提高到约250亿美元，高于之前200亿美元的目标。我还看到头条新闻说，戴尔将与在加拿大运营数据中心的Iran合作。所以，也许该股没有市场反应，但两家公司将合作在加拿大建设数据中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Delivered a mixed report. Earnings came in strong at $2.59 per share, beating expectations. But revenues of 27.01 billion came in slightly light. Gross margins though 20.7% beating estimates despite these higher memory prices. Many concerns about that going into earnings. The story though was really about the split between their two main businesses. The infrastructure solutions group that's servers, networking, storage that it beat estimates, but the client solutions group which is PCs and laptops fell a little bit short. Dell raised guidance across the board. They're now expecting full-year revenue of 111.2 to 112.2 billion dollars. That's well above Wall Street estimates. And then the same thing for the earnings per share guidance. It also came in higher at $9.92. And lastly for AI exposure, the CFO saying in the release that they're raising their AI shipment guidance to roughly $25 billion, up from the previous $20 billion target. And I'm also seeing just on the headlines that Dell is going to be working with Iran, which is they operate data centers in Canada. So perhaps there's not really a market reaction in that stock, but the two will be working together to build data centers in Canada.</p>
</details>

Iran股价持平，我想我们早就知道Iran和戴尔的合作消息了。所以你可能不会看到疯狂的市场反应，但戴尔的财报确实相当不错。股价上涨了2%。

<p class="english-text">>> Iran flat, I think we already knew about the Iran Dell announcement a while ago. Um so you probably wouldn't get a crazy market reaction there, but again, these are some pretty good earnings by Dell. That's up 2%.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，CleanSpark，我这里有确切的数字。CleanSpark 的营收为7.66亿美元，同比增长102%。净利润为3.64亿美元，而去年同期为净亏损1.45亿美元。CEO表示：“我们正在演变成一个全面的计算平台，准备好从人工智能和比特币工作负载中优化价值。我们在电力采购、基础设施开发和高效扩展方面的深厚专业知识，使我们在满足全球对计算能力激增的需求方面具有独特优势。” 他们一周前也刚刚完成了可转换票据交易。所以，市场喜欢它。CleanSpark 上涨了7%。

<p class="english-text">By the way, CleanSpark, I have the actual numbers right here. CleanSpark brought in 766 million of revenue. That's up 102% year-over-year.

Our deep expertise in power procurement, infrastructure development, and efficient scaling gives us a unique advantage in meeting surging global demand for compute." They also just closed that convertible note transaction a week ago. So, uh, market likes it. CleanSpark right there, up 7%.</p>

### 市场情绪与分析师观点

> Dan Ives：我们谈论的第二、第三、第四层次的衍生效应才刚刚开始在人工智能革命中显现。我认为那些称之为泡沫的人，你知道，称之为泡沫很容易，因为你在电子表格中看不到它。我相信这是一轮科技牛市，还会再持续两年。看看Alphabet就是另一个例子。年初时，纽约的出租车司机都看空Alphabet。现在看看，因为现实是人工智能对他们来说是顺风。我们看到了这一点，甚至在博通和芯片领域看到的一切都是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What we're talking about the second, third, fourth derivatives are just starting to play out across the AI revolution. I think those that call it a bubble, you know, it's easy to call it a bubble because you don't see in the spreadsheet. I believe this is a tech bull market. It goes on another two years. Look at Alphabet is another example. New York City cab driver was bearish in Alphabet to start the year. Now look, because the reality is AI is a tailwind for them. We're seeing that, you know, even with Broadcom and, you know, everything we're seeing on the chip side.</p>
</details>

> 昨天总统签署了一项关于“创世纪使命”（Genesis mission）的行政命令。这是一个大型人工智能项目，将让人回想起二战后曼哈顿计划的岁月。这里是否有政府的支持？这是否是你应该买入这轮人工智能牛市的又一个理由？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, yesterday the president signed an executive order for Genesis mission. This is the big AI project that is going to hearken back to, you know, the post-World War II years of Manhattan project here. Is there a government back stop here? Is that one more reason why you should be buying into this bull market for AI?</p>
</details>

> Dan Ives：是的。看，我们在华盛顿特区花了很多时间，现实是，30年来第一次，美国在科技方面领先于中国。当我们看到大型科技公司的表现时，我认为有政府的支持，因为现实是，它由人工智能教父黄仁勋（Jensen）的英伟达领导，由微软领导，由我们从OpenAI看到的情况领导。看，关于“大到不能倒”的担忧和我们仍然存在的一些顾虑，就像我们谈到的，我们正处于这场人工智能游戏的第三局上半，也许一人出局。我认为这轮科技牛市还有两年时间，这确实仍然是我们所有调查的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And look, I mean, as we spend so much time in DC, the reality is for the first time in 30 years, US is ahead of China when it comes to tech and when it comes to what we've seen from big tech, I think there is a government backside because the reality is is that it's led by godfather of AI, Jensen, Nvidia. It's led by Microsoft. It's led from what we see with OpenAI. And look, the worries about the too big to fail and some of the concerns we are still, like we talked about, we're top of the third, maybe one out in terms of this AI game. And I think we have two more years left in this tech bull market and it that really continues to be the core here from all of our checks.</p>
</details>

> 我想回到Alphabet，因为它现在的交易价格创下历史新高。Gemini 3在多大程度上改变了游戏规则？总体而言，技术在赢家和输家方面变化有多快？作为投资者，如何衡量和思考这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I just want to go back to Alphabet as it does trade at a record high right now and that is how much of a game-changer is Gemini 3 and how quickly is the technology changing in general in terms of winners and losers like how to gauge that how to think about that as an investor?</p>
</details>

> Dan Ives：是的，因为他们真的有好几年都处于困境。现在你看到了Gemini带来的重大变化，最终我认为苹果会和他们走上红毯，建立Gemini合作关系，这将成为他们的AI部分。然后你再看看芯片领域发生的事情，看看各部分的总和。看，我可以认为Alphabet还有80美元的上涨空间，相对于尚未计入故事中的AI部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, because back was against the wall for really for a few years. Now you're seeing a major change there from Gemini and ultimately I think Apple that's really going to walk down the aisle with them from a Gemini partnership that's going to be their AI piece. And then you look what's happening on chips. You look at the sum of the part. Look, I could argue Alphabet, you have another $80 upside relative to the AI piece that's not factored in yet into the story.</p>
</details>

如果真是这样，谷歌的股价将达到400美元，这将是相当惊人的。顺便说一句，微软当天也几乎没有上涨。如果我们进入2026年，微软、亚马逊和Meta的市盈率都处于多年来的最低水平，这对Meta和亚马逊来说是肯定的。微软刚刚开始进入那个更便宜的类别，因为它今年大部分时间都在520美元左右。那么，2026年的计划就是做多三家估值最低的“七巨头”吗？是这个计划吗？因为我不讨厌这个计划。如果2026年你只需要购买三家便宜的“七巨头”——微软、亚马逊和Meta，然后就可以坐下来放松，那生活就变得相当简单了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, if that's the case, you got Google at a $400 stock, which would be quite incredible. By the way, Microsoft as well, barely up on the day. I mean, if we're going into 2026 with Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta trading at some of their lowest multiples in years, definitely for um Meta and Amazon. Microsoft just started getting into that cheaper category given it was basically at like 520 for the majority of the year. I mean, is the plan for 2026 to just go long the three most undervalued Magnificent 7? Like, is that the plan? Because I don't hate that plan. That that that makes life pretty easy in 2026 if like you have to buy three cheap Magnificent 7s, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, and you can kind of just sit back and chill.</p>

### 零售业的意外强劲表现

Urban Outfitters。哇，上涨了17%。各位，如果你们今天关注零售业的财报，会发现它们表现非常好。这与主流叙事相悖。再说一次，XRT，这是零售ETF，今天上涨了5%。这与消费者疲软的叙事相悖。如果消费者有钱在Urban Outfitters消费，也许他们并没有那么疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Urban Outfitters. Wow. 17%. Guys, if you've been looking at the retail earnings today, they've been really good. And that is going against the narrative. Again, XRT, this is the retail ETF. It was up 5% today. That is going against the narrative that the consumer is weak. If the consumer has money to spend at Urban Outfitters, maybe they're not that weak.</p>
</details>

> 我们将把这加入到零售股又一个好季度中。股价上涨了15%，接近16%。Urban Outfitters的盈利强于预期，为每股1.28美元，预期为1.20美元。营收也强于预期，为15.3亿美元，市场普遍预期为14.7亿美元。第三季度可比销售额增长8%，远好于预期的5%。Urban Outfitters，就是那个同名品牌，可比销售额增长了12.5%。这比华尔街的预期好三倍。

Third quarter comparable sales up 8% well better than the 5% expected. Urban Outfitters. So just that brand, the namesake brand comps up 12 and a half%. That's three times as good as what the street was.</p>

天哪，同店销售额增长了300%。这都是因为圣诞节吗？不，这是第三季度。这不是第四季度。这是七月、八月、九月。这对这些零售股来说真是个好日子。Burlington、Best Buy，现在是Urban Outfitters。这真的与消费者疲软的说法相悖，至少对其中一些股票是这样。

> 惠普第四季度财报显示，盈利和营收均超出预期。与个人系统和打印相关的营收高于市场普遍预期，但第一季度的指引弱于预期。公司还宣布裁员4000至6000人，并计划到2028财年底，通过更广泛地采用人工智能，总共节省约10亿美元的成本。首席执行官恩里克·洛雷斯（Enrique Lores）告诉CNBC，这将有助于加速公司的产品开发。他补充说，他的团队正在对其指引采取审慎的态度。关于内存价格上涨的问题，他说惠普正在采取积极行动，比如寻找成本更低的供应商，并且也将考虑提高自己产品的价格。股价下跌约6.5%。

### AI对劳动生产率的潜在影响

我想向大家展示最后一件事。Anthropic 今天发布了一项新研究，称当前的人工智能模型可以使美国劳动生产率年增长约1.8%，这将是2019年以来平均工资增长的两倍。我们迫切需要这种增长，才能跟上标普500指数所暗示的盈利增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One last thing I want to show everybody. There was a study that Anthropic put out today, some new research saying that current AI models could lift US labor productivity growth by about 1.8% a year, which would be double the average pay since 2019. And we desperately need that to be able to keep up the earnings growth that the S&P 500 is implying.</p>
</details>

该研究分析了10万次真实的Claude对话，发现人工智能将任务时间缩短了约80%，一些医疗保健任务的缩短幅度接近90%。用户通常要求Claude处理需要约1.4小时、耗费约55美元劳动力的工作。所有这些都通过公司支付给Claude的每月约200美元的订阅费实现了自动化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The study looked at a 100,000 real Claude conversations and found that AI cut tasks by around 80% with some healthcare tasks closer to 90%. Users were typically asking Claude to handle work that would take about 1.4 hours and cost around $55 in labor. All of that automated for like 200 bucks a month or whatever subscription that the company is paying to Claude.</p>
</details>

随着人工智能在未来十年内渗透到整个经济中，并且劳动力约占生产率的60%，研究人员估计全要素生产率每年可能上升约1.1%。再说一次，这些只是初步研究。如果这与市场在整体劳动生产率增长方面的预期相符，那将是市场一直在寻找的人工智能带来的整体宏观GDP投资回报。在未来几年，我们将看到这是否会成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With AI diffusing across the economy over the next decade and labor making up roughly 60% of productivity. The researchers estimate total factor productivity could rise about 1.1% a year. And again, these are just the initial studies. I mean, if this is anything like what the market is expecting in terms of overall labor productivity growth, that is going to be the overall macro GDP ROI for AI that the market has been looking for. And over the coming years, we're going to see if that ends up playing out.</p>

### 技术星期二：标普500指数分析

Amit: 这是一个相当惊人的一天。我是说，昨天反弹1.5%，今天反弹1%。我想我们从标普指数开始，深入分析一下。但你曾警告过一些移动平均线。我想672，不，我想675是你说我们必须收复并收盘的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's been a pretty incredible day. I mean 1% rebound 1.5% yesterday. I think let's start with the S&P and get into it. But you warned of some of these moving averages. I think 672 No, I think 675 was your level that we had to reclaim and kind of close.</p>
</details>

Jason: 是的。所以我今天发了几条帖子，我想在我们开始之前，这很有趣，因为我上周发帖说，“嘿，注意我的推文，我会发一些东西。” 所以我们现在很接近了。坦白说，我真的很喜欢现在的价格走势。我真的很喜欢我们现在的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, I posted a couple things today and I I think before we even get into it, it was funny because I posted last week I was like, "Hey, pay attention to the stream or the the threat, I guess. What do you call this? your your ex feed and I'll post a couple things. So, we're we're close right now. I actually really like this price action quite frankly. Like I really like where we are.</p>
</details>

但此时此地，如果我调出上周的直播，字面上就是这个时刻。所以上周我们说，这个时刻就是当我们到达这里时的时刻。就是这个时刻，如果你之前在650点低位时感到担忧，我们将会到达这里，字面上就是这里，675点。我们现在就在这里，正中目标。这个时刻我们必须说，嘿，看，如果你是那个当时担忧的人，现在就是你应该采取措施的时刻。我不是说卖出，说清楚点，我不是那个意思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But right here, right now, if I pulled up our last week's kind of uh like not this week, but last week's maybe stream. And and and it's it's literally this moment. So last week we're like this moment is the moment when we get here. This is the moment that if you were worried before when we were at the lows at 650s, we're going to get here literally exactly here 675. Here we are smack on the dot. And and this is the moment that we have to say, hey, look, if you were that person who was worried then, this is that moment where you should probably take measures. I don't mean sell, just to be crystal clear. I don't mean that.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，嘿，你现在有了一个喘息的机会。你会被这个时刻冲昏头脑吗？你会以为我们要重返月球，然后过于兴奋吗？还是我会忘记刚刚发生的一切，顺便说一句，那只是两个交易日之前的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what I do mean is like, hey, you have a reprieve here and now. Are you going to get caught up in this moment? And are you going to get caught up thinking we're going to go back to the moon? I'm overly enthusiastic. Or am I gonna am I gonna forget about and and I'm forgetting about everything that just happened literally, by the way, two two days ago.</p>
</details>

因为情绪突然转变了。还是我会说，“等一下。让我在这里点击几个按钮，确保我不会再有那种感觉。” 这就是我的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because sentiment has shifted all of the sudden. Um or or am I going to actually say, "Hang on a second. Let me let me let me click a couple buttons here and make sure that I don't feel that way again." So that's that's kind of where I'm at.</p>
</details>

Jason: 这看起来不错。我想，所以让我快速分享一下屏幕。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> that said, this looks good. I I think you know, so let me uh let me go ahead and screen share really quick, I guess.</p>
</details>

Jason: 这个红色的盒子，是SPY（标普500 ETF）想要居住的盒子。当我两周前谈到这些SMA（简单移动平均线）时，我非常清楚地说明了它们不是所谓的支撑和阻力。这是一个很大的误解，关于这些东西如何运作，它们更像是磁铁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um so this this this red box here, this is the box that we live in. When I talked two weeks ago about these SMAs or smoothing moving averages, I wanted to be very clear about them not being like quote unquote support and resistance. It's a very big misnomer about like how these things act and they act very much like magnets.</p>
</details>

它们是磁铁，价格会被它们吸引。这就是这里发生的一切。就像磁铁被极性吸进去一样，要么被推开，要么被吸回来，二者之一。你可以通过近期的价格行为看到这一点。当我们回来时，我说，嘿，看，这是一个中间形态，不是顶部，是底部，双重底。我们将要反弹回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like it's magnets and they get price gets attracted to them and that's all that's happening over here. It's like a magnets gets sucked in like with the polarity, right? So pushed away or sucked back in, one of the two. And you can look at that by the by the near-term price action. And as we were coming back in, look, I'm like, hey, look, this is a, you know, a mids pattern, not a top, it's a bottom, um, double bottom. and and we were going to pop right back up.</p>
</details>

我认为这会形成一个小小的向上突破，就像躲猫猫一样。让我们看看这会是什么样子。我认为我们明天可能会在这个箱体之外开盘。但明天重要的是，如果我们能守住，我们是否真的能守在上面。两周前，我总是说，任何一个技术星期二，总是关于在这些箱体之外的多次收盘和开盘，对吧？特别是非农就业数据日。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think, is for a little peak above, like peek-a-boo. Let's see what what this looks like. And I think that we can open outside of this box tomorrow. But what's going to be important tomorrow is that we actually hold above if we can hold above. And and again, two weeks ago, what I always say and and any other, you know, technical Tuesday, it's always about multiple closes and opens outside of these boxes, right? Outside of this this range, specifically non-farm payroll days.</p>
</details>

如果我们做不到，那么我们预计会在短时间内穿越整个区间。短时间是一个非常具体的数字。这个具体的数字是两到三个交易日，几乎每次都是。这是一、二、三个交易日。总是这样或更少。所以如果我们做不到，就期待完全一样的情况。我不是开玩笑。我不认为我们会跌得更低，因为如果我们不跌，我也不认为我们会，那么也期待在两到三个交易日内发生完全一样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if we don't get this, then all we do is we expect to traverse this entire range in short order. And short order is a very specific number. This specific number is two to three trading sessions nearly every time. This is one, two, three trading sessions. It's always this or less. So if we can't do this, expect exactly that. Not joking. I don't expect to go any lower than that though cuz if we don't, which I don't think we will, expect exactly that in two to three trading sessions as well.</p>
</details>

这成了SPY生活的盒子，直到我们看到其中一个区间真正突破。我认为这才是我们未来走向的真实故事。所以在短期内，虽然感觉可能过于欣快或令人痛苦的绝望，无论哪种情况，我都不认为你真的需要担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this becomes the box that SPY lives in until we get one of these like one of these ranges to actually break. And that I think is the true story of where we're going. So in the in the near term, while it might feel, you know, overly euphoric or gut-wrenching despair, one of those two, in either case, I don't think you really need to worry.</p>

### 技术星期二：Meta, 英伟达, 谷歌分析

Amit: 让我们来分析一下Meta，因为如果我们不这样做，Chris会把我逼疯的。他持有750美元的看涨期权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, let's do meta because if we don't, Chris is going to drive me crazy. He has 750.</p>
</details>

Jason: **Leaps**（Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities: 长期期权，通常指到期时间在一年以上的期权合约）很大程度上是关于波动性的。它们实际上与价格无关。期权的价值是基于概率的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> uh I so leaps are very much about um volatility. They actually have nothing to do with price. Um the the value of options is based on the probability.</p>
</details>

Amit: 你认为今天630美元的走势是建设性的吗？或者你如何解读3%的涨幅？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> do you think the 630 move today was constructive or how are you interpreting 3%?</p>
</details>

Jason: 我认为这完全是预料之中的，并且它已经达到了全部目标，从交易的角度来看，这笔交易应该被平仓。所以交易就在这里，字面上就在这里。这个斐波那契回撤，记住是50%。所以从波动低点到波动高点，2025年4月的低点到2025年8月的高点，当我们失去那个633美元的低点时。这是我们在这个节目上一直在讨论的一个关键点，我们说，嘿，看，你失去了634美元这个水平，你有极高的概率到达……聊天室可能知道，但如果我们有技术星期二的播放列表，它就在这里，光彩夺目，是585美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh I think it was absolutely expected and it has actually hit its full target and that trade should be closed from a trading perspective. Um so the trade is here literally here. So that fib remember 50%. So from the swing low to so extreme low to extreme high 2025 or April April low 2025 to August 2025 high when we lost that 633 low. This was a pivot that we've been talking about on this show and we said hey look you lose this 634 level you have an extremely high probability of getting to what chat probably chat probably knows but again if we had TT playlist it's right here in all its glory it's 585.</p>
</details>

反之亦然，但它会停止。所以反之亦然，超过那个61.8%的595美元，你应该会回到那个633美元。现在，这些统计数据不会改变。所以问题就在这里。也就是说，如果它不能回到634美元以上，那么你就会回到585美元。这就是为什么作为一个交易者，这笔交易应该被平仓，因为作为一个交易者，这是一个非常清晰的风险回报交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the inverse is true as well there it is. Right? And the inverse is true, but it stops. Right? And so the inverse is true is over that that 618, 595, you should get right back to that 633. Now, these statistics do not change. And so that there in lies the problem. So that meaning that that if this does not come back over 634, then you are going right back to 585. which is why this trade as a trader should be closed and because that is a very clean risk-reward trade as a trader.</p>
</details>

Amit: 英伟达，老兄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Nvidia, man.</p>
</details>

Jason: 这是我们上次做的英伟达分析，我想我 literalmente 画了这个，这是财报前的。我们看了好几次。砰。对吧。所以这是我两周前画的。向上，向下。这略低于200美元。那是看跌的回撤。我们现在略低于180美元。我实际上画了它可能会跌得更低一点。所以我们完成了那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I got it. Because you have it so clean. Here's Nvidia that we did last time and I think I had this literally this is pre-earnings. We're we're looking at it. We're like multiple times. Boom. Right. So there's what I drew. This is two weeks ago right here. Up down. This is just under 200. That's the bearish retracement. Here we are just under 180. And I actually drew this potentially coming down slightly lower. So we're done with that.</p>
</details>

空头们带着一些攻击性介入了。他们抛售了，现在我们实际上必须处理这个问题，哦，好吧，我是否要卖掉英伟达去买谷歌，我真的不知道这是否是你真正想做的事情。下跌正在被一点一点地买入，但它们没有被强力买入以真正推高股价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bears stepped in with a little bit of aggression. They sold off and now we're actually having to deal with this, oh well, do I want to sell Nvidia to buy Google, which I don't really know is something that you actually want to do. The the dips are getting bought slightly little by little, but they're not they're not getting bought with strength to actually push it higher.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的。那么我们来分析谷歌。我想听听你作为一个技术分析师对……我猜，你认为它在这里过度延伸了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Agreed. Okay. So, let's do Google then. And I want your reaction as a technician to uh I guess just do you think it's it's overextended here?</p>
</details>

Jason: 哦，过度延伸是一个……我是说当天它有一个所谓的耗尽蜡烛图。所以我们有明确的耗尽迹象。我今天做了一个空头交易，就是谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, overextended is a I mean on the day it's uh you have an what's called an exhaustion candle. So we have we have definitive signs of exhaustion on the day. I took a short trade today and it was Google.</p>
</details>

这只是，哦，好吧，这只是简单的耗尽。没什么大不了的。所以，顺便说一句，我当时很震惊这些合约有多贵。我只是看到了任何形式的疲软迹象的第一天。所以我做的就是标记了盘前高点和盘前低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just like, oh, okay, well, this is simply exhaustion. It's not that big of a deal. It's um so and by the way I was like shocked at how expensive these like contracts are. It was just like, okay, well, this is the first day that I'm seeing any kind of sign of weakness. And so what I just did was I marked the pre-market high and I marked the pre-market low.</p>

Jason: AMD，简单。所以195美元是我们在关注的潜在流动性抓取水平，然后从这里是185美元。但我们做的是勾勒出结构需要是什么样子，结构需要是这样的。所以第一步不幸地发生得非常快。如果它不能回到50日均线以上，那么现在这就不会发生。

Jason: 24美元。就是它。实际上比24美元跌得更深一点。23.5美元。所以，我当时想的是24美元。看起来那只是为了在24美元以下开盘，然后在那个周五开盘时立即被买入。我们现在就在这里。所以我们又回来了。也回到了那个阻力位。

<details>

Amit: 我们对Robinhood（Hood）有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What What are we thinking about Hood?</p>
</details>

Jason: 我对Robinhood有很清晰的看法。首先，我们必须看到结构，我认为结构是……我们离看到结构还很远。这是肯定的。我们到达的那个点是我们在很长一段时间内第一次到达这个区域。我认为这很重要。下一个水平，也就是我们现在刚刚触及的，非常重要。

So again I think that so first of all we have to see structure and so I think structure is is uh we're kind we're far away from seeing structure. That's for sure.

### 总结与展望

Amit: 好的。我们今天就到这里了，朋友们。我想我们分析了大约50只股票。再次抱歉，如果我们错过了一些股票，但我们已经尽力了。Jason的推特就在聊天区。你可以在那里关注他。他的链接也在他的简介里。是的，我明天会做开盘和收盘直播。明天实际上是本周交易的最后一天，因为交易量会非常清淡。
