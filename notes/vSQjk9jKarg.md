title: 美好生活的秘密：哈佛幸福研究85年的启示
---

### 什么是美好生活？金钱与幸福的初探

视频探讨了一个最重要的问题：什么能带来幸福的生活？现实地说，是金钱。变得富有绝对是其中一个重要方面。存很多钱，赚钱，富裕非常重要。人们很容易说他们不在乎金钱，金钱买不到幸福，但这并非事实。因为我宁愿在游艇上哭泣，也不愿在斯巴鲁车里哭泣。（两人笑）

<p class="english-text">This video is about one of the most important questions: what leads to a happy life? Realistically, money. Being wealthy is definitely a big aspect of it. To save a lot of money. Money. Money. Earning money. It's very important to be rich. It's easy for people to say they don't care about having money and that money can't buy happiness, but that's really not true. 'Cause I would rather cry on a yacht than in a like a Subaru. (both laugh)</p>
</details>

显然，拥有成功的职业生涯和财务财富对人们来说很重要。你心中有目标数字吗？你想达到什么程度？至少一百万。是吗？是的。2018年对约十万名大学新生进行的一项调查显示，约55%的人表示希望在事业上取得成功，83%的人表示希望变得富有。但这些成就真的能增加幸福感吗？这正是本视频想要探究的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Clearly, having a successful career and financial wealth are important to people. Is there a number in mind? Something you wanna get to? At least a million. Yeah? Yeah. In a survey from 2018 of around a hundred thousand college freshmen, about 55% said they wanted to be successful in their career and 83% reported that they wanted to become rich. But do these accomplishments really increase happiness? Well, that's what I wanna find out in this video.</p>

### 幸福研究的挑战：记忆与彩票赢家

但我们如何研究什么能让人幸福呢？你可以问他们：“什么会让你幸福？”嗯、啊、啊、啊、噢。但人们并不擅长判断什么会让他们幸福。赢得彩票似乎应该会让你幸福。什么？！（妹妹尖叫）什么？！什么？！然而，对彩票中奖者的多项研究发现，在最初的幸福感消退后，许多人并不比我们其他人更幸福。事实上，有些人甚至比中奖前更痛苦。因为你不再像以前那样经常见到很多人了。显然，在某些方面，你变得有些孤立了。是的，我同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But how do you study what makes people happy? Well, you can ask them. What's gonna make you happy? Um. Uh. Uh. Uh. Ooh. But people aren't really good at judging what will make them happy. Winning the lottery seems like it should make you happy. What!? (sister screams) What!? What!? But numerous studies on lottery winners find that after the initial surge of happiness wears off, many are no happier than the rest of us. Some are, in fact, more miserable than they were beforehand. 'Cause you don't see as many people as you used to see. Obviously, you become slightly isolated, I think in some ways. Yeah, I agree.</p>
</details>

另一个问题是人们的记忆并不可靠。我们的大脑只检测、编码和存储眼前整个经历的零散片段。这被称为**重构记忆**（Reconstructed Memories: 大脑根据现有信息和信念重新构建过去的记忆，而非精确回放）。它在我们生活的方方面面无时无刻不在发生。大多数关于幸福感的研究会找到老年人，并让他们回忆什么曾让他们幸福。但正如我们刚刚所见，记忆并不可靠。因此，更好的研究方法是追踪人们的一生，记录他们所做的选择以及这些选择如何影响他们的幸福感。这真的很难做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another problem is that people's memories aren't reliable. We only detect, encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us. It's called reconstructed memories. It happens to us in all the aspects of our lives all the time. Most studies on happiness find older people and ask them to recall what made them happy. But as we've just seen, memory is unreliable. So a better way to conduct a study would be to follow people throughout their entire lives, capturing the choices they make and how those affect their happiness. That is really hard to do.</p>

### 哈佛成人发展研究：85年的追踪与发现

但有一项这样的研究，自1938年以来一直在进行。85年是一项研究持续的漫长时间，因此它已从一代研究人员传给了下一代。它目前由第四任主任**罗伯特·瓦尔丁格**（Robert Waldinger）负责。那么这项研究的独特之处是什么呢？罗伯特·瓦尔丁格表示，它的独特之处在于，据我们所知，这是有史以来进行过的最长时间的人类发展研究，任何深度研究中持续时间最长的。这些研究深入探究了人们的生活及其身心健康。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there is one study like this that's been running since 1938. Now, 85 years is a long time to run a study so it has been passed down from one generation of researchers to the next. It's currently run by its fourth director, Robert Waldinger. What is the claim to fame then of the study? You know, the claim to fame is that it is, as far as we know, the longest study of human development that's ever been done. The longest study of any depth. These are studies that take deep dives into people's lives and their mental and physical health.</p>
</details>

这项研究最初实际上是两项独立的研究，由两组互不相识的哈佛研究人员进行。第一组追踪了268名哈佛年轻男性，以了解他们如何发展到成年早期。当然，如果你想研究正常的青年成人发展，你就会研究所有来自哈佛的白人男性，对吧？（德里克笑）你知道，这是其中一个局限性。第二组研究了来自波士顿最贫困和最弱势家庭的456名男孩，从他们中学时期开始。所以这两项研究都旨在探究发展中哪些方面是正确的，以及我们如何预测谁在成长过程中会表现良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The study actually began as two separate studies by two groups of Harvard researchers that didn't know about each other. The first group followed 268 young men from Harvard to find out how they would develop into early adulthood. So of course, if you wanna study normal young adult development, you study all white guys from Harvard, right? (Derek laughs) You know, it's one of those limitations. The second group studied 456 boys from middle school onwards from Boston's poorest and most disadvantaged families. So there were these two studies, both meant to be studies of what goes right in development and how we predict who does well as they grow up.</p>
</details>

最终，这两项研究合并为一项：**哈佛成人发展研究**（Harvard Study of Adult Development: 一项自1938年开始，追踪个体一生以探究幸福和健康因素的纵向研究）。在研究开始时，参与者接受了访谈和全面的身体检查。随着他们的成长，他们进入了各行各业。其中一些人成为了瓦工、医生、工厂工人、律师，甚至有一位成为了美国总统。（总统音乐）每两年，研究人员会向他们询问关于生活的问题。比如：“如果你可以在不损失收入的情况下停止工作，你会吗？你会做什么？”“你多久感到一次与他人隔绝？”“判断对错：生活中痛苦多于快乐。”以及其他关于他们的婚姻、事业、友谊以及身心健康的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Eventually, the two studies merged into one: The Harvard Study of Adult Development. At the start of the study, the participants were interviewed and received extensive physical examinations. And as they grew, they entered all walks of life. Some of them became bricklayers and doctors and factory workers and lawyers, and one even became president of the States. (presidential music) Every two years, researchers ask them questions about their lives. Like, "If you could stop working without loss of income, would you, what would you do instead?" "How often do you feel isolated from others?" "True or false, life has more pain than pleasure." And other questions about their marriage, career, friendships, and their physical and mental health.</p>
</details>

尽管这项研究最初只有724名参与者，但随着时间的推移，他们的配偶和子女也被纳入了研究。那么，总共有多少人参与了这项研究呢？研究中总共有2500到3000人。随着技术的进步，数据收集的方法也得到了改进。我们现在从DNA中提取血液。你知道，DNA在1938年甚至都还没被设想出来。我们测量信使RNA、DNA甲基化，我们将人们带入实验室，故意让他们承受压力，然后观察他们从压力中恢复的速度。例如，观察心率变异性，观察头发中沉积的**皮质醇**（Cortisol: 一种由肾上腺分泌的应激激素），因为这似乎是循环皮质醇的长期衡量指标。但所有这些新方法都服务于研究人类福祉这一宏大现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While the study started with just 724 participants, over time, their spouses and children were also included in the study. So how many people are we talking about in total who have been part of the study? Between 2,500 and 3,000 people altogether in the study. And as technology improved, so did the methods of data collection. We now draw blood from DNA. You know, DNA wasn't even imagined in 1938. We measure messenger RNA, DNA methylation, we bring people into our laboratory, we deliberately stress them out and then see how quickly they recover from stress. Looking at heart rate variability, for example, looking at cortisol deposited in hair, because that seems to be a long-term measure of circulating cortisol. But all of these new methods are in the service of studying the same big phenomena of human wellbeing.</p>

### 85年研究的两大启示：身体健康与人际关系

那么，这项跨越人类一生的85年研究，教会了我们什么关于健康幸福生活的道理呢？实际上，有两个巨大的收获。其中一个并不令人惊讶。那就是，如果你照顾好自己的身体健康，它会带来巨大的好处，不仅能延长你的寿命，还能让你保持健康的更长时间。饮食均衡，定期锻炼，不滥用酒精或毒品，不吸烟，接受预防性医疗保健，锻炼身体至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what do 85 years of research across entire human lives teach us about a healthy and happy life? Two huge takeaways really. One is no surprise. It's that if you take care of your physical health, it has huge benefits, not just for your longevity, but for how long you stay healthy. Eating well, getting regular exercise, not abusing alcohol or drugs, not smoking, getting preventive healthcare, exercise is hugely important.</p>
</details>

一项台湾研究考察了1996年至2008年间41.6万名健康人的医疗数据。八年后，他们对每个人进行了随访，以探究运动与死亡率之间的联系。他们发现，每天仅运动15分钟的人，死亡风险降低了14%，预期寿命延长了三年。每额外增加15分钟的运动，死亡风险就额外降低4%。2008年的一项大型**元分析**（Meta-analysis: 一种统计学方法，用于综合多项独立研究的结果，以获得更全面的结论）证实，身体活跃的人在每项研究调查的时间范围内，死亡风险都有所降低。运动还能保护我们的**认知健康**（Cognitive Health: 涉及记忆、思维、学习和解决问题等大脑功能的状态）。2014年的一项元分析发现，身体活动水平较高的参与者，**认知衰退**（Cognitive Decline: 记忆力、思维能力等认知功能随时间推移而下降的现象）的风险降低了35%，**痴呆症**（Dementia: 一种由大脑疾病引起的慢性或进行性综合征，导致记忆、思维、行为和日常活动能力下降）的风险降低了14%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A Taiwanese study looked at the medical data of 416,000 healthy people between 1996 and 2008. Eight years later, they followed up with each person to look at the link between exercise and mortality. They found that people who exercised just 15 minutes a day had a 14% reduced risk of dying, and a three year longer life expectancy. Every additional 15 minutes of exercise decreased the risk of dying by an extra 4%. A large meta-analysis from 2008 confirms that people who are physically active have a reduced risk of dying during the timeframes investigated in each study. Exercise also protects our cognitive health. A meta-analysis from 2014 found that participants with higher levels of physical activity had a 35% reduced risk of cognitive decline and a 14% reduced risk of dementia.</p>
</details>

而另一个令人惊讶的重大发现是，人际关系不仅能让我们更幸福，还能让我们更健康，帮助我们活得更久。这不仅仅是哈佛研究的结论。现在有大量的研究表明人际关系对人类幸福和健康的重要性。它们教会我们三个主要经验。首先，人际关系对我们的健康大有裨益。2010年，研究人员综合分析了148项研究，总计超过30万名参与者。他们发现，平均而言，拥有更强社会联系的人，在任何一年内的生存可能性增加了50%。尤其是婚姻，对人们的寿命有很大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the big surprising finding is, relationships, not just keeping us happier, but keeping us healthier and helping us live longer. It's not just the Harvard study. There's now a whole list of studies that show the importance of relationships to human happiness and health. They teach us three main lessons. The first is that relationships are great for our health. In 2010, researchers looked across 148 studies with a total of more than 300,000 participants. They found that, on average, people with stronger social connections had a 50% increased likelihood of survival for any given year. Being married, in particular, has a large impact on how long people live.</p>
</details>

有一项我认为备受推崇的研究表明，已婚男性平均比未婚男性多活12年，已婚女性平均比未婚女性多活7年。在所有方面，婚姻对男性来说总是比对女性更有利。（德里克笑）这并不是因为你有一张结婚证，对吧？而是因为生活在亲密伴侣关系中的人们倾向于互相保持健康。你有一个人在关注你，照看你。这是一个非常真实、具体的效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's one study, I think it's pretty well respected, that suggests that married men live 12 years longer on average than unmarried men and married women live seven years longer on average than unmarried women. Marriage is always a better deal for men on all parameters than it is for women. (Derek laughs) And it's not because you have a marriage license, right? It's because people living together in an intimate partnership tend to keep each other healthier. You have somebody who's kind of watching, looking out for you. It's a very real, concrete effect.</p>
</details>

### 孤独的危害：如同吸烟和肥胖

如果与他人保持良好联系能让我们更幸福、更健康、更长寿，那么当我们感到与世隔绝时会发生什么呢？犹他大学的研究员**朱丽安·霍尔特-伦斯塔德**（Julianne Holt-Lunstad）对大量关于孤独感生理影响的研究进行了元分析。她的计算结果是，孤独对健康的危害，相当于每天吸半包烟，或者与肥胖的危害相当。感到与他人隔绝还会让你更容易患病。2016年的一项大型元分析发现，不良的社会关系与**心脏病**（Heart Disease: 影响心脏功能的各种疾病的总称）风险增加29%和**中风**（Stroke: 脑部血液供应中断或减少，导致脑细胞死亡的疾病）风险增加32%相关。因此，当我们审视对数千人进行的研究时，这些都具有真实且可量化的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If feeling well-connected to others makes us happier, healthier, and extends our lives, then what happens if we feel disconnected? There's a researcher, Julianne Holt-Lunstad, out of the University of Utah, who did a meta-analysis of a whole slew of studies of the physical effects of loneliness. And her calculation was that being lonely is as dangerous to your health as smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day, or as dangerous as being obese. Feeling disconnected from others also makes you more prone to disease. A large meta-analysis from 2016 found that poor social relationships were associated with a 29% increase in risk of heart disease and a 32% increase in risk of stroke. So these have real sort of quantifiable consequences when we look at studies of thousands of people.</p>
</details>

一个需要注意的是，大多数关于孤独感对健康影响的研究都集中在50岁及以上的人群。而且孤独感正在上升。美国卫生局局长今天宣布，美国出现了一种新的公共卫生流行病：孤独。我们现在发现，每两名成年人中就有一人报告有可测量的孤独感，而且年轻人受影响最大。这就是为什么这如此令人担忧。这是因为我们已经意识到，孤独不仅仅是一种不好的感觉。它对我们的身心健康有着真实的影响。英国已经任命了一位孤独事务大臣。许多国家都对这种社会联系的崩溃感到担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One caveat is that most studies on the health effects of loneliness focus on people aged 50 and older. (clock ticking) And loneliness is on the rise. The U.S. Surgeon General today declared a new public health epidemic in America. Loneliness. We're now finding that one in two adults report measurable levels of loneliness and it turns out that young people are most affected. And here's why this is so concerning. It's because we've realized that loneliness is more than just a bad feeling. It has real consequences for our mental and physical health. The UK has appointed a minister of loneliness. Many, many countries are concerned about this breakdown in social connection.</p>
</details>

### 孤独与独处：主观感受的差异

关于孤独的一个问题是，它到底是什么样子？因为显然，每个人都会经历一些孤独的时期。那么，它何时会变得真正有害，我们又如何定义它呢？嗯，孤独与独处是不同的，对吧？所以你可以独处并感到相当满足，事实上很多人都是如此。独处时能感到满足是一种相当重要的技能，也是一种很棒的能力。孤独是一种主观体验，即你与他人的联系少于你所期望的。这就是为什么，你知道，你可以在人群中感到孤独。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A question about loneliness, like, what does that look like? Because, obviously, everyone experiences some periods of loneliness. So you know, when does it become sort of really detrimental and how do we define that? Well, loneliness is different from being alone, right? So you can be alone and quite content, and many people are, in fact. The ability to be content when you're alone is quite a skill and it's a wonderful ability. Loneliness is that subjective experience of being less connected to people than you wanna be. And that's why, you know, you can be lonely in a crowd.</p>
</details>

我们都处于外向（渴望生活中有很多社交）和内向（实际上需要大量独处，不希望有太多人，因为很多人对**内向者**（Introverts: 倾向于从独处中获取能量，社交活动可能消耗其能量的人）来说是压力）的谱系之间。我们知道的是，这两种倾向都没有更健康之说，对吧？比如内向者是完全健康的。他们可能只需要一两个真正牢固的关系，而不希望有更多的人。这完全没有问题。而**外向者**（Extroverts: 倾向于从社交互动中获取能量，喜欢与人交往的人）可能希望生活中有很多社交。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're all on a spectrum between extroversion, you know, wanting lots of people in our lives, and introversion, actually needing a lot of solitude and not wanting a lot of people, a lot of people are stressful for introverts. And what we know is that neither one is healthier, right? Like introverts are perfectly healthy. They just may need one or two really solid relationships and don't want a lot more people. Nothing wrong with that at all. Whereas extroverts may want lots of people in their lives.</p>
</details>

### 关系的质量重于数量，并保护我们的大脑

因此，第二个经验是，重要的不是你认识或见到多少人，甚至不是你是否已婚，因为一段糟糕的婚姻可能比离婚对你的健康更有害。相反，重要的是你亲密关系的质量。当我们追踪所有最初的参与者到80多岁时，我们问：“好的，哪些数据能最好地预测50岁时谁在80岁时会幸福健康，而不是生病或死亡？”我们原以为会关注50岁时的血压和胆固醇水平作为最强的预测因子。结果是他们的人际关系。尤其是他们对婚姻关系的满意度，是最好的预测因子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the second lesson is that it's not how many people you know or see, or even whether you're married or not, because a bad marriage can be worse for your health than getting divorced. Instead, it's about the quality of your close relationships that matters. When we'd followed all the original people out to their 80s we said, "Okay, what data actually are the best predictors at age 50 of who's gonna be happy and healthy at age 80 as opposed to sick or dead?" And we thought we were gonna be looking at blood pressure and cholesterol level at age 50 as the strongest predictors. It was their relationships. It was particularly their satisfaction with their marital relationships that was the strongest predictor.</p>
</details>

人际关系不仅能让我们更幸福、身体更健康，它们还能保护我们的大脑。80多岁时处于安全关系中的人，如果他们觉得可以依赖对方，会发现他们的记忆力保持更长时间的敏锐。而那些感到孤独的人，他们的记忆力则会更快衰退。一项针对美国退休成年人的研究发现，在10年内，感到孤独的人认知衰退的速度高出20%。2018年的一项元分析进一步证实了孤独感的有害影响，发现它也增加了痴呆症的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And relationships don't just keep us happier and physically healthier, they also protect our brains. People who are in secure relationships in their 80s, where they feel that they can rely on the other person, find that their memories stay sharper for longer. And people who feel lonely, well, their memories fade quicker. A study of retired U.S. adults found that the rate of cognitive decline was 20% higher over 10 years for those who felt lonely. A meta-analysis from 2018 further confirms the detrimental effects of loneliness, finding that it also increased the risk of dementia.</p>
</details>

### 关系如何调节压力：生理机制

但仍然有一个很大的未解之谜：人际关系中究竟是什么让它们特别有益健康或有帮助？目前有相当充分的研究支持的最佳假设是，人际关系是情绪调节器，它们是压力调节器。许多人每天都会遇到有压力的事情，对吧？那么会发生什么呢？身体会进入**战斗或逃跑反应**（Fight-or-flight mode: 身体在面对感知到的威胁时产生的生理反应，为战斗或逃跑做准备）模式，血压升高，呼吸加快，循环应激激素水平上升。但在面对挑战后，身体应该在正常的战斗或逃跑反应之后恢复平衡。如果我能回家，有人可以倾诉，我真的能感觉到我的身体平静下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there's still a big open question: what is it about the relationships that makes them particularly healthful or helpful? The best hypothesis, for which there's some pretty decent research now, is that relationships are emotion regulators. They're stress regulators. So stressful things happen every day to many of us, right? So then what happens? Well, the body goes into fight-or-flight mode, blood pressure goes up, respirations become more rapid, circulating stress hormone levels rise. But then the body is meant to go back to equilibrium after that normal fight-or-flight response when we face a challenge. If I can come home and there's somebody here to talk to, I can literally feel my body calm down.</p>
</details>

我们相当确定的是，那些孤立的人更有可能长期处于一种慢性战斗或逃跑模式。这意味着他们体内循环的皮质醇水平更高，**慢性炎症**（Chronic Inflammation: 身体对长期刺激或损伤的持续性免疫反应，可能损害组织）水平更高，而这些因素会逐渐损耗身体系统。因此，例如，慢性压力可以预测**冠状动脉疾病**（Coronary Artery Disease: 供应心脏血液的动脉变窄或阻塞的疾病），也能预测关节炎和二型糖尿病，正是因为这种共同的机制会破坏多个身体系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we are pretty sure happens is that people who are isolated, that they're more likely to stay in a kind of chronic fight-or-flight mode. And that what that means is that they have higher levels of circulating cortisol, higher levels of chronic inflammation, and that those things gradually wear away body systems. So that's how, for example, chronic stress can predict coronary artery disease, but also arthritis and also type-two diabetes because of this common mechanism that breaks down multiple body systems.</p>

### 令人担忧的趋势：社交互动减少

我们的社会中存在一个令人担忧的趋势。新闻播报员：与朋友的社交互动从2003年的每天60分钟下降到2020年的每天仅20分钟。科技从根本上改变了我们彼此互动和沟通的方式，不幸的是，它常常用质量较低的在线连接取代了过去丰富的面对面联系。现在，你可能会说你是一个内向者，不需要花很多时间与人相处就能感觉良好。尽管内向者和外向者需要不同量的社交刺激，但两者都需要人际连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is an alarming trend in our society. [Newsreader] Social engagement with friends decreased from 60 minutes a day in 2003 to just 20 minutes a day in 2020. The technology has fundamentally changed how we interact with one another and how we communicate with one another and, unfortunately, has often replaced what used to be rich in-person connections with online connections, which often are of lower quality. Now, you may say you're an introvert and you don't need to spend much time with people to feel good. And while it's true that introverts and extroverts need different amounts of social stimulation, both need human connection.</p>
</details>

2015年，霍尔特-伦斯塔德及其同事分析了70项独立研究的数据，总计超过300万名参与者。与其他研究类似，他们发现主观的孤独感使过早死亡的风险增加了26%。但他们也考察了社会隔离的客观衡量标准，即你实际与他人相处的时间。他们发现，社会隔离使过早死亡的风险增加了29%。不幸的是，内向者更容易面临社会隔离的风险。

<p class="english-text">In 2015, Holt-Lunstad and her colleagues looked at the data of 70 independent studies with more than 3 million total participants. Similar to other studies, they found that the subjective feeling of loneliness increased the risk of premature death by 26%. But they also looked at the objective measure of social isolation, how much time you're actually spending with other people. And they found that social isolation increased the risk of premature death by 29%. And unfortunately, introverts are more at risk of being socially isolated.</p>

### 重新审视金钱与成就：真正的骄傲与遗憾

就像今天的许多年轻人一样，哈佛研究的许多参与者也曾认为金钱和成就是他们追求美好生活的方向。但这项研究和许多其他研究表明，最幸福的人是那些积极投入与伴侣、朋友、家人和社区关系的人。当他们80多岁时，研究人员问他们，你最自豪的是什么，你最大的遗憾是什么？许多人说他们最自豪的是与他们的人际关系有关的事情。比如，“我是一个好老板，我是一个好父母，我是一个好朋友，我是一个好导师。”没有人说“我发了大财”，对吧？甚至没有人说“我获得了诺贝尔奖”，尽管确实有几个人获得了。这与那些我们认为“哦，这就是我们必须获得才能感觉生活有意义”的成就徽章无关。每个人回顾时都提到了他们的人际关系。

<p class="english-text">Just like many young people today, many participants from the Harvard study also believed that money and achievement were what they should go after to have a good life. But what this study and plenty of others show is that the people who were the happiest were those that leaned into their relationships with their partner, friends, family, and community. And when they were in their 80s the researchers asked them, what are you most proud of and what is your biggest regret? Many people said that they were proudest of something to do with their relationships. So it could be, "I was a good boss, I was a good parent, I was a good friend, I was a good mentor." Nobody said, "I made a fortune," right? Nobody even said, you know, "I won the Nobel Prize," which a few people did. It wasn't about those badges of achievement, right, that we think of as, "Oh, that's what we gotta get to feel like we've had a meaningful life." Everybody looking back mentioned their relationships.</p>

最大的遗憾尤其是在男性中，因为这是二战一代。他们说：“我希望我没有花那么多时间在工作上，我希望我能花更多时间与我关心的人在一起。”那么我们最初的问题呢？成就和金钱真的能让我们幸福吗？根据哈佛研究，成就徽章不一定能让我们更幸福，但从事有意义的工作可以。那么金钱呢？它能让我们更幸福吗？2010年，**丹尼尔·卡尼曼**（Daniel Kahneman）和**安格斯·迪顿**（Angus Deaton）进行了一项著名研究，发现年收入超过约7.5万美元后，**情绪幸福感**（Emotional Wellbeing: 指人们日常经历的积极和消极情绪，如快乐、压力、悲伤、愤怒等）的衡量指标没有任何改善。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The biggest regret was particularly among the men, 'cause this was the World War II generation. They said, "I wish I hadn't spent so much time at work, I wish I had spent more time with the people I care about." So what about our original question? Do achievements and money really make us happy? Well, according to the Harvard study, badges of achievement do not necessarily make us happier, but doing meaningful work can. And what about money? Does that make us happier? Well, there's a famous study from 2010 by Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton that found that above an income of around $75,000 a year, there is no improvement whatever in the measures of emotional wellbeing.</p>

但11年后，**马修·基林斯沃思**（Matthew Killingsworth）研究了3.3万名美国在职成年人的数据，发现更高的收入与更高水平的幸福感相关。因此他写道：“没有证据表明年收入超过7.5万美元后，**经验幸福感**（Experienced Wellbeing: 指人们在日常生活中实际感受到的情绪和体验）会达到平台期，这与一些有影响力的过往研究相悖。”2022年，卡尼曼和基林斯沃思在**芭芭拉·梅勒斯**（Barbara Mellers）的调解下，着手解决这一冲突。当他们分析基林斯沃思的数据时，发现了一个有趣的模式：根据人们相对于他人的幸福程度，赚更多钱会带来不同程度的幸福感提升。

<p class="english-text">But 11 years later, Matthew Killingsworth studied data on 33,000 employed U.S. adults and he found that higher incomes corresponded to higher levels of wellbeing. So he wrote, "There was no evidence for an experienced wellbeing plateau above $75,000 a year, contrary to some influential past research." In 2022, Kahneman and Killingsworth set out to resolve the conflict with Barbara Mellers as a mediator. When they analyzed Killingsworth's data, they discovered an interesting pattern, depending on how happy people were relative to others, earning more resulted in different increases in happiness.</p>

对于每个收入水平，他们根据人们的幸福感将其分为低、中、高等级别。他们发现，在每年约10万美元的门槛以下，更高的收入与所有群体的更高幸福感相关。但如果超过这个门槛，对于最不幸福的群体来说，收入的进一步增加与幸福感不再相关。然而，对于所有更幸福的群体，更高的收入似乎确实能带来更多的幸福感。而真正的转折是，那些一开始就最幸福的人，随着收入的增加，获得幸福感提升的潜力最大。人际关系、有意义的工作和金钱都在我们的幸福中扮演着角色。

<p class="english-text">For each income level, they divided people into groups based on their happiness, low, medium, high, and so on. And they found that below a threshold of roughly a hundred thousand dollars a year, a higher income was associated with more happiness for all groups. But if you go above that threshold, then for the unhappiest group, a further increase is not associated with more happiness. However, for all the happier groups, higher incomes do seem to lead to more happiness. And the real twist is that those who are the happiest to start with stand to gain the most with increasing income. Relationships, meaningful work, and money all play a role in our happiness.</p>

### 为什么人际关系常被忽视？

那么，为什么我们如此难以意识到人际关系的重要性呢？罗伯特·瓦尔丁格解释说，如果你仔细想想，人际关系在我们有记忆之前就已经存在了，所以它们就像我们呼吸的空气一样，我们认为它们是理所当然的。所以你不会认为那是你需要培养才能让自己幸福的东西。我们根本不会那样想。然而，当我们科学地研究它时，我们发现它竟然是幸福和身体健康的巨大预测因子。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So why can it be so hard to realize just how important relationships are? You know, if you think about it, relationships have been there since before we have memory, right? So they're like the air we breathe, we take 'em for granted. So you don't think about that as something you cultivate in order to make yourself happy. We don't think about that at all. And yet, when we study it scientifically, we find that that turns out to be an enormous predictor of happiness as well as physical health.</p>

### 培养幸福：像锻炼身体一样经营关系

什么会让你幸福？嗯、啊、啊、啊、嗯、啊。富有绝对是其中一个重要方面，但一个充满爱的家庭是它的基础，你明白我的意思吗？现实地说，是金钱。但与人建立深厚联系才是让我幸福的原因。太棒了。拥有良好的人际关系。你组建一个家庭。拥有家庭并供养他们。朋友和家人。看到我的家人幸福，那是我真正关心的一切。回馈你来自的社区，回馈世界。一个强大的家庭基础，每晚都能回家。是的。我想结婚，生很多孩子。我想——多少算很多？大概五六个吧。那是——只要我能负担得起。（德里克笑）所以。

<p class="english-text">What's gonna make you happy? Um. Uh. Uh. Uh. Um. Uh. Being wealthy is definitely a big aspect of it. But that loving family is kind of like the foundation of it. You know what I mean? Realistically, money. But like building deep connections with people are what's going to make me happy. That's awesome. Having like good relationships with other people. You raise a family. Have a family and provide. Friends and family. Seeing my family happy, that's all I really care about. Giving back to the community where you came from, the world. A strong family base just to come home to every night. Yeah. I wanna get married, have a ton of kids. I want to- How many is a ton? Probably like five-ish, six. That's a- As many as I can afford. (Derek laughs) So.</p>
</details>

事实上，当我采访人们时，我惊喜地发现有很多人认识到人际关系的重要性。那么，如果你能给人们一些建议，让他们从今天开始做些什么来变得更幸福，你会提出什么建议？罗伯特·瓦尔丁格建议，把它想象成与身体健康类似。如果你今天出去锻炼，你不会回到家说：“我完成了。我再也不用做了，”对吧？它就像一种练习，对吧？那些最擅长处理人际关系的人，是那些日复一日、周复一周地坚持与他们关心的人保持联系的人。比如打电话，散步，喝咖啡，做任何事情，打篮球。那些反复定期采取这些行动的人，就是那些保持紧密联系并因此保持幸福的人。

<p class="english-text">In fact, when I interviewed people, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many identified the importance of relationships. So if you could give people advice on what to start doing today to start being happier, what suggestions would you make? To think about it as analogous with physical fitness, if you go out today, you don't come home and say, "I'm done. I don't ever have to do that again," right? It's like a practice, right? That the people who were best at relationships were the people who made it a practice day after day, week after week, to stay connected to the people they cared about. You know, to talk on the phone, to go for walks, to have coffee, to do whatever, to play basketball. The people who took those actions again and again regularly were the people who stayed very connected and stayed happy that way.</p>
</details>

所以我们提出，这是一种我们可以培养的实践，人们可以采取微小的行动。我们有很多故事，讲述那些认为自己不擅长人际关系、永远不会拥有幸福生活的人。然后一切都改变了。很多时候，它在他们意想不到的时候发生了改变。比如，我们有一个故事，讲的是一个男人婚姻不幸福，与孩子关系疏远，也没有朋友。然后当他退休时，他加入了一个健身房，在那里找到了一群朋友，这群朋友第一次成为了他的“部落”。这只是一个例子，说明我们的生活会经历这些我们通常无法预测、意想不到的曲折。其中许多转折都是积极的。科学告诉我们的信息是，不要放弃你生活的这一方面，因为在任何年龄，许多事情都可以改变。（转场提示音）

<p class="english-text">So what we propose is that this is a practice we can cultivate and that there are tiny actions that people can take. We have many stories of people who thought that they were no good at relationships, that they were never gonna have happy lives. And then it changed. And many times it changed when they didn't expect it. So like, we have a story about one man who really didn't have a good marriage and was kind of distant from his kids, didn't have any friends. And then when he retired, he joined a gym and he found this group of friends that became, for the first time, a kind of tribe for him. And that's just one example of how our lives take these twists and turns that we usually can't predict, that we don't expect. And many of those turns are in positive directions. The message that the science tells us is don't give up on this aspect of your life. 'cause many things can change at any age. (transition beeps and chimes)</p>
