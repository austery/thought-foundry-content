title: 2026年全球主要风险展望：美国政治革命、欧洲困境与地缘冲突
summary: Eurasia Group总裁伊恩·布雷默在TED访谈中，深入解读了2026年全球主要风险。他指出，美国正经历一场政治革命，内部两极分化严重；欧洲面临围困，缺乏对美威慑力且内部压力重重；俄罗斯对北约前线国家发动非对称攻击，加剧地区冲突风险。同时，美中关系在短期内趋于稳定。布雷默强调，尽管前景不容乐观，但当前的危机也蕴含着重塑全球秩序和美国未来的希望。

**Helen Walters**: 大家好。2026年新年快乐！我是**Helen Walters**，TED媒体与策展负责人。今天是1月5日，我在布鲁克林。我有点感冒，如果我的声音不济，请多包涵。不过幸好今天大部分的谈话将由**欧亚集团**总裁**伊恩·布雷默**完成。他经常来为我们解读世界正在发生的一切。今天他还会分享他和欧亚集团刚刚发布的全球风险清单。伊恩，非常感谢你的到来。

**Helen Walters**: Hello everyone. Happy 2026 wherever you are. I am Helen Walters. I'm the head of media and curation at TED. It is January the 5th. I am in Brooklyn. I have a cold, so apologies if my voice gives out, but luckily most of the talking today will be done by the one and only Ian Bremer, the president of the Eurasia Group, who often comes to explain what on earth is going on in the world to us. He's also here today to share the list of global risks that he and Eurasia just published. So Ian, thank you so much for being here.

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 海伦，新年快乐。除了谈论全球风险环境，还有什么更好的庆祝方式呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Helen, happy new year. How else could one possibly celebrate but to talk about the global risk environment?

</details>

**Helen Walters**: 事实证明，你真是个扫兴的人，但事实也证明，我们确实有很多事情要谈。这份报告内容丰富，很多都与美国有关。但我认为我们应该从委内瑞拉开始，这个国家目前正处于新闻风口浪尖。去年，我想每个人都清楚，委内瑞拉将发生一些重大事件。但我不确定是否有人真正预料到这会涉及绑架一位外国领导人及其妻子，并将他们带到布鲁克林接受指控。你预料到了吗？你认为发生了什么，或者你能告诉我们最近发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: You really are a massive downer, it turns out, but it turns out there is also a lot to talk about. And so a lot of the report, which is so meaty, relates to the United States. But I actually think that what we need to do is start with Venezuela, which is wildly in the news at the moment. It was clear to everybody, I think, last year, that something pretty major was going to happen in Venezuela. But I'm not sure that anyone really anticipated that that was going to involve essentially kidnapping a foreign leader and his wife and bringing them to Brooklyn to stand charges. Did you anticipate that? And what do you think happened or what can you tell us about what has just been going on?

</details>

### 委内瑞拉政权更迭：特朗普的个人意志

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，我们确实预料到了，因为我们听说了这个故事。但我必须告诉你，两个月前我第一次听到时，我非常惊讶。这个想法不仅仅是**特朗普**要除掉**马杜罗**，或者在压力下迫使他离开，而且显然这种压力一直在升级。但几个月来，一直有人努力获取更多关于马杜罗行踪的情报，并具备精确的行动能力，同时争取他身边愿意与美国合作的人，以便将他抓捕并带到美国，实际上是带到纽约市，那里是大多数媒体所在地，也是报道最引人注目的地方。特朗普几周前就批准了这项行动，但他们需要一个合适的时机进行打击。显然，我、华尔街日报或纽约时报都不能谈论此事，因为那会危及任务，尤其是委内瑞拉当地与马杜罗合作的人员。所以，是的，我们知道这件事，但仍然非常震惊。我想说几点。首先是这次军事行动的成功。我们谈论的不是诺列加和巴拿马，这是一次严肃的军事行动，资金充足，资源丰富，相当忠诚，并且有大量古巴顾问提供支持，他们也非常专业，还有俄罗斯的军事援助、防空系统等等。美国不仅进入并抓捕了他和他的妻子，而且没有一名美国人伤亡。所以，我的意思是，首先，这次行动对美国军方和特朗普来说是多么惊人的成功，不应被低估。我不是在谈论其合法性，也不是在谈论其连锁反应。我只是在谈论罢免这个头条新闻。越来越多的人一直在问我，他们说：“这与毒品有关吗？与石油有关吗？与民主有关吗？”当然不是，至少对特朗普来说不是。但我们应该认识到，其中很大一部分就是你所看到的：罢免马杜罗。特朗普想让马杜罗下台。他正在与一小群高级顾问讨论此事。副幕僚长**史蒂文·米勒**、国务卿兼国家安全顾问（身兼二职）**马尔科·卢比奥**，以及中情局局长**约翰·拉特克利夫**是推动这一决定的核心参与者。他们得出的结论是，任何情况都比马杜罗好。真的是任何情况。混乱都比马杜罗好。一个新的军政府都比马杜罗好，任何都行。这就是做出这个决定的基础，尤其是因为**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**一直在嘲讽特朗普。他不愿接受，你知道，那种“金戒指”和“黄金签证”，然后去土耳其，安静地度过余生，但不再掌权。他跳着特朗普的舞步，基本上是在说：“我敢挑战你。你不会把我赶下台的。”特朗普对此非常愤怒。所以，特朗普试图实现的一个重要目标，他已经实现了。他罢免了马杜罗。他把他带到了美国。他把他带到了纽约。他将面临审判。这将在几个月内展开，带来积极的头条新闻，展示特朗普的强硬：“别惹我。我把你搞定了。”我认为我们必须从这一点开始，因为对特朗普来说，故事的很大一部分就此开始和结束。你不需要去谈论石油、毒品、选举，或者中国、俄罗斯、真主党和伊朗。还有很多其他的故事。海伦，你和我现在可以把它们全部揭开。但我们应该首先认识到，对特朗普来说，这件事的很大一部分是：“我生马杜罗的气。他让我难堪。我给了他最后通牒。我必须将他赶下台。”句号。故事结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Well, we we did, because we heard the story. But I have to tell you, the first time I heard it about two months ago, I was quite surprised. The idea that this wasn't just going to be Trump taking out Maduro or forcing him under pressure to leave, and clearly there's been a lot of that pressure that's that's escalated. But that for several months now there has been an effort to get more information intelligence on Maduro's whereabouts with precise capacity as well as get people around him that would be willing to work with the US, so that he could be extracted and brought to the United States, in fact, brought to New York City, where most of the media is located and where the coverage is going to be the most dramatic. Trump gave the approval on that weeks ago. But they needed to have a proper window to make the strike. And obviously not something that I could talk about or the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times could because it would have put the mission and the people, especially the people on the ground in Venezuela cooperating with Maduro in danger. So yeah, aware of it, but still extraordinarily striking. And I mean, a few things to say here. The first is the success of this military operation. And this is not Norria and Panama we're talking about. This is a serious military operation, well-funded, well-resourced, pretty loyal, and entrenched with lots of Cuban advisers providing support who are also quite professional, Russian military aid, air defense, all of that. And the United States not only went in and got him and his wife, but there wasn't a single American fatality. And so I mean, first of all, the the the the staggering nature of how successful this was for the US military and for Trump should not be underestimated. I'm not talking about the legality. I'm not talking about the knock-on implications. I'm just talking about the headline of the removal. And what increasingly people are asking me all the time, they're saying, "Well, is this about drugs? Is it about oil? Is it about you know all of these democracy?" Of course not, not for Trump anyway. But we should recognize that a big piece of this is what you see. It's about removing Maduro. Trump wanted Maduro out. He was having this discussion with a small group of top advisers. Steven Miller, the deputy chief of staff. Marco Rubio, secretary of state and national security adviser, dual hated. And John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA, were the core participants in driving this decision and and they had come to the decision that anything would be better than Maduro. Literally anything. Chaos would be better than Maduro. A new military government would be better than Maduro, anything. And and that was the basis of making this decision, especially as Nicholas Maduro was taunting Trump. He was not willing to take, you know, sort of the the brass ring, and the golden visa, and travel to Turkey, and and live out his days quietly but out of power. He was doing the Trump dance and basically saying, "I dare you. You're not going to take me out." And and Trump was enraged by that. And so a big piece of what Trump was trying to accomplish, he has accomplished. He has removed Maduro. He has brought him to the United States. He has brought him to New York. He is going to face justice. And that will play out over months with positive headlines showing Trump, you don't mess with me. I took you out. And I think we we need to start with that because, you know, for Trump, a big part of the story begins and ends there. You don't need to go to the oil and the drugs and the elections or the Chinese and the Russians and Hezbollah and Iran. There are lots of other stories. You and I, Helen, can now unpull all of them. But we should start with the recognition that for Trump a very large piece of this is I'm angry about Maduro. He is making me look bad. I have given him an ultimatum. I must remove him from power. Period. End of story.

### 委内瑞拉后续：缺乏治理规划与特朗普的强权逻辑

**Helen Walters**: 所以问题当然是你说，嗯，事情不会就此结束。现实是，现在美国比以往任何时候都更深入地介入委内瑞拉。正如你所说，它从一个国家抓捕了一位外国领导人，我们以前也见过这种情况，即使一个可怕的独裁者被推翻，实际上在那里维持任何形式的武力，或者接下来会发生什么，你知道，特朗普谈论管理委内瑞拉，那么接下来到底会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: So the problem of course is you say that you that um it doesn't end there. And the reality is that now the US is more involved in Venezuela than ever before. It has extracted as you say a foreign leader from a country and we've seen this we've seen this play out before where where you know even if someone even if a terrible dictator is taken out actually sustaining any type of force there or like what happens next and and you know Trump talks about running Venezuela like what actually is going to happen next.

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 这次抓捕行动投入了大量的规划。在许多个月里，三个月前美国还不知道**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**的行踪。到他们发动袭击时，他们已经对他身在何处、正在做什么了如指掌。他们之前没有从马杜罗身边的人那里获得任何情报。到他们发动袭击时，他们已经有许多人被完全策反，并向美国提供信息。所以，军事计划在战略上做得非常出色，执行也异常成功。我的意思是，普京希望他能在乌克兰做到这一点，但他当然做不到。但是，海伦，对于委内瑞拉现在将如何治理，没有任何规划。当你听到特朗普说：“嗯，现在我们正在管理委内瑞拉”时，我想这句话让**马尔科·卢比奥**感到惊讶，因为美国根本没有管理委内瑞拉的计划。这根本不是政权更迭，这是政权轮盘赌。你罢免了马杜罗，现在有一个新的人掌权，而美国人与他没有任何关系，没有理由相信他是友好的，也没有任何与他打交道的历史，对吗？我的意思是，可能是，而且美国不认为她是罪犯，但她身边很多人都是罪犯，他们头上都有悬赏，而且他们仍然在那里。所以，如果说有什么计划的话，这个计划就是美国刚刚表明，如果你不按照美国的要求做，而你又是一个非常弱小的国家，那么代价将是巨大的。特朗普已经通过尼古拉斯·马杜罗非常清楚地表明了这一点，并震惊了世界各地的许多人，包括盟友和对手。**中国政府**表示他们感到震惊。我从未见过中国高级外交官对美国决定做出公开声明说：“我们感到震惊。”请记住，当时有一个中国高级代表团在加拉加斯，就在几个小时前刚刚会见了马杜罗，但特朗普并没有因此停止发动军事突袭，他也没有告诉中国人。他没有提前通知他们，对吗？所以，他们感到震惊。嗯，这就是刚刚发生的事情。现在，接下来会发生什么？特朗普认为，因为他已经展示了这种能力，所以下一届委内瑞拉政府会按照他的意愿行事，会在石油、毒品问题上按照他的意愿行事，会在切断与**真主党**、**俄罗斯**、**伊朗**的关系上按照他的意愿行事，并且会按照他的意愿接受来自美国的委内瑞拉非法移民返回委内瑞拉。这就是愿望清单。这是特朗普议程上的首要任务。特朗普议程上的首要任务不是“我希望确保有民主选举”。**马尔科·卢比奥**希望随着时间的推移能有民主选举，但这并不是特朗普的优先事项。你看到特朗普很快就抛弃了**玛丽亚·马查多**，尽管她是合法的反对派领导人，曾获得诺贝尔和平奖。在马杜罗窃取的选举中，她的政党获得了65%的选票。特朗普不在乎。他觉得她不能管理这个国家。我将与这些人合作，除非他们不按照我的意愿行事。海伦，我要说，在过去的48小时里，第一点，**德利·罗德里格斯**和其他人与特朗普政府私下进行的对话，比她公开谴责这些行动并声称马杜罗仍然是总统的言论要同情和更具建设性得多。她已经有所退让，谈论合作的愿望，但私下里对美国人更加和解。这并不奇怪，她需要保持自己核心圈子的一定可信度，直到她觉得委内瑞拉局势稳定下来。嗯，特朗普政府理解这一点，并准备给她一些时间。时间意味着一两周，而不是几天。嗯，但特朗普政府明白，如果她决定不按照美国人的意愿行事，而且她是否会这样做还没有确定，因为与她没有经验。那么，将会有进一步的行动，美国在委内瑞拉周围部署的军队将保持原位，以使这种威胁更具可信度。所以，他们不会突然转移到地中海东部去威胁伊朗。他们需要那些能力就地待命。嗯，而且，我已经听说，你知道，特朗普政府在早期阶段可能会做的一些事情，例如，夺取海上油井，这些油井防御不严，美国可以以相对较低的风险做到这一点，这将向委内瑞拉政府表明，我们是认真的。你们没有牌。我们有牌。你们没有盟友。没有人会支持你们。俄罗斯和中国袖手旁观，什么也没做。没有人提供任何真正的支持。所以，我们是老大。所以，当特朗普说我们要管理委内瑞拉时，他就是这个意思。他不是说马尔科·卢比奥会成为总督。他不是说他要把托尼·布莱尔派到加拉加斯去管理它。他的意思是，委内瑞拉政府，这个新的政权轮盘赌，将听从该地区的新权威，即“唐罗主义”，否则后果自负。他就是这个意思，而这个假设将在未来几周内受到考验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: So there was an enormous amount of planning that went into this extraction, this operation. Over many, many months, the US had no idea where Nicholas Maduro's whereabouts were three months ago. By the time they made those strikes, they had minute-by-minute sense of where he was, what he was doing. They had no intelligence coming from people around Maduro. By the time they made the strikes, they had many people that were fully compromised and providing information to the US. So the military plan was extremely well done in terms of strategy and it was also exceptionally well executed. I mean, Putin wishes he could have pulled something like that off in Ukraine and of course he couldn't. But Helen, there is no planning around what governance is going to look like now in Venezuela. And when you heard Trump say, "Well, now now we're running Venezuela," I think that that statement was surprising to Marco Rubio because there's no plan for the United States to run Venezuela. Not at all. And this is not regime change. This is regime roulette. You have taken out Maduro and now there's somebody new in charge that the Americans don't have a relationship with, have no reason to believe is a friendly, have no history in dealing with or engaging with, right? I mean, it could be and and a whole bunch of and the US does not consider her to be a criminal, but many of the people around her are criminals. Do have bounties on their heads and they're still there. So the the plan to the extent that there's a plan, the plan is that the United States has just shown that if you don't do what America wants and you're a really weak little country, the costs will be enormous. Trump has made that very clear with Nicholas Maduro and has shocked many around the world, allies and adversaries. The Chinese government said they were shocked. I've never seen a Chinese public statement from a top diplomat in response to a US decision that says, "We're shocked." And keep in mind, there was a senior Chinese delegation in town in Karakas that had just met with Maduro hours before and and then Trump didn't stop Trump from launching the military raid and he didn't tell the Chinese. He didn't give them a heads up, right? So, they were shocked. So that's that's what has just played out. And now what's going to happen? Trump believes that because he has shown that capacity that this next Venezuelan government is going to do what he wants, will do what he wants on oil, will do what he wants on drugs, will do what he wants on cutting off relations with Hezbollah, Russia, Iran. And will do what he wants in terms of accepting Venezuelan migrants, illegal migrants from the United States back to Venezuela. That is that is the wish list. That is on top of Trump's agenda. On top of Trump's agenda is not I I want to make sure there are democratic elections. Marco Rubio wants that over time, but that is not a priority for Trump. You saw that Trump was was quick to throw Maria Machado under the bus even though she's the legitimate opposition leader. Won the Nobel Peace Prize. Her party took 65% of the vote in an election that was stolen by Maduro. Trump doesn't care. It's like she can't run the country. I'm going to work with these guys unless they don't do what I want. And I will say, Helen, over the last 48 hours, first point, the conversations that Deli Rodriguez and others have had with the Trump administration privately have been much more sympathetic and engaging than what she has been saying publicly, condemning the actions and that Maduro is still the president. She's already backing down somewhat, talking about a desire to cooperate, but considerably more conciliatory with the Americans privately. Not surprising she needs to maintain some level of credibility with her own inner circle until she has a sense that there's stability on the ground in Venezuela. And the Trump administration understands that and is prepared to give her some time. Time meaning a week or two, not a matter of days. That is but um the Trump administration understands that if she decides that she's not going to do what the Americans want and there's no certainty that she will again there's no experience with her. Then there's going to be further action and the military that the US has arrayed around Venezuela will stay in position to make that threat more credible. So, they're not going to suddenly move to the eastern Mediterranean to start threatening Iran. They're going to need those those capabilities in situ. And I've already heard that, you know, the sorts of things that the Trump administration might do in the early stages would be to, for example, capture the offshore oil rigs, which aren't well-defended, which the US could do with relatively low risk, and which would show the Venezuelan government, we really mean this. You don't have the cards. We have the cards. You don't have allies. You don't have anyone that's going to support you. The Russians and the Chinese stood by and did nothing. No one provided any real support. So, we're the boss. So, when Trump says we're going to run Venezuela, that is what he means. He doesn't mean that Marco Rubio is going to be proconsul. He doesn't mean he's sending Tony Blair into Karakas to run it. He means that the Venezuelan government, the new regime roulette is going to listen to the new authority in the region, the Dawnroe doctrine or else. That is what he means and that is a presumption that will be tested over the coming weeks.

### “唐罗主义”：特朗普外交政策的核心

**Helen Walters**: 所以正如你所说，“唐罗主义”实际上是你这份报告中列出的第三大风险。请给我们一点关于这里双关语的背景，以及你到底指的是什么，因为它显然不仅仅是关于委内瑞拉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: So the Donroe doctrine as you say is actually the third top risk that you have in this report. just give us a little bit of a context about the pun that's happening here and exactly what you mean by this because it's obviously not just about Venezuela.

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 一点也不。事实上，**特朗普**本人在过去几个小时里首次公开表示，他相信“唐罗主义”，这准确地描述了他对该地区的外交政策取向，这本质上是特朗普所定义的“美国优先”在西半球的体现。这意味着在世界那个地区，美国将在国家安全和战略利益方面拥有最终权威。嗯，他们有很多方法，顺便说一句，既然特朗普在委内瑞拉取得了短期成功并接受了“唐罗主义”，他现在完全专注于品牌建设。这就是他现在正在做的事情。他将尝试寻找其他方式来充实“唐罗主义”，这可能意味着打击**哥伦比亚**境内的毒品目标，甚至可能在**墨西哥**。我们可以谈谈这个。前者比后者更有可能。这意味着对该地区反对美国的政府施加更大压力，比如**尼加拉瓜**和**古巴**，特朗普和**马尔科·卢比奥**已经谈论过这些。这意味着美国愿意制定计划，试图夺取**格陵兰岛**，不是通过地面部队，而是通过对一个忠诚的美国盟友**丹麦**施加政治、经济和军事压力，但丹麦是一个弱小且不强大的国家。我们还要认识到，去年，如果我和你在1月份交谈，实际上海伦，你我去年1月份确实在交谈，我们更多地谈论的是关税。特朗普手中投射力量的主要工具是他的关税政策。他正在将进入美国市场的权力武器化，对抗世界各地的国家，无论是朋友、敌人、富裕、贫穷、小国、大国，以迫使他们达成美国想要的协议。在2026年，他不再能像2025年那样使用这个工具了。他需要达成更多的协议。中国人已经向他表明，他们在经济上能够非常有力地反击他，所以他需要对中国人更加谨慎。这在很多方面都在显现。嗯，他在美国面临负担能力问题。这也是为什么**佐兰·姆达尼**现在成为我所在城市纽约市市长的一部分原因。嗯，他在经济方面的民调不佳。他即将面临中期选举。最高法院将就**AIPA**做出裁决，可能会在一定程度上限制特朗普的关税权力。所有这些都使他更难使用关税。而且在经济上，世界正日益多极化。美国不再是唯一能够决定结果的参与者。但在军事上，世界仍然是单极的，美国仍然是主导者。这在西半球尤其如此。因此，当特朗普在外交政策的经济方面受挫时，他将倾向于在国家安全方面投入更多。这将首先在西半球显现。但它也可能在伊朗，也可能在其他美国和特朗普决定“我们不喜欢你的行为方式，先生”的地区显现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Not at all. And the fact that Trump himself in just over the past few hours has for the first time publicly said that he believes in the Donro doctrine that act accurately describes his foreign policy orientation towards the region which is essentially a manifestation of America first in the Western Hemisphere as defined by Trump. And it means that in that part of the world, the United States is going to have final authority over what happens in national security and strategic interest. And there's a lot of ways that they, and by the way, now that Trump has had that success in Venezuela in the near term and has embraced the Dawnroe doctrine, he's all about the branding. This is now what he's doing. He's going to try to find other ways to populate the Donro doctrine, which, you know, means maybe striking some drug targets inside Colombia or maybe even in Mexico. We can talk about that. The the former is more likely than the latter. It means more pressure on governments that are opposed to the United States in the region like Nicaragua and Cuba where Trump and Marco Rubio have already been talking about that. It means that the United States is willing to put plans in place to try to take Greenland, not with boots on the ground, but with political, economic, and military pressure against a committed US ally, Denmark, but a small and not very powerful one. And let's also recognize that last year, if you and I had been talking in January, and actually Helen, you and I were talking in January last year, we were talking a lot more about tariffs. The principal US tool to project power in Trump's hands was his tariff man. And it was he was weaponizing access to the US market against countries all over the world, friends, foes, rich, poor, small, big, to get them to cut deals that the Americans wanted. He no longer has the ability to use that tool in 2026 the way he did in 2025. He needs to cut more deals. The Chinese have shown him that they are economically capable of hitting him back really hard and so he needs to be more cautious with the Chinese. That's playing out many ways. He he's got affordability issues in the US. Part of why Zoran Mdani is now mayor in my city, New York City. And he's not polling well on the economy. He's got midterm elections coming up. The Supreme Court is going to rule on AIPA and probably constrain Trump's tariff authority to a degree. All of those things make it harder for him to use tariffs. And and economically, the world is increasingly multipolar. The Americans are not the only player that can determine outcomes. But militarily, the world is still unipolar and the United States is still the dominant player. And that is particularly true in the Western Hemisphere. So Trump is going to lean in as he's frustrated on the economic side in foreign policy. He's likely to lean in much more heavily on the national security side. That will play out first and foremost in the Western Hemisphere. But it can also play out in Iran. It can also play out in other areas where the United States and Trump decides we don't like the way you, sir, are behaving.

### 特朗普的“丛林法则”外交

**Helen Walters**: 你提到丹麦，这让我很感兴趣，丹麦领导人一直在以越来越严厉的措辞回应，实际上是试图将**北约**纳入其中，而且我认为是在试图表明丹麦不是一个可以被美国轻易碾压的小国。你看到了什么？你认为格陵兰岛正在发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: It's interesting to me that you bring up Denmark and it's interesting to me that Denmark's leader has been responding in kind of increasingly stark terms actually citing trying to bring NATO into the picture and actually I think trying to establish that Denmark is not a small force that can be just kind of rolled over in by the United States. Is is that what you see there? Do you think that the like what do you think is going on in Greenland?

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，首先，**格陵兰岛**对**特朗普**来说不是一个笑话。嗯，说出来有点痛苦，因为它显然是一个盟国的领土。但是，事实是，特朗普和白宫有许多人正在研究他们在格陵兰岛想要的相关部分，包括国家安全、政治忠诚度、经济准入等方面，其中大部分（并非全部）他们可以通过与丹麦人谈判获得。但到目前为止，仅仅这样并没有得到肯定的答复。原因不仅是因为**丹麦**被视为小国，还因为欧洲人被视为软弱。在这里，我们应该稍微拓宽一下视野。有两个缩写词被非常不同的人群用来理解特朗普的行为。一个是**TACO**（Trump Always Chickens Out，特朗普总是退缩），被他的对手和反对者用来形容，你知道，特朗普言行不一，他说要做X、Y、Z，但后来又退缩了。第二个是**FAFO**（F*** Around and Find Out，惹是生非，自食其果）。这是特朗普的支持者和他自己政府的成员，有时甚至是特朗普本人所说的，你知道，如果你不按照特朗普的要求做，他就会伤害你，后果会很严重。当然，现实情况，就像我们这个非常分裂、政治环境紧张的时代中的许多事情一样，现实是这两种情况同时存在。但它们存在于一个光谱上。有一些非常强大的国家，他们有能力并且愿意以实力回应特朗普的单边主义。你会把**习近平**领导下的**中国**排在第一位，但你也会把其他国家排在这一类。他们是**TACO**国家。甚至**巴西**，你知道，尽管有“唐罗主义”，巴西人还是受到了很大的压力。你知道，特朗普说：“我要对你征收关税，除非你对你的社交媒体法规做些什么。我不喜欢它对待我们公司的方式，我也不喜欢你追捕我的朋友**J·博尔索纳罗**，他的儿子一直在马阿拉歌庄园游说我，而你刚刚因为假新闻判了他27年徒刑，你知道，试图推翻选举并组织刺杀卢拉。”嗯，所以我要对你征收关税。但特朗普却退缩了。退缩是因为巴西是一个大经济体，他需要巴西的商品出口到美国以降低物价。所以**卢拉**和特朗普实际上正在努力达成协议。他们处于等式的**TACO**一边。但我们还有等式的**FAFO**一边，**委内瑞拉**显然处于等式的**FAFO**一边。**马杜罗**已经明白了这一点。直到大约48小时前，他还以为自己是**TACO**。我向你保证，马杜罗现在明白他们已经牢牢地处于**FAFO**领域了，还有其他国家。**墨西哥**人明白他们处于**FAFO**领域。**古巴**人当然应该很快明白这一点。在特朗普看来，在**J·D·万斯**看来，欧洲人处于**FAFO**领域，他们需要更认真地思考如何对一个潜在的敌对美国进行威慑，以防止美国损害他们的主权。这正是丹麦首相声明以及所有北欧领导人支持的动机，他们认为如果你试图侵犯我们的主权，这将是**北约**的终结。这确实是它的意义所在，它在国内，在美国国内也意味着哪里会有抵抗，哪里会有力量。你知道，我的意思是，从历史上看，我们理解这个想法，你有一把刺刀，如果你碰到钢铁，你就会停下来，如果你碰到烂泥，你就会继续前进。这就是应用于地缘政治的丛林法则。这绝对是特朗普的外交政策取向，现在正被世界各国视为显而易见的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Well, um, first of all, Greenland is not a joke for Trump. Um, it's it's a little painful to say that because it obviously is, uh, the territory of an allied nation. Um but um the fact is that Trump and the White House have a number of people that are working on relevant pieces of what they want in Greenland in terms of national security, in terms of political allegiance, in terms of economic access, much of which not all much of which they could get by negotiating just with the Danes. But that by itself so far is not getting to yeses. And and the reason for that is not only because Denmark is seen to be as small but also because the Europeans are seen to be weak. And and here we should broaden the aperture a little bit. There have been two acronyms that have been described by very different populations in in understanding how Trump behaves and and one is taco. Trump always chickens out used by his adversaries and his opponents to say, you know, Trump doesn't have a fist in his glove and he says he's going to do X Y and Z, but then he backs down. And then the second is fafo around and find out. And that is Trump's supporters and members of his own administration and sometimes Trump himself that says, you know, you don't do what Trump wants you to do and he's going to hurt you and the consequences are going to be serious. And of course, the reality, like so many of these things in our very very divided, hair on fire political environment, the reality is that both of these things exist at the same time. But they exist along a spectrum. You have, you know, certain very powerful countries that are capable and willing to actually respond with strength to Trump's unilateralism. And you'd put Xihinping's China number one in that category, but you'd also put in that category and others. And and they are the taco countries. Brazil even, you know, they were the Brazilians were pushed really hard despite the Dawnroe doctrine. You know, Trump said, "I'm going to tariff you unless you do something about your social media regulation. I don't like the way it's treating our c our companies and I don't like the way you're going after my buddy J Bolsinaro whose son has been lobbying me down at Mara Lago and you just gave him a 27year jail sentence for fake news, you know, trying to overturn the election and organize the assassination of Lula." And so I'm going to tariff you. And Trump has backed right down. Backed down because Brazil is a big economy and he needs Brazilian commodities. to be to have to be exported to the United States to bring prices down. And so Lula and Trump are actually now working towards a deal. They're on the taco side of the equation. But then we've got the fafo side of the equation and Venezuela is obviously on the fafo side of the equation. Maduro has figured that out. He he thought he was taco until about two 48 hours ago. I assure you that Maduro now understands that they are solidly in fafo territory and and there are others. The Mexicans understand that they're in fafo territory. The Cubans certainly should understand that in very short order. The Europeans, in Trump's mind, in JD Vance's mind, the Europeans are in fafo territory and they need to be much more serious about what deterrence looks like against a potentially adversarial United States to prevent the US from undermining their own sovereignty. And that is what has motivated the statement by the Danish prime minister and the support from all of the Nordic leaders that this is the end of NATO if you try to transgress our sovereignty. And that's really what it amounts to and it's also what it amounts to domestically inside the United States is where will there be resistance and where will there be strength you know I mean historically we understand this this idea that you've got a bayonet and if you if you hit steel you stop and if you hit mush you press on and and this is the law of the jungle as applied to geopolitics And it is absolutely Trump's orientation towards foreign policy which is now being seen as as manifest by by countries all around the world.

### 美国政治革命：全球首要风险

**Helen Walters**: 那么，让我们回到风险报告一会儿。你在报告中写道，2026年是一个转折点，实际上你引用的第一个风险是关于美国，即世界上最强大的国家正处于一场政治革命之中。但我实际上想跳到你报告后面的一句话，其中谈到美国正处于自己的“戈尔巴乔夫晚期”。这个国家正朝着某个方向狂奔，但没有人知道是什么方向。我想让你谈谈这一点，因为我认为没有人会真正愿意接受俄罗斯自己的“后戈尔巴乔夫时代”版本。那么，我们正在走向何方？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: So to get back to the risks report for a moment. So you in the report you wrote that 2026 is a tipping point year and actually the very first risk that you cite is about America is the fact that the world's most powerful country is in the throws of a political revolution. But I actually want to skip to a a phrase that you have later on in the report which talks about America being in its own late Gorbachov era. The country is careening towards something but nobody knows what. And I want you to talk about that because I don't think anyone would actually willingly sign up to be sign up for a version of Russia's own post Gorbachov era. So what do you where are we going?

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，海伦，你说得对，但很多人会支持一场针对他们认为不合法且对他们不起作用的制度的政治革命。当然，这正是你得到**特朗普**的原因。你我之前也谈过这一点，特朗普不是美国政治体系功能失调的原因。他是症状，他是受益者，他是加速器，但他不是原因。而且，在2024年投票给特朗普的人中，更多的人认为民主是投票的重要原因，而不是投票反对他的人。这是因为他们认为政治体系如此破败，并被民主党人武器化来对抗特朗普，导致了他前所未有的两次弹劾，导致了他前所未有的重罪定罪，导致了他令人遗憾地有先例的未遂刺杀。嗯，因此他们不得不将美国的权力部门，**司法部**、**联邦调查局**、**国税局**武器化。嗯，不得不将行政国家政治化，以确保这种情况永远不会再发生。所以我们现在处于这样一个环境，许多美国人，当然也包括总统，认为美国的主要对手不是俄罗斯人，不是中国人，而是在国内，是政治反对派。所以，这就是推动这场政治革命的原因。在我的一生中，有三次大规模的政治革命产生了宏观影响。第一次是**邓小平**在中国的经济革命，不是政治革命，那次是成功的。它将中国开放给全球市场。嗯，它带来了中国50年史无前例的增长，现在中国已成为美国的经济和技术竞争对手。没有其他国家能接近。嗯，第二次是**戈尔巴乔夫**的革命。我当时还是一个年轻的政治学家，正在磨练我的技能。那既是一场经济革命，也是一场政治革命。它失败了，结果苏联解体了。但在1989年、1990年，你不知道它会成功还是失败。你身处其中，很多人都支持它。现在我们在美国有一场政治革命，不是经济革命。特朗普正在推动它。嗯，在2026年，它显然比2025年初任何观察家认为的都要走得更远。而美国内部的抵抗也比2025年初任何观察家认为的都要弱。这就是为什么美国的政治革命显然是全球最大的风险。这并不是说政治革命会成功，而是说它会继续进行。随着我们走向中期选举和2028年，它将变得更具破坏性，而不是更小。而我们看到抵抗的地方，特朗普能够打破系统的地方，我相信其后果将是永久性的，至少在一定程度上对美国和全球力量平衡而言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Well, you're right, Helen, but but lots of people would sign up for a political revolution against the system that they believe is illegitimate and not working for them. And that of course is exactly how you got Trump. You and I have talked about that piece before, that Trump is not the cause of the dysfunction in the US political system. He is a symptom, he is a beneficiary, and he is an accelerant, but he's not the cause. And and more people that voted for Trump believe that democracy is an important reason to vote than voted against him in 2024. And it's because they thought the political system was so broken and had been weaponized by the Democrats against Trump, leading to his unprecedented two impeachments, leading to his unprecedented felony convictions, leading to his sadly precedented near assassination. And that they as a consequence had to weaponize the US power ministries, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the IRS. Had to politicize the administrative state to ensure that that would never happen again. So we are now in an environment where many many Americans and certainly including the president believe that the principal adversary of the US is not the Russians, not the Chinese but is inside the country is the political opposition. So that is what is driving this political revolution. Now in my lifetime there have been three political revolutions at scale that have had macro impact. The first was Deng Xiaopang's economic revolution not political in China and that was successful. It opened China up to the global market. And it led to 50 years of unprecedented Chinese growth that now shows China to be an earthw economic competitor and technological competitor to the United States. No one else is close. Number two was Gorbachov's revolution. I was cutting my teeth as a young political scientist as that was going on. That was both an economic and a political revolution. It failed and as a consequence, the Soviet Union fell apart. But in 1989, 1990, you didn't know if it was going to succeed or fail. You were in the middle of it and a lot of people were signed up for it. And now we have a political revolution in the United States, not an economic revolution. Trump is driving it. It in 2026 has clearly gone much farther than any observers at the beginning of 2025 believed it would. And the resistance inside the United States has been weaker than any observers at the beginning of 2025 believed it would be. And that's why the political revolution in the US is clearly the top global risk out there. That's not to say the political revolution will be successful, but it is to say that it will proceed. It will become more disruptive, not less, as we move towards midterm elections and 2028. And where we see resistance, where Trump is able to break the system, I believe the consequences will be permanent, at least in part, for the United States and for the global power balance.

### 美国政治革命的制衡力量

**Helen Walters**: 你认为美国内部会出现任何稳定力量来采取不同的策略吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: Do you see any stabilizing force emerging within the US to espouse a different tack?

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 当然，但这仍处于早期阶段。所以，我们在这份报告中做的一件事是，我们审视了2025年期间所有可能被视为支持政治革命的政策。嗯，我们对它们进行了分类。我们开发了一种方法，并从它们对规范的影响、侵蚀美国政治规范以及影响行政部门的制衡方面来审视它们。对于那些在很大程度上侵蚀了制衡和规范的活动，那就是你所说的政治革命活动。那些仅仅侵蚀规范但没有侵蚀制衡的，是规范侵蚀，但不是系统破坏。而那些既不侵蚀规范也不侵蚀制衡的，很多都成了头条新闻，因为人们对政治感到非常愤怒，所以“橙色坏人”之类的，一切都很糟糕。但实际上，这些是我们不应该关注的事情。所以，我们做了所有这些，并把它放在一个2乘2的图表上。如果你只看去年真正侵蚀了规范和制衡的行动，例如机构关闭、**AIPA**关税、国民警卫队部署、ACT blue调查、解雇独立委员、新闻机构诉讼、律师事务所制裁、口袋否决、**丽莎·库克**解雇、大学拨款冻结、**科米**和**詹姆斯**起诉等等。我的意思是，这在第一年是前所未有的。在第一年，并非所有这些努力都成功了。这就像你把很多东西扔到墙上，看看什么能粘住，然后当你没有看到抵抗时，你就继续前进。其中一些事情已经被阻止了。其中一些事情仍有待确定。其中一些事情特朗普已经成功了。嗯，我想说，你看到成功抵抗的地方，第一是法院。最高法院不愿对所有事情都做出裁决，而且反应肯定比特朗普的挑战能力慢，普通法院也是如此。嗯，我们当然看到了这一点，例如在委内瑞拉的最新行动中。嗯，但法院在许多领域都表明它们继续保持独立，陪审团制度当然继续保持独立，并且是从美国公民中随机选出的。嗯，最高法院本身也是独立的，并对总统起到制衡作用，包括制约总统不能竞选第三任期。嗯，军队，尽管军队高层政治化，尽管许多监察长被撤职，但我想说，军队中坚实的高级专业人员核心忠于宪法和国家，而不是忠于总统个人，这非常重要。嗯，美国的联邦制度，事实是美国仍然有州，而且这些州有红色州和蓝色州，它们由在施政上更具技术官僚倾向的人管理，市长也是如此，而不是他们在众议院和参议院的同事。他们控制着许多对美国国内重要的政策决定，包括美国中期选举和联邦选举以及总统选举的进行方式。所以，由于所有这些原因，存在制衡。如果你让我今天打赌，我会说我相信**特朗普**的政治革命会失败。但目前我对这个判断没有很强的信心。它正在迅速发展。我非常有信心特朗普的政治革命将继续，而且在我们确定结果之前，事情将会破裂。而且它也是不可持续的，很可能在2028年之前，我们将经历某种宪法危机或接近宪法危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Sure, but it is still early days. So, one of the things we did in this report is we took a look at all of the policies that could be seen as supporting a political revolution over the course of 2025. And we characterized them. We developed a methodology and we looked at them in terms of the impact they had on norms, eroding political norms in the US and on impacting the checks and balances on the executive. And and for those that were actually eroding in a significant way both the checks and balances and the norms, that was the group of activities that you would see as political revolution. Those that just erode norms but not the checks and balances are norm-eroding but not system-breaking. And those that neither erode norms nor checks, a lot of them make headlines because people's hair is on fire on the politics and so orange man bad and so everything is horrible. But in reality those are things we shouldn't be paying attention to. So, we did all of that and we put it on a 2 by 2 graph. And if you just look at the acts that were taken that really truly erode norms and checks and balances over the last year, agency shutdowns, IPA tariffs, National Guard deployments, ACT blue investigation, firing independent commissioners, news organization lawsuits, law firm sanctions, pocket recisions, Lisa Cook firing, university grant freezes, Comey and James prosecutions, on and on and on. I mean, this is unprecedented in the first year. In the first year, now not all of those efforts have been successful. It's like you throw a lot at the wall and you see what sticks and then you keep going when you don't see resistance. Some of these things have been prevented. Some of these things are still to be determined. Some of them have been successful by Trump. I would say that the things the places where you see successful resistance, number one the courts, the Supreme Court has not been willing to rule on all things and and certainly is slower in response and the courts in general than Trump's ability to challenge. And we certainly see that with actions most recent actions for example in Venezuela. But there have been many areas where the courts have shown that they continue to be independent that the jury system of course continues to be independent and randomized from American citizens. And the Supreme Court itself is independent and acts as a check on the president including as a check on the president's inability to run for a third term. The military, despite the politicization of the top of the military, despite the removal of many of the inspectors general, I would say that the the the the solid senior core of military professionals are loyal to the constitution and the country and not loyal to the president individually and that really matters. The federal system in the US, the fact that the US is still has states and that those are red and blue states and those are governed by people that are much more technocratic in orientation, mayors as well, than their colleagues in the House and Senate. And they have control over a lot of policy decisions that matter for the US domestically, including the way elections are conducted in the US midterms coming up and and federal and so and and and presidential. So for all of those reasons, there are checks. And if you made me bet today, I would say I believe that Trump's political revolution will fail. But I do not have a strong level of confidence in that call at this point. It's moving quickly. I have a strong level of confidence that Trump's political revolution will continue and that things are going to break before we determine that outcome. And that it's also unsustainable, that it's quite likely that we will experience some kind of constitutional or near constitutional crisis or crisis well before we get to 2028.

### 欧洲困境：被围困的大陆

**Helen Walters**: 好的，我们来看看欧洲，这是你提到的另一个风险。你将其描述为“被围困的欧洲”。现在，你已经谈到欧洲需要加强并发展某种形式的威慑力来对抗**特朗普**，以表明他们不像美国，尤其是**J·D·万斯**似乎认为的那样软弱。同时，正如你在报告中写道，英国、法国和德国目前都面临着巨大的内部压力，无法真正专注于做必要的事情来发展所需的威慑力等等。那么，请告诉我们关于欧洲的情况，以及我们今年应该关注什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: All right, let's go to Europe, which is another of the risks that you cite. You describe it as Europe under siege. Now, you already talked about the fact that Europe kind of needs to step up and and develop some form of deterrence against Trump in order to kind of show that they're not as weak as apparently the US, especially JD Vance seems to think that they are. At the same time, as you write in this report, the UK, France, and Germany are all facing incredible internal pressure currently and are not really able to focus on doing what is necessary to develop whatever deterrence is necessary, etc. So, talk to us about Europe and what we should be looking for this year.

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 是的。我的意思是，欧洲人基本上押注世界将继续由一个例外主义的、不可或缺的美国来推动自由贸易和集体安全，并且跨大西洋关系对美国至关重要。他们下了这个赌注。他们几十年来一直如此。这是一个糟糕的赌注。嗯，说出来很痛苦，因为我希望它是一个好赌注，但它不是。你知道，当我在2012年第一次写关于“G零世界”时，我写到“独立美国”而不是“不可或缺的美国”是美国更可能的轨迹时，欧洲人显然不相信。如果他们相信，他们也没有准备好采取行动。现在已经很晚了。我确实认为北欧国家、波罗的海国家、德国人、波兰人，我确实认为他们现在理解并接受了紧迫性。我不确定他们是否有能力做出足够强烈的回应，使其产生影响。嗯，他们有**德拉吉报告**。他们正在努力变得更具竞争力。他们正在努力提高生产力和增长，支持创业，投资更多研发和基础设施，降低能源成本，嗯，并发展能够与美国竞争的科技公司。他们离这还差得很远。嗯，他们正在努力在国防上投入更多资金，他们正在努力将国防整合到整个欧洲，并与加拿大人和其他国家合作，这样他们就不再那么需要美国人了。他们正在把所有钱都花在**乌克兰**上。美国纳税人今天不再支持乌克兰了。一年前他们还在支持，几乎是五五开。今天欧洲人承担了全部。但我相信欧洲人能够做得足够好吗？考虑到来自**俄罗斯**的外部巨大压力，以及一个不认为强大的**欧盟**对美国有利的美国？它希望欧盟分裂，希望有更多的英国脱欧，希望支持疑欧派政党，比如德国的**德国选择党**，英国的改革党，法国的**国民联盟**。嗯，不，不幸的是，如果你让我打赌，我不会赌欧洲人能成功度过这个过程。而且，我也不会像赌中国人能成功度过这个过程那样，赌欧洲人能成功。这不是我想下的赌注。我宁愿说欧洲人会成功，而中国人会遇到更多困难，他们必须更多地与所谓的西方政治体系、经济体系保持一致。但正如你所知，嗯，这不是关于我喜欢什么。这不是关于我偏好什么。没有人真正关心。这是关于我评估什么，**欧亚集团**遍布全球的250名分析师，我们根据我们的分析以及我们与世界各地领导人交谈的基础，我们认为会发生什么。这就是为什么欧洲在今年的报告中是一个如此重大的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Yeah. I mean, the Europeans have basically made a bet that the world was going to continue with an exceptionalist, indispensable America that would promote free trade and collective security and that the transatlantic relationship would be critical for the US. They made that bet. They've made it for decades. That was a bad bet. And it's it's painful to say that because I would like it to have been a good bet, but it wasn't. And you know, when I wrote about the Gzero world for the first time in 2012 and I wrote about independent America as opposed to indispensable America as the more likely trajectory for the US, the Europeans clearly did not believe it. And if they did believe it, they weren't prepared to act on it. And now it is getting very late. I I do think the Nordics, the Baltics, the Germans, the Poles, I do think that they now understand and accept the urgency. I am not sure that they are capable of responding sufficiently strongly to make it matter. They have the Draghi report. They are trying to become more competitive. They're trying to improve their productivity and growth, support entrepreneurship, invest more in research and development and infrastructure, bring energy costs down, and and develop technology companies that can compete with the United States. They're they're not remotely close to that. They are trying to spend much more on defense and they're trying to integrate that defense across Europe and with the Canadians and with others so that they don't need the Americans as much. And they are spending all the money on Ukraine. The American taxpayers are not supporting Ukraine today. They were a year ago. It was almost 50/50. Today the Europeans are doing all of it. But do I believe the Europeans will be able to do enough given the extraordinary pressures externally from Russia directly from a US that does not believe that a strong European Union is good for the US? wants the EU to fragment, wants more Brexits, wants to support euroskeptic parties like the AFD in Germany, like reform in the UK, like the national rally in France. No, I I unfortunately I would not, if you made me make the bet, I would not make the bet that the Europeans will succeed through this process. And and in a way that I would make the bet that the Chinese will succeed through this process. That is not the bet I want to make. I would rather say that the Europeans are going to succeed and the Chinese have a harder time and they have to align more with quote unquote western political system, economic system. But as you know, this is not about what I like. This is not about what I would prefer. Nobody really cares. This is about what I assess what Eurasia Group 250 people analysts all over the world what we believe on the basis of our analysis and the basis of the people that we talk to the leaders all over the world what we believe is going to happen and that's why Europe is such a significant risk in the report this year.

</details>

**Helen Walters**: 所以，我有一个关于这个的后续问题。当然，我们都非常关心你的想法，伊恩，我们必须非常清楚，但是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: So, I have a follow-up question about that. And of course, we all care deeply what you think. Ian, let's be let's be very clear, but

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 我想要的和我所想的非常不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: what I want very different from what I think.

</details>

**Helen Walters**: 你想要什么？没错。抱歉，我的头脑非常模糊。嗯，但我很好奇，如果欧洲不采取必要行动，会是什么样子？接下来会发生什么？我甚至不明白这到底意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: What do you want? That's right. Sorry, my head is very foggy. Um, but I'm curious, what does it look like if Europe doesn't do what is necessary? What is the next what I I don't even understand what the implications of that really are.

</details>

### 欧洲模式的衰落与全球影响

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，**欧盟**变得更加分裂。嗯，它变得更像一个失败的实验。嗯，他们成为技术和规则的“接受者”，而不是“制定者”。欧洲人一直是监管超级大国，能够制定许多世界其他国家必须遵守的规则。如果你想进入欧洲市场，嗯，他们将不得不容忍基本上由其他国家设定的规则，否则他们将无法进入。嗯，这意味着他们的增长将继续减少，这也意味着欧洲的社会契约将开始瓦解。问题是，如果你考虑全球经济以及经济体系如何运作，美国不像一个自由市场，中国是国家控制的。它的运作方式是中国国家掌控企业。在美国，私营部门掌控监管环境，而在欧洲，国家充当独立而强大的监管和官僚仲裁者，这使得欧洲人能够促进一个更加健全的社会契约。问题是，伴随而来的并没有显著的增长。所以，他们负担不起。他们无法支付，他们失去了全球影响力。随着情况恶化，欧洲公民开始反对这种制度，反对将他们的主权转移到布鲁塞尔和欧盟，并开始投票支持疑欧派政党，这些政党会将权力分散给德国人、法国人、荷兰人、意大利人，分散给各个国家。但当然，事实是，欧洲之所以能够帮助制定全球规则，是因为欧盟以集体方式拥有影响力。嗯，美国人不喜欢这样。美国人希望能够与那些规模小得多、实力弱得多的欧洲国家达成有利于美国的协议。中国人也有同样的感觉。俄罗斯人也有同样的感觉。这些国家现在更喜欢丛林法则，对吗？他们不想要法治。他们想要丛林法则，强者为所欲为。欧洲人需要一个系统才能蓬勃发展，在这个系统中，每个人都接受基本相同的价值观、法治以及多边协议和架构。那个世界正在瓦解。如果欧洲人做不到，那意味着欧洲模式将不再在全球拥有影响力。因此，相反，各个欧洲国家将越来越多地被美国人、中国人、俄罗斯人或他们中的某种组合“挑走”。嗯，他们将不得不做出非常不舒服的选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Um, the EU becomes more divided. Um it uh is is becomes more of a failed experiment. Um they become uh makers as uh I mean takers as opposed to makers uh of technology and of rules. The Europeans have been a regulatory superpower that have been able to make rules that a lot of the rest of the world have have to align with. If you want access to the European market, uh they will have to uh tolerate rules that are basically being set by other countries or else they won't get access. Um and that means that their growth will uh continue to diminish and it also means that the social contract in Europe will start to fall apart. The thing is if you think about the global economy and how economic systems work, the United States is not like a free market and China is state controlled. It's the way it's worked has been in China the state captures corporations. In the US, the private sector captures the regulatory environment and in Europe, the state acts as an independent strong arbiter for regulation and bureaucracy and that allows the Europeans to promote a much more robust social contract. The problem is that there isn't significant growth that goes along with that. So, they can't afford it. They can't pay for it and they lose influence globally. And as that gets worse, the European citizens start opposing that system and oppose the transfer of their sovereignty to Brussels and the European Union and start voting for Euroskeepic parties that would decentralize power to the Germans, to the French, to the Dutch, to individ to the Italians, to individual countries. But of course, the fact is that the reason that Europe has had the ability to help set rules globally is because the EU has influence in a collective way. Well, the Americans don't like that. The Americans want to be able to cut their deals that advantage the US with individual much smaller, less powerful European states. The Chinese feel the same way. The Russians feel the same way. Those countries now prefer law of the jungle, right? They they don't want rule of law. They want law of the jungle where the powerful do what they want. The Europeans need a system to thrive where everybody accepts basically the same values and rule of law and multilateral agreements and architecture. That world is falling apart. And if the Europeans don't make it, that means that the European model is no longer going to have influence globally. And so instead, individual European countries will increasingly get picked off by the Americans, by the Chinese, by the Russians, or some constellation of them. Um, and they're going to have to make very uncomfortable choices.

### 俄罗斯的第二战线：北约前线国家的风险

**Helen Walters**: 呼，这真让人深思。好的。你提到了**乌克兰**和**俄罗斯**，俄罗斯确实出现在全球风险清单上，但有趣的是，并非因为与乌克兰的热战，而是因为你所说的对**北约**的升级，也就是俄罗斯的第二战线。那么，请告诉我们这方面的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: Phew, that's something to think about. All right. So you mentioned both Ukraine and Russia and Russia shows up on the list of uh global risks, but actually interestingly not because of the hot war with Ukraine, but actually because of what you you term as being um an escalation against NATO, so Russia's second front. So talk to us about that.

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 当然，**乌克兰战争**在这里至关重要。嗯，但美国已经表明，他们愿意对乌克兰施加更大的压力，乌克兰是一个更亲近但更弱小的国家，而不是对俄罗斯施加压力。原因在于**特朗普**对停火感兴趣，无论后果如何。如果你只关心这一点，那么向乌克兰人施压让他们投降就更容易。特朗普在这项政策上取得了成功，而他对俄罗斯施压的努力远没有那么强硬，导致俄罗斯人说：“不费心了，不会帮你，不会停火。”现在俄罗斯人在乌克兰战场上损失了大量兵力，他们的经济正日益陷入结构性困境。嗯，他们很难销售石油，出口石油，因为美国正在向**印度**等国施压，要求他们不要在能源价格较低的环境下购买石油，而美国和其他国家将继续生产越来越多的石油。所以，俄罗斯人明白他们需要让欧洲人停止这样做，他们认为实现这一目标的最佳方式是让欧洲人付出代价，而欧洲人现在正承担着全部负担。但并非所有欧洲人都愿意，对吗？西班牙人兴趣不大。意大利人兴趣不大。塞尔维亚人兴趣不大。匈牙利人、斯洛伐克人，**欧盟**内外的一些欧洲国家对提供这种支持兴趣不大。所以你看到的是俄罗斯人更愿意对**北约**前线国家进行不对称攻击。你看到气象气球进入**立陶宛**，无人机进入**波兰**和**罗马尼亚**。你看到俄罗斯船只拖锚破坏光纤电缆。**芬兰**在过去72小时内刚刚抓到一艘。你看到俄罗斯人正在利用Telegram支付这些国家的当地人进行破坏、间谍活动、企图破坏和蓄意破坏，甚至暗杀。嗯，北约对此几乎没有做出回应。我们现在看到的是一群北约国家开始说：“我们不能容忍这一点。如果俄罗斯人继续进行这些袭击，我们必须让俄罗斯人付出代价。”就像北欧国家说如果美国试图夺取**格陵兰岛**就必须付出代价一样，我们看到这些国家说我们需要考虑对俄罗斯进行进攻性网络攻击。我们需要在俄罗斯防御薄弱的地区进行军事演习，以回应他们对我们所做的事情。当他们进入我们的领土时，我们需要紧急起飞我们的战斗机。这些风险正在升级。所以，事故的可能性，双方之间冲突突然加剧的可能性，在过去将近四年里，现在到下个月二月，这场战争就四年了。嗯，很多人当然看到了乌克兰和平民遭受的巨大破坏。他们看到了俄罗斯人将自己的士兵投入的“绞肉机”，但他们开始认为，虽然这场战争对世界其他国家没有那么多后果。我认为这被低估了。我认为欧洲所承受的压力，俄罗斯人非常清楚，随着这场战争继续进行，乌克兰人和俄罗斯人付出了更大的代价，双方都变得更愿意承担风险，这意味着这场战争蔓延到北约前线国家的可能性正在增加。当然，如果发生这种情况，那将比乌克兰再失去一点领土的风险大得多。因为海伦，请记住，我们在这份报告中考虑风险的方式是三方面的：可能性、紧迫性和影响。乌克兰境内的俄乌战争，当供应链已经，你知道，为了避免制裁，为了避免黑海，为了避免俄罗斯能源天然气输送欧洲而转移时，这些风险已经得到缓解，但北约前线国家卷入与俄罗斯冲突的风险，情况并非如此。所以，这正在成为一个更重大的风险，尽管今年它仅仅排在前五名之内。嗯，但它确实很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ian Bremer**: Of course, the Ukraine war is essential here. But the United States has already shown that they are willing to put much more pressure on Ukraine, a more aligned country, but a weaker one, than they are with Russia. And the reason for that is because Trump is interested in a ceasefire, no matter what the consequences. And if that's all you care about, then it's easier to press the Ukrainians to get them to capitulate. And Trump has had success in his policy of doing that where his effort to put pressure on Russia which has not been as nearly as strong has led the Russians to say not going to bother, not going to help you not doing a ceasefire. Now the Russians are losing a lot of men fighting Ukraine and their economy is increasingly in structural trouble. And they're having a hard time selling oil, exporting oil with the Americans pressuring India, for example, to not buy it in a lower energy price environment where the Americans and others are going to keep producing more and more. So, the Russians understand that they need to get the Europeans to stop doing this and they think the best way to accomplish that is to make this costly for the Europeans who are right now shouldering the entire burden. But not all the Europeans want to, right? The Spaniards are less interested. The Italians are less interested. The Serbs are less interested. The Hungarians, the Slovox, a number of European countries in the EU and outside the EU are less interested in providing that support. And so what you see is the Russians more willing to engage in asymmetric attacks into NATO's frontline states. You see the weather balloons going into Lithuania, the drones going into Poland and Romania. You see the Russian ships that are dragging anchor and destroying fiber optic lines. Finland just caught one of them just over the last 72 hours. You see the Russians that are paying using telegram locals in these countries to engage in vandalism and espionage and attempted destruction and sabotage and even assassinations. And NATO has done very little to respond to that. And what we now see is a a group of NATO countries that are starting to say we can't tolerate this. We have to create a cost for the Russians to engage if the Russians continue to engage in these strikes. In the same way that you have the Nordic states saying there has to be a cost if the US tries to take Greenland, we see these countries saying we need to think about offensive cyber attacks against Russia. We need to do military exercises in areas where the Russians are well are ill-defended to respond to what they're doing against us. We need to scramble our fighter jets when they're coming into our territory. And those risks are escalating. So the likelihood of an accident, the likelihood of a conflict that suddenly becomes greater between the two sides for the last almost four years now, it's it's going to February next month, it's going to be four years of this war. A lot of people see how much damage is being done to Ukraine, of course, and the civilian population. They see the meat grinder that the Russians are throwing their own soldiers into, but they're starting to think that while the war doesn't really have so many consequences for other countries around the world. That I think is underappreciated. And I think that the pressure that Europe is under that the Russians well understand as this war continues to grind on with greater costs for the Ukrainians and the Russians and both become more risk acceptant means that the likelihood this spills over into NATO frontline states is going up. And and of course if that happens that's a much bigger risk than Ukraine losing a little more territory. Because remember Helen the way we think about the risks in these reports are three-fold. It's likelihood, imminence and impact. And Russia Ukraine war inside Ukraine when the supply chains have already been you know sort of moved to avoid the sanctions and move to avoid the Black Sea and move to avoid Russian energy gas transport into Europe. Those risks have been mitigated, but the risk of NATO frontline states being involved in conflict with Russia, that is not the case at all. So, that's becoming a more significant risk even though this year it's only in the barely in the top five. But it is significant.

### 美中关系与台湾：短期稳定下的暗流

**Helen Walters**: 是的，这很有趣，这种强人政治的崛起，以及人们做出这些不知道会走向何方的姿态，对吧？这让我想到了台湾。我想你在这份风险报告中并没有真正提到它，但你认为现在那里正在发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: Yeah, it's interesting to me this whole the rise of the strong man and kind of people making these gestures that who knows where they end up, right? It makes me wonder about Taiwan. I don't think that you really mentioned that in this risks report but what do you think is happening there right now?

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，你知道，**中美关系**，这是世界上地缘政治上最重要的双边关系，今年根本不是一个风险。它是一个“红鲱鱼”（转移注意力的事物）。这意味着，你知道，**特朗普**明白中国人有能力并且愿意对美国造成真正的损害，并且能够承受损害而不屈服，这意味着特朗普不得不专注于如何稳定这种关系，并期待他四月份访问中国会见**习近平**，以及中国今年晚些时候对美国进行互访。而且他愿意听取像**英伟达**的**黄仁勋**这样的说客的意见，向中国人提供**H200**先进人工智能芯片，这曾是一个重要的瓶颈，美国在这方面对中国人拥有优势，因为他们担心中国在关键矿物、稀土和相关供应链方面对美国造成的瓶颈。嗯，**台湾**与此相关。日本首相，新当选的首相，嗯，**高市早苗**，她在日本很受欢迎，目前支持率高达60%以上，在得到美国中层政策制定者的建议后，公开表示如果台湾受到中国攻击，日本将支持台湾。中国人，你知道，对此非常愤怒，并对日本进行了外交和经济上的升级，以及一些军事演习。而特朗普没有公开支持日本人。相反，他打电话给日本首相，他刚刚访问过她，他们去了冲绳，她高兴得跳起来，很高兴和特朗普在一起，而特朗普却说：“啊，你现在应该在台湾问题上冷静一下。”所以，我的意思是，现实是，中国明白在短期内，只要他们不做任何过于挑衅的事情，导致该地区的美国盟友甚至可能向美国提出问题，从而引发强制升级，那么他们在台湾问题上就更具主导地位。所以，这看起来不像，我的意思是，如果我们做五年风险展望，台湾肯定会在其中，海伦。但仅仅看2026年，它不在其中。

**Ian Bremer**: Well, you know, China US which is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world geopolitically is not a risk at all this year. It's a herring. And that means that, you know, Trump understanding that the Chinese are capable and willing in causing real damage to the US and taking damage and not bending the knee has meant that Trump has had to focus on how to stabilize that relationship and looking forward to his trip to China to meet with Xihinping in April and a reciprocal trip by the Chinese to the US later in the year. And he's been willing to listen to lobbyists like Jensen Huang from Nvidia to provide the H200 advanced AI chips to the Chinese, which has been a significant choke point that the Americans have had an advantage over the Chinese on because they're concerned about the choke point the Chinese have on the US on critical minerals, rare earths, and related supply chain. Taiwan is related to this. The Japanese prime minister, the new the newly elected prime minister, Takayichi Sai, who's quite popular in Japan, just in the high 60s right now, after being advised by mid-level US policy makers, publicly said that the Japanese would support Taiwan if they were attacked by China. And the Chinese, you know, you know, were very angry about this and escalated against Japan diplomatically and economically as well as some military exercises. And Trump didn't support the Japanese publicly. Instead, he called up the Japanese prime minister who had had just he had just visited her and they went to Okinawa and she's jumping up and down and so happy to be with Trump and he's saying, "Ah, you should cool it down on Taiwan right now." So, I mean, the reality is that China understands that they're in more of the driver's seat in the near term on Taiwan as long as they don't do anything so provocative that they that they lead to a a forced escalation by American allies in the region and maybe even put the question to the United States. So, this does not look I mean, if we were doing a five-year risk horizon, Taiwan would clearly be on it, Helen. But looking just at 2026, it's not there.

### 危机中的希望：重塑未来

**Helen Walters**: 好的。这份报告内容太多了。所以实际上我想强烈建议大家去阅读它。但我想谈谈你在报告中的结论，你说我们不乐观，但我们抱有希望。我很好奇，在讨论了所有这些之后，你真的仍然抱有希望吗？为什么？我们应该如何抱有希望？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Helen Walters**: Got it. All right. There's so much in this report. So actually what I would like to do is recommend highly that everyone go and read it. But I want to move to the conclusion that you have in the report which is where you say we are not optimistic but we are hopeful. And I'm just curious after all of that after everything that we've discussed you really are still hopeful. Why and how should we be?

</details>

**Ian Bremer**: 嗯，我想我抱有希望是因为我们需要一场危机。我的意思是，在过去的几十年里，美国有大量的人越来越觉得他们的领导人不代表他们。嗯，当我提到他们的领导人时，我不仅仅是指党内的民主党和共和党领导人以及民选官员。我也指媒体领导人。我指大学领导人。我指商业领导人、金融领导人，所有这些人。嗯，我们现在看到的这场政治革命，它正在美国上演，但也在美国向全世界投射力量的方式中上演，它反映了一场危机。嗯，我不知道这场危机的结果会是什么。但我会告诉你，这场危机不仅仅是由上而下驱动的。这场危机也受到了许多美国人，选民，以及愿意走上街头的人的自下而上的推动，他们说：“我们觉得这个国家不代表我们。”而这需要发生。这个系统正在走向一场危机。它发生得比人们预期的要快，但它是必要的。在这场危机中，蕴藏着创造机会的种子，以更好地反映美国人民的利益，并可能使美国更好地与已经改变的世界保持一致。不是1945年的环境，而是2026年、2030年的环境变得更加可能。而且它发生在我们正在开发工具的时候，其中最重要的是**人工智能工具**，如果它们被善加利用，将为个体公民提供非凡的机会。嗯，我知道你同意这一点。我们的朋友**克里斯·安德森**也同意这一点。我的意思是，**TED**的很多内容都是关于在不确定时期部署这些技术，为我们身边的人做更多的事情。嗯，必要性、紧迫性都在那里。我们只需要抓住它。嗯，而且你足够了解我，明白如果我有机会向我身边的人和世界各地的人分享我对这意味着什么的看法，我就会这样做。当然，我抱有希望。看着目前的轨迹，你不可能乐观。但悲观主义，你知道，不是绝望。只要行动权掌握在人类手中，以及我们拥有的工具，那么我认为我们必须有所帮助。

**Ian Bremer**: Uh I guess I'm hopeful because we need a crisis. I mean, the United States for the last several decades has had large numbers of people that increasingly feel like their leaders don't represent them. Um, and when I say their leaders, I don't just mean the Democratic and Republican leaders in the party and the elected officials. I also mean the media leaders. I mean the university leaders. I mean the business leaders, the financial leaders, all of these people. And um we are now this this political revolution that we're seeing which is playing out in the United States but is also playing out in the way that the United States is projecting power all over the world reflects a crisis. And um I don't know what the outcome of that crisis will be. But I'll tell you that the crisis is not just being driven top down. The crisis has also been driven bottom up by a whole bunch of Americans, voters, and people willing to get in the streets that are saying, "We feel like this country does not represent us." And that needed to happen. That this system was heading for a crisis. It's happening faster than people expected, but it's necessary. And in that crisis, the seeds of opportunity to create something that better reflects the interests of the American people and perhaps better aligns the United States with the rest of the world as it has changed. Not the 1945 environment, but the 2026, the 2030 environment becomes much more plausible. And and it's happening at a time that we are developing the tools including most importantly the AI tools that will afford individual citizens extraordinary opportunities if they're used for good. Um, and I know you you agree with this. Our friend Chris Anderson agrees with this. I mean, so much of what TED is about is about trying to deploy these technologies in times of uncertainty to do more for the people around us. Um, there the necessity, the urgency is there. We just have to seize it. Um, and and you know me well enough to understand that if I have an opportunity to to to share my ideas on what that means to people around me and people around the world, I'm going to do that. Of course, I'm hopeful. You can't be optimistic looking at where the present trajectories are. But but pessimism, you know, is not hopelessness. And as long as the agency is in the hands of human beings and the tools that we have to deploy, um then I think that we have to be helpful.
