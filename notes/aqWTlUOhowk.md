summary: 哲学家 Alex O'Connor 深入探讨了关于上帝存在与否的最强论证。他详细阐述了基于层级因果关系的“第一因论证”，并将其与传统的时间性因果论证区分开来，认为宇宙需要一个持续存在的根本性支撑。同时，他也指出了“恶之问题”或“苦难问题”是反对一个全善上帝存在的有力论据。此外，他还剖析了虚无主义的本质，探讨了生命意义的主观性与客观性，并最终介绍了情感主义伦理学，认为道德判断本质上是情感的表达，而非客观事实的陈述。

title: 哲学家 Alex O'Connor：从第一因到虚无主义，我们如何理解存在与意义
---

认为自己是出于某种写在宇宙法则中的原因而存在，而不是一场或喜或悲的意外，这种想法确实更令人慰藉。我认为有非常充分的论据可以相信，宇宙存在某种基本原则，某个必然存在的实体，某个第一因。但我认为，犹太-基督教传统对于这个存在的描述是一个不完美的近似。

<p class="english-text">It is nicer to think that you are here for some kind of reason that's written into the rules of the universe and that it all is just a happy or unhappy accident. I think that there are very good arguments to believe that there are some kind of foundational principle of the universe, some necessarily existing being, some first cause. But I think that the Judeo-Christian tradition is an imperfect approximation of who that being is.</p>
</details>

**虚无主义**（Nihilism: 一种哲学观点，认为生命没有客观意义、目的或内在价值）并非消除价值观，而是分析价值观，并发现它们本质上是毫无根据的，或者即便有根据，也只是人们的主观偏好。像“善”和“恶”这样的概念很难定义，但我们却一直在使用它们。比如，“刚刚发生了一起谋杀案”和“刚刚发生的谋杀案是错误的”，这两者之间有什么区别？如果你试图找出其中的实际差异，我认为那只能是一种态度，一种表达，一种你的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nihilism doesn't remove values, it analyzes values and finds them to be essentially groundless, or if they do have a ground, subjective preferences of people. It's a very difficult thing to define concepts like good and bad, but we employ them all the time. Like what is the difference between a murder just occurred and it's wrong that that murder just occurred? If you try to isolate what the actual difference is there, I think it has to just be an attitude, it's an expression, it's the way you feel.</p>

### 上帝存在与否的最强论证

我认为，支持上帝存在的最有力论证或许是所谓的**第一因论证**（First cause argument: 一种哲学论证，主张万物必有其最初的、无需他因的“第一因”，通常指向“神”）。这个论证听起来相当朴素，很多人都熟悉宇宙需要一个第一因的说法，但我认为人们的思考方式是错误的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think probably the most powerful argument for the existence of God is the so-called first cause argument, which is quite, like, naive. A lot of people are familiar with the idea that we need a first cause for the universe, but I think people think about it wrong.</p>
</details>

你可以将因果论证分为**水平因果论证**（Horizontal causal argument: 指在时间序列上向前追溯的因果链，后一事件由前一事件引起）和**层级因果论证**（Hierarchical causal argument: 指在同一时刻存在的、维持事物状态的因果链，强调根本性的支撑原因）。很多人对层级版本的因果论证并不熟悉，我认为用一个道具，比如这杯可爱的水，可以最好地解释它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is what you might think of as a horizontal causal argument and a hierarchical causal argument. And a lot of people just aren't familiar with the hierarchical version of the causal argument, which I think is probably best explained with a prop, like this lovely glass of water.</p>
</details>

你可能会问自己：“这杯水为什么在这里？”人们通常从时间和之前发生的事情来思考原因，也就是**亚里士多德**（Aristotle: 古希臘哲學家，其思想對西方哲學產生了深遠影響）意义上的“动力因”。比如，有人刚刚把水倒进了杯子。然后我可能会问：“他们为什么要把水倒进杯子？”“哦，因为你让他们这么做的。”“哦，那你为什么那么做？”“嗯，因为杯子是空的，因为我渴了，”等等，如此无限地追溯下去。这没有起点。只要每一步都能由前一步解释，那么一切都可以追溯到过去的时间里得到解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You might ask yourself, "Why is this water here?" And the way that people tend to think about cause is in terms of time and what happened before, what might be called the efficient causes in the Aristotelian sense, which is, well, somebody just poured the water into the glass. And then I might ask, "Well, why did they pour the water into the glass?" "Oh, well because you asked them to." "Oh, well, why did you do that?" "Well, because the glass was empty, because I'm thirsty," so on and so forth, back infinitely. There's just no beginning. It's just as long as every single step is explained by the step before, then everything gets explained back in time.</p>
</details>

但还有另一种思考因果关系的方式。我可以说：“这杯水为什么在这里？”嗯，因为它被杯子托着，对吧？如果杯子不在那里，水就会流出来，或者至少无法保持其形状，即使我们在太空中也是如此。水现在在杯子里，是因为它被杯子托着。从这个意义上说，水现在的形状和位置是由杯子的形状和位置造成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there's another way that you can think about causation. I can say, "Why is this water here?" Well, because it's being held up by the glass, right? If the glass wasn't there, the water would just fall out, or at least wouldn't like retain its shape even if we were in space. The water is in the glass right now because it's being held up by the glass. In that sense, the shape and position of the water right now is being caused by the shape and position of the glass.</p>
</details>

好的，那么杯子为什么在那里？因为它被我的手托着。我的手为什么在那里？被我的手臂支撑着。我的手臂被我的肩膀支撑着。我的肩膀被我的身体支撑着。我的身体被椅子支撑着。椅子被地面支撑着。地面被建筑物的地基支撑着，以此类推。如果你继续追问下去，你可能会追溯到将建筑物向下拉的引力，你可能会追溯到将地球凝聚在一起的自然之力。但最终，所有这一切都发生在当下，在一个时间切片中，并且是层级性的。这不是追溯到过去的因果关系，如果你能明白我的意思，它更像是上下延伸的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so why is the glass there? Because it's being held up by my hand. Why is my hand there? Being held up by my arm. My arm's being held up by my shoulder. My shoulder's being held up by my body. My body is being held up by the chair. The chair is being held up by the ground. The ground is being held up by the foundations of the building and so on. And if you kept going, you might get to the gravity that's pulling the building down. You might get the forces of nature which are holding the earth together. But ultimately all of this is happening now in a time slice and hierarchically. This isn't some causation that goes back in time. It's sort of goes up and down if you can see what I mean.</p>
</details>

这种因果关系之所以不能无限延伸，是有原因的。那就是，在这个因果链的每一个阶段，因果作用者本身没有任何因果力，除非它从更根本的东西那里借来了力量。我试着用更简单的话来说明。杯子托着水，但它无法凭自身做到这一点。它被我的手托着，以至于如果我拿开我的手，杯子将不再有力量将水托在这里，对吗？所以杯子的力量，也就是使水处于现在位置的因果力，实际上是从我的手那里借来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there is a reason why that kind of causation cannot go on infinitely. And that is that in each stage of this causal chain, the causal actor doesn't have any causal power except insofar as it borrows it from something more fundamental. I'll try and put that in simpler terms. The glass holds up the water, but it can't do it of its own accord. It's being held up by my hand to the extent that if I took away my hand, the glass would no longer have the power to hold the water here, right? So the glass is power, the causal power to have to cause the water to be where it is right now is literally borrowed from my hand.</p>
</details>

但同样地，如果我移开我的手臂，我的手将不再有力量将水托在原位。所以我的手本身没有任何力量来托住杯子，它是从我的手臂借来的。而我的手臂是从我的肩膀借来的，我的肩膀又从我的身体借来。以至于如果我移开因果链中的任何一个部分，链条上比它更往上的所有东西都会瞬间失去将水托在原位的因果力，对吧？瞬间失去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But likewise, if I removed my arm, my hand would no longer have the power to hold the water where it is. So my hand doesn't have on its own any kind of power to hold up the glass. It borrows it from my arm. And my arm borrows it from my shoulder. And my shoulder borrows it from my body. To the extent that if I were to remove any of those parts in the causal chain, everything further up the chain than that would instantly lose its causal power to hold the water up where it is, right? Instantly.</p>
</details>

这意味着，除了位于这个链条基础、赋予整个链条因果力的那个东西之外，不存在任何实际的因果力。所以，如果你思考一下水平因果关系，想象一系列多米诺骨牌相互推倒。这是时间上的因果关系。一号骨牌被负一号骨牌推倒，负一号骨牌被负二号骨牌推倒，负三、负四、负五，如此无限追溯。在这种因果关系中，当负五号骨牌推倒负四号骨牌，然后骨牌继续倒下时，我可以拿走导致所有其他骨牌倒下的负五号骨牌，我可以拿走那个更早的原因，把它扔进垃圾桶。我们不再需要它了。链条下游的那些骨牌会继续倒下去，对吧？这是一种不需要最初原因、早期原因继续存在，因果链就能继续下去的因果关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what that means is that there is no actual causal power except for whatever is at the basis of this giving the whole chain causal power. So if you think about that horizontal causation, right? Imagine a series of dominoes knocking each other over. This is causation in time. Domino one is knocked over by domino minus one, and domino minus one is knocked over by domino minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five, and so on back to infinity. In this kind of causation, when domino minus five knocks over domino minus four, and then the dominoes keep falling over, I could take domino minus five that caused all these other do dominoes fall over, I could take that earlier cause, I could take it, I could throw it in the bin. We don't need it anymore. Those dominoes further down the chain would keep on going, right? It's the kind of causation where you don't require the first causes, the earlier causes to remain in existence in order for the causal chain to continue.</p>
</details>

另一个例子是父母和孩子。我的祖父导致了我父亲的存在。然后我的祖父去世了。在我祖父去世后，我父亲导致了我的存在。对吧，所以你有原因 A、B 和 C，A 导致 B，然后 A 消失了，C 出现了，B 仍然有因果力来产生 C。你明白我的意思吗？你不需要那个最初的原因一直存在。但那是在所谓的水平因果关系中，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So another example of this would be like parents and children. My grandfather caused my father to exist. Then my grandfather died. After my grandfather died, my father caused me to exist. Right, so like you've got cause A, B and C, A causes B, A then just disappears, gets into C, and B still has the causal power to bring about C. You see what I'm saying? You don't need that first cause to remain there. But that's in this so-called horizontal causation, right?</p>
</details>

在一个层级因果系列中，你不能去掉更早的原因。当我们说更早、最初或根本时，我们不是指时间上，而是指在链条中更靠下的位置。所以，如果我的祖父导致了我父亲的存在，然后我的祖父去世了，我父亲仍然有因果力来产生我。但是，如果我的肩膀决定了我手臂的位置，那么如果我的肩膀消失了，我的手臂就不再有力量来支撑我的手。肩膀需要一直存在并作用于手臂，手臂才能作用于手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In a hierarchical series of causation, you can't get rid of the earlier cause. And when we say earlier or first or fundamental, we don't mean in time. We mean like sort of further down the chain as it were. So if my grandfather causes my father, then my grandfather dies, my father still has the causal power to bring me about. But if my shoulder causes the position of my arm, then if my shoulder disappears, my arm no longer has the power to hold up my hand. The shoulder needs to stay there causing the arm in order for the arm to cause the hand.</p>
</details>

所以所有这些因果关系都是同时发生的，对吧？这意味着没有内在的因果力。我父亲有他自己的因果力来产生我，但我的手臂只是从我的肩膀借来了力量，它本身没有。但我的肩膀也只是从我的身体借来了力量，我的身体又从椅子那里借来。没有椅子，这一切都不会有任何因果力。我的手也无法在这里。没有地板，这一切都无法实现。所以这张椅子里根本没有任何因果力，除非它在此时此刻从它下面的地面借来了力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of that causation happens all at once, right? Which means that there is no intrinsic causal power. My father has his own causal power to bring about me, but my arm only borrows it from my shoulder. It doesn't have it on its own. But my shoulder only borrows it from my body, and my body only borrows it from the chair. Without the chair, none of this would have any causal power. My hand would not be able to be here. And without the floor, none of that would be able to do anything. So there's no causal power at all in this chair, except insofar as it borrows it right now in this instant from the ground below it.</p>
</details>

所以如果这个链条无限地回溯下去，这个从那个借，那个又从另一个借，如此无限地下去，那么就根本不存在任何因果力了，因为它不是从任何地方借来的。这就像每个人都只是从另一个本身没有因果力的东西那里借力。它唯一的因果力是从别处借来的，而那个别处也没有因果力。那么它是从哪里得到的呢？它是从另一个没有因果力的东西那里借来的。那么那个又是从哪里得到的呢？这个链条不能永远回溯下去，因为如果这样，此时此刻就根本不会有任何因果力了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if this just goes back infinitely, well, this borrows from this and this borrows from this and this borrows, and that goes back on literally infinitely, then there is no causal power at all because it's not being borrowed from anywhere. It's like everyone is just borrowing from another thing which has no causal power. It only gets its causal power, it's borrowed it from something else which has no causal power. So where did it get it from? It borrowed it from something else, which has no causal power. So where did that get it from? That can't go back forever because then there would be literally no causal power in this instant right now.</p>
</details>

所以，不像时间上的因果关系，你可以追溯时间，想象它无限延伸，没有第一因，因为链条中的每个独立因果作用者都有自己的因果力来推倒下一个多米诺骨牌。而层级因果关系，在这个时间切片中，此时此刻，这个被托举的杯子，必然有某种根本性的原因，它赋予了整个因果链生命力，没有它，整个体系就会崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So unlike the temporal thing where you can go back in time and imagine that just sort of goes on infinitely and there's no first cause, because each individual causal actor in the chain has its own causal power to knock over the next domino, the hierarchical causation in this time slice right now, this glass being held up right now has some kind of foundational cause which is giving life to this entire causal chain without which the whole thing would would fall apart.</p>
</details>

所以它是一个维持性的原因。它使事物在此时此刻存在并保持原样，而不是像几十亿年前启动了某个运动，而是在当下维持着它的存在。就像万有引力定律维持着这个房间里所有物体的位置一样，它是所有东西现在被支撑着的根本原因。如果它突然消失了，整个体系就会崩溃，对吧？你现在就需要它，就在此刻，作为这个由地板支撑椅子、椅子支撑建筑等等组成的因果链的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's a sustaining cause. It's things to exist and be as they are right now in time, not like a billion years ago set something in motion, but right now sustaining it in existence. In the same way that like the law of gravity sustains all of the objects in this room in position, it's a fundamental cause of why everything is being held up right now. If that just switched off, like the entire thing would fall apart, right? And you need that now, right now, like at the basis of this sort of causal chain of floors holding up chairs and chairs holding up buildings and stuff like that.</p>
</details>

所以你可能会说，“嗯，那里的根本原因可能是像万有引力定律这样的东西。”好吧，但你可能想问，是什么在维持万有引力定律？是什么确保它明天不会停止工作？这就是这类论证引发的巨大辩论。你可以引入很多技术术语，比如偶然性和必然性，或者谈论“自为因果链”和“偶发因果链”之类的东西，但我们暂时把这些放在一边，就用刚才的方式来思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you might say, "Well, maybe the fundamental cause there then is something like the law of gravity." Fine, but you might wanna ask sort of what's holding the law of gravity in place. What's making sure that it won't stop working tomorrow? And this is this sort of great debate with something like this argument. And there are lots of technical terms that you can throw in there. You can talk about contingency and necessity, and you can talk about per se and per accidens causal chains and stuff, but let's just do away with that for a moment and just think about it in those terms.</p>
</details>

是什么支撑着我头顶上这个我向听众保证存在的隐形麦克风？你解释的深度将取决于具体情境。如果我说，“是什么支撑着那个麦克风？”我们的音响工程师可能会说，“是麦克风支架。”但物理学家可能会说，“哦，是地板向上支撑着麦克风支架。”而哲学家会说，是那个位于因果链基础、赋予一切因果力的东西。这就是第一因论证的最强版本，我认为，一个不受时间影响，并且要求第一因在当下存在的版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is holding up this invisible microphone that I promise our listeners is above my head right now in place? And, like, the depth of explanation you go to will be context dependent. If I say, "What's holding up that microphone?" our audio engineer might say, "Well, it's the mic stand," right? But the physicist might say, "Oh, it's the floor pressing up against the mic stand." But the philosopher will say it's whatever is at the foundation of that causal chain giving causal power to it all. And that is the strongest version of a first cause argument, I think, one that's insensitive to time and one which requires that first cause to exist right now.</p>
</details>

仅凭这一点还不足以确立大写 G 的上帝（God）的存在，对吧？这仅仅确立了宇宙存在某种根本性的、维持性的原则。关于这个东西的性质有很多争论，但需要注意的是，没有一个单一的论证可以证明上帝的存在。你所拥有的是一个累积的案例。你有不同的论证来处理上帝的不同方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this alone isn't strong enough to establish the existence of capital G God, right? Like this just establishes that there is some kind of fundamental sustaining principle of the universe. Now there are lots of debates as to the nature of what that thing could be, but the thing that's really important to note is that there's no singular argument for the existence of God. What you have is a kind of cumulative case. You have different arguments that deal with different aspects of God.</p>
</details>

**托马斯·阿奎那**（Thomas Aquinas: 中世纪最重要的经院哲学家和神学家之一）在他的《神学大全》中讨论了这类因果论证。他提出了五种著名的方式来证明上帝的存在，其中前三种是因果论证。然后你必须做更多的工作来获得上帝的属性。你必须做更多的工作来证明这个东西不是物质的，更要证明它是善的或慈爱的等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this kind of causal argument is discussed by Thomas Aquinas in his "Summa Theologica." He gives five famous ways of sort of showing the existence of God to be true, and the first three are kinds of causal arguments. You have to then do more to get the attributes of God. You have to do more to show that this thing is not material, that this thing is certainly more to show that it's like good or loving or anything like that.</p>
</details>

阿奎那有一个来自变化的论证。它被称为来自运动的论证，但在某种古老的哲学方言中，运动就是指变化。他大量借鉴了亚里士多德的观点，这让事情变得有点复杂，但他会说，某物发生变化意味着某种潜在的东西变成了现实。这就是变化。比如一杯热咖啡会变凉，因为当它热的时候，它有变凉的潜能，而这个潜能被现实化了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so Aquinas has an argument from change. I mean, it's called the argument from motion, but motion just means change in some sort of older dialect of philosophy. So he leans quite heavily on Aristotle, and it gets a bit complicated, but he'll say something like, "For something to change means that something which is potential becomes actual." That's what change is. Like a hot cup of coffee will cool down because when it was hot, it had the potential to become cool and that potential was actualized.</p>
</details>

潜能只能被已经是现实的东西所现实化。潜能无法被潜能所现实化。比如，如果咖啡因为放在冰箱里而变凉，咖啡的潜在冷度不能被冰箱的潜在冷度所实现。冰箱必须是现实地冷的，才能引发咖啡中的潜在冷度，对吧？不能只是你有一个潜在冷的冰箱和一杯潜在冷的咖啡，然后潜在的冷度引发了潜在的……不，你必须有一个现实的东西来现实化咖啡中的潜能，对吧？他认为这就是变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Potential can only be actualized by something which is already actual. Potential can't be actualized by potential. Like if the coffee cools down because it's in a fridge, the potential coldness of the coffee can't be brought into existence by the potential coldness of the fridge. The fridge has to be actually cold in order to bring about the potential coldness in the coffee, right? It can't just be you've got a potentially cold fridge and a potentially a cold cup of coffee and the potential coldness brings about the potential... No, you have to have an actual thing actualizing the potential in the coffee, right? And that's what he thinks change is.</p>
</details>

但这样你就有了另一种因果论证。任何潜在变为现实的变化实例，都必须有一个现实的东西来使其现实化。但又必须有某个东西来现实化那个东西，再现实化那个东西，再现实化那个东西。所以阿奎那顺着这个因果链追溯，并再次说，在起点，必须有一个，正如亚里士多德可能说过的，一个“未被现实化的现实化者”，一个纯粹现实的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you have another kind of causal argument then. Any instance of change where something potential becomes actual, there has to have been something actual to actualize it. But there will have had to have been something to actualize that thing and to actualize that thing and to actualize that thing. And so Aquinas sort of follows this causal chain and says again, at the beginning, there must be a, as Aristotle might have had it, an unactualized actualizer, something which is pure act.</p>
</details>

现在这变得非常技术性和奇怪，但阿奎那接着试图推导出，为什么如果某物中没有潜能，它就不能是物质的。因为如果某物是物质的，你就有可能分割它，有可能移动它。它有潜在的属性。所以如果宇宙的第一因必须是纯粹的现实，没有潜能，那么宇宙的因就不能是物质的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this gets really kind of technical and weird, but Aquinas then tries to draw out why it would be that if something has zero potential in it, it can't be material, for example. Because if something is material, you could potentially divide it. You could potentially move it. There are things that are like potential about it, it has potential qualities. And so if the first cause of the universe has to be pure act, no potentiality, pure act, then whatever is the cause of the universe can't be material.</p>
</details>

所以现在我们得到了一个非物质的宇宙第一因，然后我们以类似的方式继续，使用不同的论证来表明这个东西必须在时间之外，空间之外。最终你会得到一个类似无空间、无时间、有创造力的宇宙第一因，其力量足以使宇宙存在。如果你不想称之为上帝，我没意见，但我认为对大多数人来说这已经足够了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now we've got an immaterial first cause of the universe, and then we carry on in a similar vein using different arguments to show why this thing must be outside of time, outside of space. And you end up with something like a spaceless, timeless creative first cause of the universe powerful enough to bring the universe into existence. And if you don't wanna call that God, that's fine by me, but I think it will suffice for most people.</p>
</details>

反对传统观念中上帝存在的最强论证无疑是“恶之问题”。我更愿意称之为“苦难问题”，因为作为一个伦理情感主义者，我经常遇到宗教人士说：“如果你没有善的标准，你怎么能称任何事物为邪恶呢？”好吧，那我们就不说邪恶，我们说苦难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The strongest argument against the existence of God as traditionally conceived is undoubtedly the problem of evil. I prefer to say the problem of suffering because a lot of the time being an ethical emotivist, especially a religious person will say, "Well, how can you call anything evil if you've got no standard of goodness?" Okay, let's not say evil then. Let's say suffering.</p>
</details>

如果你相信有一位慈爱的上帝，祂有能力做一切可能之事，并且祂不仅监管着宇宙的运行，还监管了宇宙的创造及其参数的设定，那么就会出现一些问题，一些谜团。例如，地球上的生命是自然选择进化的结果。这就是我们拥有如此复杂和多样的生命的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you believe that there is a loving God who has the power to do all that is possible and who supervises not just the goings on of the universe, but also supervised its creation and the setting up of its parameters, there are a few questions that jump out, a few mysteries. For example, life on Earth is the result of evolution by natural selection. That is the reason why we have such complexity and such variance of life.</p>
</details>

自然选择是适者生存。适者生存等同于弱者的毁灭、死亡和苦难。数十亿年来，地球上一直有生命存在。其中大部分时间，生命都存在于残酷的生存竞争中，伴随着捕食和疾病。所有曾经存在的物种中，99.9%——不仅仅是生物个体，而是物种——都从存在中被抹去，通常是以相当凄惨的方式。而所有这一切都内置于上帝选择用来创造地球上人类生命的机制之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Natural selection is survival of the fittest. Survival of the fittest is the same thing as the destruction and death and suffering of the weakest. For billions of years, there's been life on earth. And for much of that, it's existed in a brutal competition for survival, with predation and disease. And 99.9% of all the species, let alone the creatures, but the species who've ever existed being wiped from existence, usually in a pretty dismal manner. And all of this is built into the very mechanism by which God chose to bring about human life on Earth.</p>
</details>

传统的宗教团体相信人类非常特殊。他们认为我们是这一切存在的理由，而不是其他动物和其他历史时期。这意味着所有这一切都是为了我们而发生的。它被内置在系统中。将苦难作为一个抽象对象来谈论是一回事。但是，这些动物所承受的苦难数量，是真正无法估量的——不仅仅是人类这个物种在其二十万年的历史中，或者我猜人类物种的历史要长得多，几百万年。还有在我们之前存在的动物，和我们同时存在的动物，它们所经历的绝望、痛苦、苦难和折磨的深度，是真正无法估量的，对于那些无法继承永生的动物来说，是毫无意义的折磨。

<p class="english-text">Traditional religious communities believe that humans are very special.

It's one thing to talk about suffering as a sort of abstract object. But it is unfathomable, truly, the amount of suffering that these animals, not just like the human species in its 200,000-year history, or I suppose the human species would be much longer than that, a few million years. But the animals who came before us and the animals who existed at the same time as us, it's genuinely unfathomable the depths of despair and misery and suffering and torment, meaningless torment for those animals who don't get to inherit eternal life.</p>

我们被告知，上帝出于某种原因选择了这种机制来让我们存在。这似乎并不符合人们的预期。当然，这并不能反驳上帝的存在。说上帝出于某种原因这么做，在逻辑上并非自相矛盾。但这确实让人感到有些意外。我认为对大多数人来说，这是非常有力的。

<p class="english-text">And we're told that for some reason God chose this mechanism to bring us into existence. It just doesn't seem to be what you would expect. Of course, this doesn't disprove the existence of God. It's not like logically contradictory to say that God did this for some reason. But it just seems a little unexpected. And I think for most people it's very powerful.</p>
</details>

当然，这主要只能用来反驳一个善良上帝的存在。有些人会因此说，“嗯，也许上帝是邪恶的。”但这将取决于你对上帝的看法。因为有些哲学家在证明上帝存在的过程中，已经确立了祂为何必须是至善的。也有些人属于坚持上帝善良的宗教传统。所以，如果他们要接受这样一个论证的合理性，他们至少必须放弃这一点。我认为这个论证是强有力的。

<p class="english-text">Of course, this only really does anything to argue against the existence of a good God. And some people will then just say, "Well, maybe God is evil." But this will then just depend on your view of God. Because there are philosophers who, in the course of proving God's existence, have established why he must be perfectly good, for example. There are also people who belong to religious traditions who insist upon the goodness of God. So they would at least have to give up that if they were to accept the plausibility of an argument like this. And I think it's powerful.</p>

我认为有非常充分的论据可以相信，宇宙存在某种基本原则，某个必然存在的实体，某个第一因。但我认为，犹太-基督教传统对于这个存在的描述是一个不完美的近似。我认为它可能说对了很多，是过去几千年来人类神学智慧的汇编，但它也会有很多错误。

<p class="english-text">I think that there are very good arguments to believe that there are some kind of foundational principle of the universe, some necessarily existing being, some first cause.

I think it probably gets a lot right and is a sort of compilation of human theological wisdom over the past few thousand years, but it will get a lot wrong as well.</p>
</details>

我认为，如果你个人领悟了关于宇宙的某个真理，你坚信存在某种根本性的原因，“我对此知之甚少，也不想信奉某个特定的传统”，我会说，你很有力量。我认为你走在正确的轨道上。同样，如果某人是新无神论派的教条式无神论者，我很有兴趣向他们提出宗教论证，告诉他们这些论证的合理性可能比你从《上帝的错觉》中了解到的要多。但这并不足以说你的无神论是错的。

I think you're on the right track. In the same way that if somebody is sort of a dogmatic atheist of the new atheist variety, I have a lot of fun posing religious arguments to them and saying like that there might actually be more plausibility to these arguments than you would know from reading "The God Delusion." But that's not enough to say that you are wrong about your atheism or anything.</p>

但我更喜欢这样的人，他们要么说我相信有某种神，也许是某种形式的神，甚至可能不是神，只是类似的东西，但我真的不知道它是什么。我会说，“是啊，是啊，我也是，我完全不知道。”同样，有人说，“你知道，有很多谜团，但我就是无法接受这是被某种智能设计的。”我会说，“是啊，我也理解。那太棒了。”然后我们就可以讨论它，你知道吗？所以我很喜欢那样的人。

Likewise somebody who says, "I just, you know, there's a lot of mysteries, but I just can't buy the fact that this was designed somehow intelligently." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that too. That's awesome." And then we can just discuss it, you know? And so I quite like that kind of person.</p>

还有所谓的自然神论者，他们通常被描述为相信上帝启动了宇宙然后就离开了的人。所以祂不参与其中。我的意思是，祂可能已经死了，可能去睡觉了，然后让一切自行运转。这解释了它是如何开始的，但祂已经不在了。我认为这不太说得通。我认为这是伴随科学革命而来的机械论思维的产物。我们把一切都看作有点像一台机器，你把它上紧发条然后让它自己走。

<p class="english-text">There are also the so-called deists who typically are described as people who believe that God kind of set the universe in motion and then went away.

I don't think that makes much sense. I think that this is a product of mechanistic thinking that comes about with the sort of scientific revolution. But we think of everything as sort of like a bit of a machine where you twist it up and let it go.</p>

但我刚才讲的那个论证，我之所以如此喜欢它，是因为我认为它摒弃了自然神论的观点。你不可能有一个启动一切然后去睡觉的上帝。祂不能推倒第一块多米诺骨牌然后走开，让骨牌继续倒下而祂早已死去，因为祂不只是推倒了一块多米诺骨牌然后走开。祂在此时此刻正支撑着我头顶的麦克风。如果祂消失了，整个体系就会崩溃。

He's holding up the microphone above my head right now in this instant. And if he were to disappear, the whole thing would just collapse.</p>

我认为支持那种上帝的论证更有力——不是说祂是人格化的，不是说祂关心人类，对吧？因为你可以区分这些事情。有人说，“我相信有上帝，但祂对人类事务不感兴趣。”这很公平。但有人说，“我相信有上帝，但他已经不在了，完全不在了，”我认为那可能是真的，可能没有上帝。但如果你认为有很好的论证支持上帝的存在，我认为最好的版本要求祂一直存在。

But someone who says, "Well, I believe in a God, but he's just like not around anymore, like at all," I think that might be true, there might be no God. But if you think there's a good argument for God's existence, I think the best versions of arguments for God's existence require that he does stick around.</p>

### 理解虚无主义与人类处境

虚无主义有多种形式，根据语境可以有多种不同的含义。但最广泛的说法可能是，它指不相信或相信生命没有客观目的，我们所做的行为和在生活中表现出的举止也没有客观目的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nihilism comes in many forms, and depending on the context can mean many different things. But most broadly it's probably the lack of belief in or belief that there is no such thing as an objective purpose to life, or to the actions that we commit and the behaviors that we portray within life.</p>
</details>

每当任何人以任何方式行动时，当我拿起一杯水喝，当我走向公交车站时，我这么做都会有一个原因。这些行为不会凭空出现。它们的存在都有某种原因。所以如果你问我为什么要把手臂伸向那边，可能是因为我想拿一杯水。那我为什么这么做呢？我不会无缘无故地这么做。嗯，因为我渴了。好吧，那我为什么渴了？现在我们进入了生物科学的范畴。你可能会说，“嗯，因为我有一段时间没喝水了。”然后你可能会描述我的生物学中导致口渴的原因。你甚至可以给出一个进化论的解释，说明我们为什么会发展出对口渴的敏感性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whenever anybody acts in any way, when I pick up a glass of water to have a drink, when I walk to a bus stop or something, there will be a reason why I've done that. These kinds of behaviors don't just spring up ex nihilo. They exist for some kind of reason. And so if you ask me why it is that I'm reaching my arm over there, it might be because I'm trying to pick up a glass of water. Well why am I doing that? I don't just do that randomly. Well, because I'm thirsty. Okay, well why am I thirsty? Well, now we're kind of into some biological science. You might say, "Well, it's been a while since I've last had a drink." And then you might describe what it is about my biology that causes thirst. And you might even give an evolutionary explanation for why it is that we've developed this sensitivity to thirst.</p>
</details>

最终这总得有个终点。但一旦我们进入生物科学这个层面，这似乎已经超出了我自己的意志、欲望和控制，我突然意识到，如果我现在伸出手臂的最终原因是我无法控制的某个进化原则，那只是动物为生存而斗争的结果，那么我现在伸手的行为就感觉有点傻了。感觉我像是受制于某种不合理的东西，不是某种上帝赋予的目的，喝水这件事本身并没有什么好处。我只是在遵循我的进化驱动力。对很多人来说，这样的过程会感觉相当没有意义，因为你意识到你做的几乎每件事都只是受制于你的动物本能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And eventually this kind of has to bottom out somewhere. But as soon as we're in this level of like biological science, which seems to be kind of outside of my own volition and desire and control, I suddenly realized that if the reason I'm reaching my arm over right now is ultimately speaking because of some evolutionary principle that I had no control over, that's just a result of animals fighting for survival, then my reaching my hand over there kind of feels a bit silly now. It feels like I'm like beholden to something which is not reasonable, is not some kind of God-given purpose, there's nothing good about about drinking the water or anything like that. I'm just sort of following my evolutionary drives. And a process like that for a lot of people will feel quite devoid of meaning because you realize that you're just beholden to your sort of animalistic instincts essentially with almost everything you do.</p>
</details>

虚无主义者认识到，他或她所持有的价值观除了基于自己的偏好或审美偏好之外，没有任何基础。所以，成为一个虚无主义者，并不是没有欲望，也不是没有行动的动机。很多人认为，如果你像个虚无主义者一样生活，你会在床上了此残生。有些虚无主义者可能会这样，而且我认为哲学上的虚无主义和实际上的抑郁症之间确实存在很强的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The thing that the nihilist recognizes is that the values he or she holds are not grounded in anything other than their own preferences or aesthetic preferences. So to be a nihilist is not to, it's not to have no desire. It's not to have no, no motivation to act. A lot of people think that if you lived like a nihilist, you'd sort of rot away in bed. Some nihilists may do that, and I think there is actually a correlation, a strong correlation between philosophical nihilism and practical depression.</p>
</details>

然而，虚无主义关注的不是实际的后果或你正在做的事情，而是它们背后的目的，它们背后的意义。所以，假设你感到口渴。我可以向你解释，你感到口渴的唯一原因是你无法控制的某种动物性驱动力。你可能会说，“哇，这让一切都变得有点可笑了，不是吗？”但你仍然口渴。你仍然有那种欲望，仍然有解渴的价值观，所以你还是会去做。这同样适用于生活的所有领域，包括艺术、音乐和诗歌，也包括人际关系、友谊等等。你仍然会想做那些事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, nihilism is not about the actual consequences or the things that you're doing. It's about the purpose behind them. It's about the meaning behind them. And so suppose that you are feeling thirsty. I could explain to you that the only reason you are feeling thirst is because of some animalistic drive that you had no control over. And you might go, "Wow, that makes this all a bit ridiculous, doesn't it?" But you're still thirsty. You still have that desire. You still have that value of quenching of thirst, and so you'll still do that. And the same applies in all areas of life, including art and music and poetry, but also including relationships, friendships, that kind of stuff. You're still going to want to do those things.</p>
</details>

但虚无主义者是那种从宏观角度看待这一切，并意识到这一切都有点毫无意义的人。就像加缪在《西西弗斯的神话》中著名地描述的那样，一个人突然认识到自己一天的结构：起床、吃早餐、上车、去上班、休息、吃饭、回家、吃饭、睡觉，然后重新开始。你开始注意到你正在做这些事。这与你正在做什么无关，而是退后一步，意识到这一切都没有意义，除了我正在做这件事之外，别无他物。它没有更深的含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the nihilist is someone who sort of takes a bird's eye view of it and realizes that it's all a little bit meaningless. It's like Camus famously describes in "The Myth of Sisyphus" this person who suddenly recognizes the structure of their day, you know, waking up, having breakfast, getting in the car, going to work, taking a break, eating some food, going back home, eating some food, going to sleep, starting again. And you sort of start to notice that you are doing this. And it's not anything about what you're doing, it's realizing, taking a step back and realizing that there's no meaning to any of this, that there's nothing more than just my doing it. It doesn't go any deeper than that.</p>
</details>

我认为，“意义”与“目的”是同义词。有意义就是有某种目的。而目的就是行动的理由或存在的理由。所以，有意义或有目的，我认为就是有某种行动的理由。如果你谈论一个行动中的意义，那就是以那种方式行动的理由。如果你谈论生命的意义，那就是活着的理由，或者我们活着的原因，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meaning, I think, is used synonymously with purpose. To have meaning is to have some kind of purpose. And purpose is something like reason to act or reason to be. So to have meaning or to have purpose, I think, is to have some kind of reason to either act. If you're talking about the meaning in an action, it's the reason to act in that way. If you're talking about the meaning of or in life, it's the reason to live, or the reason that we are alive, right?</p>
</details>

现在，就像我之前说的，总会有某种原因，但那个原因将取决于其他东西。所以我伸手的原因是因为我想拿水，但我想要水的原因又取决于其他东西，那就是我渴了。而我渴的原因又取决于其他东西。所以，要在生命的根源找到一个客观的意义，就意味着要找到一个非偶然的行动或存在的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, like I said before, there always will be some kind of reason, but that reason will be contingent on something else. So the reason why I'm reaching my hand is because I want to get the water, but the reason why I want the water is contingent on something else, that is that I'm thirsty. And the reason that I'm thirsty is contingent on something else. So to find an objective meaning at the root of life would mean finding a non-contingent reason to act or to be.</p>
</details>

必须有一个自我证明的原则，当你问“但是为什么？”时，真实答案会是“它就是这样”，或者“为什么”这个问题不适合再问下去。要让这一切有个终点，它要么终结于某个完全任意的东西，这对人们来说感觉毫无意义，因为它本可以轻易地是别的东西；要么这个偶然的推理链条无限地回溯下去，这似乎不太可能；要么它终止于某个自我证明的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There would just need to be a self-justifying principle where if you ask "But why?" the answer and the truthful answer would be it just is, or that why is an inappropriate question to ask any further. For there to be something for this to bottom out in it will either have to bottom out in something completely arbitrary, which feels meaningless to people because it could have easily been something else, or this contingent chain of reasoning just essentially goes back forever, which seems implausible, or it terminates in something which is self-justifying.</p>
</details>

当人们说他们在生活中找到了意义时，我认为很多时候他们找到了那个自我证明的原则。对某些人来说，他们生活的意义可能是抚养孩子。如果你问他们，“你为什么起床？”“去上班。”“你为什么这么做？”“为了赚钱。”“为什么？”“为了养家。”“为什么？”“为了让我的孩子健康成长。”“为什么？”“因为我希望我的孩子健康。”“为什么？”“你什么意思为什么？就是这样，这就是意义所在。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when people say that they found their meaning in life, I think a lot of the time they found that self-justifying principle. For some people, their meaning in life might be the raising of their children. And if you ask them, "Why are you getting out of bed?" "To go to work." "Why are you doing that?" "To make money." "Why? "To provide for my family." "Why?" "To bring up my children healthily." "Why?" "Because I want my children to be healthy." "Why?" "What do you mean why? That's it, that's what it's about."</p>
</details>

哲学家可能会看着这个说，“嗯，出于兴趣，你还是应该问问为什么，你为什么在乎这个？”但在实践中，当你达到那个“为什么”的问题似乎不合适的那一刻，你就已经触底了。如果你找到了某个自我证明的原则，它最终激励了你的大部分行动，这是你在做任何事情时脑海中都会有的东西。对大多数人来说，这可能与关系有关，可能与孩子或配偶有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the philosopher might look at that and say, "Well, you should still probably ask why as a point of interest, why do you care about that?" But in practice, that moment that you reach where that question why just seems inappropriate, that's where you've bottomed out. And if you find some kind of self-justifying principle that ultimately motivates most of your actions, it's what you sort of have in the back of your mind when you're doing anything. And for most people it probably is relational, it's probably got to do with children or spouses or something like that.</p>
</details>

对于宗教人士来说，那将是上帝。他们所做的一切，即使他们不总是有意识地认识到，也都是为了上帝的荣耀。如果你让他们主动分析他们在做什么，“你为什么这么做？你为什么坐在这里接受人们的采访？”最终他们会说，“你知道，这一切都是为了上帝的荣耀。”每个人在他们思想的某个基础层面都会有那个自我证明的原则。如果你是一个世俗的人，一个无神论者，那很可能是别的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For the religious, it will be God. Everything they do, even if they don't cognize it all the time will be for the glory of God. If you ask them to proactively analyze what they're doing, "Well, why are you doing this? Why are you sat here doing an interview with people?" Ultimately they would say something like, "Well you know, it's all for the glory of God." Everybody will have that self-justifying principle somewhere at the basis of their thinking. And if you're a secular person, if you're an atheist, it will likely be something else.</p>
</details>

我可能会说，“嗯，我真的很喜欢做这种事。我认为这是一个有意义的追求，因为我喜欢讨论大问题。”如果有人说，“嗯，为什么生活中的大问题很重要？”有人可能会说，“你什么意思？它们当然重要。这几乎就是重要的定义。”现在你可以对此挑毛病，虚无主义者会这么做。他们会说你总能挖得更深，你会意识到最终这只是偏好，这就是为什么虚无主义者认为没有客观意义。但大多数人都有某种自我证明的原则，只是通常是主观的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I might say that, "Well, I really enjoy doing this kind of thing. I think it's a meaningful pursuit because I like discussing big questions." And if somebody says, "Well, why are big questions in life important?" Somebody might just say, "What do you mean? Of course they are. That's almost the definition of importance." Now you can pick a hole with that, and a nihilist will. They'll say that you can always go deeper and you will realize that ultimately it's just preference, which is why the nihilist thinks that there's no objective meaning. But most people have some kind of self-justifying principle, it's just usually a subjective one.</p>
</details>

客观意义看起来像是一个自我证明的行动理由，并且不依赖于你的任何偏好。所以，如果你的根本自我证明原则是你对孩子的关爱，那么很明显，你对孩子的关爱是主观的，它依赖于你。毕竟，你不会以同样的方式关心别人的孩子，他们也不会以同样的方式关心你的孩子。似乎如果你和你孩子都死了，这种原则就不会存在于以太之中。它似乎完全依赖于你的环境和你的偏好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Objective meaning would look something like a reason to act that is self-justifying and not because, not dependent on some kind of preference that you have. So if your foundational self-justifying principle is your care for your children, it seems quite clear that your care for your children is subjective, it's dependent on you. After all, you don't care about other people's children in the same way and they don't care about your children in the same way. It seems like if you died and your children with you, there'd be no, like this kind of principle wouldn't exist out there in the ether. It seems completely dependent on your circumstances and your preferences.</p>
</details>

将你对孩子的关爱描述为一种“偏好”似乎有点粗鲁，但广义上讲，它是一种偏好。你更偏爱自己孩子的福祉，而不是其他孩子的福祉。事实上，很多时候，关心自己孩子的福祉就是为他们提供一个屋顶和一个稳定的收入，这往往是以牺牲其他竞争同一工作的人为代价的，但你有这种偏好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems a bit crude to describe your care for your children as a preference, but broadly speaking, it is a kind of preference. You prefer the wellbeing of your children over the wellbeing of other children. And in fact, that's a lot of the time what caring for the wellbeing of your children is about, it's providing them with a roof over their head and a stable income, which oftentimes is to the detriment of other people who are competing for the same job, but you have this preference.</p>
</details>

但很明显，这是因人而异的。对吧，要有一个客观的意义，就意味着它对偏好不敏感。这意味着即使对于一个有不同偏好的人，一个就是不想要孩子的人，如果照顾孩子是生命的客观意义，那么如果有人说，“你知道吗，我就是不想要孩子。这对我没什么吸引力。我觉得我不会是个好父母。”那么你会对他们说，“你错了。你对自己生命的意义完全理解错了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it seems quite clear that that is person dependent. Right, like for there to be an objective meaning would mean that it is insensitive to preference. It would mean that even for somebody who just had different preferences, who just didn't want children, if caring for your children were the objective meaning in life, then if somebody said, "Well, you know what, I just don't want children. It's just not something that appeals to me. I think I wouldn't be a good parent." Then you would say to them, "You are wrong. You are literally incorrect about the meaning in your own life."</p>
</details>

有些人是这么想的，但他们的意思是，“哦，我觉得如果你有了孩子，你实际上会喜欢的，”对吧？但这只是说你预测他们也会主观地喜欢它。说它是客观的，就意味着即使你不喜欢它，即使你有了孩子并且实际上讨厌整个过程，觉得“天哪，这太糟糕了”，你的生活仍然会更有意义，即使你不这么认为。它必须是某种完全独立于你的偏好、独立于你对自己所做事情的实际感受而提供意义的东西，如果这说得通的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some people think this, but what they mean is something like, "Oh, I think that if you had kids, you'd actually like it," right? But that's just saying that you predict that they will subjectively prefer it too. Like to say it's objective would be, even if you don't prefer it, even if you have children and actually hate the whole process and think, "Gosh, this is awful and terrible," your life will still be more meaningful even if you don't think it is. It would have to be something which provides meaning completely independent of your preferences, of how you actually feel about what it is that you're doing, if that makes sense.</p>
</details>

如果“意义”仅仅指行动的理由或存在的理由，那么最终我确实认为，对于我们行为的方式，存在某种字面上的解释。这将是客观的，因为它将是我们行为背后的驱动力，无论我们喜欢与否。所以，如果你是一个无神论的唯物主义者，你可能会认为自然选择进化只是偏爱了某些产生特定行为的特征。我可以说，从字面上讲，你之所以这样行为，你之所以有这些偏好，是因为这个进化特征，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If meaning just means a reason to act or a reason to be, then of course ultimately I do think there is some kind of literal explanation for why we behave in the way that we do. And that will be objective in the sense that that will be the driving force behind our behaviors, whether we like it or not. So if you are an atheist materialist, you might think that evolution by natural selection has simply favored certain traits which produce certain behaviors. And I could say, literally speaking, the reason why you are behaving in this way, the reason why you have these preferences is because of this evolutionary trait, right?</p>
</details>

对大多数人来说，这并不令人满足。但从字面上讲，这可以被看作是一种客观意义，因为它是一个客观的目的。它确实是我们所有人行动的目的。但我认为人们想要的不仅仅是这些。他们想要一些感觉不仅仅是行动理由的东西。它也是某种感觉有价值的东西，被某种普世原则所证明。这里几乎有一种道德元素，即活着是一件好事，过有意义的生活是一件好事。我认为这种东西很难客观地建立基础，除非你假设某种超自然的设计，或者假设你有一种生命哲学或形而上学，认为自然本身内置了某种目的论，有些人相信这一点，但我很难理解。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For most people, that's not very fulfilling. But literally speaking, that could be something like an objective meaning in the sense of it being an objective purpose. It is literally the purpose why we all act. But I think people want something a little bit more than that. They want something which feels like it's not quite just a reason to act. It's also something which feels worthwhile, that's somehow sort of justified by some universal principle. There's almost like a moral element, that it's a good thing to be alive, that it's a good thing to live a meaningful life. And that kind of thing I think is very difficult to ground objectively, unless you posit some kind of either supernatural design, or I suppose if you have a kind of philosophy of life, or a metaphysic which says that there is some kind of teleology built into nature itself, which some people believe but I struggle to grapple with.</p>
</details>

我认为人类天生渴望某些东西，他们有价值观。我认为这可能是一种进化特征。我的意思是，如果你有两个社区，一个社区对任何事情都漠不关心，完全冷漠，不关心自己的孩子，不想生孩子，不想起床，他们是活不长的。所以我认为，在生活中做事情有某种动机感，这在进化上是被选择的。

So I think it is just literally the case that having some kind of sense of motivation for doing things in life is evolutionarily selected for.</p>

所以我认为大多数人实际上并非根本上冷漠。即使是那些看起来冷漠的人，实际上也有某些价值观，例如，他们珍视自己的舒适。比如，如果你醒来后只想回去睡觉，那不是冷漠。那是拥有与让你起床的价值观不同的价值观。你珍视你的舒适，你珍视睡觉。所以大多数人都有这些价值观。

<p class="english-text">And so I think the most people are not actually fundamentally apathetic. Even people who seem apathetic actually have certain values, they value their own comfort, for example. Like if you sort of wake up and you just wanna go back to sleep, it's not apathy. That's having a different value to the kind of value that would get you out of bed. You value your comfort, you value sleeping. And so most people have these kinds of values.</p>
</details>

虚无主义并不消除价值观。它分析价值观，并发现它们基本上是毫无根据的。或者如果它们有根据，那根据也存在于人们的主观偏好中。所以，我理解为什么虚无主义可能会让你以一种被视为冷漠的方式行事。它可能会让你有点沮丧，可能会让你更多地躺着，对以前喜欢做的事情失去动力，所有这些伴随抑郁症而来的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nihilism doesn't remove values. It analyzes values and finds them to be essentially groundless. Or if they do have a ground, the ground is within the subjective preferences of people. And so, like, I understand why, I mean, nihilism might make you act in a way that would be viewed as apathetic. It might make you a bit depressed, for example. And it might mean that you lay around a bit more and you have less motivation for doing the things you formally enjoyed, all of those things that come along with depression.</p>
</details>

但你仍然会有字面意义上的价值观。你不会喜欢自己的痛苦。如果饿了，你会感到饥饿，无论你是否选择满足它。你会有一些在体验时想要的体验，和一些在体验时不想要的体验，我认为这是对快乐和痛苦的一个很好的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you'll still have literal values. You will not enjoy your own pain. If hungry, you will feel that hunger, whether or not you choose to satisfy it. You'll have experiences that you want when experienced and experiences that you don't want when experienced, which I think is a good definition of pleasure and pain.</p>
</details>

那么虚无主义做了什么呢？它只是移除了那些价值观中的意义。所以我想象一个正在受苦的人，想象一个正在受苦但不是虚无主义者的人会很有帮助。你可能拥有世界上最糟糕的生活。你可能每天都抑郁、不开心。你可能认为你的生活一团糟，但你可能相信这背后有某种原因。你可能相信这背后有意义。也许你是宗教信徒，也许你相信轮回，无论如何，你正在受苦，但你不是一个虚无主义者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what does nihilism do then? It just removes the meaning in those values. And so I would sort of like to imagine that the person who is suffering, it's helpful to think of a person who's suffering but is not a nihilist. You could have the worst life in the world. You could be depressed, you could be upset every single day. You could think your life is going terribly, but you could believe that there's some kind of reason. You could believe that there's a meaning behind it. Maybe you're religious, maybe you believe in reincarnation, whatever, such that you're suffering but you're not an nihilist.</p>
</details>

成为一个虚无主义者，就是受苦，并且因为认识到这种痛苦是毫无意义的而更加痛苦。所以原则上，你也可以非常快乐，过得非常开心，同时也是一个虚无主义者，只要你认识到你感受到的快乐是完全没有意义的。它没有理由。你只是在感受它。你只是存在着，并且正在感受某种东西，仅此而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To be an nihilist is to suffer and suffer all the more from the recognition that the suffering is meaningless. So in principle, you could also be really happy, you could be having the best time in the world and be a nihilist so long as you recognize that that happiness you're feeling is completely meaningless. There's no reason for it. You are just feeling it. You just exist, and you're feeling a certain thing, and that's it.</p>
</details>

在实践中，虚无主义往往使人悲伤多于快乐。但作为一种哲学，一种生活哲学，一个非常有动力、非常快乐、非常满足的人，同时又意识到这一切背后没有任何意义，这并不矛盾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In practice, nihilism tends to make people more sad than happy. But as a philosophy, let's say, a philosophy of life, there's no inconsistency with being a very motivated, very happy, very content person who yet realizes that there's no meaning behind any of it.</p>
</details>

事实上，大多数人，从字面上讲，确实在生活中感受到意义。说每个报告这一点的人要么在撒谎，要么在自欺欺人，这似乎有点大胆。这似乎很大胆。这似乎有点傲慢和过于自信。不是说这使它变得错误，但我认为你应该意识到这是一个多么激进的主张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is the fact that most people, literally speaking, do feel meaning in life. And it does seem a little bit bold to say that everybody who reports that is essentially either lying or deluding themselves. That seems bold. It seems a little arrogant and too confident. Not to say that that makes it false, but I think you should be aware of how radical a claim that is, of course.</p>
</details>

但似乎也存在一种对意义的普遍追求。很明显，存在一种普遍的冲动，认为我们都在这里是有某种原因的。现在，就像我之前说的，这可以通过进化上的自我选择压力来解释。但在某种程度上，你可能会说这已经足够了，因为唯一重要的是我感觉好像有客观意义。对人们来说，这可能就足够了，因为虚无主义作为一种生活哲学，一种影响你行为方式的哲学，你可能就接受了这样一个事实，即每个人普遍都有这种驱动力，并把它当作客观的一样对待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But also there does seem to be this universal compulsion towards meaning. It's like, obviously, there is this universal compulsion to think that there is some reason why we're all here. Now, like I said before, that could be explained through evolutionary self-selecting pressures. But in a way you might just say that that's kind of enough, because the only thing that matters is that I feel as though there is objective meaning. Like that might just be enough for people in the sense that nihilism as a lived philosophy, that like informs the way that you behave, you might just sort of, you might just sort of accept the fact that everybody universally has this drive and treat it as if it were objective.</p>
</details>

就像，如果你想决定房子要漆成什么颜色，而颜色是完全主观的，但如果碰巧每个人，出于某种进化原因，都更喜欢蓝色，绝对每个人实际上都更喜欢蓝色，你可能会把蓝色是漆房子的最佳颜色当作一个客观事实来对待。在这种情况下，这可能成为一个有意义的陈述。即使你认识到它在技术上不是客观的，只是普遍主观上为真。但在实践中，这和客观真理的作用是一样的，如果你明白我的意思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the same way that like, if you're trying to work out what color to paint a house, and, like, color is completely subjective, but if it just so happened that everybody, for some evolutionary reason, preferred the color blue, like, absolutely everybody just in fact preferred the color blue, you might treat it as an objective fact that a blue is the best color to paint the house. And in that context, that might become a meaningful statement. Even though you recognize it's not technically objective, it's just universally subjectively true. But in practice, that sort of works the same as an objective truth, if you know what I mean.</p>
</details>

所以你会把房子漆成蓝色，如果有人说你应该漆成别的颜色，你或许可以对他们说，“你有点错了，”即使你只是在处理偏好。所以，感受到的意义的普遍性，或者对意义的渴望，或者假设存在意义，这可能足以让人们对虚无主义产生一些怀疑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So you would paint the house blue, and if anybody said you should paint it another color, you might be able to say to them, "You're kind of wrong," even though you're just dealing with preferences. So the universality of felt meaning or desire for meaning or assumption that there is meaning might be enough to raise a few eyebrows when it comes to nihilism.</p>

虚无主义通常被看作是对宗教衰落的一种回应。你会看到像尼采、像埃米尔·齐奥朗这样的思想家。然后稍晚一些，你会看到存在主义者和荒诞主义者，你会看到萨特和加缪，对吧？但这可以追溯到更早的时候。虚无主义不是一种应对宗教衰落的新哲学。我认为宗教的出现是对虚无主义的回应。我认为是反过来的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nihilism is often seen as a kind of response to the decline of religion. And you get thinkers like Nietzsche, you get thinkers like Emil Cioran. And then a bit later on you get your existentialists and your absurdists, you get your Sartres and your Camus, right? But this goes way further back. Like, nihilism is not a new philosophy in response to the decline of religion. I think that religions emerge as a response to nihilism. I think it's the other way around.</p>

在印刷文字中能找到的对虚无主义最伟大的阐述之一，是《旧约》中的《传道书》。那简直是虚无主义的倾泻，“‘虚空的虚空，凡事都是虚空，’传道者说。”《传道书》带我们领略了这位匿名作者的思考。有人试图确定他的身份，但他是谁并不重要。我们知道他是一位伟大的人，一位国王。他过着辉煌的生活，但他在其中看不到任何意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the still greatest expositions of nihilism that can be found in the printed word is the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. Just this nihilistic outpouring, "'Meaningless, everything is meaningless,' says the Teacher." Ecclesiastes takes us through the reflections of this man, this anonymous author. Some have tried to identify him, but it doesn't really matter who it is. We know that he was a great man, a king. He lived an illustrious life, but he saw no meaning in it.</p>
</details>

他不断回到“hebel”这个词，字面意思是“风”之类的东西。所以英王詹姆斯钦定本把它翻译成“vanity”（虚空），虚空的虚空，一切都是虚空。我听过一些解经家认为，希伯来语中“hebel”这个词最好的现代翻译其实是“absurd”（荒诞），这与加缪将我们的期望与现实这个伟大的偶像破坏者相碰撞，现实粉碎了我们所有期望的观点相符。但“毫无意义，毫无意义，一切都毫无意义”是一种翻译。“荒诞，荒诞，一切都荒诞”是我最喜欢的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he keeps coming back to this word hebel which means literally something like wind, right? And so it's translated as vanity by the King James, vanity of vanities. Everything is vanity. I've heard some exegetes think that the best modern translation of that word hebel in Hebrew is actually absurd in alignment with Camus' rubbing up of our expectations against the great iconoclast of reality which just shatters all of our expectations. But "Meaningless, meaningless, everything is meaningless," is one translation. "Absurd, absurd, everything is absurd," is my favorite.</p>
</details>

因为他描述了这些事情。他说，“凡我眼所求的，我没有留下不给它的。我喝酒，我参加派对，我享受生活。但最后我看到这一切都是‘hebel’，都只是风。什么都不是。它发生了，然后就消失了。它没有任何意义。”显然，写下这段文字的人正在与我们今天谈论的完全相同的虚无主义主题进行深刻的斗争。

<p class="english-text">because he's describing these things. He's like, "I denied my eyes no pleasure that they saw. If I wanted something, I took it. I drank wine. I partied, I lived life. But in the end I saw that it was all hebel, it was all just wind. It's just nothing. It just happens, and then it's gone. And it doesn't mean anything." And clearly whoever penned this text is struggling deeply with the exact same nihilistic themes that we talk about today.</p>
</details>

对他来说，这是一段宗教经文。所以有一种潜台词，他一直在说，在日光之下，没有任何东西，没有任何意义，这一切都没有任何目的。我们常说的“日光之下，并无新事”就出自这里。“日光之下”是《传道书》中反复出现的短语。有人认为，这意在表明，在地球上，与天国分离，这一切没有最终的目的。

<p class="english-text">And for him, this is a piece of religious scripture. So there's this undertone, he keeps saying that under the sun there is nothing, there's no meaning, there's no purpose to any of this. It's where we get the phrase "nothing new under the sun." Under the sun, is this phrase that keeps showing up in Ecclesiastes. And some have suggested that this is supposed to indicate that on Earth separate from the heavenly realm, there's no ultimate purpose to this.</p>
</details>

但有趣的是，在《传道书》的结尾，有一段话，有人在评论这位传道者，也就是 Qoheleth 的话。我们听了这位传道者的话，谈论一切是多么没有意义。然后在结尾，有一段对这位传道者论述的评论。它说他所说的一切都是正直和真实的。他所说的一切基本上都是正确的。但解决方案是：敬畏上帝，遵守祂的诫命。

<p class="english-text">But interestingly, at the very end of Ecclesiastes, there's this passage where someone is, I mean, we've heard the teacher speak, Qoheleth.

And it says that everything he said was upright and true. Everything he said was correct essentially. But the solution is this, fear God and keep his commandments.</p>
</details>

并没有解释为什么这能解决问题。也没有说明这会改变什么的机制。最有趣的是，它似乎在暗示这个人所说的一切都是真的，一切都只是风。但不知何故，只要敬畏上帝，遵守祂的诫命，你就解决了问题。我不认为这是一个非常令人满意的解决方案。但我想，这正是虚无主义文学的伟大主题。人们尝试寻找某种解决方案，但最终，至少对我来说，它们似乎都相对不令人满意。

But that somehow by just fearing God and keeping his commandments, you have somehow solved the problem. I don't think that that's a very satisfying solution. But then I think that that is the great theme of nihilistic literature. People try for a kind of solution, but ultimately, for me at least, they seem relatively unsatisfying.</p>

快进几千年，你看到了阿尔贝·加缪的《西西弗斯的神话》，它以“想象西西弗斯是快乐的”这个著名的观点结尾。也许这对你有用。我不知道它对我有什么用。但是，是的，尼采通常与虚无主义联系在一起。他本人当然不是虚无主义者，但讨论了很多虚无主义的主题。然后存在主义者是讨论现代虚无主义的首选人物。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Fast forward thousands of years and you get Albert Camus' "Myth of Sisyphus," which famously ends with this idea of imagining Sisyphus happy. Maybe that does it for you. I don't know what it does for me. But yeah, Nietzsche is often associated with nihilism. Not a nihilist himself, of course, but discusses a lot of nihilistic themes. And then the existentialists are the sort of go-to figures for discussions of modern nihilism.</p>
</details>

事实上，加缪因《西西弗斯的神话》开篇的鲜明观点而备受赞誉，即“只有一个严肃的哲学问题，那就是自杀。”因为其他一切，你知道，空间有多少维度，抽象数字是否存在，所有这些都是次要的。最根本的问题是，你今天是要喝杯咖啡还是自杀，正如他曾经说过的。这些是你的选择。

<p class="english-text">In fact, Camus is celebrated for the starkness of the opening line of the "Myth of Sisyphus," that "there is one serious philosophical question, and that is suicide."

The most foundational question is whether or not you're going to, as he once put it, have a cup of coffee or kill yourself today. Those are kind of your options.</p>

所以，所谓的虚无主义文学，范围很广。但我认为它实际上始于屠格涅夫的小说《父与子》，我认为这个词是由此普及的。尽管那是一种更受限制的虚无主义用法，更与他所生活的俄罗斯文化相关。但我们是从那里得到这个词的。而且它以小说的形式出现。有趣的是，这经常出现在叙事中，即使在《传道书》中，它也在讲述一个故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nihilistic literature, so to speak, is a broad span. But literally I think it begins with, I think that the term is popularized by Turgenev's novel "Fathers and Sons." Although that's a more, I think, that's a more restricted use of the word nihilism. It's more culturally relevant to Russia, the Russia that he was living in. But that's sort of where we get the term from. And it's in novelistic form. Interestingly, this often shows up in narrative, even in the book of Ecclesiastes it's sort of telling a story.</p>
</details>

广义上讲，大多数人都知道，有所谓的分析哲学，即“如果p则q”，逻辑谬误和肯定前件式。另一边是所谓的大陆哲学，它更具叙事性，更像诗歌，更像是抓住思想但不是直接地。所以这里有你的存在主义者，也有你的小说家。你有你的陀思妥耶夫斯基和你的托尔斯泰，你有你的诗人。这些都属于那一派。

<p class="english-text">I mean, broadly speaking, most people will know, there's this distinction between the so-called analytic philosophy, the if p then q, and logical fallacy and modus ponens. And on the other side you've got the so-called continental philosophy, which is more narrative, it's more poetry, it's more grasping at ideas but not directly. So this is where you have your existentialists but also your novelists. You have your Dostoevsky and your and your Tolstoys, and you have your poets. And that's all sort of on that side.</p>
</details>

而虚无主义文学，至少是人们关心的那些，几乎完全属于大陆哲学派，因为它似乎确实是一种抵制用抽象术语讨论的东西。它非常个人化，非常叙事化。你需要将自己融入生命的故事中，才能理解问题所在。

我的意思是，你可以想象和一个外星人说话。如果你试图向一个外星人或人工智能描述什么是虚无主义，你说，“嗯，问题是我起床去上班，我就是不知道我为什么这么做。”外星人可能会说，“嗯，是的，你知道。你这么做是为了赚钱和工作。”“是啊，但我是为什么这么做呢？”“嗯，因为不然你就会流落街头，你会受苦。”“但是为什么？”“嗯，你只是，这只是内置于你的，你不喜欢受苦。这就像是受苦的定义。你就是不喜欢受苦，你在试图避免它。”“是啊，你说得对。但就是，有些东西，天哪，我真希望有更多，你知道吗？”外星人说，“你什么意思？更多什么？更多快乐吗？”“不，不是更多快乐，就是，我希望有个理由。”用简单的语言解释清楚其实会很困难。这几乎像是一个只有亲身经历过的人才能理解的问题。

And the alien might be like, "Well, yeah, you do. You do it to get money and to get a job." "Yeah, but like, why do I do that?" "Well, because otherwise you'd be on the street and you'd be suffering." "But why?" "Well, you just it's just built into your, you don't like suffering. That's like a definition of suffering. You just don't like suffering and you're trying to avoid it." "Yeah, you're right. But it's just sort of, there's something, gosh, I just wish there was more, you know?" The alien's like, "What do you mean? More what? Like more pleasure?" "No, not more pleasure, just like, I wish there were like a reason." It'd be actually quite difficult to just explain in plain terms. It's almost like it's a problem that can only be understood by someone who lives it.</p>

没有人会凭空被一个哲学立场说服，对吧？你读一个哲学家，他们会以某种方式表达一些东西，让你觉得，“嗯，是的，你知道吗，我觉得这有道理。”这通常是因为他们正在用语言表达或系统化一些你已经有所了解的东西。事实上，如果你打开维特根斯坦的《逻辑哲学论》，引言的第一行就说，“这本书对任何不已经同意其内容的人来说都将是完全无用的。”他只是承认，他写这本书的真正原因是为了阐明一些希望他的读者已经独立得出的东西。

我认为这种情况经常发生，顺便说一句，这也是为什么如果你曾经尝试接触哲学，你可能会查阅史上最伟大的50位哲学家。我真的很感兴趣。我想看看我能学到什么。然后它会说，“好吧，一位伟大的哲学家是让-保罗·萨特。”你说，“好吧，我试试看，”然后你拿起书来读，你就会觉得，“我不懂。我不仅不理解背景，即使我看了 SparkNotes，了解了他在说什么，我还是觉得这没道理。我没被打动，为什么这本书这么有名？”这是因为你只是凭空把它拿了出来。

<p class="english-text">I think that happens all the time, which is also why, by the way, if you've ever tried to get into philosophy, you might look up like the 50 greatest philosophers of all time. I'm really interested. I wanna see what I can learn. And it will say, "Okay, well one great philosopher is Jean Paul Sartre." And say, "Okay, I'll give that a go," and you pick it up and you read it, and you're just like, "I don't get it. I don't understand, not only do I not understand the context, like even when I looked at the SparkNotes and I got what he was talking about and all, it just doesn't make sense to me. I'm not impressed, like why is this so famous?" And it's because you've just plucked it out of nowhere.</p>
</details>

然而，如果你和人们进行过无数次对话，让-保罗·萨特这个名字时不时地出现，以至于你听说过他，而且仅仅因为碰巧你所在的对话和情境适合那些知道他是谁的人提起他的名字，那么很有可能，如果你再去读他的书，你实际上会喜欢他所说的，因为他不断出现是有原因的。

<p class="english-text">Whereas if you've had like a million conversations with people and Jean Paul Sartre is a name that has come up every now and again, such that you've heard of him and such that just because it's so happens that you are in like conversations and you are in situations that suited his name coming up from people who know who he is, chances are that if you then go and read him, you are actually going to enjoy what he's saying because there's some reason he keeps coming up.</p>
</details>

所以当人们向我推荐哲学读物时，我真的告诉他们就读他们听说过的，因为你听说过那些哲学家是有原因的，因为他们是在你显然已经感兴趣的语境中出现的人。我认为认识到这一点很重要，你不会凭空被一个你还没有一只脚踏入的哲学所说服。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when people ask me for a recommendation of what to read philosophically, I literally tell them to just read what they've heard of, because there's a reason why you've heard of those philosophers, because they're the people who've come up in the kind of context that you are obviously already interested in. And I think it's important to recognize that you're not gonna be convinced out of nowhere of a philosophy that you don't already have sort of one foot in.</p>
</details>

因此，我认为我们对世界的倾向会影响我们被哪种哲学所吸引。我喜欢所有虚无主义文学，所有著名的存在主义虚无主义文学，如果你把这些交给一个自信的基督徒，他们是不会被说服的。如果你把它交给一个没怎么想过这个问题，但生活中可能有些虚无主义色彩的人，他们可能会读了之后说，“是啊，他有道理，”对吧？如果你在接触文本之前就已经对它有所吸引，它就会更有吸引力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so for that reason, I think that our predisposition towards the world will influence the kind of philosophies which are attracted to us. I mean, I like all of the nihilistic literature, all of the famous existential nihilistic literature, if you handed that to a confident Christian, they're not gonna be convinced by it. If you hand it to somebody who hasn't really thought about the issue, but maybe has some sort of nihilistic undertones to their life, they might read that and go, "Yeah, he's got a point," right? It's sort of, it's going to be more attractive if you are already kind of attracted to it before you've interacted with the text.</p>
</details>

我认为不仅如此。我只是觉得值得指出的是，任何对哲学慰藉和原则的彻底放弃都会带来痛苦。但不仅如此，因为虚无主义对很多人来说也是一件相当令人沮丧的事情。我的意思是，认为你在这里是出于某种写在宇宙法则中的原因，而不是一场或喜或悲的意外，这种想法确实更美好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I do think it's not just that. I mean, I just think it's worth pointing out that any kind of radical abandonment of philosophical consolation and principle is going to bring with it distress. But it's not just that, because nihilism is also just quite a upsetting thing for a lot of people. Like, I mean, it is nicer to think that you are here for some kind of reason that's written into the rules of the universe and that it all is just a happy or unhappy accident.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一种更美好的哲学。但我们应该对那些对我们更有吸引力的哲学持更怀疑的态度，不是因为它们更不可能是真的，而是因为我们更有可能在证据不足的情况下接受它们，因为我们希望它们是真的。所以我认为我们需要认识到这种偏见并小心对待。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it's just a nicer kind of philosophy. But I think we ought be more suspicious of philosophies which are more attractive to us, not because they're less likely to be true, but because we are more likely to accept them on less evidence because we want them to be true. And so I think we need to recognize that bias and be careful of it.</p>
</details>

但我们完全没有任何理由就存在，这似乎也完全令人困惑。我的意思是，虚无主义者最终必须假设，要么我们的存在没有任何理由，这似乎完全荒谬。事物存在必须有字面上的理由。要么存在某种理由，但它是完全任意的，这也似乎有点令人困惑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But it does also seem completely bewildering that we would just exist for absolutely no reason. I mean, the nihilist ultimately has to posit that there is either no reason for our existence, which seems completely ludicrous. There needs to literally be a reason why things exist. Or that there is some kind of reason, but it's completely arbitrary, which also just seems a bit bewildering.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，无论为什么会有任何东西存在的这个宏大谜题的答案是什么，从哲学上说，说它本可以走向另一边，本可以什么都没有，这似乎有点不令人满意。表面上看，这似乎有点不可信。所以虚无主义也有一种固有的不可信性，人们会与之斗争。而你更相信生命意义的不可信性，还是这一切都无缘无故发生的不可信性，我认为最终将取决于你的情绪状态。

<p class="english-text">I mean, whatever is the answer to the grand mystery of why anything exists at all, it seems a little unsatisfying philosophically to say that it just could have gone the other way and they could have just been nothing. It seems a little, well, on the surface, it seems a little implausible. And so there is an inherent implausibility to nihilism too that people will wrestle with. And whether you are more convinced by the implausibility of meaning in life or the implausibility of it all just happening for no reason I think will ultimately depend on your emotional state.</p>

### 情感主义如何塑造伦理学

**情感主义**（Emotivism: 一种元伦理学理论，认为道德判断并非陈述事实，而是在表达情感或态度）是一种伦理理论。它实际上也是一种语言理论，但它属于关于什么是善、什么是恶的讨论范畴。广义上讲，人们可能熟悉，在道德问题上，关于善恶，大致有两个学派。一派是客观主义者，他们认为有些事情是善是恶，无论你喜欢与否。另一派是主观主义者，他们说这基本上都只是你的观点，你的偏好。有些人喜欢谋杀，有些人不喜欢，就像有些人喜欢蛋糕，有些人不喜欢一样，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Emotivism is an ethical theory. It's also a theory of language really, but it belongs in this discussion around what is good and what is bad. Broadly speaking, people might be familiar that when it comes to morals, what's good and what's bad, there are kind of two schools. You have the objective who think that there are things which are good and bad, whether you like it or not. And there are the subjectivists who say it's kind of just all your opinion. It's your preference. Some people like murder, some people don't, in the way that some people like cake and some people don't, right?</p>
</details>

情感主义更偏向主观主义这边，但它又有些不同。它认为，当人们做出伦理陈述时，他们是在表达一种情感。当你说谋杀是错误的，你实际上是在表达一种对谋杀的情感状态。这听起来很像主观主义。在主观主义框架下，“谋杀是错误的”这句话翻译过来就是“我不喜欢谋杀”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Emotivism is more on this subjective side, but emotivism is something a little different. It suggests that when people make ethical statements, what they're doing is expressing an emotion. When you say that murder is wrong, you are literally expressing an emotional state towards murder. That sounds very similar to subjectivism. In the subjectivist framework, the phrase "Murder is wrong" translates to something like, "I don't like murder."</p>
</details>

像“我不喜欢谋杀”这样的短语，是关于我心理状态的一个声明。我可能在撒谎。我可能说我不喜欢谋杀，但实际上我暗地里喜欢谋杀。这可能是我在撒谎。我不喜欢谋杀这件事，可能是真的，也可能是假的。这似乎是一个关于我的大脑、我的心理、我对谋杀的态度的声明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A phrase like, "I don't like murder" is a claim about my psychology. I could be lying. I could say I don't like murder. But actually I do secretly like murder. It could be something that I'm lying about. It could be true, it could be false that I don't like murder. It seems to be a claim about my brain, about my psychology, about my attitude towards murder.</p>
</details>

情感主义不是那样的。它不是报告一种情感状态或态度，而是字面上表达那种态度。这就像告诉你“我不喜欢谋杀”和直接说“呃，谋杀”或者做个厌恶的表情之间的区别。或者像 A.J. 艾耶尔著名地说的那样，“嘘，嘘谋杀，”对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Emotivism is not that. It's not the reporting of an emotional state or an attitude. It is literally the expression of that attitude. It's the difference between telling you, "I don't like murder," and literally going like, "Ugh, murder," or just like pulling a nasty face. Or as A.J. Ayer's famously had it going, "Boo, boo murder," right?</p>
</details>

情感主义者认为，当我们说谋杀是错误的时候，发生的就是这种情况，这意味着这些伦理主张根本就不是那种可以为真或为假的东西。有些表达和陈述有所谓的“真值”。真值意味着它可以为真或为假。所以像“天空是红色的”这样的陈述有真值，只是它的真值是假。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The emotivist thinks that that is what's going on when we say murder is wrong, meaning that these ethical claims are literally not the kind of thing that can be true or false. There are some kinds of expressions and statements that have what's called truth value. Truth value means that it can be true or false. So a statement like the sky is red has truth value, it's just that the truth value is false.</p>
</details>

然而，有些陈述，比如命令，“到那边去”，它没有真值。它不是那种可以为真或为假的东西。像“我不喜欢谋杀”这样的短语可能是真的。客观主义理论认为谋杀是错误的，这可能是真的，但对情感主义者来说，这就像说“嘘，谋杀”，这不是真的，也不是假的，它只是一种表达。就像我踢到脚然后说“哎哟”一样。那是真的吗？是假的吗？我在撒谎吗？这些在这里不适用。你只是在表达某种东西。无论如何，这就是情感主义者相信的，这是情感主义的大致立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whereas some statements like commands, for example, "Go over there," it doesn't have truth value. It's not the kind of thing that can be true or false. A phrase like, "I don't like murder" could be true. A phrase like the objectivist theory that murder is wrong might be true, but for the emotivist, it's literally like going, "Boo, murder," which isn't true. It isn't false, it's just an expression. It's the same as me kicking my foot and going, "Ow." Is that true? Is it false? Am I lying? Like that kind of doesn't apply here. You're just expressing something. That's what the emotivist believes anyway, that's the broad position of emotivism.</p>
</details>

它属于伦理学中**非认知主义**（Non-cognitivism: 伦理学中的一种观点，认为道德陈述不具有真值，即无法被判断为真或假）的范畴，这意味着这些陈述没有真值。有认知主义者认为伦理陈述有真值，而非认知主义者认为没有。情感主义是非认知主义的一种形式。例如，另一个非认知主义学派是规定主义，它认为伦理陈述本质上是命令。当我说谋杀是错误的，我的意思类似于“不要谋杀”。这就是我所说的陈述类型。所以它不完全是表达情感，而是发出命令，但它也是非认知主义的，因为它没有真值。你只是在说一些既不真也不假的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It belongs in this category of non-cognitivism about ethics, which means that these statements don't have truth value. There are cognitivists who think that ethical statements have truth value and non-cognitivists who think that they don't. And emotivism is a form of non-cognitivism. So for example, another non-cognitivist school is prescriptivism, which thinks that ethical statements are essentially commands. When I say murder is wrong, what I mean is something like, "Don't murder." That's like the kind of statement that I'm saying. So it's not exactly expressing an emotion, it's giving a command, but it's also non-cognitivist because it doesn't have truth value. You're just sort of saying something that isn't true or false.</p>
</details>

在情感主义框架下，推理可以与伦理陈述相联系。有一种观点认为，如果我们是情感主义者，那么所有关于道德问题的分歧的可能性都会消失。因为如果没有真值，你怎么能进行辩论呢？在某种程度上这是对的，我理解这种批评。与其说是批评，不如说是一种观察。我们可能真的做不到，但这可能就是事实，但很多人对此不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reasoning can be connected to ethical statements on an emotivist framework. There is this idea that if we're emotivists, then suddenly the possibility for all disagreement on moral issues vanishes. Because how can you have a debate if there's no truth value? And that's true to a degree, and I understand the criticism. It's not so much a criticism as an observation. It might just be true that we can't do that, but a lot of people aren't satisfied with that.</p>
</details>

但它的限制比人们意识到的要大得多。A.J. 艾耶尔在《语言、真理与逻辑》中指出，他是这个情感主义学派的创始人。他指出，绝大多数的道德辩论根本就不是道德辩论。它们是关于描述性事实的辩论，然后我们把我们的道德直觉应用到这些事实上去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's way more restricted than people realize. A.J. Ayer pointed out in "Language, Truth & Logic," he sort of is the founder of this emotivist school. He points out that the vast majority of moral debate is not moral debate at all. It's debate about descriptive facts that we then apply our sort of moral intuitions to.</p>
</details>

例如，想象一场关于美国枪支问题的辩论，人们来回争论。一个人说，“你知道吗，如果我们把枪支定为非法，每年与枪支相关的死亡人数将减少一万？”另一个人说，“啊，是的，但你知道你没有考虑到这个统计数据吗，如果你除掉有好人持枪的情况，那么得救的人会更少？”然后有人说，“哦，但你知道游泳池杀死的孩子比枪支还多吗？”这就是我们来回进行的辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example, if you imagine a debate about guns in America and people are having a back and forth. And one person says, "Well, did you know that if we criminalize guns, it would reduce the number of gun-related deaths by 10,000 a year? And another person says, "Ah, yeah, but did you know that you haven't taken into account this statistic that if you get rid of good people with guns, then less people will be saved?" And then someone says, "Oh, but did you know that swimming pools kill more children than guns do?" This is the kind of debate that we're having back and forth.</p>
</details>

但这些主张都不是道德主张。它们只是描述性的、事实性的主张，是统计数据，你可以去检验它们。它们要么是真的，要么是假的，对吧？我们认为的很多道德辩论，实际上只是关于描述性事实的辩论，一旦这些事实确定下来，我们再把我们的道德直觉应用上去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But none of those claims are moral claims. They're just descriptive, factual claims, they're statistics, you can go and test them. It's either true or false, right? Like a lot of what we think is moral debate is actually just debate about descriptive facts, which once those are settled, we then apply our moral intuitions to.</p>
</details>

例如，在枪支辩论中，一个人有一种道德观点，另一个人有另一种道德观点，他们在激烈争论。但实际上他们可能有相同的道德观点。对情感主义者来说，这是一种情感表达。那么情感表达可能是什么呢？假设一个人说，“如果我们允许社会上有枪支，无辜的人就会死。”另一个人说，“但是，如果我们不允许社会上有枪支，那么只有坏人会有枪，他们会杀死无辜的人，没有人来保护他们，所以无辜的人会死。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example, in the gun debate, one person has one moral view and another person has another moral view, and they're battling it out. But actually they might have the same moral view, so to speak. For the emotivist, it's some kind of emotional expression. And so what might be the emotional expression? Well, suppose one person says, "If we allow guns in society, innocent people are going to die." And another person says, "But, like, if we don't allow guns in society, then only the bad guys are gonna have guns, and they're gonna kill innocent people, and there's gonna be no one to protect them, so innocent people will die."</p>
</details>

他们都同意，无辜的人死去，嘘。他们辩论的是一个描述性的事实，关于更多枪支、更少枪支、更多死亡、更少死亡的字面真相，对吧？所以，我们无法就道德问题进行任何理性讨论的想法立刻浮现出来，这是真的，但我只想指出，它的限制要大得多。这并不是说你不能进行这种枪支讨论。你不能讨论堕胎和医疗保健。你不能谈论，我不知道，选另一个热门的道德问题，限速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Both of them agree, innocent people dying, boo. And what they're debating is a descriptive like truth of of the matter as to whether, literally speaking, more guns, less guns, more deaths, less deaths, right? And so the idea that instantly comes to mind is that we can't have any kind of reasonable discussion about moral issues, like it's true, but I just wanna point out that it's way more restricted. It's not like you can't have this kind of gun discussion. You can't have a discussion about, I don't know about abortion and healthcare. And you can't talk about, I don't know, pick another pet moral issue, speed limits.</p>
</details>

我们怎么能就限速进行道德讨论呢？嗯，我们可以谈论会有多少人死亡，关于提高时速10英里的统计数据，所有这些都只是事实。然后我们会应用我们的道德直觉。我认为，当我们真正分解并孤立道德元素时，我们会发现实际上共识远多于分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, like how can we have a moral discussion about speed limits? Well, we can talk about how many people will die, the statistics about increasing by 10 miles an hour and all this kind, that's all just facts. And then we'll apply our moral intuitions. And I think that when we actually break down and isolate the moral element alone, we'll find that there is actually a lot more agreement than there is disagreement.</p>
</details>

这并没有解决问题。挑战在于，如果道德问题上真的存在分歧怎么办？如果两个人真的有相互冲突的“嘘”和“耶”怎么办？在这种情况下，有两种策略。你要么说，“嗯，如果你真的把这些进一步分解，你会意识到每个人最终在基本伦理问题上都有相同的情感表达。因为我们都是人，我们都有共同的进化遗产，这会在我们内心植入某些情感倾向，如果我们把它们分解得足够细，最终会是相同的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That doesn't do away with the problem. The challenge is like what if there really is disagreement on the moral stuff? What if two people genuinely just have conflicting boos and yays? And in that case, there are sort of two strategies. You either say, "Well, if you really broke those down further, you'd realize that everybody ultimately has the same emotional, like, expression on fundamental ethical issues. Because we're all human, we all have a shared evolutionary heritage that will have placed within us certain emotional predispositions, that ultimately will be the same if we just break them down far enough."</p>
</details>

另一种策略是说，“不，人们确实有根本的价值观冲突。这就是事实。这就是现实。我们对此无能为力。”你觉得哪种更可信，取决于你。但显然，前者是一种更乐观的想法。我认为人们会更倾向于前者，因为它让我们能够说，“嗯，每个人都同意无辜的人死去是坏事，所以我们可以据此行事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other strategy is to say, "No, people do just have fundamental value conflicts. And that's just true. And that's just the way it is. And there's nothing we can do about it." Whichever of those you find plausible is up to you. But obviously the former is a bit more of an optimistic idea. I think people will be more attracted to that because it allows us to sort of say, "Well, everybody agrees that boo innocent people dying, and so we can just in accordance with that."</p>
</details>

但似乎更有可能的情况是，事实并非如此。我的意思是，在这一点上，很明显有些人对无辜的人死去并没有负面的情绪反应。所以这不可能是我们都同意的最基本的伦理原则。但它可能比这更深。它可能是，那不是根本的。无辜的人死去不可能是根本的伦理表达，因为它包含了太多的概念。无辜的概念，死亡的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it seems more likely the case that that's not true. I mean, on that point, it's quite clear that there are people who do not have an adverse emotional reaction to innocent people dying. And so that can't be the most foundational ethical principle that we all agree on. But it might go deeper than that. It might be, that's not foundational. Innocent people dying cannot be a foundational ethical expression, because it contains too many concepts. The concept of innocent, the concept of death.</p>
</details>

你之所以可能认为，你之所以可能对无辜的人死去有那种情绪反应，它可以被分解得更细。如果有人认为他们的基本伦理原则是“无辜的人死去，嘘”，我能立刻想出十种情况，你会完全接受一个无辜的人死去。不可能是那样。它必须更深。很可能，如果你真的深入研究人们的道德情感，它们最终会在整个人类物种中根植于相同的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason why you might think, the reason why you might have that emotional reaction to innocent people dying, it can be broken down much, much further. If somebody thinks that their fundamental ethical principle is innocent people dying, boo, I can think of 10 situations off the top of my head in which you would be perfectly fine with an innocent person dying. It can't be that. It must go deeper than that. And it might genuinely be that if you actually go deep enough into people's moral emotions, they will ultimately outroot the identical across the human species.</p>
</details>

在更高层面上，当某人对某事有情绪反应时，那种情绪反应，你不能说它是错的，因为没有真值，但你可以说它暴露了某人犯的一个错误。这真的很有趣。假设你因为婚礼那天下雨而非常沮丧。但结果实际上并没有下雨。你只是不小心看了一个新闻预报的录像带，对吧？你相信在下雨，你对此非常沮丧。我走过来对你说，“嘿，实际上没下雨，对吧？”你突然又开心了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that at a higher level, when someone has an emotional reaction to something, that emotional reaction, you can't say it's wrong because there's no truth value, but you could say that it betrays a mistake that somebody has made. This is really interesting. Like, suppose you were really upset because it was raining on your wedding day. But it turned out it wasn't actually raining. You'd been accidentally watching a tape recording of the news forecast, right? And you believed it was raining, and you're really upset about it. And I come over to you and I say, "Hey, it's not actually raining, right?" And suddenly you are happy again.</p>
</details>

那些情绪状态，因下雨而悲伤，因不下雨而快乐，它们只是情绪状态，对吧？它们不是真的，也不是假的。它们只是情感的表达。但我仍然可以进来，给你信息，改变你的情绪状态，仅仅根据我刚刚给你的信息，就让你感觉完全相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those emotional states, the sadness that the rain and the happiness that it's not raining, they're just emotional states, right? They're not true. They're not false. They're literally just expressions of emotion. But I can still come in and give you information that will change your emotional state and literally convince you to sort of feel the opposite way just based on the information that I've just given you.</p>
</details>

所以同样地，人们可能在更高层次的情感表达上犯了错误，对吧？就像你可能因为下雨而悲伤，即使实际上并没有下雨，有人可能对一个表面的道德问题有情绪反应。他们可能会说，“哦，我认为那个枪支法案通过是错误的。”但如果你真的向他们解释事实，他们可能会说，“实际上，是的，有道理。不，我认为那个枪支法案通过是好的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in the same way it might be that people have, so to speak, mistakes in their like emotional expressions at a higher level, right? In the same way that you might be sad that it's raining, even though it's not really raining, somebody might have an emotional reaction to a surface-level moral issue. They might be like, "Oh, I think it's wrong that that gun law passed." But if you actually just explain to the facts to them, they might be like, "Actually, yeah, fair enough. No, I think it's good that that gun law passed."</p>
</details>

所以你正在进行一场看起来像是关于道德问题的理性讨论，但你实际上只是在讨论事实。很可能，如果我们真的让地球上的每个人在内心情感上与他们所有基本的情感动机保持一致，那么统一性会比不统一性多得多。但我们不知道，因为当然，那个实验没有也可能永远无法完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you are sort of having this what looks like rational discussion about moral issues, but all you're actually doing is discussing the facts. And it might be the case that if we actually made every human being on earth consistent internally, emotionally with all of their foundational emotional motivations, that there would be a lot more unity than disunity. But we don't know, because, of course, that experiment has not and probably cannot ever be done.</p>
</details>

我不确定情绪和态度之间是否有区别。我认为它们基本上是同义词。西蒙·布莱克本不同意我的观点。他是一位重要的元伦理学家。他创立了一个元伦理学立场，他称之为准实在论，这是一种关于伦理学的非认知主义。但他认为，例如，你可以对某事有一个态度，而没有一个情绪状态，或者与那件事相关的情绪状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not sure there is a distinction between emotions and attitudes. I think these are essentially synonyms. Simon Blackburn disagrees with me about this. He is an important metaethicist. He founded a metaethical position, which he equals quasi-realism, which is a kind of non-cognitivism about ethics. But he thinks that, for example, you can have an attitude towards something without having an emotional state, like, or being in an emotional state with relation to that thing.</p>
</details>

所以你可能有一个态度，认为那件事是坏的，或者你不应该那么做，但并不意味着你在情感上投入了。我只是不确定那是否可能。我认为，对某事有一个态度，从字面上讲，就是有一种你希望它成为的方式。我认为这属于情感的范畴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you might have an attitude that that thing is bad or that you shouldn't do that or something like that. But it doesn't mean that you're like emotionally invested. I'm just not sure that that's possible. I think that to have an attitude towards something is kind of, literally speaking, to have a way that you prefer it to be. And I think that that belongs in the category of emotion.</p>
</details>

但这本质上是语义学。如果你想划清界限，你或许可以做到，说对某事的态度是你希望它成为的方式的欲望。而你的情绪状态是你对它没有成为你想要的方式的反应。是的，你可以划出这样的界限，但我认为在实践中，我们谈论的是同一件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this is essentially semantics. Like if you want to draw out a distinction, you could probably do it and say that an attitude towards something is something like your desire for the way that you want it to be. Whereas your emotional state is the reaction you have to it not being the way you want it to be. Yeah, you could draw out some distinction like that, but I think that in practice we're kind of talking about the same thing.</p>

有一点很重要需要指出，是人们常犯的一个错误。情感主义者不认为“错误”或“坏”或类似的东西对应于一种预先存在的情感，比如厌恶、愤怒或沮丧。它只是属于那个类别，但它是一种独特的情感，就像愤怒有点像悲伤，但它们不是一回事。它们只是属于同一类别。它们只是两种独特的情感。“错误”是它自己的一种情感。它是独特的，但它仍然是一种情感，你知道吗？它只是属于那个类别。

<p class="english-text">One thing that's important to point out is a mistake that people make. Emotivists don't think that wrongness or badness or something that maps on to a preexisting emotion, like disgust or like anger or upset. It just belongs in that category, but it's its own unique emotion, in the same way that anger is a little bit like sadness, but they're not the same thing. They just belong in the same category. They're just two unique kinds of emotions. Wrong is its own kind of emotion. It's unique, but it's still an emotion, you know? It just belongs in that category.</p>
</details>

那么，我们为什么会这么想呢？嗯，人们是如何谈论伦理的？好的，我们谈论事情是错误的，但当有人做了绝对可怕的事情，真的非常非常坏，我们说什么？“恶心。”你说，“那太恶心了。太卑鄙了。”那种情感反应就浮现在你的脸上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So well, why might we think that? Well, how do people talk about ethics? Okay, we talk about things being wrong, but when someone does something absolutely awful, like really, really bad, what do we say? "Disgusting." You say, "That's just disgusting. It's despicable." And the sort of emotional reaction just comes up in your face.</p>
</details>

现在，有些人会说，那种情感反应是你对“错误”的反应，对吧？存在这种客观的“错误”，你对这种“错误”产生了厌恶的反应。我更倾向于说，“错误”的全部就是那种厌恶的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, some people will say that that emotional reaction is your reaction to the wrongness, right? There is this objective wrongness and you are having this reaction of disgust to the wrongness. I'm more inclined to say that the wrongness in its totality is the feeling of disgust.</p>
</details>

情感主义的一个很好的例子是乱伦禁忌。这是人类社会中最普遍的禁忌。无论我们看到哪里，都禁止与直系亲属发生任何婚姻或性关系。我记得有些部落有一些有趣的变体，比如你可以娶你的姐姐，但不能娶你的妹妹，诸如此类。但总的来说，都存在某种乱伦禁忌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A great example for emotivism is the incest taboo. It's the most universal taboo that exists in human societies. Everywhere we look, there is a prohibition against any kind of marital or sexual relation with your immediate family. Some tribes, I think, found have some interesting variants whereby, like, you can marry your older sister but not your younger sister, stuff like that. But across the board there is some kind of incest taboo.</p>
</details>

从进化论的角度很容易解释为什么会这样。很明显，近亲繁殖会带来各种各样的问题，这在进化上会被淘汰，对吧？但进化论的解释不是一种辩护，对吧？我也可以从进化论的角度解释为什么人们倾向于有点种族主义。我可以从你的进化生物学角度解释这一点，但这不能成为种族主义的辩护。那只是对它的解释，对吧？

<p class="english-text">It's quite easy to explain evolutionarily why this is the case. Like, clearly there are all kinds of problems with inbreeding that will be evolutionarily deselected for, right? But evolutionary explanations aren't a justification, right? Like I can also evolutionarily explain why people tend to be a bit racist. I can explain that in terms of your evolutionary biology, but that wouldn't be a justification for racism. That would just be an explanation for it, right?</p>
</details>

所以我可以解释为什么存在这种乱伦禁忌，但大多数人想说乱伦是错误的。为什么？这对任何世俗伦理学家来说都是一个出了名的难题，特别是如果你是某种功利主义者，认为唯一重要的是最小化痛苦。“哦，那是因为你可能会有残疾的孩子。”这让我想到几个问题。首先，有残疾的孩子有什么错？其次，显然你可以控制这些因素。

<p class="english-text">So I can explain why there is this incest taboo, but most people want to say that incest is wrong. Why? It's a famously difficult thing for any, at least secular ethicist, to do, especially if you're some kind of utilitarian who thinks that the only thing that matters is the minimization of suffering. "Oh, well it's because you can have disabled children." Few questions jump out of that for me. Firstly, what's wrong with having disabled children? Secondly, obviously you can control for these factors.</p>
</details>

好的，所以你确保是两个女人，或者是两个已经绝育的男人，或者一个已经绝育的男人和一个女人，或者两个男人。“好吧，那是因为家庭中的权力不平衡，”好的，我们也可以控制这一点。我们经常在这些无关紧要的因素上浪费太多时间。你完全可以控制这些因素。它到底有什么错？

You can literally just control for these factors. What's wrong with it?</p>
</details>

归根结底，大多数人如果审视自己的内心体验，要么，那些开明的理性主义者会说，“嗯，那我不认为这是错的，你知道吗？”好吧，也许他们在保持一致性上是对的，但即使是这样的人，也往往会对此感到不舒服。

</details>

有一次，有人真的让我在这方面经受了考验，因为我曾经有点功利主义，我曾经谈论过这个，说，“嗯，我想我看不出这有什么主观上的错误。”我认识的一个人假装他的新女友是他的表妹之类的，他把她介绍给我。然后后来很明显他们是一对，他只是在捉弄我，看看我实际上会作何反应。因为说“哦，是的，那没什么错”很容易，但你仍然会觉得，“什么？”因为它太普遍了。

<p class="english-text">Somebody actually once put me through my paces on this, because I used to be a bit of a utilitarian and I used to talk about this and say, "Well, I suppose like I can't see anything that's subjectively wrong with that."

And then like later on it became clear that they were an item, and he was just toying with me to see how I'd actually react. Because it's easy to say, "Oh yeah, there's nothing wrong with that," but you're still gonna be like, "What?" because it's so universal.</p>
</details>

那么那里发生了什么？我们只是觉得它恶心。我们只是觉得，“天哪，不。我的意思是，那是你的兄弟，那是你的姐妹，那是你的母亲。”最终，当你把它分解开来，你所拥有的就只有这些。会有人说，“不，我信上帝，上帝在宇宙的道德法则中规定这是错误的。”有趣的是，这仍然没有告诉你为什么它是错误的，只是让你确信它是错误的。

There will be people who say, "No, like, I believe in God and God has enshrined into the moral law of the universe that this is wrong."

但好吧，至少暂时搁置这个问题，对于我们这些世俗伦理学家来说，即使是世俗伦理学家也会说，“不，情感主义是错的。”好吧，那试着解释一下这里发生了什么。也许你会说，在这种情况下，人们只是在产生一种情绪反应，因此它不是错误的。但我认为这在所有情况下都是如此。

想想你见过的最恐同的人。他们怎么说同性恋者？他们不只是抽象地、完全不带感情地说，“我认为那是不道德的。”他们说，“那太恶心了。太恶心了。不，不。我的儿子绝不能是同性恋，不，不。”它有这种每个人都知道的情感成分。每个人都知道这些事情有这种情感成分，但我认为那里只有情感成分。我认为这就是伦理学。

<p class="english-text">Think about the worst, most homophobic person you've ever met. What do they say about gay people?

It's got this emotional component that everybody knows. Everybody knows about this emotional component that these things have, but I think there is just the emotional component. I think that's what this ethics is.</p>
</details>

这就是一个父亲说，“我儿子是同性恋”，作为一个事实，和说，“我儿子是同性恋是错误的”之间的区别。我认为，如果你孤立地看这两个陈述之间的区别，那就是，在一种情况下，他正在对那个关于世界的事实产生某种感觉。这并不是他添加的另一个事实。那里只有一个事实，那就是他的儿子是同性恋，而在说他儿子是同性恋是错误的时候，唯一添加的就是他对此的感受。

<p class="english-text">That is the difference between a father saying, "My son is gay," as a matter of fact, and saying, "It's wrong that my son is gay."

And it's not like another fact that he's adding on. There's only one fact there, which is that his son is gay, and the only thing that's being added on in saying that it's wrong that his son is gay is how he feels about it.</p>
</details>

你可能还记得我说过，情感主义是一个关于伦理的理论，但实际上它是一个关于语言的理论，对吧？它更多地是关于人们说某些词时的意思。所以，当有人说“世界应该这样”时，他们是在表达一种关于世界的情感状态。他们在表达他们对世界的情感反应，他们不喜欢它。你仍然可以理解那里发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You might remember that I said that emotivism is a, it's a theory about ethics, but really it's a theory about language, right? It's more about what people mean when they say particular words. And so to say that, when someone says like, "The world ought to be this way," what they're doing is they're expressing an emotional state about the world. They're expressing their emotional reaction to the world, that they don't like it. And you can still make sense of what's like going on there.</p>
</details>

这有点像我们在找吃的，我说，“我们去 Wetherspoons 吧。”我不知道你是否知道 Wetherspoons 是什么，但它是英国一个很棒的连锁酒吧。你看了看手机说，“哦，它们都关门了。”我就会说，“唉，天哪。”我是在表达一种我希望世界是怎样的偏好，你知道吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's kind of like if we were looking for some food and I said, "Let's go to Wetherspoons."

Like I'm expressing a preference about how I wish the world were, you know?</p>
</details>

关键是，我不仅仅是在报告这件事，我不是在说，“你知道，我希望我们生活在一个 Wetherspoons 整夜都开的世界里。”那只是关于我心理状态的一个事实。它是表达本身。我认为如果我说，“它们这么早就关门真是太不对了，”或者类似的话，我用了这些道德化的术语，那我就是在表达一种情感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And crucially, I'm not just reporting this, I'm not just saying, "You know, I wish we lived in a world where Wetherspoons were open all night." That would just be a fact about my psychological state. It's the expression itself. And I think that if I said something like, "It's just so wrong that they shut early," or something like that, I use these moralizing terms, that what I'd be doing is expressing an emotion.</p>
</details>

所以你仍然可以说，“世界真的不应该是那样的，”但情感主义者只是把那种语言翻译成伦理表达的语言，就像，我不知道，你可能会翻译……很多时候在人际关系中，你得翻译他们说的话。如果你的妻子对你说，“哦，你比你说的时间晚了十分钟回来。”她实际上是在说，“别把我当傻子。你在对我撒谎，你从来不准时，你很懒。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you can still say something like, "The world really ought not be that way," but the emotivist is just translates that language into the language of ethical expression in the same way that like, I don't know, you might translate when... A lot of the time in like relationships with people, you kind of have to translate what they're saying. If your wife says to you like, "Oh, you're back 10 minutes later than you said you'd be." What she's actually saying is, "Stop taking me for a fool. Like, you're lying to me and you're never on time and you're lazy."</p>
</details>

但表面之下还有更多东西。它甚至可能是一种情感的表达。当她说，“哦，不，只是我以为我们今晚可以一起吃晚饭。”表面上，她在做一个关于她心理的描述性声明。“我只是向你报告，我以为，我有一个信念，我们要吃晚饭。”那只是关于世界的一个事实。但很明显，她实际上是在向你表达一种情感状态。她在表达她的不快，但她把它伪装成关于她心理的真理主张的语言，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's sort of this, there's something more going on under the surface. It might even be a kind of expression of emotion.

"I'm just reporting to you, I thought, I had a belief that we were gonna get dinner." That's just a fact about the world. But clearly what she's actually doing there is expressing an emotional state to you. She's expressing her upset, but she's sort of disguising it in the language of truth claims about her psychology, right?</p>
</details>

伦理学也是一样。当有人说，“我认为那是错的，”他们是在对某事产生情绪反应，并把它包装成描述性的外衣。

我一直对伦理学是……这个观点深感怀疑。众所周知，像“善”和“恶”这样的概念很难定义，但我们却一直在使用它们。在这种对话之外，如果我这次采访迟到了一点，有人说，“哦，我觉得那真的很糟糕，你迟到真的很不道德，”在不做任何元伦理学分析的情况下，我们都大概明白那是在说什么，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was always already just deeply suspicious of the idea that ethics is this... It's a very difficult thing to define famously, like, concepts, like good and bad, but we employ them all the time. Like, outside of this kind of conversation, if I'm a bit late to this interview, and somebody says, "Oh, I just think that that's really bad, that's really immoral that you were late," like without doing any metaethic, we all kind of get what's being said there, right?</p>
</details>

从技术上讲，如果我问这个房间里的每个人，“嗯，你对‘错误’的定义是什么？那字面上是什么意思？你的意思是它导致痛苦吗？你的意思是它……”人们可能会有不同的看法，但从表面上看，我们都使用这些术语，我们用这些术语相处，我们知道它们的意思。

<p class="english-text">Technically speaking, if I asked everybody in this room, "Well, what's your definition of wrongness? What does that literally mean? Do you mean that it causes suffering? Do you mean that it..."

</details>

所以我只是对这样一个事实感兴趣，即这是一个我已经经常使用的词汇，但我也对宇宙中存在一种叫做“善”的东西的观点深感怀疑。它到底存在于哪里？它如何存在？它存在于人、行动中吗？某物甚至能存在于一个行动中吗？它在哪里？它是什么，你知道吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I was just interested in the fact that it's a kind of lexicon that I was already frequently employing, but also deeply suspicious of the idea that there is this thing in the universe called like goodness.

</details>

就像，“好吧，那让我们开始注意。”我的意思是，人们意识到这些善恶的东西本质上只是人们在说的话，这并不是一个不常见的想法。它只是观点和主观偏好。好吧，但让我们更具体一点。我到底在说什么？因为我使用这些术语。我不是在不知道一个词的意思的情况下使用它。我不是在不知道“obnoxious”（讨厌的）的定义的情况下就使用了这个词。当我说这些术语时，我知道我的意思，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like, "Okay, well then let's start paying attention." I mean, this is not an uncommon thought for people to realize that the this good and bad stuff is essentially just, it's just people saying stuff. It's just like viewpoints and subjective preferences. All right, but let's get more specific. What exactly am I saying? Because I use these terms. It's not like I'm using a term without knowing what it means. It's not like I've just used the word obnoxious, but not known the definition of obnoxious. I know what I mean when I say these terms, right?</p>
</details>

但当我反思时，对吧？“但是这个，这个善，这个恶是什么？我一定是指的什么。那么我指的是什么？”就在那时，我做了这个练习，真正地试图孤立道德元素。“下雨了”和“下雨是坏事”之间有什么区别？“刚刚发生了一起谋杀案”和“刚刚发生的谋杀案是错误的”之间有什么区别？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when I reflect on it, right? "But what is this, this good, this bad? I must mean something. So what do I mean?" And that's when I sort of do this exercise of really trying to isolate the moral element. What is the difference between it's raining and it's bad that it's raining? What is the difference between a murder just occurred and it's wrong that that murder just occurred?</p>
</details>

如果你试图孤立那里的实际区别，我认为那只能是一种态度，一种表达，是你对那种特定情况的感受。所以，说某事是错误的唯一能增加的东西就是那种态度的表达。这就是引导我走向情感主义的思维方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you try to isolate what the actual difference is there, I think it has to just be an attitude, it's an expression, it's the way you feel about that particular situation.

</details>

我想很难确切地记得我是如何开始被这个观点说服的，但我猜我当时确信没有客观的善或恶。我甚至无法理解这样一个概念。一旦那个消失了，你甚至不再真正地在做伦理学了。现在你只是在试图弄清楚，“好吧，那么那些词是什么意思？‘善’这个词的指代物是什么？”它不可能是完全没有意义的。它必须有某种指代物。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it is hard to remember literally how I sort of first started becoming convinced by this, but I suppose I was convinced that there is no objective good or bad.

What is the referent for the word good?" It can't be literally meaningless. It must have some kind of referent.</p>
</details>

这就是 A.J. 艾耶尔最初走向这个观点的原因。他对语言中的意义有他自己的一整套哲学。他认为，陈述只有在两种情况下才有意义：要么是你可以通过经验观察来验证的，即证明或反驳；要么它们只是分析上为真，即根据定义为真，比如二加二等于四之类的。或者分析上为假，你知道，二加二等于五。这是一个有意义的陈述，只是它在意义上是假的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what led A.J. Ayer to it in the first place. He had this whole philosophy about meaning in language. He thought that like statements could only be meaningful if they were either something you could verify, so prove or disprove through empirical observation, or if they were just like analytically true, just true by definition, things like two plus two is four, something like that. Or analytically false, you know, two plus two is five. It's a meaningful statement. It's just meaningfully false.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，这种哲学，即逻辑实证主义，已经完全失宠了。这种观点认为，陈述只有在可验证或分析上为真或为假时才有意义，这意味着任何不属于那个类别的陈述……艾耶尔认为它不仅仅是错误或虚假的，而是字面上毫无意义的。就像说“blah, blah, blah”一样。它完全没有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This philosophy, by the way, has completely fallen out of favor, this logical positivism, as it's called, this idea that statements are only meaningful if they are verifiable or analytical, or analytically true or false, which means that any kind of statement which does not belong in that category... It's not just that it's like wrong or false. Ayer thought it was literally meaningless. It was the same as just like going, "Blah, blah, blah," or something. It just literally had no meaning.</p>
</details>

所以《语言、真理与逻辑》第七章的大问题是，伦理陈述怎么办？当我说谋杀是错误的，这似乎不是我能通过经验验证的东西。我不能出去用科学实验来测试谋杀是否是错误的，但它似乎也不是分析上为真。它似乎不是根据定义为真。我似乎可以有意义地问，谋杀真的错了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the big problem in chapter seven of "Language, Truth & Logic" is what about ethical statements? When I say murder is wrong, it doesn't seem like it's something I can empirically verify. I can't go out and like test with scientific experiments whether murder is wrong, but it also doesn't seem analytically true. It doesn't seem true by definition. It seems like I can meaningfully ask, is murder really wrong?</p>
</details>

所以艾耶尔的哲学使他陷入了这样一个境地：他要么必须说伦理陈述因此是字面上毫无意义的，再说一遍，说谋杀是错误的就等于说谋杀是“blah, blah, blah”。一个毫无意义的陈述。但艾耶尔觉得，“不，它肯定有意义。”所以如果它既不是分析上为真，也不是经验上可验证的，那么这些伦理陈述是什么意思？哦，好吧，它们是情感的表达。它们不是那种我们可以像科学一样测试的真假事物，也不是分析上为真的。它根本不在真值的范畴内。它只是字面上的情感表达。所以从那个意义上说，它是有意义的，在一个稍微不同的意义上，表达的字面意义就是一种表达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so Ayer's philosophy led him to this position where he either had to say that ethical statements were therefore literally meaningless, again, like saying murder is wrong would be the same as just saying like, murder is blah, blah, blah. Like, just meaningless statement. But Ayer was like, "No, it definitely means something." So if it's not analytically true and it's not empirically verifiable, then what do these ethical statements mean? Oh, well, they're expressions of emotions. They're not the kind of things that are true and false that we can test like scientifically or might be analytically true. It's not in the realm of truth value at all. It's literally just an emotional expression. So it's meaningful in that sense, in a slightly different sense that the literal meaning of the expression is just that an expression.</p>

情感主义最大的问题是所谓的**弗雷格-吉奇问题**（Frege-Geach problem: 针对非认知主义伦理学的著名难题，指出其无法合理解释道德语言在复杂句子（如条件句）中的用法），以两位哲学家的名字命名。它也被称为嵌入问题。原因在于它处理了这样一个问题：当你把一个词或一个陈述的意义嵌入到英语的一个更大的句子中时，意义需要保持不变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The biggest problem for emotivism is this so-called Frege-Geach problem, named after two philosophers. It's also known as the embedding problem. Reason for that is because it deals with this problem that, when you take the meaning of a word or a statement and you embed it in the English language into a larger sentence, the meaning needs to stay the same.</p>
</details>

所以如果我说，“外面在下雨，”然后我说，“我想知道外面是否在下雨，”我把“外面在下雨”这个原子短语嵌入到一个更大的句子中，那个孤立的“外面在下雨”的元素必须意味着同样的事情。我现在说，“我想知道外面是否在下雨，”然后“外面在下雨。”嗯，“我认为外面在下雨。”或者，“如果外面在下雨，那么我会带一把伞，”对吧？像那些陈述，“我会带一把伞”和“外面在下雨”有它们自己的意义，当你把它们嵌入到一个陈述中，比如“如果外面在下雨，那么我会带一把伞”时，它们保留了那个意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I say, "It's raining outside," and then I say something like, "I wonder if it's raining outside," so I've embedded that phrase, "it's raining outside" that atomic phrase inside a larger sentence, that isolated element of "it's raining outside" has to mean the same thing. I'm now saying, "I wonder if it's raining outside," and then "it's raining outside." Well, "I think that it's raining outside." Or, "If it's raining outside, then I will bring an umbrella," right? Like those statements, "I will bring an umbrella" and, "it's raining outside" have meaning of their own, and they retain that meaning when you embed them into a statement, like, "if it's raining outside, then I'll bring an umbrella."</p>
</details>

弗雷格和吉奇的问题在于，对于情感主义来说，如果伦理陈述只是情感的表达，也就是说，当我说谋杀是错误的，我字面上的意思类似于“嘘，谋杀”。那么我如何理解像“我想知道谋杀是否是错误的”这样的陈述呢？当有人这么说时，那句话是什么意思？因为如果“谋杀是错误的”只是意味着“嘘，谋杀”，那就意味着有人在说，“我想知道是否嘘，谋杀。”这没什么道理，因为你正在表达一种情感，然后说，“我想知道。”这几乎就像你踢到脚趾然后说，“我想知道是否，啊，天哪。”这不合逻辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem for Frege and Geach is that with emotivism, if ethical statements are just expressions of emotion, that is, when I say murder is wrong, I literally mean something like boo, murder. Then how can I make sense of a statement like, "I wonder if murder is wrong." Like, what does that statement mean when someone says that? Because if murder is wrong, just means boo, murder, that would mean someone saying, "I wonder if boo, murder." That doesn't make very much sense because you are expressing an emotion and then saying, "I wonder." It's almost like you stub your toe and you go, "I wonder if, ah, man." It doesn't make sense.</p>
</details>

你唯一能理解有人说“我想知道谋杀是否是错误的”的方式是，如果在那个语境中，在嵌入的语境中，“谋杀是错误的”意味着不同的东西。在那个语境中，它意味着它不是情感的表达。哦，它是关于他们心理态度或其他东西的讨论。但句子的意义不会那样改变。

The only way you could make sense of someone saying "I wonder if murder is wrong," is if in that context, in the embedded context, murder is wrong means something different. In that context, it means it's not an expression of emotion. Oh, it's a discussion about their mental attitude or something like that. But meaning doesn't just change like that for sentences.</p>

所以嵌入问题说，“嗯，如果你看一个陈述，比如‘我想知道谋杀是否是错误的’或者‘如果谋杀是错误的，那么谋杀詹姆斯就是错误的’”，这似乎是一个我能理解的合理陈述，那么鉴于在那个嵌入的语境中，那些陈述不能只是情感的表达，这意味着在那些嵌入的语境之外，它们也不能只是情感的表达。

<p class="english-text">And so the embedding problem says, "Well, if you look at a statement like, 'I wonder if murder is wrong' or if murder is wrong, then murdering James is wrong," which seems to be a sensible statement that I can make sense of, then given that in that embedded context, those statements can't just be expressions of emotion, means that outside of those embedded context, they also can't just be expressions of emotions.</p>

这是一个有点技术性的问题。我希望这能说得通。解释起来有点困难，但我希望这能传达出来。人们可以对此进行进一步的阅读，但我的意思是，如果你思考一个论证，比如，如果谋杀是错误的，那么谋杀詹姆斯就是错误的。前提二，谋杀是错误的，结论，因此，谋杀詹姆斯是错误的。

<p class="english-text">It's a bit of a technical problem. I hope that kind of makes sense. It's a little bit difficult to explain actually, but I think hopefully that comes across. And people can do further reading on this, but I mean, if you think about an argument like, if murder is wrong, then murdering James is wrong. Premise two, murder is wrong, conclusion, therefore, murdering James is wrong.</p>
</details>

那个结论是从那些前提中得出的。我们不知道前提是否为真，但我们可以说，如果前提为真，结论就成立。这是一个有效的论证。但逻辑有效性依赖于前提的真值。说一个论证是有效的，就是说如果前提为真，结论就为真。对吧？这就是说一个论证有效的意思。这是有效论证的定义。

<p class="english-text">That conclusion follows from those premises. We don't know if the premises are true, but we can say that if the premises are true, the conclusion follows. It's a valid argument. But logical validity relies on the truth value of the premises. To say that an argument is valid is to say that if the premises are true, the conclusion is true. Right? That's what it means to say an argument is valid. That's like the definition of a valid argument.</p>
</details>

所以如果我们采纳那个论证，如果谋杀是错误的，那么谋杀詹姆斯就是错误的，前提二，谋杀是错误的，那么谋杀詹姆斯就是错误的。这似乎是有效的，但这需要我们能够把前提二，即“谋杀是错误的”，看作是可真可假的东西。如果我们是情感主义者，我们说，“不，不，不，那是情感的表达，它不能为真或为假，”那么我们就得说我刚才列出的那个论证是无效的。

<p class="english-text">So if we take that argument, if murder is wrong, then murdering James is wrong, premise two, murder is wrong, it follows that murdering James is wrong. That seems valid, but that would require us being able to conceive of premise two, murder is wrong, as being something which is true or false. If we're an emotivist and we say, "No, no, no, that's an expression of emotion, it can't be true or false," then we'd have to say that that argument that I just laid out is not valid.</p>
</details>

那似乎不对。似乎完全有效。我的意思是，它必须是有效的。当然，如果你看到它写下来，它就像，那显然，结论显然是从前提中得出的。所以，就好像当你把这些伦理表达嵌入到更大的语境中，比如三段论或者“我想知道是否”或者无论什么，如果-那么陈述，它们突然就，怎么说，不再是情感表达了？突然它们有了真值，我们以不同的方式谈论它们。那似乎没有任何意义。所以这就是弗雷格-吉奇问题。

<p class="english-text">That doesn't seem right. Seems perfectly valid. I mean, it has to be valid. Surely if you see it written down, it's like that's obviously, the conclusion obviously follows from the premises. So it's as though when you take these ethical expressions and you embed them into bigger contexts like syllogisms or "I wonder if," or whatever, if-then statements, that suddenly they're what, like just not emotional expressions anymore? Suddenly they have truth value and we talk about them differently. That doesn't seem to make any sense. So that's the Frege-Geach problem.</p>

如果你对情感主义感兴趣，可以从 A.J. 艾耶尔的《语言、真理与逻辑》开始，这一切都源于此。他在第七章中谈到了使用道德术语的意义。整本书解释了他的逻辑实证主义哲学，就像我说的，现在已经没人相信了。它在20世纪曾一度流行，然后就完全失宠了。但第七章仍然是这个情感主义框架的起源。

<p class="english-text">If you're interested in emotivism, the place to start might be A.J. Ayer's "Language, Truth & Logic," which is where this all kind of comes from. It's chapter seven in which he talks about what it means to use moral terms. Like the book as a whole explains his logical positivism as a philosophy, which like I say, no one really believes in anymore. It was kind of popular for a while in the 20th century and then just completely fell out of favor. But that chapter seven is still the origin of this emotivist framework.</p>

但关于这些东西，一位更现代的哲学家是西蒙·布莱克本，我认为。布莱克本以他的哲学入门书而闻名。他写了几本面向大众的哲学入门读物。但他在元伦理学方面也做了一些重要的工作。他本人不是情感主义者，但他有说服力地写了关于情感主义和更广泛的非认知主义的文章。他还汇编或构建了一个对情感主义最佳反驳的有影响力的回应。这两个名字是我能想到的开始探索情感主义的人。

<p class="english-text">But a more modern philosopher to read on this stuff would be Simon Blackburn, I think. Blackburn is famous for his introductions to philosophy. He's written a few sort of popular introductions for just getting into philosophy. But he's also done some important work in metaethics. He's not himself an emotivist, but he's written compellingly about emotivism and non-cognitivism more broadly. He's also compiled or constructed quite an influential response to the best objection to emotivism. Those would be the two names that jump out at me to begin exploring emotivism.</p>
