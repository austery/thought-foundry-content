### 核心理念：承诺不足，交付有余与客户忠诚度

一个单独的功能不足以赢得客户的青睐。我们成功的核心秘诀之一是“承诺不足，交付有余”。

<p class="english-text">A feature alone is not going to get me $100,000 from a customer. One of the reasons for our success is underpromising and overd delivering. This is the core of repeat business. If your existing customers are not paying you more, then you're basically just selling and running, which means hunt, hunt, hunt. But the balance between hunting and farming, which is new customers versus getting more from existing customers. Jeff Bezos has called it like the flywheel effect of companies. You know, you need to add new logos, but you need to go make money from existing logos. I think that tests the real metal of a company. I'm a big fan of Will Gdara is a restaurant tour who actually had two of the most famous restaurants in the world and he talks about this concept of unreasonable hospitality giving people way more than they expect. That is where great entrepreneurs differentiate from the mediocre ones.</p>

这正是重复业务的核心。如果你的现有客户没有为你带来更多收入，那么你基本上只是在“销售后即走”，这意味着你需要不断地“寻找、寻找、寻找”新客户。而“狩猎”（获取新客户）与“耕耘”（从现有客户那里获得更多价值）之间的平衡，是构建大型企业的核心。正如杰夫·贝索斯（Jeff Bezos）所称的“飞轮效应”（Flywheel effect: 公司通过一系列相互强化的行动，实现持续增长和动能），你需要不断获取新客户（新 Logo），同时也要从现有客户那里盈利。我认为这真正考验着一家公司的实力。我非常欣赏一位名叫威尔·格达拉（Will Gdara）的餐饮业人士，他曾经营着两家世界闻名的餐厅，他提出了“非理性热情好客”（Unreasonable hospitality: 给予顾客远超他们预期的服务和体验）的概念。这正是优秀创业者区别于平庸者的关键所在。

### 创始人介绍：Dheeraj Pandey 的创业历程

我的名字是 Dheeraj Pandey。我是 DevRev 公司的联合创始人兼首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My name is Dhiraj Pande. I'm the co-founder and CEO of a company called DevRev. So we are in the business of blurring the lines between the public wisdom of the internet and natural language wisdom with the enterprise wisdom. That's basically what Devre is all about. Before this I had started a company nutanics. We were the fastest to a billion dollars in revenue and took it public in 7 years record time on NASDAQ was the largest tech IPO of 2016. I ran it as a public company CEO for almost 5 years. Then I realized there's a big opportunity opening up in AI which is how dead started almost 4 years ago. I also sit on Adobe's board. I'm on the audit committee there. And last but not the least a big student of both AI and design.</p>
</details>

我们致力于融合互联网的公开智慧、自然语言的智慧与企业内部的智慧。这正是 DevRev 的核心所在。在此之前，我创立了 Nutanix（Nutanix: Dheeraj Pandey创立的第一家公司，专注于提供融合了商品化硬件和软件的IT基础设施解决方案）。我们公司在七年内实现了十亿美元的营收，并创纪录地于 2016 年在纳斯达克（NASDAQ: 美国一家主要的股票交易所，以科技股为主）上市，成为当年最大的科技 IPO。我作为上市公司 CEO 运营了近五年。之后，我意识到人工智能（AI: Artificial Intelligence，指由机器展示的智能，通常指计算机系统模仿人类认知功能）领域存在巨大的机遇，于是大约四年前，我开始着手创建 DevRev。我还担任 Adobe 的董事，并在其审计委员会任职。最后但同样重要的是，我一直深入学习人工智能（AI）和设计。

### 个人背景与早期创业启示

我拥有一个相当不平凡的童年。我在印度最贫穷的邦长大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a fairly dysfunctional childhood. I grew up in the poorest state of India. The Himalayan rivers the seasonal rivers that would flood half the state. Half the year was flooded. It was the most lawless state but the poorest state. That state's GDP per capita is only as much as subsaharan Africa. So you can imagine the level of poverty that actually I saw. That's what catapulted me to actually get out of the state and do something. Back in the day you could only be a good engineer or a good doctor. There was no third profession. I picked engineering. Luckily when I was growing up and I had to pick uh the field of engineering the internet had just happened. This is 1993 1994. computer science was going to be the next hot thing just like AI which is the new computer science is hot right now I built my entire career just being shaped around the internet I can't stay in India right now but back in the day the only option was to leave the country if you're an engineer I have to be in this bubble to know what working in the industry means a big part of this is to have seen dysfunction as a child divorced is not bad enough I mean if you've seen sad and disappointing days as a higher. I think it actually carries through with you. But it also means you can actually take care of tough situations and entrepreneurship is a lot of that. It's a lot of highs and lows and it's important not to get too sad with the lows which also means that you can't be too happy with the highs and staying on that average line and how you modulate your emotion is the way you will deal with a lot of failures.</p>
</details>

那里，喜马拉雅山脉的季节性河流每年都会淹没半个邦。一年中有一半时间处于洪水状态。那是一个最无法无天但也是最贫穷的邦。该邦的人均 GDP 仅相当于撒哈拉以南非洲的水平。所以你可以想象我亲眼目睹的贫困程度。正是这种经历促使我离开了家乡，去追求更有作为的事业。在那个年代，你只能成为一名优秀的工程师或医生，没有第三种选择。我选择了工程学。幸运的是，在我成长过程中需要选择工程学领域时，互联网刚刚兴起。那是 1993 年、1994 年。计算机科学即将成为下一个热门领域，就像现在人工智能（AI）一样热门。我整个职业生涯都是围绕互联网构建的。我现在无法留在印度，但在那个年代，如果你是一名工程师，唯一的选择就是离开这个国家，我必须身处这个行业圈子，才能了解行业运作的意义。其中很重要的一点是，童年时期就经历过“功能失调”（dysfunction）。离婚或许不算什么，但如果你在成长过程中经历过悲伤和令人失望的日子，我认为这会伴随你一生。但这也意味着你能够应对艰难的局面，而创业恰恰充满了这样的挑战。创业有太多的起起伏伏，重要的是不要因为低谷而过于沮丧，这也意味着你不能因为高峰而过于得意忘形，保持情绪的平均线，以及如何调节情绪，将决定你如何应对无数的失败。

### Nutanix 的经验：从技术风险到市场风险

Nutanix 是我的第一家创业公司。我认为 Nutanix 的核心在于真正解决数据管理问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nutanics was my first startup. I think the core of Nutanix was to really do something around data management. We said, look, we are good at data inensive applications. We reliably manage data at fast speeds like no one else. Hey, we can ship software to you where your data centers will look like Google's and Amazons and Facebooks and so on. And we were also trying to bring commodity hardware which was Taiwanese equipment to the enterprise. Before that, people were buying hardware from Dell, HP, IBM, all these branded hardware companies, EMC, NetApp. So, they were all into shiny hardware. And he like no, no, no, no. You can take the same approach that Amazon, Google, Facebook take really source hardware from Taiwan, bring it to the US and put software on top. So you have a commodity hardware and a pure software running on top of it. First four five years was extremely problematic because the hardware was flaky and unreliable and the software needed to overcompensate for that. So we took our time to really make the software compensate for a flaky, fragile hardware. In fact, our company was always shut down three times. But at the core, the big thing in my head was that you are on a tight rope and you're walking a tight rope and you have to cross this valley. When you're halfway through, you can't turn around. You'll fall if you turn around. Any new product that you launch, any new initiative, you have to think about plowing through. Now, sometimes moving forward might mean shutting it down completely. But to actually say I want to go back this direction is the worst thing that entrepreneurs actually do. So we did have a couple of big pivots. The only constant in building a company is change. So if you can embrace change and you can make it seamless and you can be a little bit ahead of the market and you have to be really good at looking around the corner and that means listening because when you hear something from the market the first time as a stubborn entrepreneur you'll say h that's an aberration. When you hear it the second time, now it's a coincidence. When you hear it a third time, it's a pattern. You need to understand how to recognize patterns and look around the corner. Be at least 6 months ahead of what eventually will be a hard pivot and see if you can make soft pivots into that direction. There's no point just making 90° turns or 180° turns if you can actually make softer turns to the same degree that he would have otherwise achieved.</p>
</details>

我们当时的想法是，我们擅长处理数据密集型应用，能够以极快的速度可靠地管理数据。我们设想，可以提供软件，让客户的数据中心看起来像谷歌、亚马逊、Facebook 那样。我们还试图将台湾生产的商品化硬件引入企业市场。在此之前，人们都从戴尔（Dell）、惠普（HP）、IBM、EMC、NetApp 等品牌硬件公司购买设备。他们都钟情于光鲜亮丽的硬件。但我们认为，可以借鉴亚马逊、谷歌、Facebook 的模式：从台湾采购硬件，运到美国，然后在上面运行软件。这样，你就拥有了商品化硬件和运行在其上的纯软件。最初的四五年极其困难，因为硬件不稳定、不可靠，软件需要为此进行大量补偿。因此，我们花了很长时间来确保软件能够弥补脆弱硬件的不足。事实上，我们的公司曾三次濒临倒闭。但核心理念是，你正走在钢丝上，必须穿越山谷。当你走到一半时，不能回头，否则就会摔下去。任何新产品、新举措，你都必须坚持推进。有时，前进可能意味着彻底关闭它。但想要回头，则是创业者最常犯的错误。我们确实经历了几次重大转型（pivot）。建立公司唯一不变的就是变化。因此，如果你能拥抱变化，使其变得顺畅，并能稍微领先于市场，你必须善于“预见未来”（looking around the corner）。这意味着要倾听：当一个固执的创业者第一次听到市场上的某种声音时，他可能会觉得那只是个“异常现象”。第二次听到时，可能觉得是“巧合”。第三次听到时，那就是一种“模式”了。你需要学会识别模式并预见未来。至少要比最终的重大转型（hard pivot）提前六个月，看看是否能进行一些“软性转型”（soft pivots）朝着那个方向。如果你能以同样的方式实现目标，但通过更平缓的转向（soft turns）而非生硬的 90 度或 180 度转弯，那就没有必要采取生硬的转向。

### 市场风险与产品-市场契合度（PMF）

我认为，Nutanix 的理念在于“追随市场趋势”（where the puck was headed），而不是仅仅停留在“当前市场”（where the puck was）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if you look at the idea of nutanics, it was where the puck was as opposed to where the puck was headed because it my the first idea my first startup. I had started to really take technology risk but not a market risk cuz the market by 2012 had already seen cloud and the fact that consumer cloud companies were saying look you don't need to own infrastructure if you can stream the infrastructure. It's like what happened with music eventually was like you don't need to own songs. market for Spotify was already happening and the public cloud was that version for infrastructure. So the puck was headed to streaming and we were still at iTunes and on software was basically headed in that challenge market where you would constantly have to think about do I need to own or can I stream do I need to own can I stream so the idea of nutanics was where the puck was and it was a technology risk and we got paid for it for 1020 $20 million that's the valuation of nanic but to really build a hundred billion business you had to take a market risk This is something that all entrepreneurs will actually face being an investor but also being an operator and when you do your company you're doing both in one at some point you might have to decouple those where you become an investor in your current idea and you become an operator of a new idea around 2020 when co happened is when you're like okay what's the next chemistry we can bring together and it really happened to be around business software when GPT came about by this time we already had our own vector database. We had built our own vector database to actually do search because we knew search was the first killer app for anything intelligent. Now what GPT has given us is the ability to ask it questions and bring the natural language wisdom that otherwise we would have struggled to build. But at the core of it, the enterprise data piece of it is the biggest challenge cuz I can't do anything in the in the business in a in an enterprise software environment with Wikipedia's knowledge or internet's knowledge. I need to bring the knowledge of the enterprise in a coherent hole which is what a knowledge graph actually brings. And to take this knowledge graph and mix it up with the wisdom of the internet is what we really do. So the biggest bang for AI is building a perplexity like thing for all enterprise assets. And that to me was the light bulb moment. In the absence of the public cloud, we could have been a hundred billion company. But in the presence of the public cloud, we'd be hovering around the $20 billion range, you know, because the market has moved. If technology doesn't integrate things, bring the chemistry as opposed to just new features and new ideas, it has not done its job. A big ideas are about alchemy. It's about mixing things together and making it look like a more robust solution. Even like a chemical solution is about bringing chemistry together. And bringing a lot of these things together is where a lot of uh value gets created. Product market fit is actually a journey, not a destination. You'll need to struggle with that. At 1 million, at 10 million, at 50 million, at 100 million, at a quarter billion, at half a billion, a billion, every such milestone, you have to keep thinking again. You have to think ahead of the curve because if you waited too long, you might start to sputter at 100 million. You might have needed a new product for going from 100 million to 250 million. And you might need to have needed to see the new region of the world to do sales and marketing. I think this idea of PMF is relative and it's not a destination. Every time you think you have product market fit, you will start to sputter at the next threshold. So at 10 million, you're like, "Okay, I have PMF." That means that you not thought through that at 50 million, you will stall because you didn't have a pipeline that was large enough for more features, more capabilities, bigger deals, bigger customers, or you didn't think hard enough about the other regions of the world, which will now create a portfolio effect. Because what he keep me to doing is to create a portfolio of products of customers of regions of the world, geographies around the world that will give you that balance every quarter because not every existing customer will pay you every quarter. So you need to find a portfolio of large customers so that they can all balance each other every quarter. I think that to me is a journey more than a destination.</p>
</details>

我的第一个想法是，我承担了技术风险，但没有承担市场风险。因为到 2012 年，市场已经看到了云计算的趋势，消费者云公司都在说：“你看，如果你能‘流式传输’基础设施，就不需要自己拥有它了。”这就像音乐最终发生的那样：你不需要拥有歌曲，Spotify 的市场已经形成，而公共云就是基础设施的“流式传输”版本。所以，市场趋势（puck）正朝着流式传输方向发展，而我们当时还在使用 iTunes。软件也大致朝着这个方向发展，你必须不断思考：我需要拥有它，还是可以‘流式传输’？Nutanix 的理念在于“市场趋势的走向”，它是一个技术风险，我们因此获得了 1000 万到 2000 万美元的估值。但要真正建立一个千亿美元的企业，你必须承担市场风险。这是所有创业者都会面临的，既是投资者，也是运营者。当你经营公司时，你同时扮演着这两种角色。在某些时候，你可能需要将它们分开：你成为当前想法的投资者，同时成为一个新想法的运营者。大约在 2020 年，新冠疫情爆发时，我开始思考：“我们能结合出什么样的‘新化学反应’？”这最终围绕着商业软件展开。当 GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer）出现时，我们已经拥有了自己的向量数据库（Vector database: 一种专门设计用于存储、检索和管理高维向量数据的数据库，常用于AI和机器学习应用中的相似性搜索）。我们构建自己的向量数据库是为了实现搜索功能，因为我们知道搜索是任何智能应用的首个‘杀手级应用’。现在，GPT 赋予了我们提问的能力，并带来了自然语言的智慧，否则我们很难构建出来。但核心在于，企业数据部分是最大的挑战，因为在企业软件环境中，我无法仅凭维基百科或互联网的知识来开展业务。我需要将企业的知识以一种连贯整体的方式呈现出来，这正是知识图谱（Knowledge graph: 一种表示知识的结构化模型，通过节点（实体）和边（关系）来描述概念及其相互联系）所能带来的。将这个知识图谱与互联网的智慧相结合，就是我们真正要做的事情。因此，AI 最大的价值在于为所有企业资产构建一个类似 Perplexity AI 的搜索能力。对我来说，这就是那个“灵光一现”的时刻。如果没有公共云，我们本可以成为一家千亿美元的公司。但在公共云的背景下，我们可能只能徘徊在 200 亿美元左右，因为市场已经发生了变化。如果技术不能整合事物，带来“化学反应”（chemistry），而不仅仅是新功能和新想法，那么它就没有完成使命。伟大的想法在于“炼金术”（alchemy），是将事物混合在一起，使其看起来是一个更强大的解决方案。即使是化学溶液，也是将化学物质结合在一起。将许多事物结合起来，才能创造巨大的价值。

“产品-市场契合度”（Product-market fit - PMF）实际上是一个旅程，而非终点。你需要为此而奋斗。在 100 万、1000 万、5000 万、1 亿美元、2.5 亿美元、5 亿美元、10 亿美元的每一个里程碑，你都必须重新思考。你必须“领先于曲线”（ahead of the curve），因为如果你等待太久，可能在 1 亿美元时就开始停滞不前。你可能需要一款新产品才能从 1 亿美元增长到 2.5 亿美元，或者需要开拓新的地域市场来进行销售和营销。我认为 PMF 的概念是相对的，它不是一个终点。每次你认为自己达到了 PMF，你就会在下一个门槛处开始遇到瓶颈。所以在 1000 万美元时，你可能会想：“好吧，我有 PMF 了。”这意味着你可能没有充分考虑到，在 5000 万美元时，你会因为没有足够大的产品线来支持更多功能、更强大的能力、更大的交易、更庞大的客户群，或者没有充分考虑其他市场区域（现在将产生投资组合效应）而陷入停滞。因为我需要做的是建立一个产品、客户、区域的“投资组合”（portfolio），这些全球各地的地理区域能够让你每个季度都保持平衡，因为并非所有现有客户都会在每个季度都付费。所以你需要找到一个大型客户的投资组合，以便它们能在每个季度相互平衡。我认为这对我来说更像是一场旅程，而非终点。

### 技术颠覆与未来商业模式

我们回过头来思考“想法的漏斗”和“想法的生命周期”。漏斗的顶端有大量的想法，然后它们变成概念。从概念变得稍微真实一些时，它仍然是一个“功能”（feature）。你谈论所有那些正在构建“代理”（agents）的公司，但它们充其量只是功能，你可以通过向客户展示一个功能来获得一些早期胜利，但如何将一个功能转化为一个产品呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We take a step back and think about the funnel of idea and the life cycle of an idea. There's a lot of ideas up there at the top of the funnel and then they become concepts. From concepts when it becomes a little bit real, it's still a feature. You talk about all these companies that are basically building agents, but at best they're features and you can get some early wins by showing a feature to your customer, but how do you take a feature to a product? A feature alone is not going to get me $100,000 from a customer. How do you organize all this into a robust product and a product to a company and a company to a business? That is the real test of entrepreneurship. Going from a company to a business is now really building relationships with customers, making sure that you don't leave customers in the lurch when they need the most amount of help. One of the reasons for our success is underpromising and overd delivering, you know, and this is the core of repeat business. If your existing customers are not paying you more, then you're basically just selling and running, which means hunt, hunt, hunt. But the balance between hunting and farming, which is new customers versus getting more from existing customers, is at the core of building large businesses. You know, Jeff Bezos has called it like the flywheel effect of companies. You know, you need to add new logos, but you need to go make money from existing logos. I think that tests the real metal of a company. Do you have a product that is authentic? You have customer support that's really good and finally you have salespeople who really know how to underpromise and overd deliver. I'm a big fan of Will Gdara is a restaurant tour who actually had two of the most famous restaurants in the world and he talks about this concept of unreasonable hospitality giving people way more than they expect. That is where great entrepreneurs differentiate from the mediocre ones. I think a lot of people think that entrepreneurship is about selling, selling, selling your dreams and ideas to prospective candidates who become employees of your company, but also prospective customers and partners. Very few people, I would say less than a percent of the people are really good at following through. They'll sell and they'll move on and they'll sell some more and they'll move on as opposed to selling and staying. I think that idea of unreasonable hospitality is what really creates the flywheel. When you go to a new customers, they hear from existing customers and that's how you reduce the friction. At the end of the day, there's two emotions going on in a new relationship. The fear of missing out, but also the fear of messing up. FOMO but also FOMO as we call it. And a lot of people think that they just need to create for more with prospects. But they don't realize that most customers, especially in B2B, I'm talking about B2B software, when you're really doing larger deals like $50, $100, $200,000. A lot of it is actually based on faux mean, which is fear of messing up. So building that critical relationship and providing that unreasonable hospitality and letting your existing customers speak of that unreasonable hospitality is the only way to blunt that emotion of fear of messing up. To me, entrepreneurship is about building that authenticity at every level of the way because the market is actually smarter than you think.</p>

一个单独的功能无法为我带来客户的 10 万美元。如何将这一切组织成一个强大的产品，将产品转化为一家公司，再将公司发展成一项业务？这才是创业的真正考验。从公司发展到业务，实际上是建立与客户的关系，确保在他们最需要帮助时，你不会让他们失望。我们成功的秘诀之一是“承诺不足，交付有余”，这是重复业务的核心。如果你的现有客户没有为你带来更多收入，那么你基本上只是在“销售后即走”，这意味着你需要不断地“寻找、寻找、寻找”新客户。而“狩猎”（新客户）与“耕耘”（从现有客户那里获得更多）之间的平衡，是构建大型企业的核心。杰夫·贝索斯称之为公司的“飞轮效应”。你需要增加新客户（新 Logo），同时也要从现有客户那里赚钱。我认为这真正考验着一家公司的实力。你是否有真实的产品？你是否有非常好的客户支持？最后，你是否有真正懂得“承诺不足，交付有余”的销售人员？我非常欣赏餐饮业人士威尔·格达拉（Will Gdara），他曾经营过两家世界闻名的餐厅，他提出了“非理性热情好客”的概念，即给予顾客远超他们预期的服务。这正是优秀创业者区别于平庸者的关键。我认为很多人认为创业就是不断地向潜在候选人（他们将成为你公司的员工）以及潜在客户和合作伙伴推销你的梦想和想法。极少数人，我认为不到 1% 的人，真正擅长“跟进”。他们会销售，然后离开，再销售，再离开，而不是销售后继续留守。我认为“非理性热情好客”的想法正是创造飞轮效应的关键。当你接触新客户时，他们会从现有客户那里听到你的口碑，这样你就减少了摩擦。归根结底，一段新关系中存在两种情绪：害怕错过（FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out），以及害怕搞砸（FOMO - Fear Of Messing Up）。很多人认为他们只需要与潜在客户进行更多的互动。但他们没有意识到，大多数客户，尤其是在 B2B 领域，我指的是 B2B 软件，当你进行 5 万、10 万、20 万美元这样的大型交易时，很大程度上是基于“害怕搞砸”（fear of messing up）的心理。因此，建立关键的客户关系，提供“非理性热情好客”，并让现有客户为你代言，是平息“害怕搞砸”情绪的唯一途径。对我而言，创业就是要在各个层面建立真实性，因为市场比你想象的要聪明得多。

### 颠覆性技术与消费模式的兴起

技术上的颠覆性创新是什么？我认为最大的颠覆者是“小型化”（miniaturization）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is disruptive in technology? The biggest disruptor to technology is miniaturization. Big things into small things. Literate sits in a pocket. No one on a desk. I mean, even the idea of infrastructure was like that. Oh, we buying things for 5 years. big metal monolithic purchases like just come and use the compute for 2 hours if that's what it takes for you when you make things smaller and lighter weight that is the biggest disruptor to incumbents SAS has become extremely heavyweight extremely complex in terms of implementation so the disruption that will happen is consumption we go from subscription to consumption and consumption models is what will disrupt subscription models remember subscription Subscription models disrupted licensing models of the last 20 years before that where people are buying 5 years enterprise license agreements we move to subscription we said hey you can pay by the user then slack comes in there you don't have to pay by the user you can pay by the monthly active user making it even more lightweight and a little bit more towards consumption snowflake coming in saying everything consumption based I think all SAS will probably become consumptionbased and that will disrupt legacy SAS</p>
</details>

大东西变成小东西。如今，智能手机（literate）可以放在口袋里，而不是放在桌子上。甚至基础设施的概念也是如此。过去，我们购买的是为期五年的、大型金属单体设备。而现在，如果你只需要使用计算资源两个小时，你就可以按需付费。当你把事物做得更小、更轻量化时，这就是对现有巨头的最大颠覆。软件即服务（SAS: Software as a Service，一种软件分发模式，其中第三方供应商托管应用程序并使其可供客户通过互联网使用）已经变得极其笨重，在实施方面极其复杂。因此，即将发生的颠覆是“消费”（consumption）。我们从“订阅”（subscription）模式转向“消费”模式，而消费模式将颠覆订阅模式。请记住，订阅模式颠覆了过去 20 年的许可模式，当时人们购买的是为期五年的企业许可协议。然后我们转向了订阅模式，我们说：“嘿，你可以按用户付费。”接着 Slack 出现了，你甚至不必按用户付费，可以按月活跃用户付费，这使得它更加轻量化，更偏向于消费。Snowflake 紧随其后，提出“一切都基于消费”。我认为所有 SAS 都可能变得基于消费，这将颠覆传统的 SAS。

### 惰性是最大的敌人

人们不应该做的最糟糕的决定是，长时间地“坐视不管”（sit on things）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the worst decision that people should not take is sit on things for too long. Sit on people who are not a good fit for too long. Bad products, unhappy customers, unhappy employees, mediocre leaders. So to me, sitting on the suboptimal thing for too long is the worst thing that can happen. It's the tyranny of mediocrity. not changing and do nothing. Which is exactly what you have to go and fight when you go and sell your new idea to customers because customers most comfortable thing is to do nothing. And your biggest competition is not that other idea, the other competitor. Your biggest competitor is inertia. And that is also the biggest enemy within a company. Do nothing. That's the worst thing uh an entrepreneur can do. That's the worst thing a company can do.</p>
</details>

长时间地容忍不合适的人，容忍糟糕的产品、不满意的客户、不快乐的员工、平庸的领导者。对我来说，长时间地维持次优状态是最糟糕的事情。这是“平庸的暴政”（tyranny of mediocrity）。不改变，什么都不做。这正是当你向客户推销新想法时必须与之斗争的。因为客户最舒适的选择就是“什么都不做”。而你最大的竞争对手不是那个其他的想法或竞争对手，你最大的竞争对手是“惰性”（inertia: 在此语境下，指企业或个人抵制改变、维持现状的倾向，是创业者面临的主要竞争对手之一）。惰性也是公司内部最大的敌人。“什么都不做”，这是创业者能做的最糟糕的事情，也是一家公司能做的最糟糕的事情。
