title: 团队沟通失效：NASA火星气候轨道探测器任务失败的启示
summary: 本文通过NASA火星气候轨道探测器任务的失败案例，揭示了团队沟通失效是导致任务失败的关键原因。团队成员之间的沟通不畅、信息不对称和隐性语言差异等因素，都可能导致团队决策的失误。

### 沟通失效：团队失败的根源

NASA于1999年9月23日发射的火星气候轨道探测器任务的失败，并非源于技术故障，而是团队内部沟通不畅导致的。探测器在进入火星大气层时解体，原因在于NASA和洛克希德·马丁公司在计算飞行路径时使用了不同的单位系统——NASA使用米制单位（牛顿），而洛克希德·马丁公司使用英制单位（磅）。由于双方未能及时沟通确认单位标准，导致计算结果偏差高达4.4倍，最终导致任务失败。这个案例揭示了一个深刻的道理：即使是高智商的工程师团队，也可能因为沟通失误而犯下低级错误。

What happened on September 23, 1999?
This is the day
that the Mars Climate Orbiter
went on a mission to Mars
and actually failed considerably.
This was this device
that NASA sent over to Mars.
It was designed
to measure the weather on Mars,
and also to serve
as this communication device
for the Mars Polar Lander,
which was supposed to arrive
a couple of months later.
It just completely failed.
It hit the atmosphere,
burst into a million pieces,
leaving the folks who worked at NASA
befuddled, upset, pretty pissed off.
These are not them.
You have to use your imagination
a little bit in this talk.
Now these things happen.
Sending things into space
is tricky business,
and quite frankly, as a psychologist,
who am I to judge
a bunch of very smart engineers
who work for NASA
for failing and having a bad day at work?
But what makes this story
extra special and super fascinating
from my perspective
is that the entire failure
comes down to one thing:
failed communication
between these team members,
and more specifically,
the people working on this project
were not talking to each other
about the right stuff at the right time.
It really is that simple.
So I'm going to break this down for you.
So it all started when they
had to calculate the flight path.
So any time you send something into space,
you have to tell it where to go.
And to do so you have to
calculate the flight path.
Now the folks working at NASA
for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
they calculated the flight path
using the metric system,
and so they had the newton
as their unit of force.
Those working at Lockheed Martin,
they were using the pound
as their unit of force.
When you're using
these two different systems,
the whole thing was off
by a factor of about 4.4.
Now at no point did the folks at NASA say,
"Hey guys, you're using
the newton as a unit of force, right?"
"No, guys. We were using the pound."
That conversation never actually happened.
And so we have our first
big communication mishap.
Two sets of teams failed
to communicate about basic information
that seemed pretty obvious to everybody.

### 隐藏信息与团队决策困境

心理学家通过“隐藏信息任务”（Hidden Profile Task）实验发现，团队在做决策时，往往会忽略掉关键的独特信息。实验中，团队成员各自掌握部分信息，只有一个人拥有关键的独特信息，但如果这个人没有主动分享，团队很可能做出错误的决策。研究表明，即使团队成员都致力于做出正确的选择，也常常会因为信息不对称而失败。这种现象在现实中普遍存在，团队成员往往无法准确判断彼此掌握的信息，导致关键信息被遗漏。

And just to put things into perspective,
imagine instead of sending
something into space,
these folks were making a cake.
And if I thought
I was using a pound of butter
and you thought we were using
a kilogram of butter --
that's about 2.2 pounds of butter --
your cake would end up
tasting pretty gross,
like this one looks here.
Now before we get too judgey about this --
it sounds pretty silly --
we do this all the time.
We walk into meetings.
You know, if we get lucky,
there's that annoying,
overly conscientious person
who says things like,
before we get started,
everyone, let's level set
and talk about, you know,
whether there's ink in the printer
at the newspaper we work
or whatever obvious thing
they want to get on the same page with.
And we usually
roll our eyes at this person
and we tell them to stop talking
because we want the meeting to end soon,
and we want to get on
to the important stuff.
And we say things like,
"We've done this a million times,
do we really need
to cover that kind of thing?"
And the answer is yes,
we should have that 22nd conversation
so that our probe does not explode
when it hits the atmosphere.
But we often do not do this.
Now the good news is this is NASA.
There is no single point of failure.
And so just because
you miscalculate your flight path
doesn't mean the whole mission
is going to actually end
in just a complete failure.
And so people started noticing
things were wrong.
And the good news is you can actually
recalculate a flight path.
So people started bringing this up
in various meetings,
and they even had a conference about it.
But then there was
a big mistake that happened.
Communication mishap number two.
The people holding
that critical information
were ignored for a very dumb reason
that I'm pretty sure everyone
in this room can recognize.
They did not fill out the right form.

### 隐性语言与沟通障碍

团队沟通中还存在着“隐性语言”的问题，即团队成员之间形成的特定术语、缩写或表达方式。虽然这些隐性语言可以提高团队效率和凝聚力，但对于不熟悉这些语言的人来说，却会造成沟通障碍和排斥感。即使团队成员都使用相同的语言，也可能因为隐性语言的差异而产生误解。为了避免沟通障碍，团队成员应该主动询问不理解的术语或表达方式，营造开放和包容的沟通氛围。

Now all of us know that if you send
an important message over Slack
and everybody was on email,
or over email and everybody was on Slack,
we just miss that critical information.
But we don't think that a failure
to fill out the right form
is going to be the difference
between our mission to Mars
failing and succeeding.
We think that critical information
will eventually make its way
to the important people at the top.
But often this is not the case.
We get very married to our processes,
and these can actually
be our Achilles heel
in really important
group decision-making contexts.
Things didn't end here.
There were actually some
last-ditch efforts to save this mission
that didn't go so well.
Someone got on the phone
with another person.
They sounded urgent about fixing it,
but that person didn't
actually recognize urgency.
I think the quote
was something around like,
"They didn't sound anxious enough",
and so they weren't taken seriously.
So this miscommunication
also worked around nonverbal behaviors,
tone of voice and so on and so forth.
So there's lots of ways
in which this mission went awry.
But I've been studying miscommunication
for over 20 years now,
and I have to say that
what actually happened at NASA
is much more the norm than the exception.
That even when people are making
really critical decisions,
they often fall flat on their faces,
and often for these very simple reasons.
And this is the case
even when we give people
every piece of information they need
to make the right choice.
