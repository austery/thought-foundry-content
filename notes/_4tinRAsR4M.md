### YouTube 平台挑战与创作者立场

本次视频是一次频道更新，博主首先告知频道会员，其 **YouTube 频道会员资格** 已被禁用，原因不明，但 YouTube 指出是 **AdSense 账户** 被暂停，尽管其 AdSense 仪表板显示一切正常。这一状况导致他无法再为会员制作专属内容。博主请求观众原谅视频可能略显粗糙，因为他是在发现会员功能被暂停后立即赶制此视频的。他声明并非寻求帮助或同情，问题最终会解决，且这并非世界末日，因为他 2025 年全年的 YouTube 总收入不足 6000 美元，明确表示并非为钱而制作视频。他坦言自己与广告生态系统并不契合，并认为 Google 作为一家广告技术与人工智能公司，他越是批评 **AI 炒作** 和 **广告技术 (AdTech)** 的问题，越有可能被踢出奖励计划，这或许是此次事件的原因，但他目前尚不清楚。博主表达了不希望被完全逐出平台的愿望，因为目前市场上真正试图客观讨论 **人工智能 (AI)** 和大型科技公司利弊的内容创作者不多，大多数要么是百分之百支持，要么是认为“毫无用处”。为应对潜在风险，他已在下方提供了免费的 **Patreon** 链接和一个已存在一段时间的免费**电子报 (newsletter)** 订阅链接，以确保在 YouTube 平台出现更严重问题时，仍能传播其信息。他坦承数月未更新电子报，但当前 YouTube 的状况已提升了其优先级。博主重申不愿成为依赖广告驱动的创作者，不喜欢广告技术对社会的负面影响，也不想加剧这一问题。

Hey folks, this is a channel update video, so
if you're not interested in that, feel free
to click away and hopefully come back for some
future video that
hopefully you'll find that more interesting.
First off, I need to let the channel members
know that YouTube is mad at me for some reason
and has disabled my channel memberships.
Not sure what's going on.
YouTube says my AdSense account is suspended,
but my AdSense dashboard says everything is
fine.
The result of that though is I can't make
videos just for members anymore to let you
folks know what's going on.
Also, please forgive me if this video is a
little rougher than normal.
I fast-tracked as soon as I found out I couldn't
let my members know that my access to memberships
have been suspended.
I'm not asking for help to fix it, I'm not
asking for sympathy, it'll probably get
fixed eventually, but it's not at the end of
the world.
My total earnings from YouTube for all of 2025
was less than 6 grand, so I'm definitely
not making videos for the money.
And to be honest, I'm not a good fit for the
whole advertising ecosystem anyway.
Google is an Advertising Technology and an AI
company, and the more I push back on AI
hype and the more I talk about the problems
with AdTech, the more likely I am to get kicked
out of the rewards program anyway, which might
have actually been what caused this,
but right now I haven't a clue.
I do hope that I don't get completely kicked
off the platform though.
There aren't very many of us that are trying to
make content that tries to be realistic
about the pros and cons of AI and big tech right
now.
Most everybody is either 100% all-in hype or
100% "this stuff is useless".
Just in case though, I've created a free
Patreon link below, and I have a free
newsletter
I've had for a while that you can subscribe to
the link below for that,
So I'll have some way of trying to get my message
out in the event that YouTube gets even more
mad at me.
Full disclosure though, I haven't published
anything to the newsletter in a few months,
although with how YouTube is acting up right now
that certainly bumps that up in priority.
I don't really want to be an ad-fueled creator
anyway though.
I don't like the impact that Advertising
Technology is having on society, and I don't
really
want to contribute to that problem.

### 开发者创业课的缘起与核心理念

博主指出，当前是开发者面临挑战的时期，尽管不如互联网泡沫破灭时严峻，但他预计当 **AI 泡沫** 破裂时，情况会变得更糟。他希望能在此过程中提供帮助。一年多来，他一直在构思一门面向开发者的课程，旨在帮助他们学习如何创办自己的企业。尽管曾因“死胡同般的骗局”而耽误了时间，但他确实一直在推进此事，并已准备好课程大纲，希望获得反馈。在详细介绍课程内容前，他首先分享了一个至关重要的免费建议：在构建任何事物时，务必先解决问题的最小化版本，使其运行起来，再在此基础上发展。试图承担过多会大大降低成功的几率。这一点同样适用于软件产品和软件课程的开发。因此，他将从一个特定受众开始，待其成功后再扩展，并为此可能无法纳入首批受众的学员表示歉意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's a rough time to be a developer right now,
although it's still not as bad as the
dot-com crash, and I expect that when the AI
bubble pops, it's going to get a lot worse
for a while before it gets better. I really
want to try to help with that.
I've been talking for a year or so now about
creating a class for developers to figure
out how to start their own business.
Believe it or not, I actually really have been
working on that.
I got sidetracked into a dead end rip-off and
lost quite a bit of time, made a video
on that one, but I have been working on it, and
I even have an outline of it ready, and
I would love to get your feedback about it.
Let me first tell you what the class is not, so
those of you that aren't interested can
not waste any more of your time.
The first, let me start with a quick, free
piece of advice that far too few people
understand.
When you're building things, it's vitally
important to first solve the smallest version
of the problem that you can, get that out in
the world and running, and then build upon
that success. Biting off any more than the
minimum that you can greatly reduces your
chance of succeeding.
This is true for building a software product,
and it's also true for building a software
curriculum, so I'm starting with a specific
audience, and then, once I get that working,
I'm going to expand on that, which means that
some of you unfortunately won't be in
the first audience, and I'm sorry about that.

### 课程定位：明确的边界与限制

首先，这门课程**不会教授编程本身**。如果观众尚未熟练掌握编程，该课程将无法提供帮助，它也不是一门“用 AI 编程”的课程，尽管 AI 会在一定程度上被提及。其次，至少在初期，本课程**不面向刚毕业或刚完成训练营、缺乏行业经验的早期职业人士**。如果观众刚离开学校或训练营，正在寻找工作，那么这门课程目前可能不适合。博主计划在课程成功运行并证明其价值后，推出一个面向早期职业人士的扩展版本。但眼下，试图同时涵盖独立软件创作者和进入编程劳动力市场的内容，将导致两方面都无法做好。一旦他确信已摸清资深从业者的需求，便可在此基础上添加其他内容，但同时处理所有问题是失败的根源。

此外，博主只能教授他所了解的内容，这意味着课程将**仅限英文授课**，且他只能从**美国本土**的角度讨论商业问题，无法为美国以外的观众提供具体指导。他没有视频游戏行业的从业经验，因此无法提供相关帮助。他也不是律师、会计师或财务顾问，不能提供法律或财务建议，但他会分享自己的经验和教训，并推荐相关领域的专家书籍。

博主强调，这**不是一个快速致富的计划**。独立自主并非易事，他本人已在其中摸索了约 20 年。他承认，独立经营产品会极大地提升编程能力，并提供学习难以获得的技能，这是一种宝贵的职业工具。但如果目标是轻松赚钱，这门课程并非最佳选择。

<summary>Original English</summary>

So first off, this class isn't going to teach
programming itself.
If you're not already comfortable programming,
this isn't going to help you, and this isn't
going to be a programming with AI class either,
although I'll talk about AI at some level.
More about that later in the video.
Secondly, this class is, at least to start with,
not for early career people that haven't spent
a couple of years at least working in the
industry already.
If you just got out of school or you're just
out of a bootcamp or something and you're
looking for a job, unfortunately, this isn't
for you.
That said, once I get this class running and I
feel like it's been useful to people, then
I intend to make an extended version of that
class that's intended for early career people.
But right now, if I try to make a class both
about being an independent software creator
and a class about entering the programming
workforce at the same time, I wouldn't do
a good job of either.
Once I'm confident I figured out what the later
career folks need, then I can add the
other stuff on top of that, but trying to do
all of that at once is a recipe for failure.
So next, I can only teach what I know, which
means I can only teach in English, and I don't
know any other languages well enough to teach
in them.
I can only talk about business issues from
inside the United States because that's where
I am.
I'm not going to stop you from taking the class
if you're outside the U.S., but I'm
not going to be able to help you with the way
that things work outside the U.S.
I haven't worked in the video game industry, so
I can't help with that.
I'm not a lawyer, an accountant, or a financial
advisor.
I can't give you legal or financial advice.
I can and will tell you what I have done and
what has worked for me and what hasn't
worked for me.
And I'll recommend books from experts outside
my field for things like legal issues.
If you choose to take advice from those books,
then that's up to you.
Next, I want to be clear that this isn't a get-rich-quick
thing.
Being on your own is not the easiest path.
I've done it on and off for 20 years or so.
There are times I like it.
There are times I don't want to deal with it,
and I just take a normal job, and there
are times that I don't want to do my own thing
at all, but I have to because I just don't
have the option of being an employee for one
reason or other.
I will tell you that building and running your
own product will absolutely make you a
better programmer, and it will give you an
opportunity to learn skills that are hard to
acquire otherwise.
I will also tell you that once you've learned
how to build your own business, you can always
do that again if you need to later in your
career, so it's a great tool to have
in your toolbox. But if you're looking for an
easy way to make money, this isn't it.

### 价值主张：面向未来的常青技能

博主强调，课程将侧重于**更高层次、更具常青价值的内容**，而非纠缠于当前的技术细节。例如，关于 **AI** 的讨论将主要围绕如何评估和使用编程生产力工具（无论是 AI 还是其他技术），目标是教会学员如何在技术变革中导航行业，而不是教授如何使用某个特定工具。这样，当新一代 **LLM**（大型语言模型）出现时，所学内容也不会立即过时。他会分享自己如何使用 AI，并尽力回答大家的问题，有时可能需要额外研究。他承诺尽可能广泛且以常青内容的形式回答问题，希望课程内容能为学员的整个职业生涯服务。

最后，这门**首期课程仅面向那些积极计划边学边实践项目**的学员。博主不需要学员全职投入或在课程结束前完成项目，但他需要学员在课程进行期间提供关于课程本身的反馈。如果学员只想被动学习而不打算实践，他建议等到第一批学员反馈被采纳后再参加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Next I want you to know that, at least during
the lectures, I'm going to try to focus on
higher level, more evergreen content rather
than getting in the weeds of what's going
on in the current moment.
For example, I'll be talking about AI off and
on, but I'll primarily be talking about
AI in the context of how to evaluate and use
programming productivity tools, whether they're
AI or other things.
The goal here is to teach you how to navigate
the industry as technology changes, not teach
you exactly how to use claude code versus 4.5 or
whatever.
That way next month when the new Gemini or the
new chatGPT or the new thing past
LLMs comes out, and it's way better than what
we've got now, what you learn in class won't
be outdated immediately.
I'll talk about how I'm using AI, of course, if
people want, and I'll answer whatever questions
people have to the best of my ability.
Sometimes that might mean I have to go off and
do some research and come back to you.
If so, I will.
Even if those questions are down in the weeds,
but I'm going to try to answer as many of
the questions as I can in as widely an
applicable manner as I can and as an evergreen
content
as I can.
So hopefully this is a class that will teach
you things that will serve you for the rest
of your career, not just for the next year or
two.
That's the hope at least.
Lastly, this first class is only for folks that
are actively planning on working on a
project kind of as we go.
I don't need you to be working on it full-time,
I don't expect you to be done by the time
the class is over, but I need feedback on the
class as I teach it.
So if you only want to take the class passively
and not try to apply any of it during the
weeks that the class is being taught, I'd ask
that you wait to take the class until
after I've gotten and incorporated the feedback
from the first set of people taking it.

### 课程结构与交付模式

课程计划为期六到八周，博主初步计划为六周，但预计会根据学员反馈进行调整，可能需要更深入地讲解某些假设大家已知但实际需要包含的内容，从而将课程延长至八周或更久。每周将安排两次大致相同的、时长约一小时的课程。时间安排上，会尽量覆盖一个工作日和一个周末或晚间时段，学员可选择参加任一或两个时段。所有课程都将录制并提供给学员，以便回顾、观看其他时段或补课。

此外，每周还将安排两次**办公时间 (office hours)** 或开放式问答 (Q&A) 环节，同样会提前安排，可能包含一个工作时间段和一个晚间/周末时段。这些环节将是自由形式的，博主会尽力回答所有问题，无论是否直接与课程内容相关。这些问答环节也会被录制。

课程还将设立一个**社区聊天论坛**，供学员交流和提问。该平台不会是 Discord，而是一个专门的在线学习平台，目前倾向于 **Circle.SO**，但尚未最终确定。社区将持续到课程结束后，博主也计划在课程结束后继续提供办公时间和问答环节，只要仍有学员参与。

课程将收取一次性费用，该费用包含在线社区的访问权限。同时，将提供退款机制，允许学员在认为课程不值时获得退款，但需扣除支付网络收取的手续费。博主希望课程能真正帮助到学员，避免让他们感觉被欺骗或钱花得不值。课程的具体费用将在与潜在学员沟通后设定，并在开课前公布。

<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay, so let's talk about the class structure.
My current plan is for a six to eight, maybe a
little more week class.
I'm planning on six, but I'm expecting that as
I get feedback from people in the classes
I go, I'll end up realizing that there are
things that I assumed most people would know,
but that need to be part of the class.
And I expect I'll adjust the curriculum as we
go.
It might be things I need to go deeper in, we'll
just see.
That might stretch the class out to eight weeks
or maybe even more.
I'm planning on two mostly identical hour-ish
long class sessions each week at two different
times, probably one during the workday and one
on the weekend or on an evening.
Students can attend either session or both, and
the classes will all be recorded, they
will be made available to all the people taking
the class.
So you can refer back to what happened in the
class after it's over, or you can watch
another session of the class, or you can catch
up in the event that something prevented you
from attending class that week.
I'm also planning on having two sessions of
office hours or open Q&A each week.
They'll be scheduled beforehand, again,
probably one during business hours and one on
an evening
or a weekend.
They'll be free form.
I'll do my best to answer whatever questions
anyone has, whether they're directly related
to the curriculum or not.
Again, they'll be recorded for any student to
watch that once too.
There's going to be a community chat forum
service thing where folks can talk amongst
each other and ask me questions.
It won't be discord.
I don't like discord.
It'll be a dedicated online learning platform.
I'm kind of leaning towards Circle.SO at the
moment, but that hasn't been finalized yet.
The community will continue after the class is
complete, and I plan on continuing to hold
office hours in Q&A after the classes
themselves are all done, at least for as long
as people
are still showing up to the Q&A's with
questions.
There will be a single up front charge for the
class, which also grants access to the
online community.
There will be a process where, as you don't
think the class is worth it, you can get your
money refunded, except for whatever financial
transaction fees were extracted by the payment
network company.
I want this to be useful to people, and I don't
want you to feel like you're being ripped
off.
And if you're not getting anything out of it, I
don't want you to feel like I took your
money for something that you don't want.
I don't know what the cost is going to be.
That will be set after I've had a chance to
talk with some of you - more on that in a minute.
But I'll put the cost out before the class
starts so everybody will know what they're
signing up for.

### 课程大纲：六大核心模块

课程内容（草案，可能调整顺序或增加主题）将涵盖以下六个主要模块：

*   **第一课：职业规划** - 探讨如何应对技术变革的浪潮，判断何时成为雇员、顾问或小型软件服务提供商更优，以及原因。内容包括如何在技术变革中生存，如何选择适合自己的业务类型，以及如何构思和确定首先要构建的产品。
*   **第二课：最小可行产品 (MVP) 的定义与决策** - 重点在于如何定义和确定一个最小可行产品，并深入探讨订阅模式、免费版与付费版、不同层级、追加销售等策略。
*   **第三课：MVP 的落地实施** - 涵盖选择编程语言、框架、安全措施、持续集成/持续交付 (CI/CD)、云服务提供商、用户数据库、加密、前端、后端、数据库、批处理、计算服务器以及成本控制等技术细节。
*   **第四课：必要的客户触点准备** - 涉及域名、营销、网站建设、市场兴趣评估、社交媒体运用、A/B 测试、寻找目标受众、客户服务等面向客户的环节。
*   **第五课：业务与幕后运作** - 关注财务、基础会计、基础税务、基础公司结构，以及如何与律师、会计师等专业人士合作。
*   **第六课：扩展与规模化** - 讨论自动化测试、日志记录、调试与故障排除、构建可维护性、监控、优雅地失败、添加新功能，以及根据市场变化调整产品方向等扩展性议题。

博主提醒，课程时间有限，无法涵盖所有细节，它并非一个编码训练营。课程将侧重于他“用血泪换来的经验”，填补现有资源之间的空白。对于更基础的内容，他会推荐其他资源。例如，在讨论数据存储时，他会分析 SQL 数据库、对象数据库、直接序列化、文件存储检索、对象关系映射器 (ORM) 和缓存等的优缺点，并解答疑问，但不会教授 SQL 本身，而是推荐相关书籍。同样，他会讨论 Go、Rust、Python、TypeScript 等语言的优缺点，但具体的语言教程需学员自行通过课外资源学习。他预计每位学员都会有自己独特的语言、框架和云服务组合。

<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay.
So let's talk about what's in the class.
Note that this is a draft in a subject to reordering
additions, et cetera, although everything
in these sessions will be in the class, the
grouping might be rearranged, or it might
change.
I might get other topics added.
It's possible, especially after people ask
questions, that some of these topics might
get expanded beyond the length of the session
for that week, in which case things will need
to get rearranged, potentially with the
addition of another week of sessions to the
schedule.
Session one is about career planning, riding
the waves of technology changes, how to decide
when it's better time to be an employee or a
consultant or a small software service provider,
and why.
How to survive as technology changes, how to
decide what kind of business is a good fit
for you, how to pick an idea and decide what
you want to build, at least what you want to
build first.
Session two is on specifying and deciding on a
minimum viable product, how to think about
subscriptions, free versions, paid versions,
tiers, upselling, all that kind of stuff.
And three is about getting an MVP up and
running, so picking programming languages,
framework,
security, continuous integration, continuous
delivery, cloud providers, user databases,
encryption, front end, back end, databases,
batch processing, compute server, controlling
costs, all that kind of stuff.
Session four is about necessary customer-facing
collateral, so domain names, marketing,
websites,
gauging interest, social media, A/B testing,
finding your audience, customer service, all
that kind of stuff.
And five is about business and behind-the-scenes
work, so finances, basic accounting, basic
taxes, basic corporate structures, window-engaged
professionals like lawyers' accountants, that
kind of thing.
And then session six is about expanding and
scaling tech stuff, automating testing, logging,
debugging troubleshooting, building for
maintainability, monitoring, failing gracefully,
adding new
features, pivoting product direction as things
change, that kind of stuff.
Note that not everything you might possibly
want to know about these topics can be covered
in the time allotted, this isn't a coding bootcamp.
In class, I'm going to be covering the lessons
I learned the hard way, the things that fit
in the gaps between the other resources.
For things that are more straightforward, I'll
be recommending other resources, books,
videos, that kind of thing.
So for example, when I talk about data storage
in class, I'll talk about the pros and cons
of SQL databases, object databases, direct
serialization, file storage retrieval, object
relational mappers, caching, et cetera.
And I'll answer any questions folks have, but
instead of trying to teach SQL itself,
I'm going to point you at a Joe Celko book, I'll
probably talk about pros and cons of
programming in Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, et
cetera, but when it comes to questions
about how to use those particular languages,
then I'll expect you to make use of books
and tutorials and stuff outside of class.
I'll answer questions if you have them, but I'm
not going to do tutorials on every single
language.
And I expect that pretty much everybody is
going to have their own unique little version
of the combination of frameworks and languages
and cloud hosts and all that kind of stuff.

Okay.
So if that doesn't sound like something you're
interested in, thanks for watching this far.
But if it does sound like something you'd be
interested in, I'd like to hear from you
because I'm only assuming this is a class that
people would find valuable and that creating
and teaching it would be worth the effort.
And before I commit to the time, it's going to
take to do it, I need to find out if that
assumption is correct.
So if this is the kind of class you'd
potentially be interested in, I would
appreciate it if
you'd go to this link on the screen or down
below, fill out a form, let me know what you
think about the description I just gave you.
The things I want to know the most are how much
do you think such a class would be worth
to you? is there anything you think that you'd
want to learn such a class that's missing
from what I described in the video?
Is there anything I described as being in the
class that you think doesn't belong?
Is there anything in the description that's
unclear or there are other questions or
feedback
that you have?
At the end of the survey, if you have other
feedback, there will place where you can type
stuff in, and if you wish, you can even
schedule a free Zoom call with me to discuss it
further.
So thanks for watching this far.
I hope to hear from you.
Let's be careful out there.
Take care.
