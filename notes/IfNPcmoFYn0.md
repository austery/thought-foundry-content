### 海军生涯与领导力启蒙

**Ryland Hamilton**: 刚大学毕业，我就加入了海军。我曾在太平洋和大西洋的舰船上服役。20年前我所在的海军拥有世界上最强大的海军力量，几乎没有真正的竞争对手。但当我刚上舰时，负责一个部门，我其实并不是一个优秀的领导者。在海军，你无法选择你的下属。海军会说：“这是你的团队，你必须尽力发挥他们的作用。”所以，你随着时间学会的是，你必须了解人们的动机，理解他们，关心他们。如果你不理解人，你就无法理解他们的动机，也就无法完成你的任务，一切都会因此而瓦解。

**Ryland Hamilton**: Right out of college, I joined the Navy. So, I was on ships in the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy that I was in 20 years ago, we had the world's most powerful Navy. And there's really no pure competitor. But when I first was on a ship in the Navy, and I was in charge of a division, I actually wasn't a great leader. In the Navy, you don't get to choose the people that are working for you. The Navy basically says, "This is your team, and you've got to make the best out of them." And so what you learn over time is you have to learn what motivates people and you have to understand people and you have to care about people and if you don't understand people then you can't understand what motivates them and then you can't get your mission your job done and then everything kind of unravels from there.

**Ryland Hamilton**: 我在海军学到的领导力是“**领头羊式领导**”（leading from the front）。当我还是海军的一名初级军官时，有一种叫做“**甲板领导力**”（deck plate leadership）的概念，意思是必须和你的士兵、你的团队一起在甲板上，帮助他们解决问题，而不是让他们向你汇报。你是一个团队的一份子，帮助他们解决手头的问题。有时这意味着要在发动机舱里花几个小时排除故障。有时我们会遇到海上失去转向能力、断电、进水、火灾等各种问题，需要我们去解决。但当你的团队看到你和他们一起站在这里，耐心等待，理解他们面临的问题，并理解你能帮助扫除哪些障碍时，你就能赢得他们的信任。

**Ryland Hamilton**: What I learned in the Navy about leadership is leading from the front. When I was a junior officer in the Navy there's this sort of concept of deck plate leadership is that you have to be on the deck plates with your sailors and with your team and trying to help them solve the issue that you're not someone who that they report to. You're someone who's part of a team that's helping them solve the problem at hand. And sometimes that meant spending hours in an engine room trying to troubleshoot through an issue. Sometimes we would lose steering at sea. We'd lose power. We'd have flooding. We'd have fires. We had many different issues that we'd have to work through. But when your team saw that you were the person, you're standing in there, you're waiting with them, you're being patient, and you understood the problems that they were facing, and you understood any barriers that you could help remove, you would then get their trust.

### 创业历程：从海军到自主船舶

**Ryland Hamilton**: 我叫 Ryland Hamilton，是 **Blue Water Autonomy** 的 CEO 兼联合创始人。我们的第一个客户是 **美国海军**。我们正在设计和建造**自主船舶**。我们的重点是 **美国海军**，为海军建造未来的军舰。刚大学毕业，我就加入了海军，曾在太平洋和大西洋的舰船上服役。我们曾在北方湾区搜寻水雷，船上的瞭望员 24/7 全天候观察，寻找任何可能漂浮的水雷。海军中有许多高风险任务可以通过自主系统来完成。一艘载有 400 名船员的船不应该去搜寻水雷，更不应该有人拿着望远镜在船头值守。至今，我们已经成功下水了一艘我们称之为“自主测试艇”的 145 吨级船只，就在波士顿附近，我们正在那里测试我们的技术。**Google Ventures** 和我们现有的投资者向我们公司注资 5000 万美元，这极大地加速了我们的发展。

**Ryland Hamilton**: My name is Ryland Hamilton. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Blue Water Autonomy. Our first customer is the US Navy. We're designing and building autonomous ships. Our focus is on the US Navy and building future warships for the Navy. Right out of college, I joined the Navy. I was on ships in the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. We were up in the Northern Gulf and we were looking for mines. In fact, we'd have lookouts on the front of the ship 24/7 looking for any mines that could be floating. There are a lot of really risky missions in the Navy that could be done by autonomous systems. There's no reason that a ship with 400 sailors on it should be hunting for mines, including having people with binoculars on the front of that ship. And to date, we've actually launched what we call our autonomous test vessel, which is a 145 ton vessel just outside of Boston where we're already testing our technology. Google Ventures and our existing investors put $50 million into our company which really helps turbocharge what we're doing.

**Ryland Hamilton**: 我在大学时经历了 **9/11** 事件，那无疑是一个让每个人都为之震动的时刻，让人思考“我人生真正想做什么？”。那时，大学毕业后的传统选择是进入咨询业或投资银行业等专业服务领域。但我渴望做些不同的事情。我不是那种适合朝九晚五坐在办公桌前工作的人。我想起我的家人曾在海军服役，我父亲曾在海军学院就读，并在 60 年代服役于核潜艇部队。我的两位叔叔也曾在海军服役。于是，我想知道海军生涯会是怎样的？我加入了海军，这是我做过的最好的决定之一。我们曾在北方湾区搜寻水雷，船上的瞭望员 24/7 全天候观察，寻找任何可能漂浮的水雷。我在海军最难忘的经历之一，大概是我第一次真正登上海军舰艇，航行在开阔的海洋上。我加入的是一艘两栖运输舰，当时它在波斯湾。但为了登上那艘船，我必须先乘坐直升机，然后去一艘航空母舰。就在我待在那艘航空母舰上等待转运到我的舰艇时，伊朗发射了一些试验性导弹。当时海军并不知道这些是否是试验导弹，直到整艘舰艇进入一级战备状态。而我，虽然了解海军，但因为我之前曾在中东旅行，还穿着便服。我身处一艘即将进入一级战备状态的舰艇上，却不知道该去哪里。我只能在楼梯间上下奔跑，这时有人抓住我，说：“你看起来像不知道该做什么，进来这里等一下。”那是我登上海军舰艇后的第一个小时。但我想，这个经历告诉我，要时刻保持警惕，任何事情都可能随时发生。有计划很重要，但同样重要的是要明白计划永远不会完全按预期实现。

**Ryland Hamilton**: When I was in college, 9/11 happened and it definitely was a moment that kind of I think shook everyone and said, "What do you really want to do with your life?" And at that point, the traditional jobs coming out of college were to go into consulting or into investment banking and professional service careers. But I wanted to do something different. And I'm not the type of person who's well suited to be behind a desk from 9 to 5. And I was like, "Oh, well, my family had been in the Navy. My father actually went to the Naval Academy and served on nuclear submarines in the '60s. I had two uncles who also served in the Navy. So, I wonder what a career in the Navy would be like." And I joined the Navy, which was one of the best decisions I've ever made. We were up in the Northern Gulf and we were looking for mines. In fact, we'd have lookouts on the front of the ship 24/7 looking for any mines that could be floating. One of the most memorable experiences I had in the Navy was probably the first time I actually was on a naval ship out sort of in the, you know, open ocean. And I joined an amphibious transport ship. It was actually in the Persian Gulf when I met it. But in order to get to that ship, I had to fly in a helicopter and actually go to sort of an aircraft carrier first. And while I was on that aircraft carrier waiting to get transported to my ship, Iran actually fired some test missiles. Now, the Navy at the time didn't know if those were test missiles until the whole ship went to general quarters, but here I was knew the Navy and because I had actually been traveling in the Middle East, I was still in my civilian clothes. So, I was on a ship, the ship was going to general quarters, and I didn't even know where to go. And so, I was just running up and down staircases, and someone grabbed me and said, "You look like you don't know what you're doing. Come in here and kind of wait." And so, that was like my first like hour on a naval ship. But, I think that lesson told me it's like, you know, be aware anything can happen at any moment. It's important to have a plan, but then it's also important to understand that plan will never actually materialize exactly as you expected.

**Ryland Hamilton**: 在海军，你无法选择你的团队。海军会直接分配给你一个团队，你必须尽力发挥他们的作用。当我第一次在海军的舰船上负责一个部门时，我其实不是一个优秀的领导者。所以，你随着时间学会的是，你必须了解人们的动机，理解他们，关心他们。如果你不理解人，你就无法理解他们的动机，也就无法完成你的任务，一切都会因此而瓦解。当我刚加入海军时，我想的是，我要做这份工作，因为每个人都关心任务和美国。但实际上，归根结底，人们更关心的是，尤其是在港口时，他们会说：“长官，我只想下午 3 点回家。”所以，如果我们的部门能完成所有任务，我们就能在下午 3 点回家，这对我很重要，因为家里有妻子、孩子，还有很多其他事情。所以，当我们回到港口时，工作与生活的平衡对我来说真的很重要。我花了很长时间才意识到这一点。然后我说：“好吧，当他来上班时，让我们专注于完成任务，让每个人都能回家。”然后，当人们回家后，他们会说：“嘿，我现在有动力了。”所以，在海军中，真正重要的是理解人，理解他们的动机。这在我刚加入海军时并不是显而易见的。我在海军学到的领导力是“领头羊式领导”。当我是一名初级军官时，有一种“甲板领导力”的概念，就是你必须和你的士兵、你的团队一起在甲板上，帮助他们解决问题。你不是他们汇报的对象，而是团队的一员，帮助他们解决手头的问题。有时这意味着要在发动机舱里花几个小时排除故障。有时我们会遇到海上失去转向能力、断电、进水、火灾等各种问题，需要我们去解决。但当你的团队看到你和他们一起站在这里，耐心等待，理解他们面临的问题，并理解你能帮助扫除哪些障碍时，你就能赢得他们的信任。

**Ryland Hamilton**: And one of the things is when you're in the Navy, you don't get to choose. You basically hire the people that are working for you. The Navy basically says this is your team and you've got to make the best out of them. When I first was on a ship in the Navy and I was in charge of a division, I actually wasn't a great leader. And so, what you learn over time is you have to learn what motivates people and you have to understand people and you have to care about people. And if you don't understand people, then you can't understand what motivates them and then you can't get your mission your job done. And then everything kind of unravels from there. And so when I first joined the Navy, I was like, let's do this job because everyone cares about the mission and America. But at the end of the day, actually what people cared about, especially when you're in port, is they're like, "Hey sir, I just want to go home at 3 PM." So if our division can get all of our tasks done and we can go home at 3 PM, that's what matters to me because at home I have a wife, I have kids, I have a lot of other stuff going on. And so when we're back at port, like it really matters for me to have this kind of balance between my work and my life. And I realized that over time. And then I said, "All right, when he showed up to at work, let's focus on getting the mission done and let's get everyone home." And then when you got people home, they were like, "Hey, I'm motivated now." And so it's really like when you're in the Navy about understanding people, what motivates them. And that's not something that was innately obvious to me when I first uh joined the Navy. What I learned in the Navy about leadership is leading from the front. When I was a junior officer in the Navy, there's this sort of concept of deck plate leadership is that you have to be on the deck plates with your sailors and with your team and trying to help them solve the issue.

**Ryland Hamilton**: 我有四年的服役经历，体验很棒。退役后，我去了研究生院，然后转向了仓储自动化领域。我很幸运，加入了一家名为 **KA systems** 的公司。那是在 2011 年，当时市面上有几千台机器人。几年后，**Amazon** 收购了 **KA systems**，并将其发展成了我们现在所说的 **Amazon robotics**，如今全球亚马逊仓库里有超过一百万台机器人。我在 **Amazon robotics** 的经历，虽然不是“甲板领导力”，更像是仓库里的“混凝土地面领导力”，在那里你花大量时间与团队一起在全美国乃至全球的仓库里，与团队一起调试各种系统。你亲身参与其中，四处奔波，在仓库里花费时间，这确实向团队表明了你的关心，团队也会因此做出积极回应。这些都是我随着时间学到的东西。在海军，我们有“**使命执念**”（mission obsession），我们清楚使命是什么，并会不惜一切代价去完成。当我转到 **KA systems** 时，一切都变成了“**客户至上**”（customer obsession）。我在 **KA** 的职责是项目经理，销售团队会花费数月甚至数年时间处理一笔交易，让客户签署合同，合同中会规定如果我们达到某些目标或里程碑，客户将支付相应金额。我的工作就是达成这些里程碑，其中之一就是让客户接受系统。这需要大量的跨部门协作。但其中一部分就是不惜一切代价完成交易，让客户满意。有时这意味着要前往内华达州偏远地区的仓库，并试图说服某人从街上铺设光纤到仓库的数据机房。有时这意味着要说：“嘿，我现在付你 100 美元现金。我不知道这是否能激励你，但你只需要尽力而为。我们必须秉持客户至上的理念，跳出框框思考如何才能完成工作。”对我来说，**初创公司**一直是一个充满激情的项目。这可能不是平衡工作与个人生活的最佳方式。我不推荐创业，但如果你想找到一份让你每天都充满热情、热爱你的工作、热爱你的客户的事情，那么没有什么比全身心投入一家初创公司更棒的了。

**Ryland Hamilton**: I had a great experience served for four years and then when I got out I went to graduate school and I transitioned into warehouse automation and I got lucky and I joined a company that was called KA systems. It was back in 2011 when there are a couple thousand robots in the field. And after a couple years, Amazon came in and actually bought KA systems and made KA systems into what we now call Amazon robotics where there now over a million robots all throughout the world in Amazon warehouses. You know, my experience in Amazon robotics where it wasn't deck plate leadership, it was more like concrete floor leadership in a warehouse where you're spending a lot of time with the team in warehouses all throughout the United States and the world. and you're with your team when you're trying to commission these different systems and you were there. You're traveling, you're spending the time in the warehouse, it really showed the team that you cared and the team would kind of respond well to that. So those are definitely things that I've learned over time. And the other piece is in the Navy, we definitely had sort of mission obsession where we knew what the mission was and we had obsessed and just complete it at all costs. When I transitioned to KA systems, it was all about customer obsession. My responsibility at KA in my job was to be a program manager, a sales team who would basically spend months or years kind of working through a deal and they'd get a customer to sign a contract and the contract would say we are willing to pay this amount if you hit these different sort of objectives or different milestones. And so my job was to hit those milestones and one of them was to get the customer to accept the system. And so there was a ton of crossunctional work that had to happen but part of that was to really just do whatever it would take to kind of get the deal done and to make the customer happy. Sometimes I would mean traveling to warehouses in remote parts of Nevada and actually trying to convince someone to go run a fiber line from the street into the warehouse into the data room. And sometimes that would mean saying, "Hey, I'll pay you a hundred bucks right now in cash. I don't know if that will incent you, but you just do whatever it takes. Just we just have this customer obsession and be like think outside the box about what it would take to actually get the job done." For me, startups have always been a passion project. It's probably not the best way to kind of like a balance between your work and your personal life. I wouldn't recommend startups, but if you want to find something where you show up every day and it's the best job in the world and you love what you're doing, you love your customers, then there's nothing better than getting obsessed over a startup.

</details>

**Ryland Hamilton**: 我将我在仓储自动化领域的经验带到了实践中，与 **Amazon Robotics** 的几位同事一起创办了一家名为 **Six Rover Systems** 的公司，我们制造协作式自主移动机器人，也就是仓库里的自动驾驶车辆。我们创造了一种新型自动化，几年后将其出售给了 **Amazon** 的竞争对手 **Shopify**。离开 **Six River Systems** 时，我深以为然 **Jensen**（**Nvidia** 的 CEO）的建议，他可能不会再创办另一家公司，因为这实在太难了。但我发现自己还是渴望做些事情。我喜欢解决难题。如果问题简单或者路径容易，对我来说就没什么意思。所以，我认为在我整个职业生涯中，我可能更多地选择了艰难的道路而非轻松的道路。很多人都可以选择轻松的路，但解决难题，尤其是与团队一起解决，所带来的满足感是惊人的。我有一段时间可以自由探索。我研究了许多不同的领域。我认识一个人曾在 **Androl** 工作，这是一家非常出色的国防科技初创公司。我当时意识到，你确实可以创办一家公司，然后将其产品销售给国防市场。这在我十几二十年前考虑不同创业机会时，并不是一个我曾有的概念或框架。但我开始探索，在决定创办一家公司之前，我说：“让我先多了解这个领域。”我努力让自己深入了解国防和海军领域的机遇。令人惊叹的是，如果我只局限于我最初的想法，我今天就不会站在这里。但我保持开放的心态，努力吸收尽可能多的信息，让自己对机遇有深刻的认识。20 年前我服役的海军是世界上最强大的，几乎没有真正的竞争对手。但今天，放眼全球，**中国**建造了世界上一半的船舶。

**Ryland Hamilton**: I took that experience from being sort of in warehouse automation and actually started a company with some other people from Amazon Robotics, company called Six Rover Systems, and we made collaborative autonomous mobile robots. to basically self-driving vehicles in warehouses and we created a new form of automation and we sold that a couple years later to Amazon's competitor Shopify. When I left Six River Systems, I really take Jensen's advice at Nvidia to heart that he probably wouldn't go back and start another company because it is so hard. But I found myself kind of itching to do something. I like taking a hard problem and solving it. And if it's an easy problem or an easy path, it's just not interesting to me. So I think throughout my career I've probably taken the hard path more often that have taken the easy path. Many other people can take the easy path. But it's the hard problems that where if you solve them or if you solve them with a team the gratification that comes from solving hard problems is amazing. I had a a period of time to just go explore. I was looking into a lot of different verticals. I knew someone who actually worked at Androl which is a really impressive defense tech startup. And I realized at the time that like you can actually start a company and then sell into the defense market. And that wasn't sort of a concept or framework that I had 10 or 20 years ago when I was thinking about different sort of startup opportunities.

### 应对地缘政治挑战与自主化未来

**Ryland Hamilton**: **中国**拥有超过美国 230 倍的造船能力。当谈到我们能在太平洋部署的原始吨位时，**中国**绝对是一个竞争对手。所以，我们需要重新思考这个问题。我花了大量时间试图弄清楚：这个市场是否足够大？是否足够大到我可以投入未来十年以上的时间来建立一家具有变革性的公司？为此，我每周会与人进行 10 到 20 次不同的谈话。我了解到一些大型造船项目存在的延误问题，了解到这是一个多么大的痛点，以及我们不可能一夜之间改变美国的造船能力。所以，我们需要重新思考这个问题。我们不会在造船上竞争，但我们可以在技术上竞争。美国在**自主化**和技术方面非常强大。我们可以利用这一优势，并将其应用于我们今天的海军。我们不是在改造现有舰艇使其实现自主化，我们是从龙骨开始重新设计一艘船。这部分原因是我在海军的经历，因为今天的海军舰艇和商船都需要工程师每天在船上值守，维护和修理舰船。所以，要将商业设计或海军设计变成无人值守数月之久，是行不通的。存在太多的单点故障，而且我们得到了很多反馈，表明你不能拿商业设计进行改造以适应我们关注的任务。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ryland Hamilton**: China possesses a ship building capacity over 230 times that of the United States. When it comes to just building like raw tonnage that we can put in the Pacific, China is like definitely a competitor in that space. So, we need to rethink the problem. I definitely spend a lot of time trying to understand is this market big enough? Is this market big enough that I can spend the next 10 plus years building a transformational company in this space? And so every week I would have 10 to 20 different conversations with people. I learned about some of the delays that we have in some of the large ship building programs. I learned about how big of a painoint it is and how we're not going to overnight change our ship building capacity in the United States. And so we need to rethink the problem. We're not going to compete on ship building, but we can compete on tech. The United States is really strong on autonomy and technology. And so we can take that strength and then apply it to our today's Navy. We're not retrofitting existing in vessels to make them autonomous. We're literally redesigning a ship from the keel up. Part of that reason is my experience in the Navy was that today's naval ships and commercial ships have engineers that are on the ships that are standing watch every day and they're maintaining and repairing the vessels. So to take that commercial design or that naval design and try to make it unmanned for months at a time just won't work. There too many single points of failures and we've got a lot of good feedback that you can't take a commercial design and do a retrofit for the missions that we're focused on.

</details>

**Ryland Hamilton**: 在任何早期初创公司，你都需要极其专注于一个客户和一个产品。但很多创始人刚开始创业时，并不清楚这一点。有时他们看到一项很酷的技术，就试图强行将其应用或创造一个市场。当我们考虑**自主船舶**的商业市场和国防市场的机会时，商业市场非常吸引人，但仍存在一些需要克服的监管障碍。但当我们审视国防领域，并看到世界各地，尤其是在太平洋地区的地缘政治威胁时，我们看到了一个关键需求。我们找到了一个愿意付费的客户，而且没有遇到商业领域那些监管障碍。于是我们说，我们相信**海事自主化**，我们希望加速它，但我们将专注于国防市场。我们得到了海军的大量支持，甚至国会也为我们正在建造的东西拨款超过 20 亿美元。所以，学到的经验是，在早期公司，**专注**至关重要。当然，这并不总是能规模化，但我想，当你是一家初创公司时，你不是在试图弄清楚如何规模化，而是在试图弄清楚如何解决一个问题。

<details>

**Ryland Hamilton**: At any early stage startup, you need to be super focused on one customer with one product. But I don't think it's obvious to a lot of founders kind of when they're starting something. Sometimes they see a cool technology and they try to force fit it or try to create a market. When we're thinking about the opportunities on the commercial market for autonomous ships and then on the defense market, the commercial market is super interesting, but there's still some regulatory sort of hurdles and obstacles that need to be overcome. But when you looked at the defense side and we looked at some of the geopolitical threats that are happening in all the areas of the world, especially around the Pacific, we saw a critical need. We saw a customer with a willingness to pay and we didn't see any of those sort of regulatory obstacles that you have on the commercial side. And we said, we believe in maritime autonomy. We want to accelerate it, but we're going to focus on the defense market. We've seen a ton of support from the Navy. We've even seen Congress allocate over $2 billion to what we're building. And so the lesson learned was focus really matters at an early stage company. Now that doesn't always scale, but I think when you're an early stage company, you're not trying to figure out how to scale. You're trying to figure out how to solve a problem.

</details>

**Ryland Hamilton**: 在船上和开阔海洋上的另一部分体验是，置身于开阔海洋之中是一种美妙的体验。你无法完全掌控一切，你对海洋充满敬畏。如果你遇到巨大的风暴，你所能做的非常有限。你能依靠的是船上的伙伴，你们是一个团队。当你朝九晚五地上班时，一天结束就可以回家。但在茫茫大海上航行的船上，你不能在一天结束时回家，你就在船上。他们也会提醒你，这是团队的努力，你的工作成功与否不是最重要的，重要的是整艘船的成功。这些都是在初创公司中令人兴奋的时刻。如果团队之间互不信任，那么团队之间的协作就不会健康。结果是，每个团队都会预留应急措施，当某个环节延误时，团队之间就会产生很多冲突。但如果团队之间相互信任，就能消除很多团队间的应急预案。所以，对我来说，**诚信**非常重要。尤其是在初创公司，很多事情可能顺利，也可能出错。我在海军学到的一点是，坏消息不会随着时间推移而变好。我希望人们能自在地分享好消息和坏消息，但将内部的一点坏消息隐瞒起来对初创公司没有帮助，因为它不会帮助到其他人。所以，**透明**和**诚实**绝对有助于初创公司在当下做出最佳决策。

**Ryland Hamilton**: The other part about being on ships and in the open ocean is it's a beautiful experience being out in the middle of the open ocean. You don't necessarily have control over everything. You just have a lot of respect for the ocean. If you're in a large storm or something like that, there's only so much you can do. What you can do is you can rely around the people that surround yourself that are on the ship and you're a team. When you show up to a job and it's 9 to5, you can go home at the end of the day. Well, when you're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, you don't go home at the end of the day, you're on the ship. And then they also remind you that it's a team effort and that it's not about you being successful in your job on a ship. It's about the whole ship being successful. And those are some of the thrilling moments about being at a startup. If you have teams that don't trust each other, then the interfaces between the teams aren't necessarily healthy. And what'll happen is that every team will have contingency that's there and then when you don't hit a date, they'll basically create a lot of conflict between the different teams. But if the teams trust each other, then you can kind of remove a lot of that contingency between the different teams. So what's super important to me is integrity. Especially at a startup, there are a lot of things that could go well. There are a lot of things that could go wrong. And one thing I learned in the Navy is that bad news does not get better over time. And I want people to feel comfortable sharing good news and bad news, but it doesn't help to kind of like heard a little bit of bad news internally and not tell other people because it just doesn't help the startup. And so transparency and being truthful is definitely helps a startup make the best decisions at the moment.

**Ryland Hamilton**: 所以，当你作为创始人制定计划时，计划永远不会完美。事实上，很多时候结果都不会如你所愿。这正是作为创始人的一大魅力——你努力让每个人发挥出最佳水平，因为归根结底，你拥有丰富的资源和众多的人才，你的目标就是充分利用这些资源和人才，并产生最佳结果。结果可能不完全是计划中的那样，但要拥抱这些潜在的不足，同时也要看到那些远超预期的进展。今天我们身处旧金山。当我向家人或朋友描述我希望 **Blue Water** 成为什么样子，以及我们的长远愿景时，我真心希望它能成为“**公海上的 Waymo**”。我认为 Waymo 是一种技术和公司，它让我们接受了乘坐没有司机的汽车。我们不再将 Waymo 视为一家汽车公司，而是一家创造“**软件定义汽车**”的公司。所以，当我思考 **Blue Water** 的未来时，我希望 **Blue Water** 能够创造出海上的每一艘船，并让人们将其视为“**软件定义**”的。很多工作和任务都可以被软件取代。因此，它实际上可能成为一份很棒的工作，你在船上执行各种任务、杂务或使命，这就像乘坐 Waymo 汽车一样，是一种美妙的体验。

**Ryland Hamilton**: So when you're a founder and you're thinking about a plan and never does your plan go perfectly. In fact, there are a lot of times when the outcomes aren't what you expected. And that's the beauty about being sort of a founder is basically you're trying to get the best out of everyone because at the end of the day, you'll have so many resources, you have so many people, and your goal is to get the best out of your resources and your people and to produce the best outcome. It might not exactly be the plan, but just embrace that there going to be some downsides, but there are also a lot of upsides and things you moved a lot faster than you ever expected. So today we're in San Francisco and when I think about what I want Blue Water to be by describing it to like my family or friends and what the long-term vision is, I really want to be the Whimo for the open ocean. I think Whimo is this type of technology in this company where we're now coming to the fact that we accept getting into a car without people in it. We don't think about Whimo less as a vehicle company and more as a company creating these softwaredefined vehicles. And so when I think about what I want Blue Water to be is I want Blue Water to basically create every ship that's out there and for people to think about them as being software defined. A lot of the dole and jobs can be kind of replaced by software. So it can actually maybe become one of the best jobs that's out there where you're basically on a vessel doing different types of you know tasks, chores or missions and it's kind of a beautiful experience just like being in a Whimo car.
