### 加拿大军事战略：不确定世界中的定位与挑战

**Steve Pacin**: 大家好，我是**Steve Pacin**。我们今天在道恩斯维尤（Downsview）前加拿大皇家空军基地现场，进行2026年第一期《TVO今日直播》节目。这里是百年理工学院**庞巴迪航空航天中心**的A机库，是其专门的航空航天校区。这一切都是**DAREHub**（道恩斯维尤航空航天创新与研究）的一部分。我们之所以在这里，是因为在一个似乎日益危险的世界里，加拿大正在重振和恢复其军事力量。这个基地在第二次世界大战期间曾为盟军生产**德哈维兰蛾式飞机**和**蚊式飞机**，直到1990年代一直是加拿大皇家空军的活跃基地。几十年来，加拿大在军事上一直表现出色，但随着资金和兴趣的减少，这种优势逐渐减弱。现在，随着数十亿资金被重新分配用于武装和振兴军队，加拿大能够并且应该拥有什么样的作战力量？我们又该如何为这项任务做好准备？在开始之前，我要感谢**Red Wilson**，他领导着**Wilson基金会**。自《TVO今日直播》系列节目开播以来，**Red Wilson**一直支持我们，为我们提供开展这些节目所需的资金。所以，Sheldon，给大家拍个照。后面看台上座无虚席，每个人都免费入场，因为**Red Wilson**资助了整个活动。所以非常感谢。我们也很高兴感谢**Jackman基金会**，他们也加入了进来，他们的额外支持也备受欢迎。今天，我们很高兴邀请到**Wayne Eyre将军**，他是一名退役的加拿大空军军官，服役超过30年，曾担任多个杰出指挥职务，并于2021年至2024年担任加拿大国防参谋长。**Wendy Gilmore**女士，她在加拿大外交事务和国防部服务了三十多年，包括在**北约**担任国防投资助理秘书长。以及**Christian Leuprecht**教授，他是**加拿大皇家军事学院**和**皇后大学**的教授，最近编辑了《**军事行动应对国内紧急情况和全球疫情**》一书。让我们用掌声欢迎今天的嘉宾。谢谢你们的到来。

**Steve Pacin**: Hi everybody, I'm **Steve Pacin** and we are here on the site of the former Royal Canadian Air Force Station Downs View for the first edition of TVO Today Live for 2026. This is hangar A of the **Bombardier Center for Aerospace and Aviation** at **Centennial Colleg's** dedicated aerospace campus. It's all part of the **DAREHub**, D AIR, Downs View Aerospace Innovation and Research. And we are here because in what seems like an increasingly dangerous world, Canada is revitalizing and restoring its military. This site once cranked out dehavlin moths and mosquitoes for World War II Allied forces and was an active RCAF base right up until the 1990s. For decades, Canada punched well above its weight militarily. That waned as funding and frankly interest shrank. Now, with billions reallocated to rearm and revive it, what kind of fighting force can and should Canada have, and how do we equip for that mission? Before we start, I want to say thank you to **Red Wilson**. He heads up the **Wilson Foundation**. Ever since this TVO Today live series began, **Red Wilson** has been there for us, offering us the support and funding we need to do these programs. So, Sheldon, take a shot of everybody here. We got an overflow crowd on the bleachers at the back there and everybody gets in for free because **Red Wilson** is underwriting this whole effort. So, thank you so much for that. And we are also happy as well to thank the **Jackman Foundation** which has now come aboard and their additional support is most welcomed as well. Now, we are delighted to have with us for this conversation today, **General Wayne Heir**, retired Canadian Air Force's officer with more than 30 years in the service and among several distinguished commands and deployments, was chief of Canada's defense staff from 2021 to 24. **Wendy Gilmore**, who for more than three decades served in Canada's foreign affairs and national defense departments, including at **NATO** as assistant secretary general for defense investment. and **Christian Lipre**, professor at the **Royal Military College of Canada** and **Queens University** and the editor most recently of **Military Operations in Response to Domestic Emergencies and Global Pandemics**. And how about this audience welcoming our guests here today. Thank you for coming in.

**Steve Pacin**: 这个节目的起因是上一个联邦预算中宣布的大幅国防开支增加，为**加拿大武装部队**提供了810亿美元的资金方案。我之前介绍您为空军，我本想说武装部队，**加拿大武装部队**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: The impetus for this program was a huge bump in defense spending announced in the last federal budget. An $81 billion funding package for the **Canadian Armed Forces**. And I introduced you as Air Force. I meant to say armed force. **Canadian Armed Forces**.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 我本来不打算纠正你，Steve。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: I wasn't going to correct you, Steve.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你应该纠正我的，但话一出口，我就觉得不对劲。总之，**加拿大武装部队**，包括一项加拿大采购计划。但在我们谈到这个之前，对许多人来说，房间里有一头大象。房间里有很多飞机，但也有那头大象。也许形状像委内瑞拉或格陵兰。所以，让我们从我们目前与南方邻居之间这种，该怎么说呢，令人恼火的关系开始。将军，当你担任**国防参谋长（CDS）**时，你强调世界上的和平与安全都归功于一个商定的、基于规则的国际秩序。根据我们的总理的说法，那已经结束了。它已经过去了。这对我们的军队来说有多令人担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: You should have corrected me, but as soon as the word came out of my mouth, I thought that doesn't sound right. Anyway, **Canadian Armed Forces**, including a Canadian procurement program. But before we even get to that, for many people, there's an elephant in the room. There's a lot of planes in the room, but there's an elephant, too. Perhaps shaped like Venezuela or Greenland. So, let us begin with the, what shall we call it, infuriating relationship we are currently having with our neighbors to the south. General, when you were the **CDS Chief of Defense Staff**, you underscored that whatever peace and security exists in the world is thanks to an agreed upon international rules-based order. According to our prime minister, that's done. It's over with. How concerning is that for our military?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，这应该非常令人担忧。我们已经看到这种情况有一段时间了。事实上，在2022年，我公开表示我们正处于全球秩序的转折点。而我们从南方边境看到的情况，正在加速这个转折点。嘿，我们面对现实吧，所有的全球秩序都有兴衰。我们已经看到了五六七百年。但这是一个秩序、无序、再秩序的周期。我们正在进入无序阶段，在我们找到新的平衡之前，出现误判和坏事的可能性非常大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Well, it should be very concerning. And we've seen this coming for some time. In fact, in 2022, I said publicly that we were at a turning point in that global order. And what we see coming from south of the border is an accelerant to that turning point. Hey, let's face it, all global orders come and go. We've seen this for 5, 6, 700 years. But it's a period or it's a cycle of order, disorder, reorder. We are entering the disorder phase and until we find a new equilibrium, there is tremendous opportunity for miscalculation and bad things to happen.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: **Wendy Gilmore**，我们应该如何应对我们集体历史上的这一刻？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: **Wendy Gilmore**, how should we react to this moment in our collective history?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我倾向于想起英国的格言：“保持冷静，继续前进。”我们必须了解正在发生什么。我们必须尽可能冷静地应对事件，应对**特朗普总统**在南方的言论，应对国际大事件，应对世界贸易秩序的变化，所有这些都将影响加拿大。但最重要的是，我们必须专注于理顺我们自己的内部流程，并尽可能保持韧性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I tend to think of the British adage for keep calm and carry on. We have to understand what's going on. We have to react as calmly as possible to events, statements from **President Trump** in the south, international events at large, changes in the world trading order, they will all impact Canada. But what is most important is that we focus on getting our own internal processes right and that we remain as resilient as we can.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我们如何在这一切面前保持冷静？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: How do we keep calm in the face of all of that?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 嗯，我个人认为，如果你面对一个恶霸，你就应该站起来，说出正确的话，并尝试调整你的方法，同时考虑到你正在保护自己的利益。但与此同时，我们必须意识到，尤其是在我们与美国人的关系方面，我们不能筑起一道墙。他们不会离开。我们必须找到一种方法与一个政府合作，即使我们现在可能与他们的做法并非完全一致，甚至根本不一致。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: Well, my personal opinion is that if you're faced with a bully, you stand up and you say what is right and you try and calibrate your approach to taking into account you're protecting your own interests. But at the same time, we have to be aware, especially when our relationship with the Americans is concerned, is that we're not putting up a wall. They're not going away. We have to find a way to work with an administration, even if we may not be completely aligned or aligned at all in what it is that they're doing right now.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian，你的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian, your view.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 好的，你看，今年是**乔治·华盛顿**在独立战争期间，率领军队穿过圣约翰，向魁北克城进军250周年，他当然被英军击退了。1812年战争，俄勒冈边界争端。我们回想起**尼克松时代**。你看，与美国的关系一直很困难。这有两个原因。一是美国一直奉行单边主义，它维护自己的利益，并且长期以来在西半球单边维护其安全利益，这可以追溯到**门罗主义**。另一个原因是，如果你回想**阿瑟·施莱辛格**1973年的著作《**帝国总统制**》，我们长期以来看到美国行政权力的扩张，从华盛顿到**理查德·尼克松**。这后来受到国会的制约。但施莱辛格指出，这些权力，行政权力，特别是在冲突时期和战争时期会扩张，你可能会说我们生活在一个冲突肯定加剧的时代。如果你看看俄罗斯和中国对西方的学说，我们可能会说我们生活在一个战争时期。因此，行政权力的扩张符合更广泛的历史模式，这种扩张是以牺牲国会和制衡为代价的。但我想我的更广泛观点是，任何希望这只是一个短暂的理性失误，我们会回到现状的人，那是不可能发生的。所以我们最好做好准备。不，我们一直与美国有着偶尔紧张的关系，但根据你的经验，以前有过这样的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So, look, this is the 250th anniversary of **George Washington** during the revolutionary wars with his armies through St. Johnu marching on Quebec City where he was of course beaten back by British troops. War of 1812, Oregon boundary dispute. We think back to the **Nixon era**. Look, the relationship with the **United States** has always been difficult. And it's been difficult for two reasons. One is that the **United States** has always been unilateral and it asserts its interests and it has long asserted its security interests unilaterally in the hemisphere. going back to the **Monroe Doctrine**. The other is that if you think back to **Arthur Slesinger's** 1973 book, **The Imperial Presidency**, we've long seen an expansion of executive power in the **United States** from Washington through to **Richard Nixon**. That was then constrained by Congress. But what Schlesinger points out that these powers, executive powers expand particularly during times of conflict and during times of war and you might say that we live in a time of certainly heightened conflict. If you look at Russian and Chinese doctrine towards the west, we might say we live in a time of war. And so the expansion of executive power fits with the broader historical pattern that comes at the expense of Congress and at the expense of checks and balances. But I think my broader point is anybody who hopes this is just a momentary lapse of reason and we'll go back to the status quo auntie, that's not going to happen. So we better get ready. No, we've always had an occasionally fraught relationship with the **United States**, but in your experience, has it ever been like this before?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 不，当然没有。我们一直享有非常棒的关系。有过起伏，但从军事角度来看，它一直很强大。当然在我40年的服役生涯中。我希望这种关系的强度能够继续保持，至少是为了维持个人关系。这样，十年、十五年、二十年后，如果我们处理一个敏感问题，当时的指挥官可以拿起电话解决问题。我认为这样做符合我们的最佳利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: No, certainly not. We have enjoyed a fantastic relationship. There's been ups and downs, but certainly from a military perspective, it has been strong. Certainly over the course of my 40 years of service. I would like to think that that strength of relationship continues if nothing else to maintain a personal relationship. so that 10, 15, 20 years from now if we're dealing with a sensitive issue that our commanders at the time can pick up the phone and sort it out. I think it's in our best interest to do that.

</details>

### 格陵兰与北极安全

**Steve Pacin**: 你知道吗，因为**唐纳德·特朗普**说他需要格陵兰的原因之一，是由于俄罗斯或中国在该地区持续存在的威胁。你知道那里是否曾发现过任何可信的威胁？格陵兰和英国之间以冰岛为中心的海域，在整个冷战期间一直是关注的焦点，因为如果威胁来自俄罗斯，而俄罗斯拥有携带导弹的核潜艇，可能威胁**北美**，它们最有可能出现的区域就是我们过去常说的，现在仍然称之为**GIUK缺口**。格陵兰本身作为一个领土，战略位置非常重要，因为它能够放置不同类型的传感器，可以“超视距”地观察北极及其他地区。但我们必须记住的一件事是，格陵兰和**丹麦王国**自第二次世界大战以来，一直是**北美**防御不可或缺的一部分。美国在第二次世界大战期间曾派兵，确保格陵兰不被用作气象站或其他类型监视的基地。自第二次世界大战结束以来，自1951年以来，美国和丹麦之间就有一项条约，允许美国相当自由地进入格陵兰领土。该条约于2004年更新，以涵盖格陵兰人民的利益和自主权。因此，对我来说，**特朗普总统**及其主要顾问为何如此执着于拥有格陵兰是不可理解的，因为格陵兰一直完全无缝地融入到**北美**的防御中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Do you know, because one of the reasons **Donald Trump** said he needed Greenland was because of the persistent present threats by either Russia or China in that part of the world. Do you know if there are any credible threats that have been picked up there? The area between Greenland and the United Kingdom centered with Iceland in the middle has been an area of focus throughout the Cold War because if there are, if the threat is coming from Russia and Russia has nuclear submarines with missiles that could threaten **North America**, the area that they are most likely to come down is what we used to call, we still call the **GIUK gap**. Greenland itself as a territory is strategically located because of the ability to place different types of sensors on it that can see and we call over the horizon, over the Arctic and elsewhere. But one of the things we have to remember is that Greenland and the **Kingdom of Denmark** have been integrally in, part of the defense of **North America** for well since the **Second World War**. The Americans had troops during the **Second World War** that were were ensuring that Greenland wasn't used as a as a base for weather stations or other types of surveillance. Since the end of the **Second World War**, since 1951, there has been a treaty between the **United States** and Denmark that allows the **United States** fairly unfettered access to Greenlandish territory. It was updated in 2004 to encompass the the interests and frankly this the autonomy of the Greenlandish people. So it is inexplicable to me why there is this fixation from **President Trump** and his key advisers on owning Greenland when Greenland has always been incorporated into the defense of **North America** completely seamlessly.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你认为是什么原因导致**温迪**所说的总统对格陵兰的“执着”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: What do what do you think accounts for the fixation to use Wendy's word for the president on Greenland?

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 所以，这个缺口在通信方面至关重要。欧洲和**北美**之间95%的数字通信都通过穿过这个缺口的关键基础设施电缆进行。俄罗斯和中国一再表明他们有能力和意图切断通信。而且这长期以来一直是俄罗斯，追溯到苏联，在保护其堪察加半岛的核资产和摩尔曼斯克半岛的俄罗斯舰队方面的“红线”。所以，是的，我们有俄罗斯潜艇的侵略性活动，我们有俄罗斯和中国之间的一些勾结，但在某种程度上，这与我们在冷战期间看到的情况没有什么不同。我们看到的是遏制这种能力，特别是反潜战能力的萎缩，但其中一些是政治决定，可以追溯到**皮埃尔·特鲁多**，他在战略反潜战方面为加拿大决定，参与战略反潜战实际上是不稳定的。所以我们已经有了反潜战能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So the gap is critical for instance in terms of communications. So 95% of digital communications between Europe and **North America** run through critical infrastructure cables that run through that gap. Russia and China have repeatedly demonstrate they have the capabilities and the intent to cut communications. And this has long been sort of the red line for Russia back to the **Soviet Union** in terms of protecting its nuclear assets in the Kan Peninsula and the Russian fleet in the Morman Peninsula. So yes and so we we have aggressive Russian submarine activity we have some collusion with by Russia and China but to some extent this is no different than what we saw during the cold war what we have seen is an atrophying of capabilities to contain that in particular anti-ubmarine warfare capabilities but some of those were political decisions going back to **Pier Trudeau** in terms of strategic ASW deciding for Canada that was actually destabilizing to engage in strategic ASW. So we had already anti- anti-ubmarine warfare capabilities.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 但如果我说，Christian，这种能力的萎缩不仅仅是加拿大，也不仅仅是丹麦。它也包括美国的能力。美国没有像我现在认为他们可能希望的那样，在北方高纬度北极能力上进行投资。但这只是所有盟友的集体决定。所以，是也不是。因为我认为我们需要问，北极的威胁是什么？这种威胁真的与冷战时期不同吗？俄罗斯人会带着特种部队出现在加拿大领土上部署吗？我不确定这种威胁与以前的威胁有多大不同。例如，如果你看看美国海军，美国海军从未真正对北极感兴趣。大部分工作都留给了美国海岸警卫队。因此，从加拿大的角度来看，我们需要问，我们正在寻求防御什么？我的感觉是，我们需要区分北极内部的威胁和通过北极而来的威胁。我的感觉是，北极内部的威胁与以前没有太大不同。如果你要向**北美**发射导弹，如果你是俄罗斯，从太平洋阿拉斯加海岸或西海岸发射导弹，比从北极发射效率要高得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: But if I can say Christian that atrophying of capability is not just Canada, it's not just Denmark. It's also the American capability. The Americans have not invested in high north Arctic capabilities to the extent that I believe now they probably had wished they would. But it's it's collective decision on the part of all of the allies. So, yes and no. Because I think like we need to ask what is the threat in the Arctic? Is the threat actually different from what it was during the Cold War? Are the Russians going to show up with special forces that they're going to deploy on some Canadian territory or so? And I'm not sure the threat is that much different than what the threat has been pre previously. If you look at the **US Navy**, for instance, the **US Navy** has never really been interested in the Arctic. Much of this is left up to the **US Coast Guard**. And so from a Canadian perspective, we need to ask what is it that we're looking to defend against? And my sense is we need to distinguish between threats in the Arctic and threats coming through the Arctic. My sense is threats in the Arctic are not that different from what they were before. And if you're going to send a missile to **North America** and if you're Russia, it's much more efficient to send that missile for instance from the Pacific off the coast of Alaska or off the West Coast than it is than it is from the Arctic.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian，请不要给他们任何想法。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian, don't give them any ideas, please. All right.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Christian，我可能会对“情况与冷战时期没有太大不同”的说法提出一些异议。你知道，我们现在所面临的，在历史上可能是前所未有的，是安全环境中各种压力的汇合：地缘政治、气候变化和技术变革的加速。这三者共同作用，将创造一个非常不确定的未来。气候变化使得北极变得更加易于进入。随着进入的增加，兴趣也随之增加。随着兴趣的增加，紧张局势的机会也随之增加。你看到资源潜力正在开放，海上主张重叠，以及大大缩短从中国到欧洲的航运时间的过境能力。我们看到潜在对手之间出现了前所未有的结盟。这里我指的是俄罗斯和中国。你知道，北极传统上是它们之间的分歧点。这可以追溯到19世纪，当时俄罗斯夺取了中国领土。但现在情况不再如此。我们看到北极地区联合演习和联合轰炸机巡逻日益增多。所以当我们谈论北极时，我们必须从战略时间线来思考。当你担任国防参谋长时，你是否曾想过：“天哪，我们在这个世界上的这个区域真是太脆弱了，我真希望美国有一天能入侵或以某种方式拥有格陵兰，以确保我们的安全。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: So Christian, I would I would take some exception to the situation is not terribly different from the cold war. You know what we have now is perhaps unprecedented in history a confluence of confluence of stressors in the security environment. Geopolitics, climate change and technological change acceleration. And those three operating together will create a very uncertain future. climate change, the Arctic is becoming much more accessible. With increased access comes increased interest. With that increased interest comes increased opportunity for tension. You have an opening up of resource potential for for resources, overlapping maritime claims, the ability to transit which greatly reduces shipping times from China to to Europe. We're seeing an unprecedented alignment between potential adversaries. Here I'm talking Russia and China. You know, the the Arctic traditionally was a wedge issue between the two of them. And it goes back to the 1800s when when Russia seized Chinese territory. But not so much anymore. And we're seeing increasing joint exercises in the Arctic, joint bomber patrols, and and so when we talk about the Arctic, we got to be thinking in strategic timelines. When you were chief of defense staff, did you ever think to yourself, "Boy, we are really vulnerable in this neighborhood in the world, and I I really hope the **United States** someday either invades or somehow owns Greenland to make sure we stay safe."

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 绝对没有。当我担任国防参谋长时，我正是那个主张我们必须对此采取行动的人，因为如果我们不这样做，其他人就会这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Absolutely not. When I was chief of defense staff, I was the one arguing we got to do something about this because if we don't, somebody else will.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 温迪，我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Wendy, I

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我还要说，我回到联盟的重要性，并解决将军刚才提到的所有问题。我们有32个志同道合的国家，也许其中一个国家不像以前那样志同道合了，那就是美国。关于我们如何集体处理这些问题并决定如何解决它们，首先，这能最好地利用我们非常有限的资源，我完全同意需要更多资源，但最重要的是，它强化了我们重视彼此主权和领土完整的理念。这就是我们试图保护的。关于北极，我总是喜欢提醒自己和他人的一件事是，它不仅仅是一片广阔的、无人居住的白色领土，可以被用作棋盘上的棋子。那里有人居住。格陵兰人拥有决定自己未来的主权能力。到目前为止，他们决定留在**丹麦王国**内。我们自己的北极人民与王室有条约关系。他们对自己的土地拥有权利，他们的想法和利益必须被考虑在内，他们也认识到对他们领土的兴趣越来越大，进入他们领土的机会越来越多，随着全球变暖的持续以及我们对各种资源的需求增加，外部兴趣也会增加，但他们对什么是安全威胁的看法可能与我们大相径庭，这一点必须考虑在内。Christian。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I would also say that I I come back to the importance of the alliance and addressing all of the issues that General just mentioned. We have a collection of what I mean what were 32 like-minded countries perhaps you know one of the countries is less like-minded than it used to be the United that would be the **United States** with respect to we approach these issues collectively and we decide how we're going to address them that number one makes best use of our very limited resources and I agree completely that more resources are needed but most importantly reinforces the idea that we value each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And that's what we're trying to protect. The one thing that I always like to remind myself and others about the Arctic is that it's not just a vast white uninhabited territory that can be used as some pawn on a chessboard. There are people living there. The Greenlanders have sovereign ability to decide on their own future. They have so far decided that's within the **Kingdom of Denmark**. Our own Arctic peoples have treaty relationships with the crown. They have rights in their lands and their ideas and their interests have to be taken into account and they also appreciate that there is more interest in their territories that there is more access to their territories that as global warming continues and frankly our desire for all sorts of resources increases that there's going to be more outside interest but their concept of what constitutes a security threat could be very different from ours and that has to be taken into account. Christian.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 是的。所以，我同意**埃伦将军**和**安迪**的观点，即在该地区发生的事情，其规模和速度确实发生了变化。但我认为这也是一个功能，有很多连续性。我的意思是，16.6万公里的海岸线，一个比整个欧洲还要大的区域。但如果威胁真的那么大，你看，我们有八个军事基地，在情况好的时候，我们可能会集结八架**CF-18**，三艘护卫舰，它们都无法进入北极。我们建造的北极巡逻舰在北极的能力有限。你知道，如果这个国家面临的威胁真的那么大，我们会在拉脱维亚部署一整个旅吗？但我认为肯定存在变化的威胁。例如，高超音速武器以及俄罗斯正在部署的导弹。这些无疑是规模上的变化，因此，拥有冷战时期的雷达站，例如，根本无法应对当前的需求。如果你看看美国新的国防战略，它非常清楚地表明，我们希望与盟友合作保护我们的利益，我们希望与半球内的伙伴和盟友合作保护半球，特别是如果盟友和伙伴不与我们合作，那么美国将单方面行动，这就是为什么美国一直保持……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Yeah. So, I agree with **General Eron** in the sense and with Andy that really that absolutely there's a change in in in scale and in pace of what's happening in that area. But I think it's also a function there's a lot of continuity. I mean 166,000 kilometers of coastline, an area that is larger than all of Europe. But if the threat was really that big, look, we have eight military bases and on a good day we might marshall eight **CF-18s**, three frigates that don't make it up into the Arctic. We have Arctic patrol vessels that we built that have limited capability in the Arctic. You know, would we have an entire brigade in Latvia if the threat to this country sort of was genuinely so big? But I think there are certainly changing threats. So hypersonic weapons for instance and the missiles sort of that Russia is deploying. these are certainly a change in scale and so having cold war era radar stations for instance is simply not going to meet the moment and if you look at the new **US defense strategy** it is very clear we want to work with allies in terms of protecting our interests and we want to work with partners and allies in the hemisphere to protect the hemisphere in particular and if allies and partners are not going to work with us then the US will do it unilaterally that's why the US keeps

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我听到了最后一部分，我不记得听到第一部分，那就是我们希望与盟友合作，以确保半球的安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: I I heard the last part of that I don't recall hearing the first part of that which is that we want to work with our allies to ensure the safety of the hemisphere.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 嗯，这在刚刚发布的国防战略中明确指出，并且在该语境中明确提到了加拿大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Um it's in the just released defense strategy it says so explicitly and it mentions Canada explicitly in that context.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 好的，让我接着这个话题。根据你的经验，加拿大和美国的军事官员、士兵、战略等在多大程度上相互交织，以完成我们一直在谈论的所有事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Well, let me pick up on that. In your experience, how intertwined were Canadian and American military officials, soldiers, strategies, etc. in order to do all the things we've been talking about?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 所以，首先，让我回到Christian的评论。这并不是什么新鲜事。通常当我与我的美国同行会面时，即使是在**拜登政府**时期，北极问题也始终是他们谈话要点清单上的首要事项。你们在北极问题上做了什么？所以，我们需要做的是让自己成为确保北极安全不可或缺的伙伴。这样，就不用别人替我们做，我们也不会在这个过程中失去主权。现在，Steve，回到你的问题，我们非常具有互操作性。你知道，我自己曾作为空降兵团的副指挥官，在一个拥有10.5万部队的司令部中担任第三号人物，进行了两年的交流。所以，信任度很高。这来自于几十年的共同工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: So, so firstly, let me go back to Christian's comment. This is nothing new. Um, often when I would meet with my American counterparts, and this is under the **Biden administration**, the Arctic was at the top of their their list of talking points. What are you doing about the Arctic? Um, so what we need to do is make oursel the indispensable partner in terms of securing the Arctic. So again, somebody doesn't have to do it for us and and we lose sovereignty in the in the process. Now, Steve, to your your question, um, we are very interoperable. Um, you know, I myself spent two years on exchange as a deputy commander of a of a airborne corps, number three in a headquarters with 105,000 troops under command. Uh, so there was a high degree of trust. Uh, and that comes from decades and decades of working together.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 当时是哪个政府掌权？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Which administration was in control when that was happening?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，当时是**奥巴马政府**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Uh, at that point, that was the **Obama administration**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 好的。所以不是特朗普。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Okay. So not Trump.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 后来，我在韩国担任美国四星将军的副指挥官。事实上，当**特朗普**与**金正恩**会面时，我就在非军事区。那又是另一个故事了。但是，这些关系根深蒂固。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Subsequently, I was in Korea as a deputy commander to an American fourstar. Uh, in fact, I was in the demilitarized zone when **Trump** visited with **Kim Jong-un**. So, that's a whole another story. Um, but, uh, those relationships run deep.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Yeah,

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 温迪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Wendy,

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为，就像将军一样，我绝对相信我们必须培养并继续我们拥有的专业关系，坦率地说，是跨越国界的人际关系。加拿大和美国永远不会彼此分离。我们还必须对现任政府的意图有一个非常清晰的认识。是的，他们发布了一项新的国防战略，以进一步完善他们的国家安全战略。虽然其中提到了盟友和伙伴，但很大程度上是在“如果我们认为他们有用，我们就会利用他们”的背景下。如果他们符合我们的利益，就没有集体利益的概念，没有对所有人都有益的观念，而这坦率地说正是整个**北约**联盟的基础。所以，你知道吗？我完全同意我们必须加紧努力。我们必须进行这些投资。我们必须更快地增强我们自己的能力，以便我们能够自卫，而且我认为有一些学术研究表明，我们要“防御帮助”。美国人迟早会以某种方式行动。我们必须证明我们首先在那里并且有能力，这样我们才能避免如果他们决定需要做某事而我们没有准备好去做时，最终导致主权丧失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I think it I mean, like General, I absolutely believe that we have to foster and continue the professional relationships we have and frankly people-to-people relationships across the border. Canada and the US are never going to be separated from one another. We also have to have a very cleareyed view of the intent of the current administration. And yes, they have a new defense strategy that has been released further to their national security strategy. And while it mentions allies and partners, it's very much in the context of if we think they're useful, we will use them. If they are working in our interest, there's no sense of a collective interest of what is good for all, which is frankly what the whole **NATO** alliance is based on. And so then, you know what? I I do agree absolutely with the sense that we have to step up. We have to make these investments. We have to do them even more quickly in our own capabilities so that we defend ourselves and I think there's been some academic research defend ourselves against help. The Americans are going to do it one way or the other. We have to prove that we are there first and capable so that we can avoid the ultimate loss of sovereignty that will result if they decide that something needs doing and we're not prepared to do

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 但我认为Christian，双方，加拿大和美国这两个国家，多年来都认为拥有这种关系，这种互操作性符合他们的共同利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: But I think Christian, both sides, both countries, Canada and the **United States**, saw it as in their mutual interest over the years to have this relationship, this interoperability

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 因为我们彼此之间有相当程度的信任。我不知道今天我们是否可以说这种关系更像是一种负担而不是资产。你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: because we've had a decent level of trust with each other. And I'm wondering if today we can say this relationship may look more like a liability than an asset. What do you think?

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 嗯，让我们回想一下这是如何形成的，对吧？它回溯到**第二次世界大战**初期，美国担心加拿大在受到攻击时可能无法自卫。因此，美国提出一项建议，美国可能需要在加拿大领土上部署军队。当时加拿大总理与美国达成了一项准战略协议，即我们将共同努力，将世界上的威胁尽可能地远离我们的海岸。这随后转化为美国所称的“边缘战略”。所以你希望将威胁保持在**大西洋**边缘和**太平洋**边缘，并与那里的盟友和伙伴合作，并与加拿大建立关系，以便能够实现这一点。我会说，这项战略使**北美**成为世界上最稳定、最繁荣，可能也是最理想的大陆。我担心我们已经忘记了，特别是作为加拿大人，是什么让我们达到了加拿大今天的这个特殊时刻。因为我认为我们已经忘记了我们最初与美国建立这种关系的战略维度。现在，我们可能不同意美国所持的观点以及美国看待世界的方式。但你看，在古代，世界的中心，从西方角度来看，是地中海，后来随着殖民现代时期，转移到了**大西洋**，显然，那个重心正在向**印太地区**转移。所以我们正在经历全球动态的重大重组，我不确定加拿大和盟友在过去25年里是否真正跟上了这个步伐，我们喜欢抱怨美国政府的所作所为等等。但我也要说，我们需要承担一些责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Well, so let's think back of how this came to be, right? Right. So it came back to the beginning of the **Second World War** and a US concern that Canada may not be able to defend itself if attacked. And so a proposal by the US that the Americans might need to deoil troops on Canadian soil to which the Canadian prime minister at the time struck a quasi sort of strategic agreement with the **United States** that we would work together to keep the threats of the world as far away from our shores as we can. This then translates into what the US calls sort of the rim strategy. So you want to keep the threats on the **Atlantic** rim and on the **Pacific** Rim and work with allies and partners there and in relationship with Canada to to be able to assert that. And I would say that strategy has made **North America** the most stable, the most prosperous, possibly the most desirable continent in the history of the world. And I worry that we have forgotten, especially as Canadians, what got us to that special moment that Canada is in today. because I think we've forgotten that strategic dimension of why we got into that relationship with the **United States** in the first place. Now, we might disagree with the perspectives that the **United States** has and that how the **United States** looks at the world. But look, you know, in the antiquity, the center of sort of the world was, you know, from a western perspective, the Mediterranean that then shifted with sort of colonial modern sort of times to the **Atlantic** and clearly that center of gravity is shifting to the **Indo-Pacific**. So we have a significant sort of restructuring of of global dynamics and I'm not sure that Canada and allies sort of have really sort of kept pace with that over the last 25 years and we love to complain about what's coming out of the US administration and so forth. But I would also say we need to take some responsibility.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 嗯，就是这样。我们让我们的能力萎缩了25年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Well that's it. We've let our capabilities atrophy for 25 years.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 让我们直言不讳。我们被视为**北约**的落后者已经五六十年了。对吧。这公平地说。嗯，加拿大的军事历史就是一部准备不足的历史。你知道，如果我们看看1914年、1939年、1950年、2001年、2022年，是的，我们都没有做好准备。嗯，现在迹象很清楚。我们必须做好准备。国际关系的货币现在是硬实力。如果你想在谈判桌上占有一席之地，你必须有东西来支持它。一个国家的军队是其最终的保险政策，而我们一直没有支付保费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Let's be blunt about this. We've been seen as the lagards in **NATO** for 50 60 years. Right. That's fair to say. Well, Canadian military history is one of unpreparedness. You know, if we take a look at 1914, 1939, 1950, 2001, 2022, yeah, we have not been ready. Well, now the signs are clear. We've got to be ready. The currency of international relations is now hard power. You want a seat at the table, you got to have something to back it up. A country's military is it ultimate insurance policy, and we have not been paying the premiums.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 加拿大对**北约**有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: How important to **NATO** has Canada been?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以，我对我们被视为落后者的想法有些不满。当然在整个**北约**加拿大历史上并非如此。我的意思是，我们没有投资国内能力，因为我们在欧洲拥有重要的能力。直到90年代初，我们有一个陆军旅，我们有空军。我们一直是**大西洋**常备海军舰队的一部分。从那时起，我们参与了**北约**的每一次行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So I I take some umbrage at the thought that we've been seen as a lagard. Certainly not throughout the course of **NATO** Canada. I mean we we have not invested in domestic capability because we have had significant capabilities in Europe. Up until the early 90s we had a brigade land forces, we had air forces. We have always been part of standing naval fleet at **Atlantic**. Um since then we have been in an operational capacity in every operation that **NATO** has had.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 但自2014年设定2%目标以来，我们从未达到GDP的2%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: But we've never hit 2% of GDP since 2014 when the 2% target was established.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 不，我们没有。而且我的意思是，我将是第一个，坦率地说，在我的职业生涯中一直主张我们应该投入更多。我们应该更早地这样做，并且应该做得更好。话虽如此，我们是否将2%视为一个武断的目标，以及我们达到2%是否就意味着成功，对我来说是一个完全错误的说法。我们需要对加拿大需要什么进行现实的评估，为其设定一个价值，然后着手进行投资。如果你，我只是不想不必要地复杂化事情，但2%的数字，以及现在实际上是5%的数字，是对为满足**北约**下**欧洲-大西洋地区**防御计划所需的军事资产进行的成本计算。**欧洲盟军最高司令**的责任区域。这不包括**北美**。所以，如果我们完全现实，并且我们希望在当前的**北约**作战计划中发挥我们的作用，我们的目标将不得不更高，因为我们还有其他事情要做，而不仅仅是防御欧洲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: No, we haven't. And there I mean I would be the first and frankly have argued over the course of my career that we need to be investing more. We need to have done it earlier and we need to have done it better. That being said, the whether we consider a 2% an arbitrary target and whether we will have succeeded when we hit 2% is to me a complete misnomer. We need to make a realistic assessment on what it is that Canada needs, put a value against that and get on with the business of investing. If you I I would just not to to complicate things unnecessarily, but the 2% figure and what is now actually a 5% figure is a costing of what are the military assets that are required in order to meet the plans that have been established for the defense of the Euroatlantic area under **NATO**. Sacker's area of responsibility, Supreme Allied Commander Europe. That doesn't include **North America**. So, if we were being completely realistic and we wanted to pay play our part in the current **NATO** operational plannings, our target would have to be a lot more because we have other things to do other than simply defend Europe.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 话虽如此，你对现任总理宣布我们将把军事开支提高到GDP的5%这一消息有多大信心，认为它真的会实现？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Having said that, how confident are you that the announcement that the current prime minister has made that we're going to go to 5% of GDP for military spending that that's actually going to happen?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，军队没有奢侈地决定将出台哪些政治决定，以及这些政治决定在未来几年是否会得到维护。我只是想回到温迪关于国防开支的观点。嘿，GDP的百分比不是一个好的衡量标准。那是一个投入衡量标准。更好的国防规划是基于威胁的。所以你要看看国家面临的威胁，然后确定需要哪些能力和准备来应对这些威胁。嗯，这非常非常困难。所以**北约**采用了这个投入衡量标准。它远非完美。但是，它仍然是一个目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Well, one one thing that the military does not have the luxury of is determining what political decisions are going to come out and whether those political decisions are going to be upheld in the years to come. I just want to go back to Wendy's point on on defense spending. Hey, the the percentage of GDP is not a good metric. That is an input metric. Much better defense planning is threat based. So you take a look at the threats the country is facing and you determine what capabilities and readiness are necessary to address those threats. Um very very difficult to do. So **NATO** settles on this input metric. It is far from perfect. Um but it is a target nonetheless.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 嗯，问题就在这里。我的意思是，它可能远非完美，但它是每个人都同意的，而我们从未达到过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Well that's the thing. I mean it may be far from perfect but it's the one that everybody's agreed upon and the one we've never hit.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 所以这不会让我们在其他人眼中显得有点弱吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: So does that not make us look a little weak in the eyes of everybody else?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的，会的。我看到加拿大在2022-2023年期间的地位自由落体，尤其是在22年2月俄罗斯残酷入侵乌克兰之后，当时我们的盟友都在增加开支，增加投资，而我们却在讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yes it does. And I saw Canada's stock in freef fall in the period 2022 2023 certainly after Russia's brutal invasion of of Ukraine in in February of 22 where our allies were were increasing their spending were increasing their investments and we were discussing

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian，在你看来，**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**对加拿大和美国来说仍然很重要吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: discussing is **NORAD** still a big deal for Canada and the **United States** in your view Christian?

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 我认为它在功能安排上很重要，但在象征意义上也很重要，这是一个非常重要的问题，我们需要问。因为，例如，我个人认为，如果我们不购买**F-35**，那将对**特朗普政府**造成巨大的刺激，并可能加速我们已经看到的**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**的萎缩。我们已经看到由于技术变革，特别是武器系统和雷达系统，导致了萎缩，但我们也看到由于组织重组而导致的萎缩，最近的例子当然是半球或美洲司令部的宣布。所以，将六个作战司令部和领土司令部整合到一个国际和半球司令部中，我们已经看到了国防战略，该司令部的任务可能更难与加拿大的一些优先事项协调，例如加勒比地区打击毒品走私等，尽管我们一直在这方面发挥作用。所以，我的担忧之一是，我们希望保留**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**，既出于功能原因，因为我们最初为什么加入**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**？因为作为一个适度经济体，我们永远没有能力独自保卫北极。所以我们需要这种功能安排。但如果它由于各种原因正在萎缩，那么这意味着美国对北极的控制前景将增加，这最终不符合加拿大的利益。因此，我们需要在**加拿大联合行动司令部**拥有强大的能力，不仅是为了力量投射和对**大西洋**和**太平洋**的贡献，而且是为了大陆防御，以便最终与美国人平起平坐。这不仅对我们的大陆防御有好处。它也对我们的政治和军事安排有好处，因为无论是**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**还是**北约**，如果你没有强大的治国工具，你的声音在双边关系和**北约**多边关系中都将大大削弱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: I think it is a big deal in term of functional arrangement but it's also symbolically a big deal and it's a really important question for us to ask because for instance I think personally my view if we didn't buy the **F-35** that would be a huge irritant to the **Trump administration** and it might accelerate an atrophying of **NORAD** that we've already seen we've seen an atrophying as a result of technological change in particular the weapon systems and radar systems but we've also seen an atrophing as a result of organizational and restruct structuring and the latest of that is of course the announcement of the hemispheric or America's commands. So taking the six combatant commands and territorial commands and putting them into an international and the hemispheric command and we've seen the defense strategy the mandates for that command that might be more difficult to reconcile with some Canadian priorities in terms of sort of narco drug trafficking in the Caribbean and stuff although we've always had a had a role in this. So one of my concerns is that we want to hang on to **NORAD** both for functional reasons because why do we get into **NORAD** to begin with because we would never have as a modest economy the capabilities to defend the Arctic on our own. And so we needed this functional arrangement. But if it is atrophying for a host of reasons then that means the prospect of more US control of the Arctic which cannot be in Canadian in Canadian interests ultimately. So we need strong capabilities in the **Canadian Joint Operations Command**, not just for the purpose of force projection and contributions across the **Atlantic** and and the **Pacific**, but in terms of continental defense in order to work with the Americans ultimately at eye level. And that is good not just for our continental defense. It is also good for our political and our military arrangements because whether it's Norat or **NATO**, if you don't have robust instruments of statecraftraft, your voice is going to be significantly diminished in both the bational relationship and in the multilateral relationship around the table with **NATO**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 将军，你想补充吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: General, you wanted to add?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，我只是想补充Christian刚才说的。当我们在2023年初击落从西太平洋阿拉斯加上空飞来的气球时，这种功能整合或早期预警对我来说非常重要，坦率地说，这是必不可少的。然而，在功能方面，美国人希望我们做什么呢？他们认为，如果你从大陆的10点钟到2点钟方向看加拿大领土，那里存在一个关键的脆弱点。它没有传感器覆盖。我们如何通过加拿大的传感器，从太空到海底，让自己成为不可或缺的伙伴，以便我们知道在我们领土及其周边地区正在发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Well, I'll just jump into what Christian was saying there. Um the functional part was really driven home to me when we were shooting down balloons in early 2023 as they were coming in from the western Pacific over Alaska and that integration or that early warning of what was coming was quite frankly essential. What we need though on the functional piece and this is how what what the Americans want of us is they see a key vulnerability if you look at the continent from the 10:00 to the 2:00 position over Canadian territory. It's not covered with sensors. How do we make ourselves the indispensable partner through Canadian sensors that go right from space to the seabed so that we know what is happening in our territory and the approaches to it.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我能问你关于美国去年年底公布的这项新的国家国防战略或国家安全战略吗？它基本上是说，我在这里为了简化而转述，但基本上是说西半球是我们的，我们将随心所欲，你知道，如果它是他们的，我想我们就不再是其中一部分了。我不知道。所有这些应该在多大程度上决定我们如何以及为何为国防目的重新武装自己？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Can I ask you about this new national defense strategy or national security strategy that the Americans unveiled towards the end of last year which basically said I'm going to paraphrase for simplicity here but basically said the **Western Hemisphere** is ours and we'll do whatever we like and you know if it's if it's theirs the presumption is I guess we're not part of it anymore. I don't know. How much should all of that determine what and how we spend our money on to rearm ourselves for defense purposes?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为这很重要，但我也想回到“保持冷静，继续前进”的前提。我相信，加拿大需要审视我们希望为自己的安全能够做什么。我们准备在哪些方面独立行动并为此付费？我们需要与盟友一起做些什么？特别是，我的意思是，我们不会失去美国人。无论他们合作起来有多困难、多容易、多费劲，他们都将一直在那里。所以，我们必须弄清楚如何将我们自己的能力带到谈判桌上，以便我们拥有发言权。我想很快回到**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**。我曾担任**北美防空司令部（NORAD）司令**的政治顾问两年，他是一名美国司令。我是一名加拿大外交官，坐在他的身后，偶尔在他耳边低语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I think it's important, but I would also go back to the keep calm and carry on premise. We need to do, I believe, Canada needs to look what do we want to be able to do for our own security. Where are we prepared to do it on our own and pay for it? What do we need to do with our allies? And in particular, I mean, again, we're not we're not losing the Americans. No matter how difficult or good, easy they are to work with, hard they are to work with, they're still going to be there. So, we have to figure out how do we bring our own capabilities to the table so that we get a voice. And I would come back just quickly to **NORAD**. I spent two years as the political adviser to Commander **NORAD** who American commander. I was a Canadian diplomat sitting at his sort of, you know, behind occasionally whispering in his ear.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 那尴尬吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Was that ever awkward?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为这是一种真正的荣幸，因为我们在**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**中拥有一种基于条约的关系，它明确关注我们安全、航空航天控制、航空航天预警、海上预警的某些领域。在这些领域，加拿大和美国建立了流程、程序和指挥关系，使我们能够无缝地协同工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: It was, I thought, a real privilege because we have in **NORAD** a treaty- based relationship that looks explicitly at certain areas of our security, aerospace control, aerospace warning, maritime warning. In those areas, Canada and the US have established processes and procedures and command relationships where we are working seamlessly together.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 那么，几天前你在《**环球邮报**》上读到我们正在制定计划以防御美国入侵时，你感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: So, how'd you feel a few days ago when you read in the **Globe and Mail** that we're drawing up plans to defend ourselves from a US invasion?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为我们应该这样做，而且我会向我出色的同事将军请教，军队的全部意义在于他们是世界上最好的规划者，我希望他们能为尽可能多的突发事件做好计划，无论是来自南方邻国的入侵，还是其他任何威胁，威胁的风险是基于威胁发生的可能性以及如果发生时的后果，然后你根据这些来投入资源。但我想回到与美国的关系，那就是我们必须找到一种方法与他们合作，无论谁掌权，无论我们喜欢或不喜欢他们说什么，而我们做到这一点的最好方式就是带着能力来到谈判桌前，对我们自己的领土拥有主权控制，这意味着我们可以部署我们自己的资源。我想说，在**北美防空司令部（NORAD）**中最大的挑战之一，就是当我们上去观察气球时，我们只有一定数量的能力可以追踪那个气球或任何可能出现的威胁，追踪其穿过加拿大领土的轨迹。在某个时候，我们就会说，好吧，我们不能再继续了。我们需要美国的空中加油。我们需要美国的传感器。在某个情况下，我记得，我们可能需要美国的飞机来实际击落那个威胁。那么，美国就会说：“是的，我们在这段关系中。我们会来为你做这件事。但是，嘿，加拿大，你真的需要我们的空中加油机。你真的需要我们的空中预警能力，无论何时发生。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I think we should have the whole point and I I would look to my my wonderful colleague General the whole point of a military is that they are the best planners in the world and I would like to think they have plans for as many contingencies as possible whether it's an invasion from our neighbors to the south whether it's you know pick pick your threat it has to be threats you know risk is based on the you know the possibility of a threat happening and the consequence if it does happening and you put your resources in as as that dictates. But I guess what I would come back to with the states is that we have to find a way to work with them irrespective of who is in charge or how much we may like or not like what they're saying and the best way we do that is by coming to the table with capability with sovereign control over our own territory meaning that we can deploy our own resources. One of the biggest challenges I would say just to to finish this thought in **NORAD** is that when we went up to look at balloons, we only have a certain amount of capability that can track that balloon or whatever the threat happens to be the track of interest across Canadian territory. And at some point we say, well, we can't do it any further. We need American refueling. We need the American sensors. We need possibly American planes in one instance, as I recall, to actually take that threat down. Well, then the **United States** says, "Yes, we're in this relationship. We're going to come and do it for you. But hey, Canada is again, you really need our refuelers. You really need our airborne early warning capability, whatever happens at some point.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 没错。我们必须带着东西上谈判桌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Exactly. We need to come to the table with stuff.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian，然后是将军。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian and then the general.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 所以，这两点都非常重要，因为美国军队对它所拥有的能力非常忙碌。我认为所有这些事情都传递了一个信息，那就是我们帮助你的事情，你将需要自己去做，因为我们还有很多其他的优先事项。嗯，如果我可以说，一个小小的修正。国家安全战略和国家国防战略是两份独立的文件。在国家安全战略中，加拿大只出现了一次，而在国家国防战略中，它出现了三次。这也让你对加拿大在这里可以扮演的角色有了一些了解。而加拿大可以扮演的角色，我总是这样总结，就是美国人是最好的朋友，无论我们喜欢与否。我认为**特朗普政府**明白这一点，对吧？我们并没有很多选择。你要和谁结盟？俄罗斯，中国。所以从这个意义上说，我认为能力问题绝对是至关重要的。我认为加拿大政府在与我们的欧洲盟友合作方面一直做得不太好的事情有两点。欧洲人认为**北约**是关于保卫欧洲的。他们忘记了**北约**实际上有三个支柱：欧洲、**北美**和跨大西洋空间。我们在保护跨大西洋空间方面承担了不成比例的重任，特别是在追踪俄罗斯潜艇方面，以及在大陆防御方面。为什么大陆防御如此重要？有两个原因。一是我们不希望在我们的主权政治决策方面受到勒索，这些决策是由我们在渥太华和华盛顿合法民主选举产生的政府在涉及我们的利益、安全和国防时做出的。如果我们的对手能够用非常危险的武器威胁我们，而加拿大目前几乎没有能力防御，那么这实际上会让我们受到这些对手的政治勒索。还要记住，在1950年代，这些武器在加拿大北极地区是一个“飞越问题”，它们会击中美国。今天，如果你击中加拿大，它将对**北美**产生同样具有破坏性的影响，就像你击中美国一样。另一个当然是，如果我们作为加拿大人认为我们不希望世界上核扩散，而且我想不出任何理由我们应该希望核扩散，那么我们就需要保护美国对我们的伙伴和盟友的延伸战略核威慑，因为如果他们认为这种延伸核威慑不再可信，那么**印太地区**和欧洲的伙伴和盟友就会获取自己的核武器，这不可能对世界稳定有利，我们需要解释的是，对加拿大大陆防御和国家国防的投资就是对**北约**的投资，而且正如温迪所说，我认为我们没有很好地传达这一点，而且它没有得到很好的理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So, both really important points because the US military is very busy with the capabilities it has. And I think there's a message about all these things where we help you with, you're going to need to do on your own because we have a bunch of other priorities. Um a slight correction if I may. The national security strategy and the national defense strategy are two separate documents. In national security strategy Canada shows up once in national defense strategy it shows up three times. That also gives you a bit of an idea of there is a role for Canada to play here. And the role for Canada to play is the way I always sum this up is the Americans are best friends whether we like it or not. And the **Trump administration** I think understands that right? It's not like we have a host of options. Who are you going to ally with? Russia, China. So in that sense, I think the the the capabilities question is absolutely critical. And I think one of the things Canadian governments have never done very well with our European allies is two things. Europeans think **NATO** is about defending Europe. They forget that **NATO** actually has three pillars. Europe, **North America**, and the transatlantic space. We do a disproportionate amount of heavy lifting in protecting that transatlantic space in terms of in particular tracking Russian submarines for instance and in continental defense. Why is continental defense so important? Two reasons. One is we don't want to be extorted in terms of our sovereign political decisions that our legitimately democratically elected governments in Ottawa and in Washington make when it comes to our interests, our security and our defense. And if our adversaries can threaten us with very dangerous weapons that currently in Canada we would have very little capacity to defend against then that effect effectively sets us up to political extortion by those adversaries. Also remember those weapons in the 1950s this was a flyover problem in terms of the Arctic in Canada and they were going to hit the **United States**. Today if you hit Canada it would have just as disruptive an impact on **North America** as it would if you hit the if you hit the **United States**. The other is of course if we believe as Canadians that we don't want nuclear proliferation in the world and I cannot think of any reason why we would then we need to protect extended strategic nuclear deterrence from the **United States** to our partners and allies because if they believe that that extended nuclear deterrence is no longer credible then you will have partners and allies in both the **Indo-Pacific** and in Europe acquiring their own nuclear weapons and that cannot possibly be stable. izing for the world and we need to explain that an investment in continental defense and in national defense for Canada is an investment in **NATO** and to Wendy's point I think we've not communicated that well and it's not well understood general

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 所以那里有很多东西需要解读。我想补充几点。嘿，我们面对现实吧，美国不会消失，中国也不会消失，我们必须共存，但我们如何从实力地位或足够强大的地位共存，同时也要从对自己的信心地位共存。我见过世界上很多热点地区。很多国家陷入困境。很多失败和正在失败的国家。我们在加拿大过得很好。我们有一个拥有巨大优势的国家。我们只是需要，而且我们有一种盯着邻居看并自责的倾向。但是不，我们需要找到那种自信，并通过这个挑战看到自己。这些文件，国家安全战略和国家国防战略。国家国防战略昨天刚刚发布。每个政府都会发布它们。这是一个循环。这很好。这是他们的法律。我们可以从中学习一些东西。我的担忧，这又回到了我最初关于无序时期和误判的评论，因为潜在的对手会审视这些文件，看到对西半球的关注，这种误判是否会让他们有理由在他们自己的所谓势力范围内做些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: so there's a whole bunch there to unpack I want to add a few points um hey let's face it US is not going away China's not going away we're going to have to coexist but how do we coexist from a position of strength or being strong enough but also from a position of confidence in in ourselves. I've seen a lot of hot spots around the world. A lot of countries in trouble. A lot of failed and failing states. We've got it good here in Canada. We've got a country that's got a tremendous amount going for it. We just need to and we have a proclivity of gazing at our neighbors and and beating ourselves up. But no, we need to find that self that sense of confidence and and and see ourselves through this challenge. These documents, national security strategy and national defense strategy. National Defense Strategy came out yesterday. Every administration puts them out. It's a cycle. It's good. It's in their law. We can learn something from that. My concern, and it goes back to my initial comment about a period of disorder and and and miscalculation as potential adversaries look at these documents and see the focus on the **Western Hemisphere**, could that miscalculation be giving them license to do something in their own in their own so-called sphere of influence?

**Steve Pacin**: 你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: What do you think?

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 台湾。东欧，俄罗斯的混合战争，你知道，夺取一些前苏联领土。嗯，不知道。挑战之一是，我们有一些对手，一些独裁者，他们周围都是唯唯诺诺的人，他们分享相同的世界观。任何竞争性的观点，嗯，如果你足够幸运没有从窗户掉下去，嗯。

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Taiwan. Eastern Europe, Russian hybrid warfare, you know, seizing some of the former Soviet territories. Um don't know.

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以如果我能很快插一句，对我来说，过去几周关于**特朗普总统**威胁格陵兰的喧嚣令人心碎，因为存在真正的威胁。俄罗斯正在乌克兰发动一场活跃的冲突。每天都有平民和军人死亡。过去几周我们没有谈论乌克兰。我们一直在谈论美国对格陵兰的所谓威胁。我们没有关注一些对加拿大和西方联盟构成真实和切实威胁的最紧迫的国际问题。相反，我们一直在集体地“内视”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So if I would just very quickly come in and say which to me is the the heartbreak over the last few weeks worth of churn with respect to **President Trump's** threats against Greenland because there are real threats. We have an active conflict in Ukraine perpetrated by Russia. We have deaths happening every day of civilians of military members. We haven't been talking about Ukraine for the last couple of weeks. We've been talking about some supposed threat from the **United States** toward Greenland. We haven't been looking at some of the most pressing international problems that pose real and tangible threats to Canada and to the **Western Alliance**. Instead, we've been naval gazing collectively.

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 让我在这里补充一个历史类比。没有哪个历史类比是完美的，但这个我认为我们可以从中学习一些东西。1950年的朝鲜战争，朝鲜在俄罗斯和当时的苏联以及共产主义中国的支持下，不相信韩国在美国的势力范围内。结果证明它确实在，看看发生了什么，同样的事情今天也可能发生。嗯。好的，让我在这里重新整理一下，因为对于那些迟到的人，我们想提醒大家，我们正在百年理工学院专门的航空航天校区的**庞巴迪航空航天中心**的A机库。它是**DARE**（道恩斯维尤航空航天创新与研究）的一部分。让我重新介绍我们的嘉宾。他们是退役的**Wayne Eyre将军**，他曾于2021年至2024年担任加拿大国防参谋长。**Wendy Gilmore**女士在这里，她曾担任**北约**国防投资助理秘书长，并在许多重要的对外事务岗位任职。**Christian Leuprecht**教授在这里，他是**加拿大皇家军事学院**和**皇后大学**的杰出教授。

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Let me just add a historical analogy here. No, no historical analogy is perfect, but this one I think we can learn something from it. Korea 1950 North Korea supported by Russia and or **Soviet Union** at the time and communist China did not believe that South Korea was in the **United States** sphere of interest. Well, it turned out it was and look what happened and the same thing could happen today. Hm. All right, let me just rerack here for a second because for those who join us late, we want to remind everybody here that we are in hangar A of the **Bombardier Center for Aerospace and Aviation** at **Centennial Colleg's** dedicated aerospace campus.

### 军事采购：F-35与“鹰狮”

**Steve Pacin**: 这是一个奇怪的方式来进入下一个话题。我们正在一月最后一个周末录制这个节目，这意味着昨晚在丰业银行体育馆，**Mitch Marner**在多伦多观众面前回归。奇怪的是，我在比赛现场，有人开始和我说话。他和我谈论什么？**Mitch Marner**的回归？不。他想和我谈论我们是否应该购买**F-35**还是瑞典的**鹰狮**飞机？这似乎是一个奇怪的谈话地点，但我的直觉是，如果有人在曲棍球比赛中提出这个问题，那么它已经达到了全国加拿大人都对这个难题着迷的程度。所以，好吧，让我们在这里花点时间。我们可以谈论这个问题几个小时，但我们不会。让我们在这里花点时间，谈谈我们是否应该购买多达88架**CF-35**，或者说**F-35**，来自美国，或者瑞典的选项是否更好。好的，Christian，你先开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Here's here's a weird way to get into this next subject. We are sitting here taping this in the last weekend of January, which means last night at the **Scotia Bank Arena**, **Mitch Mner** made his return for the to a Toronto audience. And strangely enough, I was at the game and some guy started to talk to me. What did he talk to me about? **Mitch Mner's** return? No. He wanted to talk to me about whether we should buy the **F-35s** or the **Swedish Griffin** plane? and seemed like an odd place to have that conversation, but my hunch is if somebody's raising it at a hockey game, then it has reached the level of interest where Canadians across the country are fascinated by this conundrum we now face. And so, well, let's take a moment here. We could talk about this for hours, but we're not going to. Let's take a moment here and talk about whether we should be buying as many as 88 **CF35s** or **F-35s**, excuse me, from the Americans or whether the **Swedish option** is a better way to go. Okay, Christian, start us off.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 所以，加拿大政府长期以来一直将国防投资作为一种经济战略。我们不是世界上唯一的国家。我认为权衡总是：它会是一个小写D和大写I，还是一个大写D和小写I？从本质上讲，政客们，无论是内阁、党团还是议会，都会考虑如果我投入所有这些钱，这对我有什么好处。但我们这里有一个奇怪的，我认为是受影响的工作。通常预算编制是这样的：你去找部门，进行威胁分析，试图弄清楚部门需要什么。在这里，我们决定要达到一个任意的支出点。嗯，我仍然不太确定总理办公室提出的那个数字是如何得出的，因为我的计算与他们的不同，但无论如何。所以现在我们正在努力弄清楚我们到底要花钱买什么。我认为这就是你节目的重要之处，对吧？所以要问这个对话，问目的是什么？是为了保护大陆吗？是为了力量投射吗？是为了贡献战争，以便我们可以讨好美国和其他盟友吗？还是首先是为了在我们的生活水平可能下降以及类似挑战的时候推动加拿大经济？这些都是具有挑战性的政治权衡。我认为我们总是需要记住，而且我认为这也是我从将军和温迪那里得到的启示，那就是将军们通常不喜欢我这样说，加拿大武装部队首先不是一个国防组织。他们是一个政治工具。**北约**也是如此。**北美和大西洋理事会**是**北约**的最高民事权力机构。它最终由政客们支配，以实现他们认为符合国家最佳利益的政治目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So, Canadian governments have a long history of using defense investments really as an economic strategy. And we're not the only country in the world. And I think the trade-off is always is it going to be a lowercase D and a capital I or is it going to be a capital D and a lowercase I? And inherently, um, politicians, whether it's cabinet, caucus or parliament, are going to be looking at what is this going to be doing for me if I'm going to be investing all this money. But we have a curious I think affected work here. Usually budgeting works by you go to the department, you do a threat analysis, you try to figure out what the department needs. Here we decided we're going to get to an arbitrary spending point. Um, and I'm still not quite sure how we came up with the figure that the prime minister's office is throwing out there because my math works differently than theirs, but irrespective of that. And so now we're trying to figure out what we're actually going to be spend be spending it on. And I think that's sort of the important point of your of of the show, right? So asking the conversation, asking to what end? Is it to protect the continent? Is it for force projection? Is it for contribution warfare so we can curry favor with the **United States** and and and with other allies? Or is it first and foremost to drive the Canadian economy at a time sort of when we have challenges in terms of our possibly declining standard of living and and the like? And those are challenging political trade-offs. And I think we always need to remember, and I think this is also what I take away from General and from Wendy, that and generals usually don't like it when I say this, the the the **Canadian armed forces** are first and foremost not a defense organization. They are a political instrument. The same with **NATO**. The the the **North American and Atlantic Council** is the chief civilian authority over **NATO**. that it is ultimately at the disposal of politicians to achieve political ends that they believe to be in the best interest of the country.

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 这些确实需要国防，我打算……

**Christian Leuprecht**: 国防只是一个工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 在一个广泛的工具包中，我们越来越需要同时使用多种工具才能达到效果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: in a broad toolkit that increasingly we need to use multiple instruments together to achieve that effect.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 好的，我来回答这个问题。我们已经在购买**F-35**了。我们已经签订了初步合同，我几乎忘了是16架，我们正在接收，然后我们有权选择额外的飞机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: Okay, I'm going to answer the question. We are already buying the **F-35**. We are under contract for an initial and I almost forget 16 that we are coming in and we are then have an option for additional aircraft.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 其中一件事，Christian谈到了国防采购的一些挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: One of the things and and Christian spoke about some of the challenges for defense procurement.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我们需要停止自责我们已经做出的决定，我们现在就需要能力。**F-18 CF-18**已经到了其自然寿命的尽头。我们需要空中能力来保护我们自己的利益。现在，**F-35**存在一些问题，我可以指出，其中最重要的是美国的政治挑战。但持续地，我们是否能够获得必要的软件升级，你知道，如果美国人不想让我们拥有它，我们是否能够持续参与那架飞机？这是一个问题。无论我们使用什么技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: We need to stop beating ourselves up about decisions we've already taken and we need capability now. The **F-18 CF-18s** are coming to the end of their natural life. We need an air capability to protect our own interests. Now, there are issues with the **F-35** that I can identify, not the least of which is the political challenges of the states. But on an ongoing basis, are we able to get the necessary software upgrades, you know, ongoing engagement on that aircraft if the Americans don't want us to have it? That's an issue. No matter what technology we access,

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 不过你想要88架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: you want 88 of them, though.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 这不是我作为一名外交官、政治专家准备回答的问题。我们的空军应该能够说出这些是任务。这是我们履行这些任务所需的飞机数量。如果你不想给我们那么多飞机，那么这就是我们能执行的较小范围的任务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: That's not a question that I'm prepared to answer as a you know call it a diplomat political expert. Our air force should be able to say these are the tasks. This is how many aircraft government we need to fulfill those tasks. If you don't want to give us that many aircraft, this is the smaller box of tasks that we can perform.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 但空军不能做出政治判断，我认为不能做出政治判断，即我们现在如何应对美国对我们的刁难。所以首先是**F-35**，它将是**CF-35**，对吧，我认为无论如何，我们对**F-35**的命名是一架全球飞机，它有一个全球机队，它将在我们的许多**北约**盟友中使用，它在日本、澳大利亚和世界其他地方使用，那个全球机队将继续存在并得到维护，而且，你知道，情感上我可能会说，现在去他的美国人，因为我不喜欢你们的总统，但我们需要能力，这些飞机目前正在生产中，我们很快就会得到它们。如果我们坚持最初的合同，我们现在就已经在驾驶**F-35**了。这并不意味着我们不应该。现在，还有额外的资源，政府需要了解这些资源需要是什么，我们需要关注主权能力并回应我们自己的利益。但现在，让我们赶紧拿到那些该死的飞机。够了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: But the air force cannot make the political I don't think can not make the political judgment of how do we respond to the US screwing us over right now. So there is first of all the **F-35** it will be a **CF-35** right is I think anyway our designation of the **F-35** is a global aircraft there is a global fleet it is going to be in use in many of our **NATO** allies it's in use in Japan in Australia and elsewhere around the world that global fleet will continue to be there to be sustained and it is you know emotionally I'd perhaps say to hell with the Americans right now because I don't like your president, but we need capability and these aircraft are currently under production and we're going to get them soon. Had we stuck with the original contract, we'd already be flying the **F-35** right now. That doesn't mean to say is that we shouldn't. Now, there are additional resources and the government needs to understand what those resources need to be that we need to look at sovereign capabilities and answering to our own interests. But right now, let's just get the bloody aircraft. Enough.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 几点。嗯，让我谈谈Christian关于将军和政治的观点。嗯，你知道，战争是政治的延伸，正如**克劳塞维茨**所说，但军事服从于民选文职官员是民主国家军事专业主义的根本，我们服从命令，无论决定是什么，都会继续执行。我作为国防参谋长多次看到，我的建议没有被采纳，或者是在考虑了军事领域之外的其他因素后才被采纳。所以我们必须认识到这一点。其次，关于**F-35**，嘿，我们知道**F-35**是所有选项中最有能力的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Couple of points. Um hey let me address Christian's point about generals and politics. Um you know war is an extension of politics as as **Klausvitz** famously said but it is a fundamental of military professionalism in a democracy that the military is subservient to duly elected civilian officials and we follow orders and and drive on whatever the decision is. And I saw many times as chief of defense staff where my advice was not taken or it was taken in consideration of other factors well beyond the military sphere. And and so we have to realize that. Secondly, um on the **F-35** in particular, hey, we we we know the **F-35** is the the most capable of of the of the options

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 也是最贵的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: and most expensive.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的。我们看到**F-35**在伊朗上空被以色列人使用，穿透了他们的防空系统，并取得了进展。嗯，所以最终的决定将是一个政治决定，而不是军事决定。我们和军队将不得不接受任何决定。但话虽如此，我认为我们可以利用这个机会跳到下一代战斗机。我们需要思考战争特征的快速变化。战争是如何进行的，这得益于我之前谈到的快速技术变革。下一代战斗机，我们需要采用一种名为**协同作战飞机**的东西。所以，一架忠诚的僚机，它是一架无人机，与一架有人机相连，并将其作为跳板，跳到下一代完全无人驾驶的自主战斗机。对于一个有陆军背景的人来说，说这些很容易，尤其是在我身后有一大堆有飞行员的飞机的情况下。但是我认为这就是我们需要前进的方向，同时真正让加拿大航空航天工业参与进来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yes. And we saw that um we saw the **F-35s** in use over **Iran** from the **Israelis** penetrating their air defense and and and going ahead there. Um and so what decision is is going to be in the end of the day a political decision, not a military decision. And we and the military will have to live with whatever decision is made. But all that being said, I think we can use this as an opportunity to springboard to the next generation of fighters. We need to be thinking about the rapidly changing character of war. How wars are being fought which is underpinned by that rapid technological change I'm talking I've talked about before this next fighter we need to adopt something called the **collaborative combat aircraft**. So a loyal wingman that is an unmanned aircraft that is tethered to a a crude aircraft and use that as a springboard to the next generation of completely uncrrewed autonomous fighters. easy for a guy from an army background to say, especially with a whole bunch of aircraft behind me that had pilots. But I think that's where we need to go and at the same time um really engage Canadian aerospace industry on this.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 但让我问一个后续问题。瑞典提出，如果我们购买他们的飞机，他们就会在这里建造。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: But let me ask the followup. Sweden is offering that if we build their if we buy their plane, they'll build it here.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 这应该影响我们的决策吗？嗯，从政治层面来看，你必须决定能力比就业更重要。嗯，如果我们看看**鹰狮**，嗯，它现在是一架很棒的飞机，嗯，它可能落后于大多数现代飞机半代，但我们将拥有这架飞机20、30、40年。嗯，那时它会在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Should that matter in our decision-making? Well, from a political level, you have to decide is capability more important than jobs. Um, and if we take a look at the **Grippin**, um, a great aircraft for right now, um, is probably half it is half a generation behind of of most modern, but we're going to have this aircraft for 20, 30, 40 years. Uh, where's it going to be then?

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 温迪，你的看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Wendy, what's your view?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以，在采购时间线上，我花了一些时间在采购领域，所以我不能替他们说话，但我可以谈论他们。我们现在有一个问题。我们有一个五年后的问题。然后我们有一个更长期的，称之为发展，技术漂移问题。现在的问题是我们目前的**CF-18**的寿命以及我们现在提供能力的需求。我们正在，也许我不会过多地偏离话题，但我们现在正在与俄罗斯发生冲突。我们加拿大正面临混合攻击。我们在欧洲的盟友每天都面临混合攻击。俄罗斯人正在测试**北约**的防御能力。如果需要，我们必须在很短的时间内拥有能力投入战斗。我们购买飞机可能要用25-30年，除非我们处于一种情况，即出现严重的损耗，在这种情况下，这些飞机可能明天就没了，我们需要一些东西来接替它们。所以，我们需要能够同时走路和嚼口香糖，也就是说，我们现在就需要一支机队。我们几年后就需要一支机队，这就是我们已经签订合同将接收的那些飞机。然后我们需要考虑我们如何与盟友定位自己，因为加拿大从**Avro Arrow**的故事中学到的一件事是，我们自己没有资源来开发一种完全独特的能力。所以，我们必须选择我们将合作的伙伴，但我们也需要在加拿大拥有制造和先进制造能力。坦率地说，这是**F-35**迄今为止为我们做的事情之一。我的意思是，我最终如果签订了**鹰狮**的合同，我会说让我们继续使用**鹰狮**。我只是相信要继续做我们说过要做的事情。但我们，我最喜欢引用的一句话是，在1939年，我们根本没有造船业可言。到1945年，我们是世界第四大造船国。我们现在所在的这个设施在短短几年内生产了数千架飞机。我认为我们现在需要的是加拿大公众向我们的政府提供必要的政治意愿，以重建我们的军队，重建加拿大的能力，同时确保我们拥有持续维持它的制造能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So, in a procurement timeline, and I spent a little bit of time in a procurement world, so I can't speak for them, but I can speak about them. We have a now problem. We have a fiveyear out problem. And then we have a longer term, call that the development, the technological drift problem. The now problem is the lifespan of our current **CF-18s** and our need to provide capability right now. We are in and maybe I'll not skew the conversation too much, but we're in a conflict with Russia right now. We as Canada are facing hybrid attacks. Our allies in Europe are facing daily hybrid attacks. The Russians are testing the defenses of **NATO**. We need to have capability to bring to the flight to the fight in a very short order if that were required. We're buying aircraft possibly for the next 2530 years unless we are in a situation in which there is significant attrition in which case those aircraft could be gone tomorrow and we would need something to follow them. So, we need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, which is we need a fleet now. We need a fleet a few years from now, which is what we'll get out of the ones that we're already under contract to receive. Then we need to think about how are we positioning ourselves with allies because the one thing that Canada has learned back with the **Avro Arrow** story is that we do not have the resources ourselves to develop a completely unique capability. So, we have to choose the partners we're going to work with, but we also need manufacturing and advanced manufacturing capabilities in Canada. And that's frankly one of the things the **F-35** has done for us to date. And I I mean, I have ultimately if we were under contract to take the **Griffin**, I'd say let's carry on with the **Grippin**. I just believe in getting on with doing what we've said we were going to do. But we went, one of my favorite things to quote is in 1939, we had no ship building industry to speak of whatsoever. By 1945, we were the fourth largest ship builder in the world. This facility that we're sitting on right now was producing thousands of aircraft that was developed over the course of a short couple of years. What I believe we need right now is the Canadian public to provide the political will necessary to our government to get on with the bu business of reconstituting our forces, rebuilding Canadian capability and at the same time making sure we have the manufacturing ability to continue to sustain it.

**Steve Pacin**: 最后简单说一句。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Last quick word on this.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 所以，从质量上讲，**鹰狮**和**F-35**是完全不同的实体。**F-35**是一个数字平台，除了其他功能外，它还能飞行。所以，在采购方面，有三件事是你想要完成的，对吧？你想要按时完成，有成本，还有能力，这些都是困难的权衡。我想说，在大多数采购项目中，你必须在其中一个方面做出妥协，但在加拿大，我们似乎永远无法做到这三者中的任何一个。让我告诉你，我们在华盛顿的同事和盟友们，每次我们撤回承诺时，都会让他们完全抓狂。加拿大不断做出表演性声明，然后又撤回，其声誉成本，特别是对加拿大而言，最终是无法估量的。我将以此结束。我的一位美国同事喜欢说，最终在国防问题上，由人民决定，人民被允许犯错。问题是，我想说，在这个国家的军民关系方面，以及对我们的国防参谋长所面临的非常具有挑战性的情况表示尊重，我们生活在一个需要国防和安全机构与政治权力之间进行更强有力对话的时代。在我看来，我们一直过于顺从，因为这些组织也有责任向加拿大人解释我们所处的快速变化的威胁环境，包括动能、核能和混合威胁，以及我们所采取的非常“顺势疗法”的姿态。而这个节目的重要性恰恰在于此，因为如果我们要花费数十亿用于国防，并可能要求加拿大人为此做出重大牺牲，我们就需要为这些支出获得社会许可。我不确定这些组织和机构，或者我们的政治领导层是否已经做了足够的努力。但我认为我们开始在一些政治言论中看到这一点。我想提醒在座的各位，我将在这里进行最后一轮讨论，然后我们会在中间放置一个麦克风，届时我们将回答大家的问题。所以，让我们在这里做最后一件事，那就是，我想知道你的愿望清单是什么。将军，我们显然将在未来几年花费数百亿美元重新武装和振兴我们的军队。你希望把这些钱花在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So qualitatively the **Grippen** and the **F-35** are completely different entities. Um the **F-35** is a digital platform that among other things happens to fly. So um we also in terms of procurement there's three things you want to accomplish right you want to get it on a timeline there's the cost and there's the capabilities and those are difficult trade-offs and I would say on most procurement projects you have to compromise on one of those it seems in Canada we can never do any three of those and let me tell you our colleagues in Washington and among allies it drives them completely insane every time we walk back a commitment and the reputational cost in particular to Canada of constantly making performative announcements and then walking them back is ultimately incalculable in terms of the consequences that we suffer from that. And I I'll close on this. One of my US colleagues like to say ultimately when it comes to defense, it's up to the people to decide and the people are allowed to be wrong. The problem is I would say in terms of civil military relations in this country and with all respect to the very challenging circumstances that our chiefs of defense staff find themselves in, we live in an era where we need to have a much more robust conversation between the defense and security establishment and the political authority. And in my view, we have been too subservient because it is also up to the to to the organizations to explain to Canadians the rapidly changing threat environment kinetic um nuclear hybrid that we are living in and the very homeopathic posture that we have. And the importance of the program here is precisely to do that because if we're going to spend billions on defense and possibly asking Canadians to make significant sacrifices in order to do that, we need to get social license for those expenditures. And I'm not sure that the organizations and the institutions or our political leadership has done enough of the heavy lifting. But I think we're starting to see that out of some of the discourse politically. I want to give this audience the heads up that I'm going to do one more round up here and then we'll put a microphone in the middle right there and uh we'll get you to take uh we'll take your questions at that point. So, let's do one last thing here and that is okay. I want to know what's on your wish list. General, we're apparently going to be spending tens of billions of dollars over the next x number of years rearming and reinvigorating our military. What do you want to spend that money on?

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 我们有多少时间？

### 军事开支的愿望清单

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 好的。嘿，所以首先，我们的战略文化正在改变，我们需要更多地关注本土。我们迄今为止的战略文化本质上是远征型的，我们更喜欢客场作战而不是主场作战。而现在，主场作战绝对是第一优先事项，所以我们需要知道正在发生什么。所以，我们所说的“全域感知”，从太空到海底，特别是在北极地区。所以，传感器技术，北方的基础设施，以便我们能够从南方投射能力。我不是在谈论在北方建立永久基地，而是通过从南方向北方投射能力来实现持续存在。我们需要保持一些远征能力，以便我们能够帮助影响新兴秩序，从而在谈判桌上占有一席之地，或者至少能够向在谈判桌上的人耳语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Okay. Hey, so firstly our strategic culture is changing and we need to be focused much more at home. Our strategic culture up to now has been expeditionary in nature and we've preferred away games to home home games. While the home game now is absolutely number one priority so we need to know what's happening. So all what we call all domain awareness from space to the seabed especially in the Arctic. So sensor technology infrastructure in the north so that we can project capabilities from the south. I'm not talking about permanent basing in the north but persistent presence by projecting capabilities from the south to the north. We need to maintain um some expeditionary capability so that we can help influence the emerging order so that we have a seat at the table or at least can whisper in the ear to somebody who's got a seat at the table.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 那需要多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: How many people would that require?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，你知道，我现在不准备给出具体数字。但肯定比我们现在拥有的要多。也许10万到12万的常备军。但是不要，不要引用我的话。我想现在说这个已经太晚了。嗯，但随着战争特征的不断演变，还有许多能力与之相关。更多的自主系统。你知道，我们习惯于投资这些非常昂贵、高端、精密的系统，如果你在战斗的最初几周就损失了它们，那对你来说会很糟糕。我们需要更多地投资于大规模生产的可消耗系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Um you know I'm not prepared to to put a number out right now. Uh but certainly more than what we've got now. 100,000 120,000 regulars perhaps. Uh but don't but don't quote me on that. I guess it's too late to say that. Um but there's a number of capabilities with the evolving again the evolving character of war that goes with it. Far more autonomous systems. You know we've we've got a habit of investing in these really expensive high-end exquisite systems that if you lose your um loss in the first weeks of combat you're it's going to be bad for you. We need to invest much more in mass-produced attractable systems.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 可消耗的意思是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Attitudable meaning

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 意思是你可以毫无问题地损失它们。想想乌克兰的无人机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: meaning they can you can lose them without problem. Think drones in Ukraine.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，你知道，5万美元的无人机，如果你损失了，那就这样吧。但如果你摧毁了一辆200万美元的坦克，那太棒了，干得好，因为这里正在发生国防经济学。所以，我们确实需要一些高端的精密系统，但我们也必须投资于那些快速变化的大规模生产系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Um you know $50,000 drone that if you lose so be it. But if you take out a $2 million tank, well excellent, good on you because there's an economics of defense that's happening here. So, we do need some of those high-end exquisite systems, but we also got to invest in those rapidly changing mass-roduced systems.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 明白了。好的。温迪，你的清单上有什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Gotcha. Okay. Wendy, what's on your list?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以，我一生大部分时间都在做官僚。我的清单上是一个有权做出快速决策的系统和流程，它能够根据需要进行演变。我们经常和**北约**谈论时间。这就是相关的速度。所以我们需要一个能够以相关速度运行的系统，那是非常快的。政府已经承诺给我们一个国防投资机构，它将是一个单一的决策者。建立这个机构仍然存在很多挑战。这不全是关于流程。我的意思是，无论你有什么流程，如果你有政治意愿去做出决策并推动事情发展，它就会很快发生。所以我的愿望清单是清晰明确的决策能力，能够做出决策，并以一种能够让我们适应必要速度的方式做出决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So, I spent much of my life as a bureaucrat. What's on my list is a system and process that is empowered to make rapid decisions that can evolve as it's need to. We we talk to **NATO** a lot about the time. It's the speed of relevance. So we need a system that can move at the speed of relevance which is bloody fast. Um we have been promised a defense investment agency by the government that is to be a single decision maker. There's still a lot of challenges with standing up that apparatus. It's not all about process. I mean it doesn't matter what process you have. If you have the political will to take decisions and move things out, it will happen quickly. So my wish list is clear unambiguous decision-making ability to make decisions and to make them in such a way that we can evolve to to meet the speed of what is necessary.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你能给我们举个例子吗？那会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Can you give us a for instance on that? What does that look like?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 嗯，举个例子，我们已经看到了一点，我认为这有点令人鼓舞，那就是政府已经表示，好吧，我们需要潜艇能力，不仅仅是为了替换我现有的潜艇，而是为了建立这种能力。所以他们非常迅速地行动，而不是通过一个漫长的、优先保护采购风险的流程，他们说我们已经筛选出两个不同的供应商，一个在韩国，一个在德国，现在正在进行一个非常快速的流程，说好吧，给我们你们最好的报价，我们将做出决定，我希望看到的实际结果是，我们将做出一个决定，这对那些失败的人来说可能不好，但无论如何我们已经做出了决定，我们将继续前进，我们将尽快让那艘潜艇投入运营，形成能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: Well, a for instance, we've already seen a little bit of it which is I would say slightly encouraging which is the government has said all right we need a submarine capability to not just replace the one I have but to build that capability. So in very rapid order they went instead of going through a long process that is prioritized to to protect against procurement risk they've said we have two we've down selected to two different suppliers one in Korea one in Germany there's a very expedited prices process going on right now to say all right give us your bested best bids that you can and we're going to take a decision and what I would like to see the the practical outcome is we're gonna make a decision and it's not going to be good for the people that lose but whatever we've made a decision and we're going to go ahead and we're going to get that submarine into, you know, operations into a capability as soon as as possible.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 最后一个后续问题，最终。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: And one last followup, at the end of the day,

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: yeah,

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 是国防部长做出决定吗？是总理做出决定吗？谁做出决定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: does the Minister of Defense make that call? Does the Prime Minister make the call? Who makes the call?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以，为**加拿大军队**购买或以其他方式获取能力的法律权力属于**加拿大公共服务和采购部长**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So, the legal authority to buy or otherwise acquire capability for the **Canadian Forces** is the **Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 哦，都不是。所以最终这些类型的决定往往是内阁决定，但内阁需要做的是说出我们的标准，让流程评估投标，无论哪个符合标准，我们都继续推进，而不是像我们多次看到的那样，包括现在**F-35**的情况，我们一遍又一遍地回去重新审视标准。是的，情况会变，事情会发生，但在某个时候，为了获得像我们身后这样的真实设备，你实际上需要做出决定并付诸实施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacy**: Oh, neither one. So ultimately though these types of decisions tend to be a cabinet decision but what cabinet needs to do is say here are our criteria let the process assess the bids whichever one meets that criteria then let's move on with it as opposed to what we've seen many many times including with the **F-35** right now is that we go back and we revisit the criteria over and over again. Yes, circumstances change, things happen, but at some point in order to get real pieces of equipment like we have behind us, you actually need to make a decision and just do it.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 明白了。Christian，你的清单上有什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Gotcha. Christian, what's on your list?

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 三件简单的事情。第一件是，我们在第二次世界大战结束后，拥有世界上第四大军队，如果你不算已经被彻底击败的德国国防军的话。我们对自己说，我们在20世纪上半叶所经历的，这不是我们想生活的世界。我们积极投资于治国工具和多边机构，以塑造20世纪下半叶的环境。我想说我们已经忘记了这个机会。我们正在被动反应。我们没有主动权。我们如何才能重新获得主动权？哪里有加拿大政治家，真正对我们希望在未来5年、10年和25年生活的国家和世界有愿景和战略，以及我们将为此进行的投资？我能请你回答这个问题吗？你现在看到这样的政治家了吗？嗯，无论好坏，尽管我们想抨击我们的一些美国同事，我总是喜欢说，你看，我们中没有人，至少我不是双重国籍，所以我没有投票权。你知道，对美国发生的事情进行道德说教是没有帮助的。但至少在美国，无论好坏，关于美国的未来以及美国希望成为什么样的国家以及它应该在世界上扮演什么角色，都有非常活跃的政治对话。显然，**特朗普政府**无论对错，都决定我们将在这个非常不同的世界中扮演一个非常不同的角色，这与过去的连续性有所不同。第二，另外两个关键点。我做了多少次像你这样的节目，人们说我们应该为和平而努力？我们不应该把钱投入国防。我想说，这正是让我们陷入困境的原因。因为这句话的隐含意思是，如果我们遇到麻烦，美国人会为我们解决。如果我们采取这种方法，那么我们就会回到你一开始带我们去的地方，我已故的同事**尼尔斯·奥尔维克**。来自帮助的防御。我们投资什么？投资于防御美国政府说“让我们帮助你”的情况的能力。因为当美国进来并说“让我们帮助你”时，当涉及到我们的国家安全，无论是金融犯罪、卡特尔、人口贩运，还是国防等等，我们都在因此而损害我们自己的政治和经济主权。而且无论对错，华盛顿对加拿大的不满远远早于现任**特朗普政府**。所以，这是一项对“来自帮助的防御”的投资。这是一项对我们政治经济主权的投资。回到1775年，英国军队支持我们当时的“我们”。今天，没有人支持我们。最终，作为加拿大人，我们想要拥有和保护什么样的主权，以及我们希望这个国家扮演什么样的角色，完全取决于我们自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Three quick things. The first is we came out of **World War II** with the fourth largest military in the world if you don't count the VM having been resoundingly defeated. And we said to ourselves, what we experienced during the first half of the 20th century, this is not the world that we want to live in. And we invested aggressively in instruments of statecraftraft and in multilateral institutions to shape the environment of the second half of the 20th century. And I would say we have forgotten the opportunity. We are reacting. We don't have the initiative. How do we get back the initiative? Where's the Canadian politician that actually has a vision and a strategy of the country and the world that we want to live in 5, 10, and 25 years from now and the investments that we are going to make to that end? Can I just ask you to answer that question? Do you see that politician out there right now? Well, for better or for worse, as much as we want to impugn some of our US colleagues, and I always like to say, look, none of us, at least I'm not a dual citizen, so I don't get a vote. You know, moralizing what happens in the **United States** is not helpful. But at least in the **United States**, for better or for worse, there's a very active political conversation about the future of the **United States** and what country America wants to be and what role it should play in the world. And clearly the **Trump administration** right or wrongly has decided we are going to play a very different role in this very different world from sort of breaking with with past continuity. The second the two other key points. How many shows like yours have I done where people say we should be working for peace? We shouldn't be putting money into defense. And I would say this is exactly what gets us in trouble. Because implicit in that statement is the Americans will do it for us if we get in trouble. And if we take that approach, then we're exactly back to when you took us at the beginning, my late colleague **Neils Orvik**. Defense from help. What are we investing in? In capabilities to defending ourselves from circumstances where the US administration says, "Let us help you." Because when the US comes in and says, "Let us help you." When it comes to our national security, whether it comes to financial crime, to cartels, to human trafficking, to defense and whatnot, we are compromising our own political and economic sovereignty as a result. And rightly or wrongly, the frustration in Washington with Canada goes well back well beyond the current **Trump administration**. And so this is an investment in defense from help. This is an investment in our political economic sovereignty. And to play it full circle coming back to 1775, British troops had our whoever our was at the time our back. Today there's no one that has our back. It is entirely up to us as Canadians what sovereignty we ultimately want to have and protect and what role we want this country to play.

**Zach**: 嗯，Zach，来自多伦多。我的问题是，**F-35**采购的拖延与贸易协议以及将其作为诱饵有多大关系？军事采购多久用于贸易谈判？谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zach**: Uh Zach Toronto. Uh my question to the uh to the panel is how much of the holding of the procurement for **F-35** is in relation to the trade deal and using that as a carrot and how often are military procurements used for trade negotiations. Thank you.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 所以，形式上它们当然是完全脱钩的。你问到过去，最近的一个例子是，当**波音公司**对加拿大，美国对加拿大采取我们认为非常不公平的贸易行为时。加拿大政府颁布了一项政策，规定公司如果行为不符合加拿大利益，就不应该参与公共采购。话虽如此，加拿大政府内部当然正在进行一项计算，试图了解他们如何与美国接触，以保护我们所需的东西，即进入美国市场，因为坦率地说，我们更广泛的经济主权，我们自己的经济稳定目前仍然基于进入美国市场。所以，这是我们政府面临的一个艰难决定，但两者之间没有直接联系。他们将在这个过程中考虑一整套不同的能力和不同的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: So formally they are of course completely disconnected. Um you asked about in the past the one of the recent examples was uh when um **Boeing** was pursuing what we felt to be very unfair trade practices against Canada, the **United States** against Canada. Um there was a a policy enacted by the Canadian government that said uh where companies are not acting in Canada's interest, they should not be part of public procurement. Um that said, there is of course a calculus going on inside the government of Canada trying to understand how do they get to a point in engaging with the **United States** that we can protect what we need which is access to the American market because there's a broader economic sovereignty frankly our own economic stability is based at the moment still because of access to the US market. So it's uh it's a difficult decision that our government has but there's no direct line from one to the other. They'll be looking at a whole suite of different capabilities and different decisions as part of that process.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian，Zach，我对加拿大在这方面的沮丧之处在于。对吧。所以，回到**Avro Arrow** **F-35**，投入了你和我的数亿美元税款。嗯，潜艇决定，德国挪威联盟正在一家总部位于加拿大的公司编写其软件。我们即将与**加拿大核实验室**以合同结构的方式进行。我们在加拿大这里产生了加拿大知识产权，世界领先的知识产权，然后我们实际上把它送走了，我们要么决定不采购这项技术，我们只是放弃它，要么我们以不保护它的方式构建我们的知识产权合同，或者我们有研究安全，这实际上让我们的对手中国和伊朗获取了这些知识产权。所以我认为我们已经对这项技术进行了投资，为什么我们要放弃它，考虑到我们已经，这是我们的投资回报，这就是我们如何保持一个高科技创新国家，因为如果你看看知识产权，如果你看看美国相对于加拿大、我们在**印太地区**的合作伙伴和我们在欧洲的盟友产生了多少知识产权，领先的知识产权开发仍然在美国，所以这取决于我们，如果我们已经投资了它，我们不妨把它留在这里并加以利用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian Zach, here's my frustration with Canada on this. Right. So, going back to the **Avro Arrow** **F-35** invested hundreds of millions of you and my tax dollars. Um, the submarine decision, the **German Norwegian Consortium** is writing its software in a company headquartered in Canada. We're about to do it with **Canadian Nuclear Laboratories** in in the way that contract is structured. We generate Canadian intellectual property, worldleading intellectual property here in Canada and then we effectively give it away and we either decide we're not going to procure the technology, we're just going to walk away from it or we structure our IP contracts in ways that doesn't protect it or we have research security that effectively lets our adversaries in China and Iran take that intellectual property. And so I think the investments that we have already made in the technology why would we walk away from it given that we've already this is our return on investment this is how we remain a high-tech innovation country because if you look at the intellectual property and you look at how much of it is generated in the **United States** relative to Canada our partners in the **Indo-Pacific** and our allies in Europe the leading IP development remains in the **United States** and so it's up to us that if we're already investing in it, we might as well keep it here and capitalize on it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicholas**: Um, my question is regarding um recently India and Russia signed an Arctic trade or Arctic defense agreement giving them access to Arctic naval ports and logistics. Um, how must Canada think about nonarctic state actors getting invested interest in the Arctic? Now,

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我可以开始，但，是的，你先说，我再补充。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I can start, but but yeah, you go ahead and I'll jump in.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 嗯，所以，加拿大迄今为止的政策是，北极国家应该在管理方面拥有第一发言权。坦率地说，北极人民拥有第一发言权，北极国家在管理这片领土方面拥有发言权。嗯，我无法评论印度和俄罗斯的协议。我不熟悉它。但是，我们的立场将继续是，北极的首要利益必须是居住在那里的人民，保护他们的利益是我们的责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: Um, so, uh, Canadian policy to date has been that the Arctic nations should have the first voice in the management. Frankly, Arctic peoples have the first voice and Arctic nations have the voice in the management of this territory. Um I can't speak to the India Russia u agreement. I'm not familiar with it. But uh but our position would continue to be that the the primary interest in the Arctic has to be the people that live there and it's our responsibility to protect their interests.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 将军。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: General.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的。所以很像中国，他们对资源开采和航运路线有兴趣。嗯，随着气候变化在那里产生影响，再次从战略时间线思考，几十年后会发生什么？嗯，你会看到鱼类蛋白质向北迁移。所以，就像中国在世界各地拥有的破坏性捕鱼船队一样，那些船队也会向北移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yeah. So much like China they have an interest for resource extraction and and shipping routes. Um as and again thinking in strategic timelines. So decades ahead as as much as climate change has an effect up there. um what's going to happen? Well, you're going to see fish protein migrate north. And so, much like the the devastating fishing fleets that China has across the world, well, those will move north as well.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 而且印度也在关注这一点。所以，是的，我们需要关注在我们的后院，在北极地区发生的事情。它可能不在加拿大的**专属经济区（EEZ）**内，但肯定足够近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: And India is looking at that as well. And so, yeah, we need to be concerned about what happens in in our backyard in the in the Arctic. It may not be within the Canada's **EEZ** but certainly close enough.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: **专属经济区（EEZ）**，嗯，专属……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: **EEZ** um exclusive

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 专属经济区。抱歉使用了缩写。嗯，中国在北极进行了大量的研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: exclusive economic zone. Sorry for the acronyms. Um, China has been doing a tremendous amount of research in the Arctic.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，几艘船，**蛟龙2号**，每年夏天都在那里。事实上，他们可能比美国人在许多地方对海底有更好的了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Uh, a couple of ships, the **Jou Long 2** have been up there every summer. Uh, in fact, they probably have a better picture of the seabed than than the Americans do in many places.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 那么，那是为了什么？资源开采，潜艇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: So, what's that for? Resource extraction, submarines.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的，很多都是军民两用。Christian。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yeah, a lot of it's dual use. Christian.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 是的，我认为这位总统我们需要能够在北极地区维护我们的主权，对抗那些显然对北极有着非常积极，在某些情况下相当侵略性兴趣的人。但我也认为我们需要将其置于背景中。所以每个人都喜欢谈论**西北航道**。如果你去过那里并见过**西北航道**，你会知道它太浅太窄，不适合我们今天的大型集装箱船。当你离开**西北航道**后会发生什么？嗯，你就在格陵兰。你距离下一个重要的港口基础设施有数百英里。第三，你实际上无法支付通过北方的保险费率，因为它，嗯，想象一下如果你在那里发生事故，你最终必须清理它。所以我认为我们还需要将其置于背景中，是的，对手有浓厚的兴趣，但那将如何在这样一个难以进入且相对而言需要加拿大政府在关键基础设施方面进行巨大投资才能使其对人们有利可图的地区实际体现出来，这当然与你的前任非常不同，我认为他有一句名言，你知道，如果这些对手之一部署到北极，他会做的第一件事是什么？他会派出一个搜救队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Yeah, I think this president we need to be able to assert our sovereignty in the Arctic against clearly people who have a very active and in some cases quite aggressive interests in the Arctic. But I also think we need to keep that in context. So everybody loves to talk about the **Northwest Passage**. If you've been up there and you've seen the **Northwest Passage**, you know it is too shallow and it is too narrow for the large container ships that we have today. What happens when you get out of the **Northwest Passage**? Well, you're in Greenland. you are hundreds of miles away from the next serious port infrastructure. And the third is you can't actually pay the insurance rates to go through the north because it is um imagine if you have sort of an accident up there and you ultimately have to clean that up. So I think we also need to keep in context yes adversaries have a keen interest but how that will actually manifest in an area that is really hard to access and relatively would require huge investments I think by the Canadian government in ter of critical infrastructure to make it profitable for for people to invest something very different of course your predecessor I think has a famous quote about like you know if if one of these adversaries deployed to the Arctic what's the first thing that he would do he would send out a search party

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的，嗯，搜救，这是另一个重要点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: yeah well search and rescue which is Another important point.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 嗯，因为国家主权的体现是能够在自己的领土内进行搜救。如果你不这样做，其他人就会做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Uh because a manifestation of national sovereignty is the ability to to do search and rescue within your own territory. And if you don't do it, somebody else will.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 我九月份在台湾待了一周。我看到了中国利用“船只遇险”制造危机，逐步侵蚀台湾主权。船只遇险，派遣中国搜救队进入台湾水域。嗯，这也许是未来几年我们北方的一个模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: I was in Taiwan for a week in September. And I saw manufactured crises of of ships in trouble that China was exploiting to gradually erode Taiwanese sovereignty. ship in trouble dispatch Chinese search and rescue into Taiwanese waters. Um there's a model perhaps for our our north in the years to come.

**Steve Pacin**: We've got a bit of a line here. So I want to encourage nice snappy questions and nice snappy answers too if I can. Go ahead please.

</details>

**George**: 大家好，我是来自沃恩的George。我也想对Steve和各位嘉宾说声谢谢，感谢你们在这次寒潮中前来。非常感谢。嗯，很快地，你们能谈谈加拿大的工业战略和我们一直在努力实施的双重用途政策吗？以及我们的盟友对这个话题的参与程度如何？你们能提一下这项政策可能面临的障碍吗？谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George**: Hi George from Vaughn. I just also want toh say thank you Steve for being here and to the panel. Thank you for coming out during this cold snap that we've been having. So appreciate it. Uh just very quickly, can you speak to the industrial strategy that Canada has and the dual use policy that we've been trying to implement and how on board our allies are on this topic and can you just mention the roadblocks that this policy might have? Thank you.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 所以我认为第一个障碍是政策的出台。我们圣诞节前听说它会在圣诞节前出台。没说哪一年。嗯，但我认为当战略出台时，我们应该会很高兴，嗯，但在此之前，我们真的无法谈论它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: So I think the first roadblock is getting the policy out. Um we heard before Christmas that it was going to be out by Christmas. Didn't say what year. Uh but I think when the when the strategy comes out we we should be happy and um but until then we can't really talk about it.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我只想说，这是一项国防工业战略。它的首要目的是确保我们拥有支持**加拿大武装部队**所需的工业基础。它的第二个目的是确保我们正在保护加拿大本土的知识产权和其他加拿大所需的技术。它的第三个优先事项是帮助加拿大经济并确保我们获得经济利益。我只是想确保这些优先事项不会颠倒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I I would just say it is a defense industrial strategy. Its first purpose should be to make sure that we have the industrial base necessary to support the **Canadian armed forces**. Its second purpose is to make sure that we are protecting the indigenous intellectual property, the other technology that is Canadian that we need. and his third priority is to help the Canadian economy and make sure we have economic benefit. I just want to make sure that those those priorities are not reversed.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 这位先生今天穿的衬衫很应景。好的，我们开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: This guy's got the right shirt for today. Okay, here we go.

</details>

**观众**: 开始。是的。我们确实生活在一个伟大的国家。这就是我穿这件衣服的原因。我认为记住这一点很有帮助。我想小组中也提到了这一点。还有北极。我曾在**努纳武特**生活过。我在那里见过人们。嗯，只是想知道你是否能多谈谈**游骑兵**，他们的参与，以及如何与**因纽特人**及其参与更多地发展，因为他们一直参与北极主权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**观众**: Start. Yes. Uh we do live great country. That's why I wore that. I think it's helpful to remember. I think that was mentioned on the panel. And the Arctic. Um I lived up in **Nunvid**. I saw people there. And uh just wondering if you could talk more about the **rangers** their involvement and how is how is more um being developed with with the **Inuit** people and their involvement as they have been with with Arctic sovereignty

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 将军。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: general.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的。所以，对于不熟悉**游骑兵**的人来说，他们是一个很棒的组织。全国大约有5000人，其中一千多人分布在北极地区。他们生活在社区中。他们是兼职预备役人员。他们是加拿大军队遍布我们国家边远地区的耳目和向导。他们在**加拿大皇家骑警（RCMP）**和地面搜救方面提供了很多帮助，他们的作用将随着我们越来越关注北极安全而继续发展。但正如我们在过去几十年中看到的那样，他们为加拿大提供了巨大的服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yeah. So the the **rangers** for everybody who is not familiar with them they are a great organization. Um about 5,000 across the country just over a thousand up in the Arctic area. They live in the communities. They are part-time reservists. They are the eyes, ears, and guides for the Canadian military across the extremities of our country. They help a lot with with **RCMP** and ground search and rescue, and their role is going to continue to evolve as we focus more and more on on Arctic security. Uh but as we've seen over the course of the last number of decades, they provide tremendous service to Canada.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian，很好的后续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian, good followup.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 北方居住的人口与我老家**金斯顿**的人口差不多。他们是极其脆弱的社区。但如果你和他们交谈，他们的优先事项是什么？当你和他们谈论安全和国防时，他们关注的是人类安全问题，是粮食安全，是能源安全。这又回到了之前的问题，我们需要投资的是双重用途。所以在北方，最终是多用途投资，投资于关键基础设施和技术，这些需要造福我们的地方准主权伙伴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: There's about as many people who live in the north as live in my hometown of **Kingston**. um and they are extremely vulnerable communities. But if you talk to them, what is their priority? When you talk to them about security and defense, it's human security issues, it's food security, it's energy security. And that gets back to the previous question that what we need to invest in is dual use. So in the north, it is multi-use ultimately investments in critical infrastructure and in technology that need to benefit our local quasi sovereign partners.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 非常好。谢谢你的提问。下一位，请。大家好，我是Aiden。我的问题是，加拿大军队在未来十年应该有哪些军事优先事项？是领土防御、国际维和还是联盟承诺，例如**北约**，为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Very good. Thanks for the question. Next, please. Hi, I'm Aiden. Uh, my question is, what should Canada's military priorities be in the next decade? Territorial defense, international peacekeeping or alliance commitments, uh, for example, **NATO** and why?

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你想知道那个清单上的首要优先事项应该是什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: You want to know what the top priority should be of that list?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 好的。嗯，首要优先事项是主场作战。所以要保护加拿大本土，特别是越来越多地保护北极。嗯，维和。嘿，我在1993年前南斯拉夫的**马达克口袋战役**中看到了维和的消亡，文明的薄薄一层被撕裂，我们60年代发展起来的“居中维和”神话已经破灭了。嗯，那种维和不会再回来了。在海外支持我们的盟友，是的，绝对可以。但我们必须非常严格地决定在哪里部署我们的部队。我们上一个国防政策，“北方强大而自由”，给了我们几个层次。嗯，你知道，最高层次是保卫国家，特别关注北极，然后是跨大西洋关系和**印太地区**。我们只能把黄油涂在面包上那么薄，引用**比尔博·巴金斯**的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Okay. Well, top priority is the home game. Uh, so protecting Canada at home and specifically more and more the Arctic. Uh, peacekeeping. Hey, I saw the death of peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia in in 93 at the battle of **Madak Pocket** where the thin veneer of civilization was ripped away and our our myth of interpositional peacekeeping that was developed in the in the 60s that is gone. Um and that type of peacekeeping is not coming back. Supporting our allies where we can overseas, yeah, absolutely. But we've got to be very disciplined as to where we put our forces. Our last defense policy, our our north strong and free gave us a number of tiers. Uh, you know, top tier defending the country and specific focus on the Arctic and then the transatlantic relationship and **Indo-Pacific**. We can only spread the uh uh spread our butter on the toast so thin uh to quote **Bilbo Bagots**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我们只能做这么多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: We can only do so much.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 明白了。是的，先生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Gotcha. Yes, sir.

</details>

**Richard**: 嗯，我是来自伯灵顿的Richard，谢谢大家今天到来。我希望你们能就你们的回答中让我困惑的几点进行阐述。嗯，谈到加拿大需要投资监测北方。这不属于**萨博鹰狮**提案的一部分吗？他们不仅说要我们购买他们的飞机，还说要购买在加拿大机身上建造的**金眼飞机**，让我们能够巡逻并保持对我们北方地区的控制。嗯，我们正在与澳大利亚合作投资一个海空雷达系统，将在北方建造。我相信我们因为没有购买他们的系统而惹恼了一些美国人。这些与美国以外国家达成的协议，难道不能扩展我们的能力，展示我们对邻国的承诺，同时也为加拿大带来工业，就像你说的可消耗资源一样吗？**F-35**，很棒的飞机，但非常非常昂贵。而**鹰狮**更便宜，有更大的增长空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard**: Um Richard from Burlington, thank you all for coming today. I was hoping you'd be able to expand on a couple of things that have confused me from your responses. Uh talk of need for Canada to invest in being able to monitor our north. Is that not part of the the **Saab Grippin** proposal? Not only are they saying buy planes from us, but also the **Golden Eye** plane built on a Canadian airframe allowing us to patrol and maintain control over our own north. Uh we are investing with Australia in a sea to space radar system to be built in the north. I believe we annoyed some Americans by not buying their system. Do not these deals with nations other than America expand our abilities, show our commitment to our neighbors and also give us industry here in Canada to your point of an attritable resource. **F-35**, wonderful plane, but very very expensive. Whereas the **Grippin** is less expensive, has greater room for growth.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你怎么知道这么多？这就是我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: How do you know so much about this? That's what I

</details>

**Richard**: 我读过一两本书。如果你损失了它，我们可以在加拿大这里重建，因为工厂在这里，而如果我们损失了一架**F-35**，我们就在等待名单的末尾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard**: I read one or two things. And if you lose it, we can rebuild it right here in Canada cuz the plant is here versus if we lose an **F-35**, we're at the end of a waiting list.

</details>

**Richard**: 所以，如果你对此有什么见解，我将不胜感激。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Richard**: So, if you had some insight into that, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 是的。所以，我们必须小心“银弹系统”。我们谈论的是传感器。我们需要的是分层传感器。你提到的澳大利亚系统是北极超视距雷达。所以，你知道，把它想象成一个地面雷达。你提到的飞机填补了所谓的空中预警系统。所以把它想象成一个飞机搭载的雷达系统。我们还需要天基系统。所以我们有这些分层传感器，这样我们就有了一些冗余。嗯，你知道，再次回到2023年击落气球的事件，让我深刻体会到的是我们国家缺乏地面雷达覆盖。我们在**育空地区**击落气球的原因是，我担心它在靠近或进入加拿大内陆时会丢失，因为我们没有那样的覆盖。所以，这种分层系统很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Yeah. So, we we just got to be careful about silver bullet systems. And we're talking about sensors. What we need are layered sensors. The Australian system you talked about was the Arctic over the horizon radar. So it's, you know, think a groundbased radar. The the aircraft you're talking about fills what's known as an airborne airborne early warning system. So think of a a a plane mounted radar system. We also need spacebased systems. So we have those layers of sensors so that we've got some redundancy. Um, you know, again, going back to 2023 and shooting down balloons, one of the things that was driven home to me was the lack of groundbased radar coverage that our country has. And the reason we took down a balloon in **Yukon** was I was afraid we're going to lose it as it came closer or as it moved into the Canadian interior because we don't have that coverage. So, it's that layer system that's important.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 如果我能补充一点，你绝对说对了一点，我认为这非常重要，那就是我们必须与许多不同的盟友建立关系。我们不希望把所有的能力都放在一个篮子里。如果我们从过去几个月美国政府不断变化的言论中学到了什么，那就是我们对美国的技术来源、经济繁荣和其他方面过于依赖。所以与澳大利亚的伙伴关系，与欧洲盟友的非常重要的伙伴关系，我们现在有了基础，可以通过与**欧盟**签署国防合作协议，进一步深入这个领域，因为欧洲人正在发展更多主权能力。与加拿大合作也符合他们的利益。我认为过于关注单个设备正是我们容易陷入的“兔子洞”。**F-35**与**鹰狮**。嗯，我们现在有**F-35**的合同。我们需要一些东西来接替它。无论那是否继续是相同的设备，还是不同的设备，或者不同的能力，这才是我们必须努力关注的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: If I I would just add in the one point you absolutely made which I I think is very important is that we have to have relationships with a lot of different allies. We do not want all of our capabilities in one bucket. And if we've learned anything over the course of the last months or so in the changing rhetoric coming out of the American administration is that we have been overly dependent on the US for our source of technology, our economic prosperity and others. So the partnership with Australia, very important partnership with European allies, we now have the foundation to get even more down into that space with the signing of a defense cooperation arrangement with the **European Union** as the Europeans develop more sovereign capabilities. Working with Canada is also going to be in their interest. I think focusing too much on individual pieces of equipment is is exactly we we tend to go down a rabbit hole. **F-35** versus the **Grippin**. Well, we have an **F-35** contract right now. We will need something that will follow it. Whether that continues to be the same piece of equipment or a different one or different capabilities, that's what we have to try and focus on.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian，我们谈论了很多装备，但我们真正需要谈论的是人，因为无论购买什么飞机，我们都需要飞行员来驾驶那架飞机。我们需要技术人员。我们需要潜艇兵。我们需要海军军官。而我们现在就已经很难培养出我们所需的船员了。所以我的担忧是，我们将购买这些精良的设备，然后却没有操作它们的人。如果你看看，这是一个很好的问题，因为这个问题表明了我们今天要求**加拿大武装部队**做的事情的广度，相对于冷战结束时我们要求他们做的事情。我们要求他们做更多的事情，无论是在数量、质量还是复杂性方面。相对于此，即使有额外的投资，我们仍然看到这些不断增长的任务的资源相对下降。所以对我来说，首先是人，而不是装备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian, and we talk a lot about the kit, but what we really need to talk about is the people because regardless of buying a plane, we're going to need pilots for that plane. We're going to need technicians. We're going to need submariners. We're going to need Mars officers. And we already have trouble generating the crews that we need today. So what my worry is we're going to buy this wonderful equipment and then we're not going to have the people to operate. If you look at the it was a great question because the question indicates the breadth of what we're asking the **Canadian armed forces** to do today relative to what we asked them to do at the end of the cold war. We're asking them to do ever more things in terms of quantity, quality, and complexity. And relative to that, even with the additional investment, we continue to see sort of relative declining resources for this growing number of tasks. So it's the it's first and foremost about for me it's about the people not the kit.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为这也很重要。我认为最棒的事情之一是，我刚刚看到几天前发布的消息，过去12个月加拿大军队的申请人数超出了预期。人数众多。我看着房间里所有的年轻人，我想说，在军队中，在工业界支持军队，你们有一个很棒的职业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I think it's also important. I think one of the great things is I just saw something released in the last few days that there have been more applicants for the **Canadian forces** in the last 12 months than than anticipated. Significant numbers of people. And I look at all of the young people in the room and I would say there is a great career for you in the forces supporting the forces in industry.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 去学**STEM**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: Go study **STEM**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我自己也说不出更好的话了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Couldn't say it better myself.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 我本来想说你不会从我这里得到任何争论。我们还有时间提两个问题。所以，请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: I was gonna say you're not gonna have no argument from this guy here. We have time for two more questions. So yes, please.

</details>

**Sorup**: 是的。谢谢。我叫Sorup，我在多伦多有一家**AI**咨询公司，我们主要在**金融科技**和电子商务领域运营。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sorup**: Yeah. Thank you. My name is Sorup and I have an **AI** consulting firm in Toronto and we mostly operate in **fintech** and e-commerce space.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Okay.

</details>

**Sorup**: 所以像我这样来自完全非传统背景的人，比如航空航天防御领域之外的人，未来有什么有意义的方式可以为这个行业做出贡献吗？他有什么有意义的方式可以为这个行业做出贡献吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sorup**: So someone coming from totally nontraditional background like outside from aerospace defense, is there any meaningful way I can make contribution to to this sector in future? Is there a meaningful way he can make a contribution to this sector?

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 你说你从事**AI**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: And and so you said you're involved with **AI**.

</details>

**Sorup**: **AI**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sorup**: **AI**. Yeah.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Sorup**: **金融科技**。**金融科技**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sorup**: **Fintech**. **Fintech**. Yes.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: **金融科技**和**金融科技**。所以，你知道，在更广泛的国家安全领域，随着我们看到对加拿大的安全威胁显现，**金融科技**正变得越来越重要。它们，它们，它们，很多事情都与安全有关。金融是重中之重。所以参与国家的金融安全至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: **Fintech** and and **fintech**. So, you know, much in the wider national security sphere, **fintech** is becoming increasingly important as we see security threats to Canada manifest. They they they there's a security nexus to so many things. Finance is right at the top. So getting involved in financial security for the country essential

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Christian.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: 所以我们谈论国家安全，但我认为挑战在于，这听起来好像联邦政府或国防部可以独自解决这些问题，鉴于挑战的复杂性，鉴于我们拥有的威胁载体类型，这需要一个全政府和全社会的方法，其中国防只扮演一个角色。你已经看到总理宣布大幅增加主要预备役，大幅增加补充预备役，但我也认为我们做得不太好的是，没有为那些想要为国家做点事情的积极个人提供确切的机制，让他们能够参与进来并找到这些机制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: So we talk about national security but I think the challenge is then that that makes it sound like the federal government or defense can somehow solve these problems on their own and given the complexity of the challenges given the types of threat vectors that we have it requires a whole of government and a whole of society approach where defense sort of plays just one role. And you've seen the prime minister announce a significant increase in the primary reserves, a significant increase in the supplementary reserves, but also I think there's what we haven't done particularly well is provide exactly the sort of motivated individuals that want to do something for their country to be able to pitch in and to find those mechanisms.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 那么他给谁打电话？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: So who does he call?

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我想说，嗯，我们被承诺除了国防工业战略之外，政府还宣布将推出一个新类型的补充预备役平台，允许加拿大人注册并告知他们的能力。我非常期待看到那会是什么样子。而且，你知道，招募中心就在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I would say there is a um we have been promised another beyond the defense industrial strategy. The government has announced that it will be launching a platform for a new type of supplementary reserve to allow Canadians to sign up and to let their capabilities be known. I'm really anxious to see what that looks like. And I'd also, you know, the recruiting center is right

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 回到Christian的观点，你知道，我们需要国家韧性，一直到省、地区和市级。一种自力更生的感觉，依靠自己的能力，而不是仅仅等待联邦政府的帮助，带着那种习得性无助，因为安全威胁正在显现，不仅仅是人为威胁，还有自然灾害。自然灾害的频率和强度不断增加是我们真正需要担心的事情。嗯，所以市政府在这方面也有作用，包括在**金融科技**和**AI**领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: going to Christian's point, you know, what we need national resilience right down to the provincial, territorial, and municipal levels. a sense of self-reliance, the ability to rely on yourself and and not just wait for help from the federal government with that learned helplessness because the security threats are manifesting, not just man-made threats, but natural disasters as well. The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters is something that we really need to worry about. Um and so municipal governments have a role in this as well and including in in **fintech** and **AI**.

</details>

**Steve Pacin**: 有趣。没有压力，但你得到了最后一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Pacin**: Interesting. No pressure, but you've got the last question.

</details>

**Danilo**: 谢谢，Steve。嗯，大家好，我是来自多伦多的Danilo，嗯，请原谅我这个问题可能很宽泛，但我想谈谈加拿大作为维和国家的形象、叙事、概念，或者你如何分类它。我们都知道，地缘政治和世界事件变化莫测。我们整个对话都在谈论这个问题，但我只是想知道，长期来看，我们是否还应该坚持这个称号？这是否应该成为其他世界领导人和国家在识别加拿大时首先想到的东西？我们应该坚持它，还是应该提出一些新的想法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Danilo**: Thanks, Steve. Uh, hi, I'm Danilo from Toronto and, uh, you'll have to forgive me for how broad this may be, but I wanted to talk about, uh, the motif, the narrative, the notion, whatever you want to categorize it as Canada, its identity as a peacekeeping nation. And as we all know, geopolitics and world events are very fluctuating. And we this has been talked about throughout the whole um conversation, but I just wanted to know long term um should we still stick by that moniker? Should that be something that other world leaders and countries should see as the first thing they they identify with Canada and and should we stick by it or should there be some new ideas to the table so to speak?

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 所以，我认为那是我们历史上的一段特定时期。嘿，我曾两次在海外任务中戴过蓝色贝雷帽。嗯，但那只是我们相当长的军事历史中的一小段时期。嘿，第一次世界大战，我们动员了60万人参战，6万人阵亡。第二次世界大战，我们动员了110万人参战，远远超过任何维和任务。你知道，朝鲜战争，也是一样。阿富汗战争，也是一样。所以，我认为我们需要专注于保卫我们的国家，并且从自信的立场去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: So, I think that was a certain period in our history. And hey, I wore a blue beret on two two missions overseas. Uh, but that was a short period in our rather longer military history. Hey, **World War I**, uh, we put 600,000 in uniform, 60,000 killed in action. **World War II**, we put 1.1 million in uniform, far more than on any peacekeeping mission. You know, **Korean War**, the same thing. The war in Afghanistan, the same thing. and and so focusing on the ability to defend our country um and and and doing it from a position of confidence is where I think we need to go.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 我认为将军已经说过，我们这种，你知道，中立的军事方介入以分离两个交战派别的想法，自1990年代以来就已经结束了，而且可能在我们意识到它结束之前就已经结束了，正如在一些非常困难的地方所经历的那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: I the I think General already said our idea of this I you know the the neutral military party that goes in to separate two waring factions has been over since the 1990s and it was probably over before we realized it was over as experienced in some very difficult places.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 当他们向我开枪时，我意识到它结束了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: When they were shooting at me, I realized it was over.

</details>

**Wendy Gilmore**: 没错。所以，我们必须意识到，有时加拿大需要通过帮助解决世界其他地区的冲突来捍卫自己的利益。但我们必须在考虑它如何贡献以及最有效的方式是什么的情况下做出这些决定。我认为我们过去几十年来学到的是，强大、有能力的军事力量，拥有授权、交战规则、自卫和保卫他人所需的装备，可能需要部署，但那不是维和。我们应该放弃这种想法，即存在某种神奇的第三方居中蓝色贝雷帽维和人员，我们可以重新成为那样，因为那已经不存在了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wendy Gilmore**: Exactly. So, one of the things that we have to realize is that there may be times when Canada will need to defend our own interests by helping to resolve conflicts in other part of the world. But we need to take those decisions in view of how is it contributing and what is the most effective way to do that. And I think what we've learned certainly in the last few decades is that strong capable military forces that have the mandate, the rules of engagement, the equipment to defend themselves and defend others maybe need to be deployed, but that's not peacekeeping. And we should let go of the idea that there is somehow this magic third party interpositional blue parade peacekeeper out there that we can go back to being because that does not exist anymore.

</details>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian，维和是从哪里来的？1956年**苏伊士危机**。为什么当时**皮尔逊**有效地发明了这个概念，以避免超级大国走向战争，可能走向核战争？因为如果发生这种情况，我们都会输。维和从来都不是为了让世界变得更好、更美好。但我认为在政治上我们把它变成了那样，因为那是一种廉价而容易做到的事情。第二次世界大战后我们做了什么？我们投资了真正的能力，正如**Wayne V**和**埃伦将军**都指出的那样，我们部署到了欧洲。我们为什么部署到欧洲？因为我们在20世纪上半叶学到了什么？欧洲人喜欢一直打到最后一个加拿大人。我指出这一点是因为，你看，我们今天正在乌克兰学习这一点。欧洲发生的事情不会留在欧洲。它对整个世界都有影响。它对我们今天在北极看到的动荡有影响。所以，这是一项对稳定性的投资。这些是对捍卫我们珍视的民主和生活方式的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Leuprecht**: Christian, what does peacekeeping come out of? 1956 the **Suez crisis**. Why did then why did **Pearson** effectively invent the concept to avoid the superpowers from going to war, possibly going to nuclear war? Because we would all lose if that was going to happen. Peacekeeping was never about making the world a better, nicer place. But I think politically we turned it into that because that's a cheap and easy thing to do. What did we do after **World War II**? We invested in real capabilities that we, as both Wayne V and **General Era** have pointed out, deployed to Europe. Why did we deploy them to Europe? Because what did we learn in the first half of the 20th century? That the Europeans like to fight their wars right down to the last Canadian. And I point that out because look, we're learning it today with Ukraine. What happens in Europe doesn't stay in Europe. It has effects on the whole world. It has effects on the instability that we're seeing in the Arctic today. And so it is an this these are in investments in stability. These are investments in defending the democracy and the way of life that we cherish.

</details>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 如果我能补充Christian的观点。一年半前，**诺曼底登陆**80周年纪念日。我在**朱诺海滩**，当我反思时，我意识到，你知道，加拿大率先在诺曼底登陆，并率先解放了欧洲。我们是一个能够成就伟大事业的国家。而且我们已经做了伟大的事情。我们只需要那种自信和对自己的信念。我们能做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Wayne Eyre将军**: If I can just add to Christian's point. So a year and a half ago, 80th anniversary of the **Normandy landings**. I was there on **Juno Beach** and as I reflected on it, I I I realized as you know, Canada at the spearheaded the the first amongst the first to land in Normandy and spearheaded the the liberation of of Europe. We are a country capable of great things. And we have done great things. We just need that confidence and that belief in oursel. But we we can do it.

**Steve Pacin**: 鉴于这个评论，我想就美国总统前几天说的一句话给你最后发言的机会，他说基本上美国在本世纪早些时候的战争中承担了所有重任，而加拿大、英国和其他盟军部队则有些退缩。你对此有何看法？

**Steve Pacin**: In light of that comment, I want to give you the last word on something that was said by the president of the **United States** the other day in which he said essentially the US did all the heavy lifting in the wars that took place earlier this century and Canadian and British and other allied troops kind of held back. What did your view of that?

**Wayne Eyre将军**: 很难不把它当成针对个人的。2007年，作为一名单位指挥官，我失去了10名在我指挥下的加拿大人。我认识更多在那里牺牲的人。你知道，从2002年一直到我们承诺结束。嗯，那是一个旨在激起愤怒的评论。那是一种“钓鱼”行为。我们被“钓鱼”了。我想对我的退伍军人同胞们说，不要上“钓鱼”的当。不要陷入那种愤怒。我们知道我们做了什么。而且我们的美国同事，那些与我们并肩作战的人，那些重要的人，他们知道我们做了什么。所以为你们的服务感到骄傲吧。你们做了国家要求你们做的一切。

**Wayne Eyre将军**: It's hard not to take it personally. In 2007 as a unit commander, I lost 10 Canadians under my command. I've known many more who were killed over there. You know, ranging from 2002 right up until the end of our commitment. Um it was a comment designed to spark outrage. It was a troll. We were being trolled. And I would I guess my message to my fellow veterans would be don't fall prey to the troll. Don't fall prey to that sense of outrage. We know what we did. Um and our American colleagues who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us, the ones that matter, they know what we did. And so be proud of of your service there. You did everything your country asked you to do.
