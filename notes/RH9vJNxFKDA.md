### 人工智能的普及与定义

**ChatGPT**（Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型）拥有八到九亿的每周活跃用户。如果你是那种每天使用它数小时的人，请问自己：为什么有五倍多的人看过它、了解它、知道它是什么、拥有账户、知道如何使用它，但本周或下周却想不出任何可以用它做的事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chat GPT has got 8 or 900 million weekly active users. And if you're the kind of person who is using this for hours every day, ask yourself why five times more people look at it, get it, know what it is, have an account, know how to use it, and can't think of anything to do with it this week or next week.</p>
</details>

主持人： “**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）”这个词有点像“技术”这个词。当某项事物存在一段时间后，它就不再被认为是AI了。机器学习仍然是AI吗？我不知道。在实际的普遍用法中，AI似乎意味着“新事物”，而**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能）则意味着“新的、可怕的事物”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The term AI is a little bit like the term technology. When something's been around any for a while, it's not AI anymore. Is machine learning still AI? I don't know. In actual general usage, AI seems to mean new stuff. And AGI seems new scary stuff.</p>
</details>

主持人： **AGI**似乎有点像这样：它要么已经存在，只是以小型软件的形式出现；要么它还有五年才能实现，并且将永远保持五年后的距离。我们不知道这项技术的物理极限，因此也不知道它能变得多好。**Sam Altman**（OpenAI首席执行官）说我们现在已经拥有博士级别的研究人员，而**Demis Hassabis**（DeepMind首席执行官）则反驳说“不，我们没有，闭嘴”。非常新颖、非常宏大、非常激动人心且改变世界的事物往往会引发泡沫。所以，如果我们现在不在泡沫中，那我们很快就会进入泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> AGI seems to be a bit a little bit like this. Like either it's already here and it's just small software or it's 5 years away and will always be 5 years away. We don't know the physical limits of this technology and so we don't know how much better it can get. You've got Samman saying we've got PhD level researchers right now and Demis says no we don't shut up. Very new, very very big, very very exciting world changing things tend to lead bubbles. So yeah, if we're not in a bubble now, we will be.</p>

主持人： Benedict，欢迎回到a16z播客。

Benedict： 很高兴回来。

<p class="english-text">>> Good to be back.</p>
</details>

主持人： 我们今天来讨论你最新的演讲《**AI eats the world**》（AI吞噬世界）。所以对于那些还没读过的人，也许我们可以分享一下核心论点，并结合最近的AI演讲来阐述，我很想知道你的想法是如何演变的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We're here to discuss your latest presentation, AI eats the world. So for those who haven't read it yet, maybe we can go share the highlevel thesis and and maybe contextualize it in light of recent AI presentations, I'm curious how how your thinking h has evolved.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 是的，很有趣。幻灯片中的一张引用了我与一家大公司**CMO**（Chief Marketing Officer: 首席营销官）的对话，他说我们现在已经听过很多AI演讲了，比如**Google**（谷歌）的、**Microsoft**（微软）的、**Bain & Company**（贝恩公司）的、**BCG**（波士顿咨询集团）的、**Accenture**（埃森哲）的，还有我们广告公司的。那么，现在该怎么办呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's funny. One of the slides in the debt references a conversation where I had with a big company CMO who said we've all had lots of AI presentations now like we've had the Google one and we've had the Google one and the Microsoft one. We've had the Bane one and the BCG one. We've had the one from from Accenture and the one from our ad agency. Um so now what? So</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，我的演讲大约有90多张幻灯片，我试图表达很多不同的观点。其中之一是，如果这是一次平台转移，或者说不仅仅是平台转移，那么平台转移通常是如何运作的？我们通常会看到哪些现象？现在有多少这些模式正在重演？当然，其中一些模式会导致泡沫，但另一些则是科技行业内部的许多变化，你知道，有赢家也有输家，曾经占据主导地位的人最终变得无关紧要，然后又创造出新的万亿或千亿美元公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um what's it's it's sort of 90 odd slides. So there kind of there's a bunch of different things I'm trying to get at. One of them is I think just to say well if this is a platform shift or more than a platform shift how do platform shifts tend to work? What are the things that we tend to see in it? And how many of those patterns can we see being repeated now? And of course those some of the patterns that come out of that are things like bubbles but another others are that lots of stuff changes inside the tech industry and you know there are winners and losers and people who were dominant end up becoming irrelevant and then there were new billion trillion dollar companies created but then there's also what does this mean outside the tech industry</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但这在科技行业之外又意味着什么呢？因为回顾过去的几波平台转移，有些行业因此彻底改变，甚至创造和消灭了一些行业；而另一些行业，这仅仅是一个有用的工具。比如，如果你从事报纸行业，过去30年受到的影响就非常不同，与你从事水泥行业的情况大相径庭，在水泥行业，互联网只是有点用处，但并没有真正改变你行业的本质。所以我试图做的是让人们了解科技行业正在发生什么，我们投入了多少资金，我们试图做什么，有哪些悬而未决的问题，科技行业内部可能会发生什么或不会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because if we think back over the last waves of platform shifts there were some industries where this changed everything and created and uncreated industries and there others where this was just kind of a useful tool like so you know if you're in the newspaper business that had a very different impact the last 30 years look very different to if you were in the cement business where you know the internet was just kind of useful but didn't really change the nature of your industry very much and so what I tried to do is give people a sense of well what is it that's going on in tech how much money are we spending what are we trying to do what are the unanswered questions what might or might not happen um within the tech industry</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但在科技之外，这通常是如何演变的？目前似乎正在发生什么？这如何体现在工具、部署、新用例和新行为中？然后，当我们回顾这一切时，我们之前经历过多少次这样的事情？你知道，这很有趣。今年夏天我参加了一个播客，开场白我大概说：“嗯，你知道，我是一个中间派。我认为这和互联网或智能手机一样重要，但也就和互联网或智能手机一样重要。”结果下面有200多条YouTube评论说：“你知道，这更重要，他不懂这有多大。”我想，嗯……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then outside technology, how does this tend to play out? What seems to be happening at the moment? How is this manifesting into tools and deployment and new use cases and new behaviors? And then as we kind of step back from all of this, how many times have we get again, how many times have we gone through all of this before? You know, they it's funny. I went on a podcast this summer and I sort of opening line I said something like, well, you know, I'm a centrist. I think this is as big a deal as the internet or smartphones, but only as big a deal as the internet or smartphones. And there's like 200 YouTube commenters underneath saying, you know, this more and he doesn't understand how big this is. And I think, well,</p>
</details>

主持人： 这确实是个大问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it was kind of a big deal. It was kind of a big deal.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，你知道，我那天结束时看了看电梯，因为我住在曼哈顿的一栋公寓楼里，我们有一个有人值守的电梯，这意味着它没有按钮，只有一个加速器和一个刹车，门卫会进来把你送到你的楼层。这就像一辆有轨电车。在50年代，**Otis**（奥的斯电梯公司）部署了自动电梯。然后你进去，按一个按钮。他们通过说“啊，它有电子礼貌”来推销它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and you know, I sort of finished the day by by looking at elevators cuz I I live in an apartment building in Manhattan and we have an attended elevator, which means it's there's a hand there's no buttons, there's an accelerator and a brake and the doorman gets in and drives you to your floor. this street car. And in the ' 50s, Otis deployed automatic elevators. And then you get in and you press a button. And they marketed it by saying, "Ah, it's got electronic politeness."</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你的意思是红外线束。而今天当你进入电梯时，你不会说“啊，我正在使用电子电梯。它是自动的。”它只是一部电梯。数据库、网络和智能手机也是如此。我现在觉得，这很有趣，我在**LinkedIn**（领英）和**Threads**（社交媒体应用）上做过几次关于“机器学习还是不是AI”的调查，AI这个词有点像“技术”或“自动化”这个词，它似乎只适用于新事物。一旦某样东西存在了一段时间，它就不再是AI了。所以，像数据库肯定不是AI，机器学习还是AI吗？嘿，我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your which means the infrared beam. And today when you get into an elevator, you don't say, "Ah, I'm using an electronic elevator. It's automatic. It's just a lift." which is what happened with databases and with the web and with smartphones and I kind of think now it's funny I did I've done a couple of polls on this in LinkedIn and threads of like is machine learning still AI is AI is kind of in AI is the word the term AI is a little bit like the term technology or automation it see it only kind of applies when something's new once something's been around any for a while it's not AI AI anymore so like databases certainly aren't AI is machine learning still AI Hey. Uh, I don't know.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我的意思是，显然有一个学术定义，人们会说：“这家伙是个白痴。”不，我当然会解释AI的定义，但在实际的普遍用法中，AI似乎意味着新事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, and there's obviously there's like an academic definition where people say, "This guy's an idiot." No, of course I'm going to explain the definition of AI, but then in in actual general usage, AI seems to mean new stuff.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。而**AGI**似乎，你知道，是新的可怕事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And AGI seems, you know, like new scary stuff.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 是的。这很有趣。我一直在思考这个问题。有一个古老的神学家的笑话，嗯，犹太人的问题是他们等待弥赛亚，但他从未来过。而基督徒的问题是，他来了，但什么也没发生。就像，你知道，世界没有改变，罪恶依然存在，你知道，就像在所有实际目的上，什么也没发生。而**AGI**似乎有点像这样：它要么已经存在，所以**Sam Altman**说我们现在已经拥有博士级别的研究人员，而**Demis Hassabis**则说“不，我们没有，闭嘴”。所以它要么已经存在，只是更多的软件；要么它还有五年才能实现，并且将永远保持五年后的距离。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. It's funny. There's I was thinking about this. There's an old theologian's joke that um the problem for Jews is that you wait and wait and wait for the Messiah and he never comes. And the problem for Christians is that he came and nothing happened. like you know the world didn't change like there is still sin you know like like like all practical purposes nothing happened and AGI seems to be a bit a little bit like this like either it's already here and so you've got Sam Alman saying we've got PhD level researchers right now and Demis says what no we don't shut it and so either it's already here and it's just more software or it's 5 years away and will always be 5 years away.</p>
</details>

### AI作为平台转移：新旧公司之争

主持人： 是的。是的。这很有趣。让我们回顾一下之前的平台转移。因为有些人，你知道，看看像互联网这样的东西，然后说，嘿，它创造了全新的万亿美元公司，你知道，**Facebook**（脸书）和**Google**（谷歌）就是因此而生的，各种新的赢家不断涌现。然而，他们看看像移动技术这样的东西，然后说，嘿，你知道，确实有像**Uber**（优步）、**Snap**（Snapchat母公司）以及**Instagram**（照片分享应用）和**WhatsApp**（即时通讯应用）这样的大公司，但这些都是，你知道，十亿美元或数百亿美元的成果，但真正的大赢家实际上是Facebook和Google。嗯，所以在某种意义上，移动技术也许是持续性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. It's um it's interesting. Let's compare back to previous platform shifts because some people you know look at you know something like the internet and say hey there were net new trillion dollar companies you know Facebook and Google u that that were created from it and just sort of all sorts of new emerging winners whereas they look at something like mobile and say hey you know there were big companies like Uber and Snap and and uh Instagram and WhatsApp but these were you know these were billion dollar outcomes or or tens of billion dollar outcomes but really the big winners were were in fact Facebook and Google. Um, and and so in some sense, mobile perhaps was sustaining.</p>
</details>

主持人： 你可以随意争论“持续性”和“颠覆性”的定义，但持续性在于，也许更多的价值流向了现有企业或在转移之前就存在的公司。我很好奇你如何看待AI，考虑到这一点，它是赋能型的吗？更多的收益会流向像**OpenAI**（人工智能研究公司）、**Anthropic**（人工智能安全公司）以及其他新兴公司吗？还是说，更多的收益会被**Microsoft**（微软）、**Google**（谷歌）、Facebook和**Meta**（脸书母公司）以及其他之前就存在的公司所攫取？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you feel free to quibble with the definition of, you know, sustaining disruptive, but sustaining in the sense that maybe more of the value went to incumbents or or or companies that existed prior to the to the to the shift. I'm I'm I'm curious how you think about AI in in in in light of that in terms of is it enabling is more of the gains coming from you know net new going to come to net new companies like like open AI and anthropic and others that that follow or um you know are more of the gains going to be captured by you know Microsoft and and and and Google and Facebook and and meta and you know companies that existed prior.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以我认为有几个答案。其中之一是，你必须小心对待框架和结构之类的东西，因为你最终会争论框架和定义，而不是争论会发生什么。你知道，它们都很有用，但它们都有漏洞。你知道，移动技术所做的，它从根本上改变了我们很多东西。例如，它将我们从网络转移到应用程序，它让世界上每个人都拥有了一部手机。它让世界上每个人都拥有了一台袖珍电脑。所以即使在今天，地球上消费级**PC**（Personal Computer: 个人电脑）的数量还不到十亿台，而智能手机的数量在五十亿到六十亿之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So I think it's well there's several answers to this. One of them is like you kind of have to be careful about like framings and structures and things because you end up arguing about the framing and the definition rather than arguing about what's going to happen. And you know they're all useful but they all they've all got holes in them. And you know that what what what mobile did was it kind of it it it shifted us you know there's a bunch of things that it changed fundamentally. It shifted us from the web to apps for example and it gave everybody on the world a a phone. It gave everybody on the world a pocket computer. So even today there's less than a billion consumer PCs on earth and there's something between five and six billion smartphones and um it made possible things that would not have been possible without it whether that's Tik Tok or arguably I think things like online dating and you know the the the you can map those against dollar value you can also map those against kind of structural change in consumer behavior and access to information and things and I think you could certainly argue that Meta would be a much smaller company if it wasn't for mobile for example. So you know you can kind of argue the puts and calls on on on this stuff a lot. Um there certainly you know not all platform shifts are the same and you know you can do the sort of standard sort of teology of say well there were mainframes and then PCs and then the web and then smartphones but you kind of want to put SAS in there somewhere and you kind of want to put open source in there and maybe you want to put databases and so you know these are kind of useful framings but like they're not predictive. They don't tell you what's going to happen. they just kind of give you one way of understanding what seems some of the patterns that that that we have here. Um and of course the big debate around generative AI is this is is is just another platform shift or is it something more than that and of course the problem is we don't know and we don't have any way of knowing other than waiting to see. So this may be as big as PCs or the web or SAS or or open source or something or it may be as big as computing and then you got the very overexited people living in group houses in Berkeley who think you know this is as big as fire or something. Well, well, great. Um, but but but does this create new companies? I mean, you go back to the mobile, you know, there was a time when people thought that blogs were going to be a diff different to the web, which seems weird now, like Google needed like a separate blog search. This was seriously this was a thing. Um, there was a time when it was really not clear, and I think you kind of generalize his point.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，它使得没有它就不可能实现的事情成为可能，无论是**TikTok**（抖音国际版）还是可以说像在线约会这样的事情。你可以根据美元价值来衡量这些，你也可以根据消费者行为和信息获取方式的结构性变化来衡量这些。我认为你当然可以说，如果没有移动技术，**Meta**（脸书母公司）会是一家小得多公司。所以，你知道，你可以在这方面争论很多。当然，并非所有平台转移都是一样的，你知道，你可以做那种标准的**技术演进学**（Teology: 探讨技术发展趋势和模式的学问），比如先是大型机，然后是PC，然后是网络，然后是智能手机，但你可能想把**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）放在某个地方，你可能想把开源放在那里，也许你还想把数据库放在那里。所以，你知道，这些都是有用的框架，但它们不具有预测性。它们不会告诉你将要发生什么。它们只是为你提供一种理解我们这里存在的一些模式的方式。当然，围绕**生成式AI**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体的人工智能）的巨大争论是，这仅仅是又一次平台转移，还是比这更重要的东西？当然，问题是我们不知道，除了等待观望之外，我们没有任何办法知道。所以这可能和PC、网络、SaaS或开源一样重要，或者它可能和计算本身一样重要。然后你就会看到那些住在伯克利合租房里非常兴奋的人，他们认为这和火一样重要。嗯，那太好了。

</details>

Benedict： 嗯，但是这会创造新公司吗？我的意思是，回到移动时代，你知道，曾经有人认为博客会与网络不同，这现在看来很奇怪，就像Google需要一个单独的博客搜索一样。这确实是一回事。嗯，曾经有一段时间，这真的不清楚，我认为你有点概括了他的观点。

</details>

Benedict： 回到90年代中期互联网的时代，你知道，我们大概知道这将是一件大事。我们并不真正知道它会是万维网。所以在那之前，我们不知道它会是互联网。我们知道会有网络。我们不清楚它会是互联网。然后不清楚它会是万维网。然后不清楚万维网将如何运作。你知道，当**Netscape**（网景浏览器）推出时，**Mark Zuckerberg**（马克·扎克伯格）还在初中或小学，或者什么的，**Larry Page**（拉里·佩奇）和**Sergey Brin**（谢尔盖·布林）还是学生，**Amazon**（亚马逊）还是一家书店。所以你可以知道它，但又不知道它。你也可以对智能手机提出同样的观点，我们知道每个人口袋里都会有一个连接互联网的东西，但它基本上会是80年代的PC公司和搜索引擎公司的PC，这并不清楚。不清楚它不会是**Nokia**（诺基亚）或微软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You go back to the internet in the mid '9s, you know, we kind of knew this was going to be a big thing. We didn't really know it was going to be the web. So before that, we didn't know it was going to be the internet. We knew there were going to be networks. We w didn't know it wasn't clear it was going to be the internet. Then it wasn't clear it was going to be the web. Then it wasn't really clear how the web was going to work. And you know when when Netscape launched like Mark Zuckerberg was in junior high or you know elementary school or something and you know Larry and Sergey were students and like Amazon was a bookstore. So you can know it but not know it. And you could make the same point about smartphones like it was we knew everyone was going to have an internet connected thing in their pocket but it was not clear it was basically going to be a PC from this has been PC company from the 80s and a search engine company. It was not clear it wasn't going to be Nocu Microsoft. See I think you have to be super careful in like predict making making kind of deterministic predictions about this.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我认为你在做出这种确定性预测时必须非常小心。你能做的是说，当这些事情发生时，一切都会改变。这之前已经发生过五到十次了。

<p class="english-text">I think you have to be super careful in like predict making making kind of deterministic predictions about this. What you can do is say, well, when this stuff happens, everything changes. And that's happened five or 10 times before.</p>
</details>

主持人： 我很好奇你是如何形成这个观点的，或者说我们是如何预测AI将与互联网一样重要的，这当然非常重要，但我还没有完全相信它会更大。我很好奇是什么激发了这种，你知道，这种说法。然后，是什么可能会改变你的想法，无论是它可能不如互联网那么大，因为当然互联网非常大，还是它可能会更大？

<p class="english-text">>> I'm curious how you got conviction in this idea or we got the prediction that hey, AI is going to be as big as the internet, which of course is pretty big, but I'm not yet I benedict. I'm not yet at the conviction that it's going to be any bigger. I'm curious what what sort of inspires that sort of uh, you know, sort of state statement. And then also, what might change your mind either way? you know that it might not be as big as the internet because of course the internet was obviously very big uh but also that hey perhaps it might be bigger</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，所以我认为，你知道，我不想，我记得我画了一张**S曲线**（S-curve: 描述技术或产品生命周期中增长模式的曲线）图，曲线略微上升，有人说：“这张图的轴是什么？”你知道，我不想陷入“这比互联网大5%还是大20%”的争论。我认为问题更像是，这仅仅是又一个行业周期，还是技术能够实现什么的一种更根本的改变？它更像是计算或电力这样一种结构性改变，而不是我们能用电脑做更多事情。我认为这才是问题所在，而且我认为在看待科技界关于这个问题的辩论时，存在一种有趣的脱节。

<p class="english-text">>> well so I think you know I don't want to I remember I made a diagram of kind of scurves kind of going up slightly someone said well what's the axis on this diagram I you know I don't want to kind of get into you know is this is this 5% bigger than than internet or is it 20% bigger I think the question is more like is it another of these industry cycles or is it a much more fundamental change in in what technology can be is it more like computing or electricity as a sort of structural change rather than here's a whole bunch more stuff we can do with computers. I think that's sort of the the question and there's a funny sort of disconnect I think in in looking at debates about this within tech because you know I</p>
</details>

Benedict： 因为，你知道，几周前我看了**OpenAI**（人工智能研究公司）的一个直播，他们花了前20分钟谈论他们明年将如何拥有人类水平、博士水平的AI研究人员，然后直播的后半部分是：“哦，这是我们的API堆栈，它将使成千上万的新软件开发人员能够像**Windows**（微软操作系统）一样工作。”他们甚至直接引用了**Bill Gates**（比尔·盖茨）的话。你会想，这两者不可能同时成立。要么我有一个博士水平的AI研究人员，这意味着它也是一个博士水平的**CPA**（Certified Public Accountant: 注册会计师）。

Benedict： 或者我有一个新的软件，可以帮我报税。那么到底是哪一个呢？要么这个东西将达到人类水平，这是一个非常非常具有挑战性、问题重重、复杂的说法；要么它将让我们能够制造更多软件，做更多以前软件做不到的事情。我认为围绕这个问题的对话中存在一种真正的**精神分裂症**（Schizophrenia: 比喻思想或行为上的矛盾和分裂）。

Benedict： 因为像**规模法则**（Scaling laws: 指模型性能随计算资源、数据量和模型参数增加而呈现可预测的提升规律）一样，它会一直扩展。同时我在这里展示它在编写代码方面有多出色。再说一次，它是编写代码，还是我们不再需要软件了？因为原则上，如果模型继续扩展，就没有人会再编写代码了。你只会对模型说：“嘿，你能帮我做这件事吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in conversations around this because like scaling laws and it's going to scale all the way and meanwhile I'm going here look how good it is at writing code and again like well is it writing code or do we not need software anymore because in principle if the models keep scaling nobody's going to write code anymore. You'll just say to the model like hey can you do this thing for me?</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。这是一种对冲，还是一种排序？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Is it a little bit of a hedge or like a sequencing thing or?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，其中一些是排序问题，但你知道，原则上，如果你认为这些东西会继续扩展，那你为什么要投资一家软件公司呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it's a it's some of it's a sequencing thing, but you know, in principle, if you think this stuff is going to keep scaling, like why are you investing in a software company?</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 就像，你知道，我们只会有一个像盒子里的神一样能做所有事情的东西。我认为这就是，但这是一种有趣的挑战，我认为这也是它与之前平台转移的根本不同之处。因为对于互联网或移动技术，或者被认为是移动大型机，你不知道未来几年会发生什么。你不知道亚马逊会变成什么样，你不知道网景会如何发展，你也不知道明年的**iPhone**（苹果智能手机）会是什么样。十年前当我们关心这些的时候，你大概知道物理极限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Like, you know, we'll just have this like god in a box that can do everything. And and and I think this is but this is the the kind of the funny kind of challenge and this is I think the fundamental way that this is different from previous platform shifts is that with the internet or with mobile or being deemed with mobile main frame is like you didn't know what was going to happen in the next couple of years you didn't know that what Amazon would become and you didn't know how Netscape was going to work out and you didn't know what next year's iPhone was going to be and 10 years ago when we cared about that you kind of knew the physical limits.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 比如你在1995年就知道**Telos**（电信公司）不会在明年给每个人提供千兆光纤，你知道iPhone不会有一年的电池续航，不会展开，不会有投影仪，也不会飞什么的。但我们不知道这项技术的物理极限，因为我们对它为何如此有效并没有很好的理论理解。事实上，我们对人类智能是什么也没有很好的理论理解，所以我们不知道它能变得多好。所以你可以做一张图表，你可以说，这是调制解调器的路线图，这是**DSL**（Digital Subscriber Line: 数字用户线路）的路线图，DSL会有多快，然后你可以对Telos部署DSL的速度做一些猜测，然后你可以说，显然我们不可能在1998年用流媒体取代广播电视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like you knew in 1995 you knew that Telos were not going to give everybody gigabit fiber next and you knew that the iPhone wasn't going to like have a year's battery life and unroll and have a projector and fly or whatever. But we don't know the physical limits of this technology because we don't really have a good theoretical understanding of why it works so well. Nor indeed do we have a good theoretical understanding of what human intelligence is and so we don't know how much better it can get. So you can do you could do a chart and you could say well you know this is the road map for modems and this is the road map for DSL and this is how fast DSL will be and then you can make some guesses about how quickly Telos will deploy DSL and then you can say well clearly we're not going to be able to replace broadcast TV with streaming in 1998</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但我们没有一种等效的方式来建模这些东西，以了解它在三年后的基本能力会是什么样子，这导致了这种有点基于“感觉”的预测，没有人真正知道。所以，你知道，**Jeff Dean**（谷歌AI负责人）说：“嗯，我觉得……”而**Demis Hassabis**说：“嗯，我觉得……”但没有人知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but we don't have an equivalent way of modeling this stuff to know what is the fundamental capability of it going to look like in 3 years um which gets you to these kind of slightly vibes-based forecasting where no one really knows. So, you know, Jeff In says, "Well, I feel like" and Demis says, "Well, I feel like," but no one knows.</p>
</details>

主持人： 然后**Karpathy**（AI研究员）在我们的播客中说：“我觉得，你知道，这还需要十年。”

Well, but this is the problem. We don't know. We don't have a way of modeling this.</p>
</details>

### AI投资泡沫与算力需求

主持人： 是的。所以让我们把这个和一些公司正在进行的前期投资联系起来。嗯，因为我们不知道，你知道，是否存在过度投资导致潜在的泡沫式机制的风险？或者你如何看待这个问题？嗯，确定地说，非常新颖、非常宏大、非常激动人心且改变世界的事物往往会引发泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And so let's connect this to sort of the you know the upfront investment that some of these companies are making. Um because we don't know you know is there a risk of overinvestment leading to some you know potential uh you know bubble-l like mechanics or h how do you think about that that question? Well, deterministically, very new, very, very big, very, very exciting world's changing things tend to lead to bubbles.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我认为没有人会否认你现在可以看到一些泡沫行为。你知道，你可以争论是什么样的泡沫，但再说一次，那并没有太多的预测力。你知道，泡沫的特征之一是当一切都顺利时，一切都同时上涨，每个人都看起来像个天才，每个人都利用杠杆和交叉杠杆，做循环收入，这很棒，直到它不再好。嗯，然后当它再次下跌时，你就会得到一种棘轮效应。嗯，所以，是的，如果我们现在不在泡沫中，我们很快就会进入泡沫。我记得**Mark Andreessen**（马克·安德森，a16z联合创始人）说过，你知道，1997年不是泡沫。98年不是泡沫。99年是泡沫。嗯，我们现在是在97年、98年还是99年？我，你知道，如果我们能预测到这一点，你知道，我们就会生活在一个平行宇宙中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you I don't think anybody would dispute that you can see some bubbly behavior now. And you know, you can argue about what kind of bubble, but again, like that doesn't have very much predictive power. And you know, one of the the features of bubbles is that when everything's going, you know, everything goes up all at once and everyone looks like a genius and everyone leverages and cross leverages and does circular revenue and that's great until it's not. Um, and then you get a kind of a ratchet effect as it goes back down again. Um, so yeah, if we're not in a bubble now, we will be. I remember Mark Andre saying, you know, 1997 was not a bubble. 98 was not a bubble. 99 was a bubble. Um, are we in 97 now or 98 or 99? I you know if we could predict that you know we'd live in a parallel universe.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，我认为，你知道，对此可能有两种更具体、更实际的答案。首先是，我们并不真正知道这些东西的计算需求会是什么，预测这一点，除了“更多”之外，预测这一点感觉很像试图预测90年代末的带宽使用情况。想象一下，如果你试图对此进行代数运算。你会说：“嗯，这么多用户，你知道，一个网页使用多少带宽？这会如何变化？随着带宽变快，这会如何变化？视频会发生什么？什么样的视频？什么带宽的视频？人们观看视频多长时间？多少视频？”然后你会，你会建立电子表格，它会告诉你十年后全球带宽消耗会是多少。然后你可以尝试用它来反向计算这将销售多少路由器。你可能会得到一个数字，但那不会是准确的数字，你知道，可能会有百倍的可能结果范围，你可以在现在对消耗的代数运算提出同样的观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think you know to the there's I suppose maybe kind of two more specific more more tangible answers to this. The first of them is we don't really know what the compute requirements of this stuff are going to be and forecasting that except like more and forecasting that feels a lot like trying to forecast like bandwidth use in the late '9s. Imagine if you were trying to do the algebra on that. You say, "Well, this many users, you know, how much bandwidth does a web page use? How will that change? How will that change as bandwidth gets faster? What happens with video? What kind of video? What bandwidth of what what bit rate of video? How long do people watch a video? How much video?" And then you'd like you you could build the spreadsheet and it would tell you what bit rate would what global bandwidth consumption would be in 10 years. And then you could try and use that to back calculate how many routters is this going going to sell. And you could get a number but it wouldn't be the number you know there'd be a you know hundfold range of possible outcomes from that and you could you know you could make the same point about algebra of of consumption now.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以，你知道，现在我们有一群理性行为者说：“嗯，这些东西是变革性的，是一个巨大的威胁，我们现在无法满足它的需求，据我们所知，需求还会继续增长。”你知道，我们已经从所有**超大规模云计算服务商**（Hyperscalers: 指提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、Google Cloud）那里得到了各种各样的引用，基本上都说不投资的坏处大于过度投资的坏处。嗯，这种事情总是运作良好，直到它不再运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know right now we have a bunch of rational actors saying well this stuff is transformative and a huge threat and we can't keep up with demand for it now and as far as we know the demand is going to keep going up. And you know, we've had a variety of quotes from all of the hyperscalers basically saying the downside of not investing is bigger than the downside of overinvesting. Um that's um or that kind of thing always works well until it doesn't.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，我看到**Mark Zuckerberg**（马克·扎克伯格）说了一句有点奇怪的话：“嗯，如果事实证明我们过度投资了，我们可以转售这些容量。”我想，马克，让我打断你一下，因为如果事实证明你无法使用你的容量，那么其他人也会有大量的闲置容量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um and I saw slightly strange quote from Mark Zuckerberg saying, "Well, if it turns out that we've overinvested, we can just re resell the capacity." And I thought, let me just like stop you there, Mark, cuz if it turns out that you can't use your capacity, everybody else going to have loads of spare capacity as well.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 现在所有这些急需更多容量的人，如果事实证明我们可以用百分之一的计算量获得相同的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All these people now who are desperate for more capacity, if it turns out we can get the same results for hundreds of the compute.</p>
</details>

主持人： 那对其他人也一样，不只是你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That will be true for everyone else too, not just you.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 是的。所以，你知道，在这样的投资周期中，你往往会过度投资，但之后，你对将要发生的事情能做的预测非常有限。我认为更有用的看待这个问题的方式是思考，嗯，你拥有这些变革性的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So yeah, you know, in a investment cycle like this, you tend to get overinvestment, but then after that, there's very limited predictions you can make about what's going to happen. I think the the more useful kind of way to look at this is to think well you've got these kind of transformative capabilities</p>
</details>

Benedict： 如果你是Google、Meta或Amazon，这些能力已经在增加你现有产品的价值，你将能够利用它们来构建更多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that are already increasing the value of your existing products if you're you're Google or Meta or Amazon and you're going to be able to use them to build a bunch more stuff</p>
</details>

Benedict： 只要你能够持续为自己正在构建的东西提供资金和销售，你为什么要让别人去做，而不是自己去做呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and why would you want to let somebody else do that rather than you doing it as long as you're able to keep funding and selling what you're building.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 而且很可能在明年，模型会发生演变。这意味着你可以用今天所用计算量的百分之一获得相同的结果。请记住，它已经在下降了，每年下降20、30、40倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And it may well turn out that you know we have an evolution of models in the next year. That means you can get the same result for 100 of the compute that you're using today. Bearing in mind that it's already going down like depend pick your numbers 20 30 40 times a year.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但使用量却在上升。所以你正处于这种非常，正如我所说，这就像试图预测90年代末、2000年代初的带宽消耗。你知道，你可以抛出所有参数，但这并不能让你得到有用的东西。你只需要退后一步说：“是的，但这个互联网的东西好用吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But then the usage is going up. So you're in this very, as I said, it's like trying to predict bandwidth consumption in the late 90s, early 2000s. You know, you can you can throw all the parameters out, but it doesn't get you to something useful. You just kind of need to step back and say, "Yeah, but is this internet thing any good?"</p>
</details>

### AI的瓶颈：供给侧与需求侧

主持人： 嗯，是的，因为我很好奇你是否认为瓶颈更多地在供给侧还是需求侧，你知道，是更多的技术限制，还是AI本身好用吗？是否有足够的用例来证明这种**SP**（Service Provider: 服务提供商）的类型？你看到了什么，你预测了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, yeah, cuz I'm curious if the bottlenecks are if you see them as more on the supply side or the demand side, you know, more technical constraints or is just is AI any good? Are are there enough use cases to to justify the the the type of SP what are what are you seeing and and what are you predicting?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以这个问题可能有两个答案。首先，我认为我们已经将所有问题分成了两个方面。现在有非常非常详细的关于芯片的讨论，然后有非常非常详细的关于数据中心的讨论，以及关于数据中心资金的讨论，然后是关于一家基于AI构建的新企业SaaS公司会是什么样子的？它会有多少利润？需要筹集多少资金？所以有风险投资的讨论，所以有很多不同的讨论。在这些讨论中，我什么都不知道，比如芯片。你知道，我会拼写“紫外线”，但我不知道什么是紫外线工艺。嗯，这就像，它更像是，更像是更多的紫罗兰色，我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So maybe two answers to this question. The first of them is I think we've had this sort of a a bifocation of what all the questions are. So there are now very very detailed conversations about chips and then very very detailed conversations about data centers and about funding for data centers and then about what does a a new enterprise SAS company built on AI? what margins will it have and how much money does it need to raise and so there are venture capital conversations and so there are many different conversations within which like I don't know anything about chips you know I can spell ultraviolet but like I don't know what like an ultraviolet process is um it's like it's more it's more more violets I don't know um</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以，你知道，这就像**Milton Friedman**（米尔顿·弗里德曼，经济学家）所说的“没有人知道如何制造一支铅笔”。你知道，我们已经有了这个，我认为第二个答案可能是，我认为有两种AI部署，即生成式AI部署。其中之一是，现在很容易也很明显地看到你可以用它做什么，这基本上是软件开发、营销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you've got this you know it's like the the Milton Friedman line no one knows how to build a pencil you've got the you know we've got this you it's turned into I think a second answer might B, I think there's two kinds of AI deployment, generative AI deployment. One of them is there are places where it's very easy and obvious right now to see what you would do with this, which is basically software development, marketing,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，针对许多非常无聊、非常具体的企业用例的**点解决方案**（Point solutions: 针对特定问题或需求设计的独立软件或服务）。还有基本上像我们这样的人，他们拥有非常开放、非常自由、非常灵活的工作，涉及许多不同的事情，并且总是在寻找优化这些工作的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so you get people in Silicon Valley who are like, you know, I spend all my diet time in DBT. I don't use Google anymore. You know, I've replaced my CRM with this.

Well, if you're in marketing, you know, all these stories of big companies where, you know, they're making 300 assets where they would have made 30. Um, and then Accenture and Bane and McKenzie and Infosys and so on sitting and solving very specific problems inside big companies.

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you go and look at the usage data and you see okay chat GPT has got 8 or 900 million weekly active users 5% of people are paying and then you go and look at all the survey data and you know it's very fragmented and inconsistent but it all sort of points to like something like 10 or 15% of people in the developed world are using this every day another 20 or 30% of people are using it every week and if you're the kind of person who is using this for hours every day. Ask yourself why five times more people look at it, get it, know what it is, have an account, know how to use it, and can't think of anything to do with it this week or next week.</p>

</details>

主持人： 是因为它还处于早期吗？顺便说一句，这也不是年轻人的专属。那么，仅仅是因为它还处于早期吗？是因为错误率吗？是因为你必须将它与你每天所做的事情进行映射吗？我过去经常使用的一个类比（它不在当前的演讲中，但我在之前的演讲中使用过）是，想象你是一名会计师，你第一次看到软件电子表格。这东西几乎可以字面上在10分钟内完成一个月的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Is it because it early? And it's not like a young people thing either, incidentally. And so, is that just because it's early? Is it because of the error rates? Is it because you have to map it against what you do every day? And one of the the analogy I always used to use which isn't in the current presentation I've been used in previous presentations is imagine you're an accountant and you see software spreadsheets for the first time. This thing can do a month of work in 10 minutes almost literally.</p>

Benedict： 你想改变，你想用不同的折现率重新计算那个**DCF**（Discounted Cash Flow: 贴现现金流），那个十年DCF。在我还没说完之前，我就已经做完了。而这本来需要一两天甚至三天的工作来重新计算所有这些数字。太棒了。现在，想象你是一名律师，你看到了它。你觉得，那太棒了。我的会计师应该看看。也许我下周制作我的计费小时表格时会用它，但那不是我整天做的事情。**Excel**（微软电子表格软件）并不能做律师每天能做的事情。我认为还有另一类人，他们会说：“我不知道该怎么用这个。”其中一些是习惯问题。其中一些是意识到“不，我可以用这种方式而不是那种方式来做。”但这也是产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You want to change you want to recalculate that DCF that 10ear DCF with a different discount rate. I've done it before you finished asking me to. And that would have been like a day or two days or three days of work to recalculate all those numbers. Great. Now, imagine you're a lawyer and you see it. And you think, well, that's great. My accountant should see it. Maybe I'll use it next week when I'm making a table of my billable hours, but that's not what I do all day. And Excel is doesn't use do things that a lawyer can do every day. And I think those there's this other class of person that's like I'm not sure what to do with this. And some of that is habit. Some of that is like realizing no instead of doing it that way I could do it this way. But that's also what products are.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 就像我在2014年到2019年在a16z工作时，每个来a16z的创业者，我相信现在也是一样，你可以看看任何一家公司，然后说那基本上是一个数据库。那基本上是一个CRM。那基本上是**Oracle**（甲骨文公司）或**Google Docs**（谷歌文档），只不过他们意识到在这个行业中存在这个问题或这个工作流程，并想出了如何使用数据库或CRM，或者基本上是5、10、20年前的概念，并为那个行业的人解决这个问题，然后去向他们销售，并想出如何让他们使用它。所以这就是为什么，你知道，你看看这方面的数据，根据你如何计算，今天典型的美国大公司有400到500个SaaS应用程序。400到500个SaaS应用程序，它们基本上都在做一些你可以在Oracle、Excel或电子邮件中完成的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like every entrepreneur who comes into a 16Z when I was there from 2014 to 2019 and I'm sure now like you could look at any company that comes in and say that's basically a database. That's basically a CRM. That's basically Oracle or Google Docs except that they've realized there's this problem or this workflow inside this industry and worked out how to use a database or a CRM or basically concepts from 5, 10, 20 years ago and solve that problem for people in that industry and go in and sell it to them and work out how they can get it to use it. And so this is why, you know, you look look at data on this that you depending on how you count it, the typical big company today has 4 to 500 SAS apps in the US. 4 to 500 SAS applications and they're all basically doing something you could do in Oracle or Excel or email.</p>

Benedict： 真的吗？他们不就是这么做的吗？他们正在解绑**ChatGPT**（聊天生成预训练转换器），就像十年前的企业软件公司正在解绑Oracle或Google或Excel一样。你是否认为，你知道，Excel为会计师所做的事情，嗯，我们现在AI正在为程序员和开发者做，但还没有完全找出那种，你知道，针对其他职位日常关键工作流程的方法，所以对于非开发者来说，不清楚，你知道，为什么我应该每天使用这个很多小时？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Really? Isn't that what they're doing? They're unbundling chat GBT just as the enterprise software company of 10 years ago was unbundling Oracle or Google or Excel. Do you have the view that you know what Excel did for for for accountants um you know we're sort of AI is now doing for for coders um and developers but hasn't quite figured out that sort of you know daily critical workflow for for other job positions and so it's unclear for people who aren't developers you know why I should be using this for many many hours a day or</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我认为很多人没有非常适合这项任务的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think there's a lot of people who don't have tasks that work very well with this.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。然后有很多人需要它被包装成产品、工作流程、工具和用户体验，并且有人来告诉他们：“嘿，你有没有意识到你可以用这个来做？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And then there's a lot of people who need it to be wrapped in a product and a workflow and tooling and UX and someone to come and say, "Hey, have you realized you could do it with this?"</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，今年夏天我与**Balaji Srinivasan**（巴拉吉·斯里尼瓦桑，前a16z合伙人）进行了这次对话，他也是a16z的前员工，他提出了关于验证的观点，因为这些东西仍然会出错，而硅谷的人往往会对此不以为然，但你知道，有些问题有特定的答案，需要是正确的答案，或者是一组有限的正确答案之一。你能机械地验证它吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I had this conversation with um in the summer with with with with Balagi who's another a former A6Z person and he was making this point about validation that can you because these things still get stuff wrong and people in the valley often kind of handwave this away but you know there are questions that have specific answers where it needs to be the right answer or one of a limited set of right answers. Can you validate that mechanistically?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，如果不能，用人来验证它是否高效？所以，你知道，在营销用例中，让机器制作200张图片，然后让人从中挑选10张好的，比让人制作10张好图片，或者即使你制作500张图片并挑选100张好的，效率要高得多。这比让人制作100张图片效率高得多。嗯，但另一方面，如果你正在做数据录入，我写过一些关于这个的文章，关于**Open Launch Deep Research**（一家研究公司），他们的整个营销案例是它会去收集关于移动市场的数据。我以前是一名移动分析师。那些数字都是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, if not, is it efficient to validate it with people? So, you know, with the marketing use case, it's a lot more efficient to get a machine to make you 200 pictures and then have a person look at them and pick 10 that are good than to have um people make 10 good images or 100 you even if you're going to make 500 images and pick a 100 that are good. That's a lot more efficient than having a person make 100 images. Um but on the other hand, if you're doing something like data entry and this I wrote something about this about um about open launch deep research open launch deep research their whole marketing case is it go goes off and collects data about the mobile market. I used to be a mobile analyst. The numbers are all wrong.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 他们展示的“看，这多有用”的用例，他们的数字是错的。在某些情况下，它们是错的，因为他们从源头抄写数字时就抄错了。在其他情况下，它们是错的，因为他们使用了不应该使用的来源。但如果我让一个实习生来做，那么一个实习生可能会发现这个问题。关于验证，如果你要做数据录入，如果我让机器从200个**PDF**（Portable Document Format: 便携式文档格式）中复制200个数字，然后我必须检查所有这200个数字，那我不如自己做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Their use case of look how useful this is. Their numbers are wrong. And in some cases they're wrong because they've literally transcribed the number incorrectly from the source. In other cases, it's wrong because they've used a source that they shouldn't have used. But like if I'd asked an intern to do it for me, then an intern would probably have picked that. And to my the point about, you know, verification, if you're going to do data entry, if I'm going to ask a machine to copy 200 numbers out of 200 PDFs, and then I'm going to have to check all 200 of those numbers, I might as well just do it myself.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。所以你有一个关于如何将它映射到现有问题的复杂矩阵。但另一方面是，你如何将它映射到你以前无法做到的新事物上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So you've got like a whole swirling matrix of how do you map this against existing problems? But the other side of it is how do you map this against new things that you couldn't have done before?</p>
</details>

### 平台转移的本质：新事物与旧任务

Benedict： 这又回到了我关于平台芯片的观点，因为你知道，我看到人们看着**ChatGPT**（聊天生成预训练转换器）或看着生成式AI，然后说：“嗯，这没用，因为它会犯错。”我认为这有点像看着70年代末的**Apple II**（苹果第二代个人电脑），然后说：“你能用这些来运营银行吗？”你的答案是“不能”，但那是个错误的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this comes back to my my point about platform chips because you know you know I see people looking at chbt or looking at generative AI and saying well this is this is useless because it makes mistakes and I think that's kind of like looking at like an Apple 2 in the late '7s and saying could you use these to run banks to which your answer is no but that's kind of the wrong question</p>
</details>

主持人： 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right</p>
</details>

Benedict： 比如，你能在Netscape中构建专业的视频编辑功能吗？不能，但那是个错误的问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> like could you build video edit professional video editing inside Netscape no but that's the wrong question right</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的，20年后你可以，但与此同时它做了很多其他事情，移动技术也是如此，比如你能用移动设备取代你的五屏专业编程设备吗？不能，所以它不能取代PC。嗯，猜猜看，50亿人拥有智能手机，七八亿人拥有消费级PC，所以它确实取代了，但做了不同的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and later yeah 20 years data you can but that meanwhile it does a whole bunch of other stuff and the same with mobile like can you can you use mobile to replace you know your your you know your five screen professional programming rig no therefore it can't replace PCs well guess what 5 billion people have got a smartphone and seven or 800 million people have got a consumer PC so it kind of did but did a different thing and the point of this is like the new thing this is you know the disruption framing you mentioned earlier the new thing is generally not very good or terrible at the stuff that was important to the old thing but it does something else</p>
</details>

Benedict： 重点是，你知道，你之前提到的颠覆性框架，新事物通常在对旧事物很重要的方面表现不佳甚至很糟糕，但它会做一些其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the point of this is like the new thing this is you know the disruption framing you mentioned earlier the new thing is generally not very good or terrible at the stuff that was important to the old thing but it does something else</p>
</details>

主持人： 对。很多问题是，好吧，它可能不擅长做某些旧任务，但生成式AI擅长做一类旧任务。还有更多生成式AI可能不擅长的旧任务。但还有一大堆你以前从未做过的事情，生成式AI真的非常擅长。那么你如何找到或想到这些呢？其中有多少是用户面对通用聊天机器人时想到的？其中有多少是创业者说：“嘿，我刚刚意识到我可以做一些以前做不到的事情，给你。我给了你一个带按钮的产品，它会为你做这件事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right And a lot of the question is okay it may not be very good at doing there's a class of old task that generative AI is good at. There's also lot many more old tasks that generative AI is maybe not very good at. But then there's a whole bunch of other things that you would never have done before that generative is really really good at and then how do you find those or think of those? And how much of that is the user thinking of it faced with a general purpose chatbot? How much of that is the entrepreneur saying, "Hey, I've just realized that there's this thing that I can do that you couldn't do before and here you are. I've given you a product with a button that will do it for you,</p>
</details>

主持人： 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right?</p>
</details>

主持人： 这就是为什么有软件公司，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And it's why there are software companies, right?</p>
</details>

主持人： 而且在移动端，你知道，一些新的用例，你知道，我们，你知道，乘坐陌生人的汽车，你知道，我们提到了**Lyft**（来福车）和**Uber**（优步），或者，你知道，通过应用程序认识的人约会，或者，嗯，你知道，出租你的空余卧室，嗯，你知道，等等。这些都是全新的公司，它们，你知道，是围绕这些行为建立起来的。我认为对于AI，仍然存在一些问题，你知道，那些全新的行为是什么？我们开始看到一些，你知道，人们与聊天机器人互动和交谈，而不是与人类互动，或者，嗯，或者作为补充。然后还有一个问题是，嘿，这些是由当前存在的模型提供商完成的，还是由，你知道，全新的公司完成的，包括企业和消费者两方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And and on on mobile, you know, some of the new use cases, you know, we're you know, getting in strangers cars, you know, we mentioned lift an Uber or sort of, you know, dating people you met via an app or um sort of um you know, lending your spare bedroom out um you know, etc. And and those were net new companies that that that you know, were built around those behaviors. And I think for AI for there's still questions of you know what are those net new behaviors we're starting to see some in terms of you know people engaging and talking with you know chat bots instead of humans or or um or in addition um and then there's a question of hey are these done by the uh model providers that that currently exist or are these done by you know net new companies both on you know sort of enterprise and consumer.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，这始终是一个问题：新事物在堆栈中能走多远？嗯，你知道，我正在和另一位前a16z员工讨论这个问题，他指出，在90年代中期，嗯，人们争论说，嗯，操作系统做了所有事情，而Windows应用程序基本上只是薄薄的**Win32**（Windows 32位应用程序编程接口）包装器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well this is always a question is how far up the stack does the new thing go? Um, and you know, I I was talking about this with another former former A6Z person who pointed out that like in the the the mid '90s, um, people kind of argued that, well, you know, the operating system does all of it and the Windows apps are basically just kind of thin Win332 rappers.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。你知道，**Office**（微软办公软件套件）基本上只是，你知道，一个薄薄的Win32包装器，所有重要的事情都由操作系统完成，无论是文档管理、打印、存储还是显示，这些以前都由应用程序完成。就像在**DOS**（磁盘操作系统）上，应用程序必须处理打印，应用程序必须管理显示。我们转向Windows后，应用程序以前做的90%的事情现在都由Windows完成了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And you know, office is basically just you know a thin wind32 wrapper like all the important stuff is being done by the OS whether it's you know the document management and printing and storage and display which all stuff that used to be done by apps like in on DOSs the apps had to do printing the apps had to manage a display we moved to Windows like 90% of the stuff that the app used to do is now being done by Windows</p>
</details>

主持人： 所以Office就像一个薄薄的Win32包装器，所有困难的事情都由操作系统完成。结果证明，那又是一个，就像框架很有用，但那可能不是一个有用的思考正在发生什么的方式。现在也是一样，这需要多少对市场运作方式或市场是什么以及你会用它做什么的单一专用理解？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and so office is just like a thin wind32 wrapper and all the hard stuff has been being done by the OS and it turns out well that was again it's like frameworks are useful but that's not maybe not a useful way of thinking about what's going on and the same thing now like how much does this need single dedicated understanding of how that market it works or what that market is and what you would do with that. Um I mean I</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，我的意思是，我记得我们在a16z的时候，投资了一家名为**Everlaw**（法律科技公司）的公司，它提供云端法律取证服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mean I remember when we were at A16Z there was an investment in a company called Everaw which is cloud um legal discovery in the cloud.</p>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 然后机器学习出现了，所以现在他们可以做翻译。他们担心律师会说：“嗯，我们不再需要你们了。我们只需要从**AWS**（亚马逊云服务）那里获得一个翻译应用程序和一个情感分析应用程序。”不，律师事务所不是那样运作的。律师事务所想要购买一个销售法律取证软件管理的东西。你知道，他们不想，你知道，自己去编写API调用。我的意思是，非常非常大的律师事务所可能会，但你知道，典型的律师事务所不会那样做。人们购买解决方案，他们不购买技术。这里也是一样，这些模型在堆栈中能走多远？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so machine learning happens and so now they can do translation. Are they worried that lawyers are going to say well we don't need you guys anymore. we're just going to go and get a translate app and a sentiment analysis app from AWS. Like no, that's not how law firms work. Law firms want to buy a thing that sells want to buy legal discovery software management. You know, they don't want to, you know, go and write their own by do API calls. I mean, very, very big law firms might, but you know, typical law firm isn't going to do that. People buy solutions, they don't buy technologies. And the same thing here, like how far up the stack do these models go?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，你能把多少东西变成一个**小部件**（Widget: 可在用户界面中执行特定功能的小型应用程序）？你能把多少东西变成一个**LLM**（Large Language Model: 大型语言模型）请求？然后，你知道，结果证明你需要那个专用的**UI**（User Interface: 用户界面）吗？有趣的是，你可以在Google周围看到这一点，因为Google曾经有一个完整的想法，认为一切都将只是一个Google查询，Google会找出查询是什么。猜猜看，你知道，现在你想要这个**Google Flights**（谷歌航班）不是一个Google查询。你知道，在某个时候，其中一个有趣的事情是，我认为思考**GUI**（Graphical User Interface: 图形用户界面）正在做什么很有趣，GUI正在做的一些事情，以及GUI正在做的显而易见的事情是，它使Office能够拥有500个应用程序，500个功能，你可以找到所有这些功能，至少你不需要记住键盘命令。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um how much can you turn things into um a widget? How much can you turn things into an LM request? And how much know does it turn out that you need that dedicated UI? The funny thing is you can see this around Google because Google had this whole idea that everything would just be a Google query and Google would work out what the query was and guess what you know now you want this Google flights is not a Google query. you know they you a certain point and and one of the one of the interesting things about this and I think it's interesting to think about what a guey is doing that some of what a guey is doing and the obvious thing that a gooey is doing is that it enables office to have 500 application 500 features and you can find them all at least it's you don't have to memorize keyboard commands</p>

Benedict： 你现在可以拥有几乎无限的功能，你可以不断添加菜单和对话框，最终你会用完对话框的屏幕空间，但你可以拥有数百个功能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can now have effectively infinite features and you can just keep adding menus and dialog boxes and eventually you you run out of screen space for dialog boxes but like you can have hundreds of features</p>
</details>

Benedict： 无需人们记住键盘命令。但另一方面是，你处于那个对话框中，或者你处于**Workday**（企业管理软件）或**Salesforce**（客户关系管理软件）或其他企业软件的那个屏幕、那个工作流程中，或者任何软件，或者航空公司网站，或者**Airbnb**（爱彼迎），或者任何东西。屏幕上没有600个按钮。屏幕上有七个按钮，因为那家公司的一群人坐下来思考过，用户在这里应该被问什么？我们应该给他们什么问题？在这个流程的这个点上应该有什么选择？嗯，这反映了大量的机构知识、大量的学习和大量的测试，以及对这应该如何运作的非常仔细的思考。然后你给某人一个原始提示，你只是说：“好吧，你只要告诉它怎么做就行了。”你就会想，但你必须闭上眼睛，眯起眼睛，从第一性原理思考。这一切是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">without people needing to memorize keyboard commands. But the other side of it is you're in that dialogue box or you're in that screen in that workflow in Workday or Salesforce or whatever the enterprise software is, whatever any software or or or the airline website or or Airbnb or whatever it is. And there aren't 600 buttons on the screen. There's seven buttons on the screen because a bunch of people at that company have sat down and has thought, what is it that the user should be asked here? What questions should we give them? what choices should there be at this point in the flow? Um, and that reflects a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of learning and a lot of testing and a lot of really careful thought about how this should work. And then you give somebody a raw prompt and you just say, "Okay, you just tell the thing how to do the thing and you're like, but you've kind of got to shut your eyes, screw your eyes up and think from first principles. How does this all of this work?"</p>

Benedict： 我总是把机器学习比作给你无限的实习生。所以，你知道，想象你有一个任务，你有一个实习生，而这个实习生不知道什么是风险投资。

<details>

主持人： 他们会有多大帮助？他们不知道公司会发布季度报告，我们有一个**Bloomberg**（彭博社）账户可以让我们查询倍数，然后你应该使用**PitchBook**（私募市场数据平台）来获取这些数据，而不是使用Google。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is my point about deep research like no you should use this source and not that source. Um,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你是想从头开始解决这个问题，还是想让一群对这些东西了解很多的人花五年时间找出屏幕上应该有哪些选择供你点击？我的意思是，这是老的用户界面格言：电脑永远不应该问你一个它自己应该知道的问题。你打开一个空白的原始聊天机器人屏幕，它会问你字面上所有的问题。它不仅仅是问你一个问题。它会问你关于你想要什么以及你将如何做到的所有问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you want to have to work that out from scratch or do you want a bunch of people who know a lot about this stuff to have spent 5 years working out what the choices should be on the screen for you to click on it? I mean, it's the old user interface saying the computer should never ask you a question that you should have to work out that it should know by itself. You go to a blank raw chatbot screen, it's asking you literally everything. It's not just asking you one question. It's asking you absolutely everything about what is it is that you want and how you're going to work out what how to do it.</p>
</details>

主持人： 所以，你知道，你提到了**ChatGPT**（聊天生成预训练转换器），你说的对，ChatGPT与其说是一个产品，不如说是一个伪装成产品的聊天机器人。我很好奇，你知道，当我们回顾这种平台转移时，你认为是否会有另一个像iPhone或Excel那样的产品，以ChatGPT无法做到的方式定义这种平台转移的特征？或者说，世界必须赶上如何使用ChatGPT或类似的东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The and so you know you're mentioning chat you right about how chatbt isn't sort of a product as much as chatbot is disguised as a as a product. I I am curious you know when we sort of look back at this sort of the you know platform shift do you think that there will be another sort of iPhone sort ofesque or excelesque product that kind of defines the the the feature the sort of platform shift in a way that chat GPT won't or or or is it sort of that the world has to catch up to how to use chat GPT or or something like chat</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以这两者都可以是真的，因为需要时间才能意识到你将如何使用**Google Maps**（谷歌地图），以及你能用Google做什么，以及你如何使用**Instagram**（照片分享应用），所有这些产品都随着时间发生了巨大的演变。所以其中一些是，你逐渐意识到你能用它做什么，就像你意识到那现在只是一个Google查询。你意识到你可以那样做，你意识到我花了数小时做这件事，我刚刚意识到哦，我其实可以制作一个**数据透视表**（Pivot table: 一种数据汇总工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so both of these both of these can be true because there was a lot of like it took time to realize how you would use Google Maps and what you could do with Google and how you could use Instagram and all of these products have evolved a huge amount over time. So some of it is like you grow towards realizing what you could do with this like you realize that's just a Google query now. You realize that you could just do it like that and you realize I spent you know hours doing this and I just realized oh I could actually just make a pivot table.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。嗯，另一方面是，你仍然期望人们从第一性原理自己解决问题，你知道，让一百、一千、一万个非常聪明的人坐下来，试图找出那些东西是什么，然后以产品的形式展示给你，这很有用。我认为这另一方面是，你知道，总是有这些先驱者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um the other side of it is then but you're still then expecting people to work it out themselves from first principles and you know it's kind of useful to have somebody really 100 a thousand 10,000 really clever people sitting and trying to work out what those things are and then showing it to you as a as a product. I think another side to this is like you know there were always these precursors</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以在**Instagram**（照片分享应用）之前有很多其他东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like there were lots of other things before Instagram.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。你知道，**YouTube**（视频分享平台）一开始并不是YouTube。我想它一开始是视频约会。嗯，有很多尝试做在线约会的，它们都或多或少地运作，直到**Tinder**（交友软件）彻底颠覆了整个事情。所以，总是有很多东西，那个短语是什么？局部最优？事实上，这就是我们所处的位置，特别是对于iPhone，嗯，之前因为我在过去的十年里一直在从事移动领域的工作。嗯，感觉我们并不是在等待一个东西。感觉它一直在运作，就像每年网络都更快，手机都更好，每年都好一点点，我们有应用程序，我们有应用商店，我们有3G，我们有摄像头，事情似乎，你知道，每年都好一点点，然后iPhone来了，它只是，你知道，只是，你知道，在图表下方，你有一条线是这样的，然后有一条线是那样的，尽管也要记住iPhone花了大约两年才真正运作起来，因为，你知道，价格不对，功能集不对，分销模式也不太奏效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. You know, YouTube didn't start as YouTube. It started as video dating, I think. Um, there were lots of of attempts to do online dating that all kind of worked until Tinder kind of pulled the whole thing inside out. And so, there were always lots of things, what's the phrase local maxima? In fact, this is where we were, particularly with the iPhone, um, before cuz I was working in mobile for the previous decade. Um, it didn't feel like we were waiting for a thing. It felt like it was kind of working like every year the networks got faster and the phones got better and it got a little bit better every year and we had apps and we had app stores and we had 3G and we had cameras and stuff seemed to be you know every year was a bit better and then the iPhone arrives and it just you know just you know below the chart kind of you know you've got this line doing this and then there's a line that does that although remember also the iPhone took like two years before it worked because you know the price was wrong and the feature set was wrong and the distribution model didn't quite work.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，所以，是的，你知道，你可以认为一切都进展顺利，然后突然出现了一些事情，你意识到不，哦不，不，不，那是什么，这和Google一样，你知道，就像在Google之前搜索就已经存在了。它只是不太好用。嗯，所以在Facebook之前有很多社交方面的东西，你知道，那才是催化剂。所以，你知道，我只是确定性地认为，整个事情还处于早期，所以感觉当然会有，你知道，几十个，数百个新事物。否则，a16z就应该关门，把钱还给有限合伙人，因为基础模型会做所有事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so yeah, you you know, you can think your you know, you can think everything's going well and then something comes along and you realize no, oh no, no, no, that's which is the same for Google, you know, like search was a thing before Google. It just wasn't very good. Um so there were lots of there was lots of social stuff before Facebook and you know that was the thing that that catalyzed it. So, you know, I just think deterministically this whole thing is so early that it feels like of course there are going to be, you know, dozens, hundreds of new things. Otherwise, H&Z should just kind of shut down and give the money back to the LPS cuz the the foundation models will just do the whole thing. And like I</p>

<p class="english-text">don't think you're going to do that. At least I hope not.</p>
</details>

主持人： 不，不，不。如果说我们过去几年有什么遗憾的话，那就是没有做得更大。我认为我们没有充分认识到在，你知道，无论是语音还是图像生成，或者任何一个细分领域，都会有如此多的专业化，会有，嗯，你知道，全新的公司被创建，它们会比模型提供商做得更好，甚至在每个类别中都会有多个模型提供商。嗯，你知道，在Web 2.0时代，我们总是押注类别赢家，对吧？类别赢家会占据大部分市场，但这些市场如此之大，嗯，而且有如此多的专业知识和专业化，以至于在一个类别中可以有多个赢家，而不仅仅是模型提供商占据一切。甚至在每个类别中，包括模型提供商，都可以有多个赢家，不断增加，你知道，专业化，而且市场足够大，可以容纳多个赢家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, no, no. If we have any regrets from the last few years, it's it's it's not going bigger. I think we didn't fully appreciate how much specialization there would be across uh sort of you know whether it's voice or image generation or or take any sort of subsector that there would be um you know net new companies created that would be better than the than the the the model providers that that there would be even multiple model providers that that or that in every category. Um you know one one thing we've always in the web two era we always bet on the category winner right and and the category winner would take mo most of the market but these markets are so big um and the the the there's so much expertise and specialization that in that there one there can be winners in in every category it's not just sort of the the model providers take everything but that even in every category including the model providers there can be multiple winners in increasing you know specialization and and the the markets are just big enough to to contain multiple winners.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think that's right. And I think you know the categories themselves aren't clear, right?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 而且，你知道，很多你认为是一个类别的东西，结果发现不，它实际上是完全不同的另一回事，类别会以不同的方式被解绑、捆绑和重新组合。我的意思是，我记得我在1995年还是个学生。嗯，我的PC上大概有四五个不同的网页浏览器，网页服务器，因为**Tim Berners-Lee**（蒂姆·伯纳斯-李，万维网发明者）最初的网页浏览器里有一个网页编辑器，因为他认为这就像一个网络驱动器，它是一个共享系统，并没有意识到它不是一个发布系统。所以你会把你的网页放在你的PC上，然后让你的PC一直开着，这样你的同事就可以查看你的Word文档或你的网页。所以再说一次，我们就是不知道如何，我总是回到这一点。我觉得我们目前提出的大多数问题可能都是错误的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you know many you know things you think this is a category and it turns out no it was actually that whole other thing and the categories kind of get unbundled and bundled and recombined in different ways. I mean, I remember I was a student in 1995 and um there I think I had like four or five different web browsers on my PC, web servers on my PC cuz I mean Tim Berners Le's original web browser had a web editor in it because he thought this was kind of like a network drive and it was a sharing system and didn't realize not not really a publishing system. So you would have your web pages on your PC and you'd use leave your PC turned on and that would be how your colleagues would look at your word documents or your web pages. And so again, like we just don't know how and and I just kind of keep coming back to this point. I feel like most of the questions we're asking at the moment are probably the wrong question.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 不过，从你刚才所说的一个方面来看，有趣的一点是我一直在思考**OpenAI**（人工智能研究公司）。嗯，因为，你知道，我被脱节所吸引，我们现在有一个有趣的脱节，那就是，你知道，如果你看基准分数，你就会发现这些通用基准测试中，模型基本上都是一样的。如果你每天花数小时使用它们，那么你就会有这样的看法：“哦，我更喜欢**Claude**（Anthropic公司的大型语言模型）的语气，而不是**GPT**（OpenAI的大型语言模型）的，我更喜欢GPT 5.1而不是GPT 4.9，或者随便它叫什么。”如果你每周只用一次，你真的不会注意到这些。而且基准分数都大致相同。但使用情况却不同。Claude基本上没有消费者使用，尽管在基准分数上它与GPT相同。然后是ChatGPT，然后图表中间是Meta和Google。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And picking up on on a strand within what you just said, though, the interesting one of the things I'm sort of thinking about a lot is looking at looking at OpenAI. Um because, you know, I'm I'm I'm sort of fascinated by disconnections and we've got this interesting disconnect now, which is that, you know, if you look at the benchmark scores, so you've got these general purpose benchmarks where the models are basically all the same and if you're Yes. If you're spending hours a day in them, then you've got this opinion about, oh, I like Claude's tone of voice more than I like GBT and I like GBT 5.1 more than GBT 4.9 or whatever the hell it's called. If you're using this once a week, you really don't notice this stuff. And the benchmark scores are all roughly the same. And but the usage isn't. It's basically the only consu Claude has basically no consumer usage even though on the benchmark score it's the same. and then it's chat GBT and then halfway down the chart it's um Meta and Google.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 有趣的是，你知道，你再读所有AI新闻通讯，然后就像Meta已经输了，他们出局了，他们死了，**Mark Zuckerberg**（马克·扎克伯格）正在花费十亿美元让研究人员重新回到游戏中，但从消费者方面来看，嗯，那是分销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the funny thing is you know that you read all the AI newsletters again then like Meta's lost they're out of the game they're dead Mark Zuckerberg is spending a billion dollars a researcher to get back in the game but from the consumer side well it's it's distribution</p>
</details>

Benedict： 这里有趣的是，我一直在思考的是，如果对于一个普通消费者用户来说，模型是商品，并且目前还没有网络效应或赢家通吃效应。这些效应可能会出现，但我们还没有。像记忆这样的东西不是网络效应，而是粘性，但它们可以被复制。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the interesting thing here is that you've got what I'm kind of circling around is if the model for a casual consumer user certainly is a commodity and there's no network effects or winner takes all effects yet. There may those may emerge but we don't have them yet. And things like memory aren't network effects as stickiness but they can be copied. Um</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你如何竞争？你只是靠成为公认的品牌，并添加更多功能、服务和能力来竞争，而人们只是不转换吗？这有点像**Chrome**（谷歌浏览器）的情况。Chrome没有网络效应，而且它实际上并没有好多少。也许它比**Safari**（苹果浏览器）好一点，但你知道，你使用Chrome是因为你使用Chrome。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how is it that you compete? Do you just compete on being the recognized brand and adding more features and services and capabilities and people just don't switch away? Which is kind of what happened with Chrome for example. There's not a network effect for Chrome, but it and it's not actually any better much. Maybe it's a bit better than Safari, but you know, you use Chrome because you use Chrome.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 或者你会在分销方面落后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or is it that you get left behind on distribution</p>
</details>

Benedict： 或者网络效应出现在其他地方，同时你又没有自己的基础设施。所以我想我想要表达的是，你拥有八九亿的每周活跃用户，但这感觉非常脆弱，因为你真正拥有的只是默认的力量和品牌。你没有网络效应。你没有真正的功能锁定。你没有更广泛的生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or network effects that emerge somewhere else and meanwhile you don't have your own infrastructure. So I suppose what I what I'm getting at is like you've got these 8 or 900 million weekly active users, but you don't have but that feels very fragile because all you've really got is the power of the default and the brand. You don't have a network effect. You don't really have feature lock in. You don't have a broader ecosystem.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你也没有自己的基础设施。所以你无法控制你的成本基础。你没有成本优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You also don't have your own infrastructure. So you don't control your cost base. You don't have a cost advantage.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你每个月都会收到**Satya Nadella**（萨蒂亚·纳德拉，微软CEO）的账单。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You get a bill every month from Satcha. Um,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以你必须在这两个方向上尽可能快地行动，一方面在模型之上构建产品和东西，这是我们之前的对话。它只是模型吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you've kind of got to scramble as fast as you can in both of those directions to on the one side build product and build stuff that on top of the model, which is our earlier conversation. Is it just the model?</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 现在，你必须在模型的各个方向上构建东西。它是一个浏览器。它是一个社交视频应用。它是一个应用平台。它是这个。它是那个。就像，你知道，那个拿着地图，上面有所有线条的家伙的表情包，你知道。嗯，它就是所有这些东西。我们昨天就要把所有这些都构建出来。然后同时，它是基础设施，就像，你知道，我们必须处理OpenAI，抱歉，处理**Nvidia**（英伟达），处理**Broadcom**（博通），处理**AMD**（超微半导体），处理Nvidia，处理**Oracle**（甲骨文），以及**石油美元**（Petrodollars: 石油出口国通过出售石油获得的美元收入）。嗯，因为你正在努力从这个惊人的技术突破和这八九亿的惊叹中，获得真正具有粘性、可防御、可持续的商业价值和产品价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, you've got to build stuff on top of the model in every direction. It's a browser. It's a social video app. It's an app platform. It's this. It's that. It's like, you know, the meme of the guy with the map with all the strings on it, you know. Um it's all of these things. We're going to build all of them yesterday. And then in parallel it's infrastructure like and you know we we do we've got to deal with OpenAI sorry deal with with with Nvidia with with with Broadcom with AMD with Nvidia with Oracle and with petro dollars. Um because you're kind of scrambling to get from this amazing technical breakthrough and these 800 900 million wows to something that has like really sticky defensible sustainable business value and product value.</p>

### 超大规模云计算服务商的竞争格局

主持人： 是的。所以当你评估超大规模云计算服务商之间的竞争格局时，你认为哪些问题在决定谁将获得持久的竞争优势，或者这种竞争将如何展开方面最为重要？嗯，这又回到了你关于持续优势的观点，我们谈到了Google，就像如果我们考虑Meta向移动端的转变，这被证明是变革性的，它使产品更有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and so as you're evaluating the the competitive landscape among the the hyperscalers, what are the the questions that you're ask that you think are going to be most important in determining um you know who who's going to gain you know durable competitive advantages or or how this competitive is going to competition is going to play out. Well, this kind of comes back to your point about sustaining advantage and we talked about Google like if we think about the shift to particularly shift to mobile for meta this turned out to be transformative like it made the products way more useful.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人： 嗯，对Google来说，移动搜索就是搜索。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um for Google it turned out mobile search is just search</p>
</details>

主持人： 地图可能有所改变，YouTube也有所改变，但基本上对于Google搜索来说，Google搜索就是搜索，而网络搜索只是意味着更多的人在更多的时间里进行更多的搜索。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and maps changed probably and YouTube changed a bit but basically for Google search Google search is search and the web web search is just mean means more people doing more search more more of the time. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人： 嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, and</p>
</details>

Benedict： 现在默认的观点似乎是，嗯，**Gemini**（谷歌大型语言模型）和其他任何模型一样好。下周，比如新模型，我还没有看过今天发布的**GPT 5.1**的基准测试。它比Gemini更好吗？可能吧。下个月它还会更好吗？不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the default view now would seem to be, well, Gemini is as good as anybody else. Next week, like the new model, I haven't looked at the benchmarks for GPT 5.1, which is out today. Is it better than Gemini? Probably. Will it still be better next month? No.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以，这是既定的。就像，你有一个前沿模型。很好。那要花多少钱？它每年花费你，随便一个数字，2500亿美元，1000亿美元。这是什么？这是我们之前关于**资本支出**（Capex: 资本性支出，指用于购买、改进或延长固定资产使用寿命的支出）的对话。好吧。所以，Google可以支付，因为他们有钱。他们有来自其他一切的现金流。所以，你这样做，你的现有产品就会优化搜索。你优化你的广告业务。你构建，你知道，你构建新的体验。也许你发明了AI的iPhone。也许没有AI的iPhone。也许其他人做了，你做了一个**Android**（谷歌移动操作系统），然后复制它。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's a given. Like, you've got a Frontier model. Fine. What does that cost? It costs you, pick a number, $250 billion a year, $100 billion a year. What's this? This is our earlier conversation about capex. Okay. So, Google can pay that because they've got the money. They've got they've got the cash rate from everything else. And so, you do that and your existing products get you optimize search. You optimize your ad business. You build, you know, you build new experiences. Maybe you invent the new the iPhone of AI. Maybe there is no iPhone of AI. Maybe someone else does it and you do an Android and just copy it. Um,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以很好，它是新的移动技术。我们会继续下去。搜索就是搜索。AI就是AI。我们会做新事物。我们会把它变成一个功能。我们会继续做下去。嗯，对于Meta来说，感觉这对于搜索意味着什么，或者它对于内容、社交、体验和推荐意味着什么，有更大的问题。这使得他们拥有自己的模型变得更加必要，就像Google一样。嗯，对于Amazon。好吧。一方面，它是商品基础设施，我们会把它作为商品基础设施出售。另一方面，也许可以退后一步。如果你不是一个超大规模云计算服务商，如果你是一个网络出版商、营销人员、品牌、广告商、媒体公司，你可以列出一系列问题，但你现在甚至不知道问题是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so fine, it's the new mobile. We'll just carry on. Search is search. AI is AI. We'll do the new thing. We'll make it a feature. We'll just carry on doing it. Um, for meta, it feels like there are bigger questions on what this means for search. Um, or what it means for content and social and experience and recommendation, which makes it all that more imperative that they have their own models just as it is for Google. Um, for Amazon. Okay. Well, on the one side, it's commodity infra and we'll sell it as commodity infra. And on the other side, and maybe can maybe step maybe step back. If you're not a hyperscaler, if you're a web publisher, a marketer, a brand, an advertiser, a media company, you could make a list of questions, but like you don't even know what the questions are right now.</p>
</details>

主持人： 这是什么？如果我问聊天机器人一件事而不是问Google，会发生什么？即使是从Google的角度来看，嗯，我会问Google的聊天机器人。没关系。但作为营销人员，这意味着什么？如果我要求一个食谱，而LLM直接给我答案，这意味着什么？如果我的业务是提供食谱，那意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What is this? What happens if I ask a chatbot a thing instead of asking Google? Even if it's Google from from Google's point of view, well, I'll ask Google's chatbot. It's fine. But as a marketer, what does that mean? What happens if I ask for a recipe and the LLM just gives me the answer? What does that mean if my business is having recipes?</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你是否有某种划分，这也是一个Amazon的问题，购买决策是如何发生的？购买一个我以前不知道存在的东西的决定是如何发生的？如果我对着我的客厅挥舞手机说：“我应该买什么？这会把我带到哪里？”以过去不会带我去的方式。所以下游有很多问题，这会向上游影响Meta，并在一定程度上影响Google。从长远来看，这对Amazon来说是一个更大的问题。LLM是否意味着Amazon最终可以真正做好大规模的推荐、发现和建议，以过去无法做到的方式，嗯，因为它拥有这种纯粹的商品零售模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you have a kind of split between, and this is also an Amazon question, how does a purchasing decision happen? How does this decision to buy a thing that I didn't know existed before happen? What happens if I wave my phone at my living room and say, "What should I buy? Where does that take me?" In ways that it wouldn't have taken me in the past. So there's a lot of questions further downstream and that goes upstream to Meta and to some extent for Google. It's a much bigger question in the long term for Amazon. Do do LLM mean that Amazon can finally do really good at scale recommendation and discovery and suggestion in ways that it couldn't really do in the past um because of this kind of pure commodity retailing model that it has.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，**Apple**（苹果）有点偏离。你知道，有趣的是，两年前他们提出了一个令人难以置信的引人注目的**Siri**（苹果语音助手）愿景。结果证明他们无法实现。有趣的是，其他人也无法实现。你回去看看他们展示的Siri演示，你会想，好吧，所以我们有**多模态**（Multimodal: 指能够处理和理解多种类型数据，如文本、图像、音频等）的、即时的、设备上的、使用**代理**（Agentic: 指AI系统能够自主地执行任务并与环境互动）的、多平台的、实时的电子商务，没有提示注入问题，错误率为零。嗯，这听起来不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Apple Apple's sort of off on one side. You know, interestingly, they produced this incredibly compelling vision of what Siri should be two years ago. It just turned out that they couldn't make it. Interestingly, nobody else could have made it either. You go back and watch the Siri demo that they gave and you think, okay, so we've got multimodal instantaneous ondevice tool using agentic multiplatform e-commerce in real time with no prompt injection problems and zero error rates. Well, that sounds good.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我的意思是，有人让它运作起来了吗？不。Google和OpenAI都没有让它运作起来。我认为Google或OpenAI无法实现Apple两年前展示的Siri演示。我的意思是，他们可能可以做演示，但他们无法持续可靠地让它运作。我的意思是，那个演示产品今天在Android中不存在。嗯，而Apple，我的意思是，对我来说，Apple面临着最具有知识趣味的问题，那就是，嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, has anyone got that working? Like, no. Open eye open Google and Open AI don't have that working. I Google I don't think Google or OpenAI could deliver the Siri demo that Apple gave two years ago. I mean, they could probably do the demo, but they couldn't like consistently reliably make it work. I mean, that that demo that product isn't in Android today. Um and Apple I mean Apple to me has the most kind of intellectually interesting question which is um</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以我看到**Craig Federighi**（克雷格·费德里吉，苹果软件工程高级副总裁）提出了这个观点，他说：“我们没有自己的聊天机器人。很好。我们也没有YouTube或Uber。”这解释了为什么这与众不同，这是一个比听起来更难回答的问题。嗯，当然答案是，如果这真的从根本上改变了计算的本质，那么这就是一个问题；如果它只是你使用的服务，比如Google，那么这不是一个问题。嗯，这有点像关于Siri去向的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I saw Craig Craig Federigi make this point which is like we don't have our own chatbot fine we also don't have YouTube or Uber what what explain why that is different which is a harder question to answer than it sounds like um and of course the answer is if this actually fundamentally changed the nature of computing then it's a problem if it's just a service that you use like Google then that's not a problem. Um which is kind of the point about about you know where does Siri go.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但这里有趣的**反例**（Counter example: 与某个论点或理论相悖的例子）是思考2000年代微软发生了什么，整个开发环境都脱离了他们的掌控，2001年之后就没有人再开发Windows应用程序了。但你需要使用互联网。要使用互联网，你需要一台PC，你会买哪台PC呢？嗯，当时Apple并不是一个真正的参与者，刚刚回到游戏中。**Linux**（开源操作系统）显然不是任何普通人的选择。嗯，所以你购买Windows PC。所以基本上微软输掉了平台战争，但却多卖了一个数量级的PC，嗯，不是卖，而是多了一个数量级的Windows PC，这是微软输掉的这件事的结果。嗯，然后直到移动时代，他们才失去了设备以及开发环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the interesting counter example here would be to think about what happened to Microsoft in the 2000s which is the entire dev environment gets away from them and no one builds Windows apps after like 2001 or something but you need to use the internet. To use the internet you need a PC and what PC are you going to buy? Well like Apple's like not really a player at that time and just getting back into the game. Linux is obviously not an option for any normal person. Um, so you buy Windows PC. So basically Microsoft loses the platform war and sells an order of magnitude more PCs like well not selling them but order an order of magnitude more Windows PCs as a result of this thing that Microsoft lost. Um, and then it takes until mobile that like then they lose the device as well as a development development environment.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以这里的问题是，如果所有新事物都建立在AI之上，而我正在访问一个从应用商店下载的应用程序，这在多大程度上对Apple构成问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here's this kind of question is if all the new stuff is built on AI and I'm accessing an app that I download from the app store, to what extent is this a problem for Apple?</p>

Benedict： 而且你需要一个更根本性的转变才能对Apple构成问题。即使你采取，你知道，不是那种完全的，就像“大灾变”降临，我们都只是去睡在舱里，就像电影里的人一样。嗯，不是《飞屋环游记》。嗯，是的，是哪一部？那个有机器人清理垃圾的电影是哪一部？

<p class="english-text">>> Wall-ally. Wally. Yeah. You know the guys in the pods in that movie. Maybe we'll be the people. Maybe we'll be like that. In which case fine. Um, but like there's a sort of a midc case which is like the whole nature of software changes and there are no apps anymore and you just go and ask the LLM a thing. Fine. What is the device on which you ask the LLM a thing? Well, it's probably going to have a nice big color screen and it's probably going to have like a one day battery life. Probably needs a microphone. Probably a good camera. Kind of sounds like an iPhone.</p>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我会买那个价格只有十分之一，只用LLM的设备吗？不，因为我仍然想要好的摄像头、好的屏幕和好的电池续航。所以，当你开始深入探究时，会有很多有趣的战略问题。嗯，这对Amazon意味着什么？这些问题与对Google或Apple意味着什么，或者对Facebook或**Salesforce**（客户关系管理软件公司）意味着什么，或者对**Uber**（优步）意味着什么，完全不同。然后回到我们对话开始时所说的，你知道，这对Uber意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Am I going to buy the one that's a tenth of the price and just use the LLM on it? No, because I'll still want the good camera and this good screen and the good battery life. So, it's not there's a bunch of kind of interesting strategic questions when you start poking away. Well, what does this mean for Amazon? Those are completely different questions to what does it mean for Google or what does it mean for Apple? What does it mean to Facebook or what does it mean to Salesforce? What does it mean to you know Uber? And then right back to what we were saying at the beginning of this conversation you know what does this mean for Uber?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 嗯，他们的效率提高了X%，现在欺诈检测也奏效了，你知道，好吧，也许他们的自动驾驶汽车是另一个话题，但假设没有自动驾驶汽车。那是另一个话题。否则，作为Uber，这改变了什么？嗯。

### AI时代的新问题与旧问题

主持人： 所以你做这些演讲已经有一段时间了。你，你知道，你把它们增加到两次，嗯，因为变化太大了。嗯，你在每次演讲中都会做的一件事是，你以提出真正好的问题和记录哪些是重要的问题而闻名。我很好奇当你回顾，你知道，也许在2022年**ChatGPT**（聊天生成预训练转换器）或**GPT-3**发布之后，嗯，你当时问的问题，以及你现在回顾时，这些问题在多大程度上有了方向，或者在多大程度上它们是相同的问题，或者新的、不同的问题？或者，你知道，如果我读了你的原始演讲，比如说GPT-3发布后的那一个，然后现在看到这个，最令人惊讶的事情是什么，或者我们学到了什么更新了那些问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so you've been doing these presentations for a while now. You, you know, you bumped them up to two times um because there's so much is changing. Um and and one of the things you do in each presentation is is you're famous for asking, you know, really great questions and chronicling what what are the important questions to to be asking. I'm I'm curious as you reflect, you know, maybe post uh you know, CHGBT in 2022 or GBT3 rather. um the questions you were asking then and you reflect on to now uh to what extent uh do we have some direction on some of those questions or to what extent are they the same questions or or new and and and different questions or what is sort of your you know if I woke up on a in a coma after reading your you know your original presentation let's say you the one after GPT uh 3 launch came out um and then seeing this one now what were the sort of most surprising things or things that we we we learned that updated those questions.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以我认为今年我们有很多新问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So I think we have a lot of new questions this year.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以我觉得，你知道，你可以在23年春天列出大约六个问题，比如开源、中国、**Nvidia**（英伟达），扩展是否继续，嗯，图像会发生什么，嗯，OpenAI的领先地位能保持多久？这些问题在23年和24年并没有真正改变，而且大多数问题仍然存在，比如Nvidia的问题并没有真正改变，你知道，关于**ChatGPT**（聊天生成预训练转换器）的答案，你知道，会有多少模型？答案是，好吧，任何能花几百亿的人都可以拥有一个前沿模型。这在23年初就很明显了。嗯，花了一段时间才让所有人明白这一点。大模型和小模型，我们会有在设备上运行的小模型吗？不，因为小模型的能力变化太快，无法将小模型缩小到设备上。但这些问题在两年半的时间里并没有改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I feel like you know you could make a list of as it might be half a dozen questions in spring of 23 like open source China Nvidia does scaling continue um what happens to images um does how long does open AI's lead remain and those questions didn't really change in 23 and 24 and most of those questions are kind of still there like the Nvidia question hasn't really changed you know the answer on ch the answer on you know will how models will there be? The answer is okay, there's going to be anybody who can spend a couple of hundred can spend a couple of billion dollars can have a frontier model. That was pretty obvious in early 23. Um it took a while for everyone to understand that. And big models and small models, will we have small models running on devices? No, because the small models the capabilities keep moving too fast for the small models to shrink the small model onto the device. But those questions kind of didn't change for two two and a half years.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我认为我们现在有了更多产品战略问题，因为你看到了真正的消费者采用，OpenAI和Google正在向不同方向构建东西，Amazon正在向不同方向发展，Apple正在尝试并显然失败，然后又再次尝试做事情。某种意义上，行业中正在发生的事情不仅仅是“让我们再构建一个模型，再花更多钱”。

<p class="english-text">I think we now have I think a bunch of more product strategy questions as you see real consumer adoption and open AI and Google building stuff in different directions, Amazon going in different directions, Apple trying and obviously failing and then then trying again to do stuff. There's some sense of like there is something more going on in the industry than just well let's just build another model and spend more money.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 有更多的问题和更多的决策。现在科技之外也有更多问题，尤其是在零售媒体方面，嗯，你如何开始思考你会用这个做什么？再说一次，你知道，我的演讲中经典的框架是，第一步是把它变成一个功能，你吸收它，你做显而易见的事情。第二步是你做新事物。第三步是也许有人会来彻底颠覆整个行业，完全重新定义问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> there's more questions and more decisions. Now there's also more questions outside of tech in certainly on like the retail media side of um how do you start thinking about what you would do with this? And again, you know, classic framing in my deck is like step one is you make it a feature and you absorb it and you do the obvious stuff. Step two is you do new stuff. Step three is maybe someone will come and pull the whole industry inside out and completely redefine the question.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以你可以做这样的想象：第一步是，嗯，你知道，你是湾区或华盛顿特区或任何地方的**Walmart**（沃尔玛）经理。第一步是找到那个指标。第二步是构建一个仪表板。第三步是，现在是黑色星期五，我正在管理华盛顿特区郊外的Walmart。我应该担心什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so you could kind of do like an imagine if here of like step one is um you know you're you're a manager at a Walmart in the Bay Area or DC or like whatever it is. Step one is find me that metric. Step two is build me a dashboard. Step three is it's Black Friday and I'm running managing a Walmart outside of DC. What should I be worried about?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 就像，那可能不是正确的，但就像，你知道，Amazon的第一步是，你买了灯泡，所以这里有一些，你买了气泡膜，所以这里有一些打包胶带，但Amazon真正应该做的是说：“嗯，这个人正在搬家，我们会向他们展示一个家庭保险广告。”这是Amazon的关联系统无法获得的，因为他们的数据中没有这些购买数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like and that might be the wrong one but it's like you know step one for Amazon is you bought light bulbs so here's so you bought bubble wrap so here's some packing tape but what Amazon should actually be doing is saying hm say this person is moving home we'll show them a home insurance ad which is something that Amazon's correlation systems wouldn't get because they wouldn't have that in their purchasing data</p>
</details>

Benedict： 而且我们仍然非常处于，就像我们仍然刚刚开始，我们仍然处于第一步，但思考更多。第二步、第三步会是什么？除了简单的自动化之外，新的收入会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we're still very much at the like we're still starting to we're still on the step one of that but thinking much more. What would the step two, step three be? What would new revenue be for this other than just like simple dumb automation?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我们会用这个构建什么新东西？嗯，这实际上会如何重新定义或改变市场？嗯，这对任何内容业务的人来说显然都是一个大问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What would new things that we would build with this be? Um, where would this actually like might I might might actually kind of redefine or change what the market might look like? Um, and that's obviously a big question for anyone in content business.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 你知道，如果我可以直接问LLM这个问题，这意味着什么？什么样的内容是建立在Google将这个问题路由给你的基础上的？什么样的内容不是真正的问题？比如，我想要一个肉酱意面食谱，还是想听**Stanley Tucci**（斯坦利·图齐，演员）谈论在意大利烹饪？就像我只是想要那个**SKU**（Stock Keeping Unit: 库存单位），还是想弄清楚我应该买哪个产品？Amazon非常擅长给你SKU，但在告诉你你想要哪个SKU方面却很糟糕。嗯，我只是想要幻灯片，还是想花一周时间与贝恩公司的一群合伙人讨论我该如何思考这个问题？我只是想要钱，还是想与a16z的，你知道，运营团队合作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, what does it mean if I can just go and ask an LLM this question? What kinds of content were predicated on Google rooting that question to you? And what kind of questions what kind of content isn't really that question? Like do I want a Bologn recipe or do I want to hear Stanley Tucci talking about cooking in Italy? Like do I just want the do I want that skew or do I want to work out which product I should buy? Which is Amazon is great at getting you the skew. terrible at telling you what ski you want. Um, do I just want the slide deck or do I want to spend a week talking to a bunch of partners from Bane about how I could think about doing this? Do I just want money or do I want to work with A16Z's um, you know, operating groups?</p>
</details>

主持人： 就像我在这里到底在做什么？我认为LLM正在以许多不同的方式开始明确这个问题。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Like what is it that I'm doing here? And I think the the LLM is starting thing is starting to crystallize that question in lots of different ways. Yeah,</p>
</details>

主持人： 就像我到底想在这里做什么？我只是想要一个电脑现在可以为我回答的东西，还是我想要一些电脑以前做不到的其他东西？因为LLM可以做很多以前电脑做不到的事情，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> like what am I actually trying to do here? Do I just want a thing that a computer can now answer for me or do I want something else that isn't? Because the LMS can do a bunch of stuff that computers couldn't do before, right?</p>
</details>

主持人： 电脑以前做不到的那件事就是我的业务吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Is that thing that the computer couldn't do before my business?</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人： 还是我实际上在做其他事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Or am I actually doing something else?</p>
</details>

主持人： 我们即将以更细致的方式弄清楚，对于许多许多这些，嗯，真正需要完成的工作是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We're we're about to figure out what is the in a much more granular way what what is the true job to be done for for for many many of these uh</p>
</details>

Benedict： 是的。你知道，回到互联网时代，你知道，关于报纸的观察是，报纸看待互联网时，他们谈论专业知识、内容策划、新闻业以及其他一切，但并没有真正说：“嗯，我们是一家轻工业制造公司，也是一家地方分销和卡车运输公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And you know going back to the internet there was you know the sort of observation about newspapers is that newspapers looked on the internet and they talked about you know expertise and curation and journalism and everything else and didn't really say well we're a light manufacturing company and a local distribution and trucking company.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 而那才是问题所在，直到互联网出现，你才开始思考这个问题，然后互联网突然让这一点变得清晰，突然创造了一个以前不存在的解绑。所以会有那种情况，就像你以前没有意识到自己是那样，直到LLM出现，或者有人带着LLM出现，然后说：“我可以用这个来做这件事，而你以前没有真正意识到这是你防御能力的基础，或者你盈利能力的基础。”我的意思是，这就像，你知道，关于美国健康保险的笑话，就像美国健康保险盈利能力的基础是让它变得非常非常无聊、困难和耗时。利润就来自于此。也许不是。我不了解那个行业，但为了论证，假设那是你的防御能力。那么，LLM消除了无聊、耗时、令人麻木的任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And that was the bit that was the problem and until the internet arrived like that wasn't a conversation you thought about and then the internet suddenly makes that clear and suddenly creates an unbundling that didn't exist before. And so there will be those kinds of like you didn't realize you were that before until an LLM comes along and points to someone comes along with an LLM and says I can use this to do this thing that you didn't really realize was the basis of your defensibility or the basis of your profitability. I mean it's like the you know the the the joke about you know US health insurance that like the basis of US health insurance profitability is making it really really boring and difficult and timeconuming. That's where the profits come from. Maybe it isn't. I don't I don't know that industry, but for the sake of argument, say that's that's your defensibility. Well, an LLM removes boring, time-consuming, mind-numbing tasks.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 那么，哪些行业受到这种保护？他们没有意识到这一点。而这些，你知道，就像你可以在90年代中期问这些关于互联网的问题，或者十年后问关于移动技术的问题。通常，你问的一半问题事后看来都是错误的问题。我的意思是，我记得在2000年作为一名初级分析师时，每个人都在说：“3G的杀手级应用是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, what industries are protected by having that? And they didn't realize that. And these, you know, it's like you could have asked these questions about the internet in the mid '90s or about mobile a decade later. And generally, you'd have half of the questions you'd have asked would have been the wrong questions in hindsight. I mean, I remember as a as a baby analyst in 2000,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 3G有什么好的用例？”结果证明，随身携带互联网就是3G的用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">everyone kept saying, "What's the killer use case for 3G? What's a good use case for 3G?" And it turned out that having the internet in your pocket everywhere was the use case for 3G.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 但那不是人们当时在问的问题。我相信现在也会是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But that wasn't the question that people were asking. And I'm sure that will be the thing now</p>
</details>

Benedict： 会有很多事情发生和被构建，你会发现，哦，原来是这样。你可以把它变成那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is there's so much that we will that will happen and get built where you go and you realize, oh, that's how you would do this. you can turn it into that.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我相信你也有过这样的经历，看到创业者。你知道，他们时不时地进来推销他们的东西。你会说：“哦，好吧。你可以把它变成那样。我以前没意识到是那样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I'm sure you've had this experience seeing entrepreneurs. You you know, you get every now and then they come in and they pitch the thing. You're like, "Oh, okay. You can turn it into that. It didn't I didn't realize it was that."</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。不，100%是这样。我最后一个问题是，嗯，如果我们在两三年后，或者你正在做一个演讲，你说：“哦，这实际上比互联网更伟大，或者这就像计算一样。”嗯，那需要什么条件？需要发生什么？什么会，嗯，什么会发展我们的思维？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, 100%. My my last question to get you out of here is um if if we're talking two or three years from now or you you're doing a presentation, you say, "Oh, this is actually bigger than the internet or may maybe this is like like computing." Um what would need to be true? What what would need to happen? What what would uh what would evolve our thinking?</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我的意思是，我有点，你知道，回到我关于犹太人和基督徒的观点，就像弥赛亚来了，什么也没发生。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean I I kind of you know sort of come back to my point about you know the Jews and Christians like the Messiah came nothing happened. Um,</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我们忘记了，我的意思是，也许有两种非常简短的方式来思考这个问题。其中之一是，我认为我们忘记了iPhone有多么巨大，互联网有多么巨大。你仍然可以在科技界找到声称智能手机没什么大不了的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we forget I mean there's maybe two two ways very brief ways to think about this. One of them is I think we forget how enormous the iPhone was and how enormous the internet was. And you can still find people in tech who claim that smartphones aren't a big deal.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 这就是人们抱怨我的基础，就像这个白痴。他认为像生成式AI和那些愚蠢的手机一样重要。拜托。我认为另一个答案是，就像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this was the basis of people complaining about me like this idiot. He thinks like generative AI is big as those silly phone things. Like come on. I think another answer would be like</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我不想卷入关于，你知道，什么是**Grace Rating Capability**（一种评估AI系统能力的指标）以及基准测试等等的争论，你知道，你会看到很多长达五小时的播客，人们都在谈论这些东西，但我们现在拥有的东西并不能取代一个真实的人，除了在一些非常狭窄和非常严格的限制条件下，这就是为什么，你知道，Demis的观点是，现在说我们拥有博士级别的能力是荒谬的。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to get into the argument about you know what is the grace rating capability and benchmarks and and all you know you see lots of 5hour long podcasts of people talking about this stuff but the stuff we have now is not a replacement for an actual person outside of some very narrow and very tightly constrained guard rails which is why you know Demis's point that it's absurd to say that we have PhD level capabilities now. Um</p>
</details>

Benedict： 我们必须看到一些真正能改变我们对这些东西能力认知的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what we would have to be seeing something that would really shift our perception of the capability of this stuff.</p>
</details>

主持人： 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 所以它实际上是一个人，而不是它有时能很好地做这些像人的事情，但有时又不能。而且，你知道，这是一个非常艰难的概念性思考，因为，你知道，我故意，我意识到我没有给你一个可证伪的答案。但我不知道可证伪的答案会是什么。你什么时候会知道这是AGI？你知道，这是**Larry Tesler**（拉里·泰斯勒，计算机科学家）的名言：AI是那些尚未奏效的东西。一旦人们说它奏效了，人们就会说：“嗯，那不是AI。那只是软件。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that it's actually a person as opposed to it can kind of do these people like things really well sometimes but not other times. And it's a, you know, it's a very tough conceptual kind of thing to think about because, you know, I'm I'm deliberate. I'm I'm conscious I'm not giving you a falsifiable answer. But I'm not sure what a falsifiable answer would be to that. When would you know whether this was AGI? You know, it's the Larry Tesla line. AI is whatever doesn't work yet. As people, as soon as people say it works, people say, "Well, that's just not AI. That's just software."</p>
</details>

Benedict： 这是一个，你知道，它变成了一种有点醉醺醺的哲学系研究生的对话，而不是技术对话。就像它会是什么？你有没有考虑过，Eric，那。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a, you know, it's a it's an and it becomes like a kind of a slightly drunk philosoph philosophy grad student kind of conversation as much as it is a technology conversation. Like what would it have you ever considered, Eric, that</p>
</details>

主持人： 也许我们也不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> maybe we're not either.</p>
</details>

Benedict： 这值得思考。我能给这个问题的具体答案是，我们现在拥有的不是那样。它会发展成那样吗？我们不知道。你可能相信它会。我不能说你错了。我们只能拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's a thought. It's I I all I can say to give a tangible answer to this question is what we have right now isn't that. Will it grow to that? We don't know. You may believe it will. I can't tell you that you're wrong. We'll just have to find out.</p>
</details>

主持人： 我认为这是一个很好的结束点。演讲是《AI吞噬世界》。我们会链接到它。它非常棒。Benedict，非常感谢你来播客讨论它。
