### 能源革命：从石油到地热的进化论

**Cindy Taff**以德克萨斯口音开场，坦言自己曾是石油与天然气行业从业者，但如今已创立地热能公司。她指出能源演变的必然性——从烧木头到鲸油、煤炭、油气，最终转向太阳能与风能。这种历史性跃迁促使她离开壳牌公司，将石油行业的"泥浆技术"（mud-on-your-boots know-how）应用于地热开发。

OK, so if you can't tell already, I'm from Texas. (Cheers and applause) And I also spent my career in the oil and gas industry. So do you hate me yet? (Laughter) Let's hope not. So I went into oil and gas because energy is life. And I wanted to be able to provide people with lights, air conditioning, heat, and, of course, the ability to watch funny cat videos on their phone. (Laughter) But energy also evolves. So humans used to burn wood for heat and light. We then transitioned to whale oil and to coal, and then to oil and gas. But we're now using renewables, like solar and wind. And it's this exciting evolution to clean, renewable energy that inspired me to leave Shell and start my own geothermal company with my partners.

**地球的"核燃料库"**  
演讲者揭示了一个鲜为人知的地质真相：地下深处蕴藏着5万倍于全球油气储量的热能。这种"永不关机"的清洁能源，随着钻探深度的增加而愈发炽热。**关键突破**在于利用石油行业百年积累的钻井技术——水平钻探和水力压裂（fracking），将这些技术从"钻油气"转向"钻热能"。

So most people don't know this, but there's a lot of heat deep in the Earth. And the deeper you drill, the hotter it gets. And this heat, this energy, it's always on, it's clean, and it actually holds 50,000 times more energy than all of the oil and gas reserves on the planet. So why am I still talking about oil and gas? It's because we're going to take the technologies that the oil and gas have developed over the last 100 years, at a cost of trillions of dollars, and we're going to start drilling for heat instead of hydrocarbons.

**技术迁移的革命性突破**  
石油行业通过技术创新实现了：  
- **水平钻探**：将钻头转向侧面，精准定位油气层  
- **水力压裂**：制造岩层裂缝释放油气  
这些技术被地热行业"即插即用"：在5公里深地层中，以披萨大小为目标反复钻探，精度达到厘米级。特别值得注意的是，地热压裂使用的液体压力仅为油气行业的1/3，且刻意避开自然断层，将地震风险降至可控范围。

So the oil and gas industry, with all of this turning and steering underground, was able to drill deeper, drill hotter and actually drill with some pinpoint precision. So, for example, imagine hitting a target the size of a pizza at a depth of five miles under the ground into the Earth, and being able to do this over and over again. The technology is pretty amazing. And so we are now going to use that technology for geothermal, but we're not going to have to learn over those 100 years, so we can apply it straight away.

**地热能的终极价值**  
在可再生能源赛道上，地热能展现出独特优势：  
1. **基荷电力**：24/7不间断供电，突破风电光伏的天气依赖  
2. **储能革命**：将间歇性电能转化为稳定输出，为数据中心（如Facebook、Instagram）提供"地球心跳"供电  
3. **人才迁徙**：全球7万支油气钻井队伍可直接转型地热开发

So you guys may ask, why do we even need geothermal? Because let's admit, wind and solar have done a great job greening the grid. Well geothermal can do what wind and solar can’t, and that is provide power 24 hours a day, seven days a week, regardless of what the weather is. You can also use geothermal as a giant battery to store extra energy from wind and solar, and to make those intermittent power resources baseload...

**2050年愿景**  
通过技术迭代使地热成本与风电光伏持平，石油行业人才将完成从"能源黑手"到"清洁能源先锋"的转型。到2050年，地热能有望满足全球80%的电力需求，并提供100%的家庭与商业供暖，彻底改变能源版图。

So the result -- by 2050, we can deliver almost 80 percent of the electricity demand that the world needs and over 100 percent of the heat for all homes, all businesses on the planet. (Applause) So energy solved, climate change solved, that better future that our kids deserve.
