### 播客开场与时代背景的共识

我们正在经历一个非同寻常的变革时代。

<p class="english-text">Number five throughout history is, man's inventiveness, particularly of new technologies. Okay. And here we are with AI. And all of those are connected. They're each related how what happens when they AI affects productivity, affects who gets the money or what happens in job political. You have to spend money to have a military and the conflicts. And then there are trade wars. And it all transpires pretty much in the same way over those 500 years. You can see these cycles in that pattern.</p>
</details>

欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是乔·魏森塔尔（Joe Weisenthal），和我一起的是特蕾西·阿洛韦（Tracy Alloway）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.</p>
</details>

特蕾西，我们做这个播客已经十年了，你知道，我们一直在努力与那些伟大的思想家交谈，对吧？那些对世界如何变化有一点点见解的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Tracy, since we've been doing the podcast for ten years, you know, trying to talk to some of the big thinkers, right? Some of the people who have a little bit of a perspective on how the world changed.</p>
</details>

我们谈论世界在十年内发生了怎样的变化，但世界如何变化以及未来十年或五十年会怎样，这有点武断，是那些思考宏大命题的思想家们在思考的事情，他们稍微拉远了视角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say how the world's changed in ten years, but it's a little bit arbitrary how the world's changed and maybe what the next ten years or 50 years are going to be like, thinkers thinking big thoughts, zooming out a little bit.</p>
</details>

我认为现在每个人都在这样做，你知道，这恰逢我们庆祝周年纪念或生日，但我觉得这就在空气中弥漫着，每个人都在努力应对眼前清晰可见的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think everyone sort of is these days. I mean, it happens to be that we're sort of celebrating our anniversary or birthday or whatever it is, but it's just I think it's just in the air, you know, like everyone, I guess people are always trying to think big, but there's something in the air right now where everyone is trying to grapple with pretty evident change that is afoot.</p>
</details>

特蕾西，市场上的大新闻是人工智能（AI）。AI不仅仅是一个关于金融和市场的故事，它触及了许多方面，它是一个文化、社会和政治的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, here's the thing. The big story in markets is, I sure. Right. And whether or not it's in a bubble and AI is a story that is not just about finance and markets. It's a story that, like, touches multiple things. It's a cultural, social and political story.</p>
</details>

所以人们谈论AI将如何改变世界，将改变艺术、音乐、电影。对吧？对一些人来说，他们会失业，对另一些人来说，他们会变得富有。人们以一种关乎国家和公司的生存方式来谈论它。如果你在AI竞赛中失败了，那么你将真正死亡，或者成为永久的底层阶级，或者人们说的其他情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have people talking literally about how AI is going to change the world. It's going to change art. It's going to change music, movies, people as well. Right? So for some people are going to lose their jobs, some people are going to get rich. People talk about it in this existential way, both for countries and companies, to your point.</p>
</details>

而且我认为，即使我们没有在2022年底开始的这次繁荣，即使没有AI的爆发，也会有所有其他关于技术竞争的重大问题，因为我们已经在讨论这些了，尤其是在中美之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you don't win in the AI race, then you are literally dead or part of the permanent underclass or whatever people say. And then I think beyond AI, even if we didn't have this boom that really started in late 2022, even if that weren't going on, there'd be all these other big questions related to technological competition, because we already talking about that, particularly. Yeah, we were China.</p>
</details>

还会有关于债务规模的担忧，还会有关于人口结构以及人口结构变化将对现有劳动力造成的压力的担忧。所以，是的，所有这些大局问题都在发生。然后将AI问题叠加进去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There would be all the concerns about the size of the debt. There'd be all the concerns about demographics and so forth, and the perhaps strain that changes in demographics are going to put on the existing labor force. So, yes, you have all of these things going on. Big picture questions. Then layer into the AI question.</p>
</details>

我只是觉得现在我们所有人都沉浸在对未来不确定性或对选举和民主的公正性的担忧中。我们正处于一个分岔路口，不知道将走向哪个方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I just feel like people right now is we all feel like we're consumed by these like sort of forward uncertainty or questions about the integrity of elections and democracy and all of these things. This sort of the, the we're at this clearing of the woods where we don't know which direction we're going to go.</p>
</details>

谁非常擅长综合分析世界正在发生的重大力量？我们确实有最合适的嘉宾，很多人都向他求教，他显然在宏观和短期周期方面都有着惊人的发言记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, who's very good at synthesizing major forces going on in the world? Well, we do indeed have the perfect guest, someone who many people turn to and who obviously has an incredible track record of talking about things both in the big picture and shorter cycles.</p>
</details>

我们将与瑞·达利欧（Ray Dalio）交谈，他是**桥水基金**（Bridgewater: 全球最大的对冲基金之一）的创始人。他管理了50年，这简直令人难以置信。我们已经做了十年播客，而他管理世界上最大的对冲基金长达50年，这是一个数量级上更令人印象深刻的成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are going to be speaking with Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater. He ran it for 50 years. That's kind of unbelievable. You know we've seen many market cycles. We're proud of ten years of doing a podcast, 50 years of running. What became the world's biggest hedge fund is an orders of magnitude more impressive accomplishment.</p>
</details>

瑞，非常高兴你能来演播室和我们交谈，非常高兴你能再次抽出时间做客《Odd Lots》。感谢你的到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Ray thrilled that you're in here in studio with us, thrilled that you're taking the time to chat with us once again. Appreciate you. Coming back on Odd Lots. Thank you.</p>
</details>

谢谢你。恭喜你们创办这个节目十年了。我想想这十年世界发生了多大的变化。你想谈宏观吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Congratulations on ten years ago. Starting this thing, I think of how, the world has changed in those ten years. And you want to talk macro? Listen, I think you're you've heard you've heard a thing or two about it.</p>
</details>

是的，我是全球宏观（Global Macro）领域的。AI只是其中的一小部分，与整个全球宏观问题相比，它很小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I am global macro. Global macro. And I is just a part of that. Yeah. It's a small thing in relationship to the whole global macro issue.</p>
</details>

我们都在为我们播客的十年感到自豪，而管理一家对冲基金50年，这听起来甚至不真实，我知道这听起来很疯狂，但……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's, how do you I mean, like, I know we'll get into all this thing, but again, like, it feels like something we're patting ourselves on the back on ten years podcast, 50 years of running a hedge fund. Like I say it, it doesn't even seem real that that could even be possible. I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but.</p>
</details>

你有什么关于长寿的建议吗？因为我们希望十年后还能做这个节目，也许四十年后就没人问我们了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you what? Oh it's fantastic. Yeah. You know, I do you have any tips on longevity because we're like, well, we want to be doing this again in ten years. Or maybe again, no one's asking us about in 40 years.</p>
</details>

有意义的工作和有意义的人际关系。换句话说，你是否热爱它，想把它做到最好，并且是共同的热爱？你是否与你在乎的人一起做这件事，并拥有有意义的关系？如果你拥有这些，你就拥有不断进化的能量，我认为这就是关键所在，对我而言是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meaningful work and meaningful relationships. In other words, do you have is it your passion to make it as great as it can be and a shared passion? And are you doing it with people that you care about and you have meaningful relationships? And if you've got that, you know, you've got the energy to keep evolving and you know, that's what it's about. I think that's, for me, what it's about.</p>
</details>

### 宏观视角：历史演变的五大力量

您如何描述当前这个时刻，不仅是市场，而且是您所说的全球宏观层面？根据您的经验和职业生涯，它与前几十年相比如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you characterize this moment, not just in markets but in global macro, as you point out, in terms of your experience, your career, how does it stack up to previous decades?</p>
</details>

这是长期演变的一部分，我想带你们快速浏览一下这个演变中的宏观视角，如果可以的话，我想从一个改变我的小故事开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's part of and it's part of a long term evolution that, I'd like to take you through a brief macro perspective of that evolution, and I'd like to start, if I could, with a little story of what would change me.</p>
</details>

我12岁时赚了一点钱，把钱投进了股市，因为当时每个人都在谈论股市。我为他们做球童时，他们会告诉我关于股市的事情。我买了一家公司，那是我唯一听说过每股价格低于5美元的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. When I was 12, I, in I earned a little bit of money, and I put my money in the stock market because everybody was in the stock market at the time. And the people I caddied for would tell me about the stock market and, the I bought a company and is the only company I ever heard of that was selling for less than $5 a share.</p>
</details>

你只是随便选的？对，因为它是低于5美元的唯一一家我听说过的公司。我想如果我能买更多股份，那么如果股价上涨，我就会赚更多的钱。这就是我的逻辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you just choose it? Right? It was. It was the only company that was less than $5 a share that I heard of. And I figured if I could buy more shares. So if I went up, I'd make more money. That was my logic. Okay.</p>
</details>

今天市场上有很多人，我还会继续说下去，但我认为很多人都有类似的逻辑，尤其是在加密货币等其他领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, there are many people today in the market and I would keep going. But the silly is the number of people out there who I believe, like, have come to think similar logic, particularly in other areas like crypto.</p>
</details>

我继续做我的事。我显然是愚蠢的。但发生的事情是，那家公司快要破产了，另一家公司收购了它，当它价值翻三倍时，我以为我很聪明，这是一场轻松的游戏，我沉迷于这场游戏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, I keep going, keep going about what I was doing. I was obviously stuck, stupid. But what happened was it was a company that was about to go broke. Another company acquired it, and when it, tripled in value, I thought I was smart. And this is an easy game, and I got hooked on the game. Okay.</p>
</details>

快进到1971年，我大学毕业，在去读研究生院的夏天，在纽约证券交易所的交易大厅做书记员。8月15日，尼克松总统在电视上说，你不能兑换黄金了。当时黄金是货币，而你持有的是贬值的纸币。所以，你说你不能兑换黄金了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fast forward. I graduated college, and, 1971, clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange before I went to graduate school in the summer. August 15th, 1971. President Nixon gets on the television and says, you're not going to get the gold. Gold was money then, and you had paper money, and it depreciated in value. So, so you're not going to get the gold.</p>
</details>

第二天早上我走进证券交易所，我想，这场巨大的危机意味着我们所知的货币正在终结，我们将遇到大麻烦。结果股市上涨的幅度超过了几十年来的涨幅，而我却不知道什么是“贬值”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I walked on the floor of the stock exchange the next morning, and I thought, this big crisis money as we know it is ending, we're going to have a problem. And it went up more than it gone up in decades, and I didn't. That's because I didn't know what a devaluation was.</p>
</details>

所以我研究了历史，发现完全相同的事情发生在1933年3月，罗斯福总统通过无线电做了完全相同的举动，因为那时他们没有足够的实物货币，黄金才是实物货币，他们没有足够的黄金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I studied history and I found the exact same thing happened in March of 1933, with Roosevelt getting on the radio and making the exact same move because they didn't have enough real money back then. It was gold, was real money. They didn't have it.</p>
</details>

这让我第一次意识到，我需要理解在我生命之前发生的事情，而不仅仅是我的亲身经历。所以我研究了30年代，正因为研究了30年代，我才能预见到2008年的金融危机，因为它是一次不断重演的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that led me to realize for the first time that I needed to understand things that happened before my lifetime, not just my experiences. So I studied the 30s, and because I studied the 30s, I was able to anticipate the 2008 financial crisis because it was the thing that was playing over and over again.</p>
</details>

现在也存在这些问题。好的，我们来谈谈这些。大约六七年前，我研究了过去500年的历史，研究了储备货币和帝国的兴衰。我说，过去500年。这让我得出了五大核心力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there are those things that are going on now. Okay, we'll get into those. Yeah. But there let me study history. And so about 6 or 7 years ago, I studied the last 500 years of history to studying what causes the rise and decline of reserve currencies in the empires. And I said, the last 500 years.</p>
</details>

让我们听听这五大力量。它们都有其内在的机制和动态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that brings me to the five big forces. Let's hear them. Okay. The five big forces are and they each have a mechanics to them, a dynamic.</p>
</details>

第一是货币、债务、市场和经济的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is how money, debt, markets and economics works. Okay. And we'll get into that.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，这里有一个大的周期，我们称之为**货币秩序**（Monetary Order: 规范货币和债务的体系）。总有一种货币秩序会形成并最终崩溃，它属于一个与债务和货币限制相关的周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second, by the way, there's a big cycle. There is and we can call it a monetary order. And there's a monetary order that always happens and breaks down. And it's part of an arc that has to do with limitations on debt and money.</p>
</details>

这就像一个杠杆周期，对吧？你能承担多少债务？你的货币应该具有什么样的价值？**财富**（Wealth: 资产的总和）是财富的储存手段，而我们的货币是什么？这是我们今天必须面对的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we'll get into that like a leveraged cycle. Right. How much debt can you take on? And what is the value of money? Money supposed to have? A store hold of wealth is data store hold of wealth. And what is our money? That's a question that we have to deal with today. Right?</p>
</details>

什么是你可以作为有效的财富储存手段的货币？我们是否处于债务周期的末端？这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is that money that you can be an effective store, hold oil. Okay. And are we at the end of our debt cycle? Okay. That's number one.</p>
</details>

第二点与货币以及谁拥有货币和财富差异等有关。周期的一部分是，资本主义为发明创造了巨大的机会，使其具有生产力等等，它提高了生活水平和财富。但它以不平等的方式提高了财富。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two related to this money and who has money and wealth differences and so on. A part of the cycle is that capitalism creates great opportunities for inventiveness to be productive and so on. And it raises living standards and it raises wealth. But it raises wealth in an unequal way.</p>
</details>

自然而然地产生了巨大的财富差异，这些财富和价值观的差异会发展到出现不可调和的分歧。所以纵观历史，有左派和右派，有富人和穷人，有自由派和保守派。纵观历史，他们之间会发生冲突，尤其是在出现经济问题时。这就是第二种力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there are big wealth differences that naturally come as a part of the cycle. And those wealth and and values differences get to a point where there are irreconcilable differences. So throughout history, there's the left and there's the right, there's the rich and there's the poor, and there are those who are liberals and those who are conservatives. And throughout history they have a conflict, particularly if you have an economic problem. So that's the second force, right?</p>
</details>

第三种力量是不断变化的世界秩序，即国际地缘政治秩序。它也有一个周期。你上次看到它是在1945年，战争结束。战争决定了谁拥有权力。掌权者决定了新的世界秩序是怎样的。然后，新兴大国挑战现有大国，然后世界秩序的动态就会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third force is the changing world order, the international geopolitical order. And that has a cycle to it, to you started and last time you saw it, 1945, the end of the war. That war determines who has power. The powerful determine what the new world order is like.</p>
</details>

世界秩序总是在变化，货币秩序在变化，国内政治秩序在变化，世界秩序也在变化。这就是第三个弧线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you have the rising power challenging the existing power, and then you change the dynamic of the world order. The world order always changes. The monetary order changes, the domestic political order changes, the world order changes. And there is that arc.</p>
</details>

第四种力量是自然事件。纵观历史，干旱、洪水和流行病造成的死亡人数以及推翻的政权，比我提到的前三种力量还要多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number fourth force is acts of nature. Throughout history, droughts, floods and pandemics have killed more people and toppled more orders than the first three that I mentioned.</p>
</details>

第五种力量是人类的发明创造，特别是新技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And number five throughout history is, man's inventiveness, particularly of new technologies. Okay.</p>
</details>

现在我们有了AI，所有这些都是相互关联的。它们都与AI如何影响生产力、影响谁能获得资金，或对地缘政治产生什么影响有关。你必须花钱来维持军队和冲突。然后还有贸易战。在过去500年里，这一切几乎都以同样的方式发生。你可以在这种模式中看到这些周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here we are with AI and all of those are connected. They're each relate how what happens when they AI affects productivity, affects who gets the money or what happens in geopolitical. You have to spend money to have a military and the conflicts. And then there are trade wars. And it all transpires pretty much in the same way over those 500 years. You can see these cycles in that pattern.</p>
</details>

### 确认变革的真实性与机制分析

听起来确实令人难以置信，让人思考：这不仅仅是我们的想象，我们正处于一个变革非凡的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is pretty incredible listening to this and thinking, you know what? It's not just our imagination. We are in a time of extraordinary change.</p>
</details>

我们经历了一场全球大流行病，以不同方式扰乱了地球上每个人的生活，至少在某种程度上是这样。我们确实拥有这项令人难以置信的技术——AI，每个人都在努力理解它。我们从大约十年前就开始讨论与中国的严重贸易紧张关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had a global pandemic that disrupted life for everyone on Earth in varying ways, at least to some extent. We do have this unbelievable technology that everyone is trying to wrap their heads around with AI. We did have even starting, you know, arguably ten years ago, the emergence of serious trade tensions with China.</p>
</details>

我们确实看到了他们的军事力量明显变得更强大。你看，所有这些迹象都表明，我们不是在产生幻觉，最近确实发生了一些大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do see the emergence of their military clearly getting much more strong, like, you know, you see all these things like, it's not we're I guess we're not hallucinating. Some big stuff is going on these days.</p>
</details>

是的，我想关注的是事情发生的机制，债务周期在哪里、财富差距在哪里，这些与地缘政治有何关联。对我来说，这就像一遍又一遍地看电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, yes. And the thing that I would like to, focus on is the mechanics of how that happens. The inter relationships between where are we in the debt cycle? Where are we in wealth? Well, we'll talk about these things and where what does that mean? Geopolitical and so on. And if it's for me, it's like watching the movie over and over again.</p>
</details>

存在关联性，存在一种大的周期动态，这样我们就可以后退一步。我认为每个人都关注当天的突发新闻，而没有后退一步去看清大的发展轨迹和因果关系。所以，我希望我们能深入探讨这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is connections and there's a cyclicality to this, a big cycle dynamic so that we can step back. I think everybody looks at the news item of the day, and they don't step back and see the big arc and the cause and effect relationship. So that's why I'm hoping we can get into that. Okay.</p>
</details>

好的，我来试着在当日新闻和宏大轨迹之间找到联系。当你看到AI这样的事物时，它如何融入你的五大力量框架？请为我们画出线条。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well let me try to thread the needle between the news item of the day and the big arc. But when you look at something like I, how does that fit into your five forces framework? Draw the lines for us.</p>
</details>

首先，它对经济方面有巨大的影响，对吧？在我看来，这非常非常像历史上所有出现伟大发明和巨大变革的时期，比如20年代，20年代末。所以生产力变革是巨大的，也许是有史以来最大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, first of all, it has tremendous effect on the economics of it, right? It looks to me very, very similar to all the times in history, that there was great inventions and great changes such as the 20s, the late 20s. So a real productive it's hard to change and maybe the greatest ever.</p>
</details>

让我们想象一下20年代。想象一下，我们需要一个时间扭曲的音轨，回到过去。第一次是电力进入家庭，你可以拥有洗衣机和冰箱。第一次是汽车。第一次是飞机。第一次是你可以去看的电影。第一次是收音机。你的家里以前是安静的。第一次是电视的发明等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But let's imagine the 20s. Okay. So imagine let me take you into the 2030s. Imagine we need to get like a time warp soundtrack back in time. But first time electricity is going into houses, and you can have washing machines and and refrigerators. First time we have the car. Okay. First time that we have airplanes. First time we have movies that you can go at ten. First time you have radio. You used to have silence in your house and so on. The the first invention of television and so on.</p>
</details>

你能想象吗？那些变革更加直接和令人兴奋。你看到了这些事物中的革命。因此，财富是如何创造的，财富的差异是什么，泡沫如何产生以及泡沫如何破灭，都有其内在的机制。换句话说，要区分这一点。顺便说一句，许多泡沫都是如此。我可以回顾历史并给你很多例子，但这（AI带来的变革）将是一个很好的例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you imagine it was the much more, immediate and exciting, you see the revolutions in those things. And so there's a mechanic to a mechanism of which how does wealth get created and what's the difference of wealth? And how does a bubble come and how does a bubble go, in other words, to distinguish it. And that's, by the way, many of those bubbles. So you I can go back in history and give you many examples, but that would be a good example.</p>
</details>

是什么推动它上涨？财富和金钱有什么区别？所以你进入了机制层面。财富不是金钱，对吧？这一点对我们现在非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what makes it go up and what is the difference between wealth and money. So you get into the mechanics. Wealth is not money okay. And so and this becomes very relevant to, to us now.</p>
</details>

换句话说，财富是什么？创造财富很容易。因为你所做的，你所拥有的……好吧，让我举个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words what the wealth is, it's easy to create wealth. It's because what you do, what you somebody what what you guys go on. What? Okay, but let me give you an example.</p>
</details>

你有一个很棒的想法，你想创造一个独角兽公司，你卖出5000万美元的股票，然后你给它估值10亿美元。对吧？现在你是个亿万富翁了，这家公司价值10亿美元。但发生的是，你实际上……它真的值这个价吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay. You come up with a great idea. You want to create a unicorn, you sell $50 million of the stock, and you value it $1 billion. Yeah. Okay, now you're a billionaire, and now that company is worth $1 billion. But what happens is you actually is it is it really worth it?</p>
</details>

我想每个孩子或青少年在某个时候都有过这个想法：我要创办一家公司，然后特蕾西，我要卖给她价值一美元的股票，然后突然间，哦，我成亿万富翁了。我认为每个人在某个阶段都有过这种想法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think every child or teenager is at some point had this idea right. I'm going to start a company. And then Tracy, I was I'm going to sell her a dollar's worth of share. But it's just this for and suddenly, oh, I'm a billionaire. Like itself is being created suddenly like I think every everyone has this scheme at some point in their life. Okay.</p>
</details>

但需要认识到的是，财富不同于金钱。你不能直接花费财富，你必须出售财富才能获得金钱去购买东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the thing to realize is wealth is different from money, okay? Wealth. You can't you can't spend wealth. You have to sell wealth in order to get money to go buy things. Okay.</p>
</details>

泡沫是如何发生的？泡沫发生的方式是，你产生了对金钱的需求，然后财富上涨，然后出现了出售它的需求。例如，假设我们实施了财富税。会发生什么？那些人需要出售一部分股票，才能获得现金来支付税款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so how did the bubbles happen? Okay. The bubbles happen in the way that you create these needs for money. And then the wealth rises and then there's a need to sell it. For example, let's imagine that we put in wealth taxes. Okay okay. What's going to happen. Those are going to need to sell some of that stock to be able to get up the cash to be able to pay taxes. Right.</p>
</details>

无论出于何种原因，对现金的需求出现，你想将财富转换为金钱，然后动态开始反向运作。我所谈论的只是机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whether for whatever reason the need for cash happens and you want to make a conversion from wealth to money to be able to come up with the money and in all the bubbles, it's work this way. There's not enough cash and there's the desire for that cash, and then you sell it and the dynamic begins to work in reverse. So that's all I'm talking about is mechanics. Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以，当你问我这个问题时，我审视今天，看起来又是一个这样的时刻：谁拥有财富？然后，脆弱性在哪里？这是真实的财富还是账面财富？人们犯的错误是认为，它是否会随着时间的推移产生收入来证明其估值是合理的？这并不能制造泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you asked me the question and I look at today to today, it looks like another one of those okay, who's got the wealth. And then where is the vulnerability that can is this real wealth or is it accounting wealth. And then and it's people make the mistake of thinking, will it, produce an income over its time in order to justify that valuation? That's not what make bubbles okay.</p>
</details>

因为这个问题的答案在1928年到1931年之间没有改变。不是说他们找到了答案，然后说，好吧，那没关系。这是财富和金钱之间的动态关系。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Because the answer to that question did not change between 1928 and 1931. It's not like they found out the answer. And then they say, okay, that's okay. It's this dynamic between wealth and money. Okay.</p>
</details>

所以，事情的发生有其机制，对吧？如果你理解了这些，而且这可以追溯到很久以前，如果你追溯到《旧约》中的禧年（Year of Jubilee: 圣经中规定的债务豁免和财产归还的年份），你如何处理债务？你必须偿还债务，因为债务是对金钱的需求。我必须用金钱来偿还我的债务。所以理解这些机制很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a mechanics to the way this happens, right? And if you understand those and it goes back a long time, if you go back to the Old Testament, the year of Jubilee okay. How do you deal with debt. And you have to pay back the debt because debt is a need for money. I have to deliver money on my debt. So it's important to understand those mechanics.</p>
</details>

### 债务、政治极化与世界秩序的重塑

所以，我们来谈一个机械性的问题。你提到了财富税的想法。当人们描述2025年的经济状况时，经常听到的一点是，很多人都依赖于财富，人们谈论K型复苏，谈论高收入或高财富人群如何推动消费等。然后我们看到这些巨大的义务，无论是国债还是照顾老年人的义务等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So actually, let's get into a mechanical question for you that and you mentioned the idea of a wealth tax. One of the things that you hear a lot when people characterize the economy today of 2025, is that a lot of it is riding on people as well as people talk about, you know, the k-shaped recovery. They talk about how people in the higher income or wealth quintiles are really driving consumption, etc..</p>
</details>

这是否意味着，在某个时刻，也许我们不称之为财富税，但政治实体感到有必要去追逐所谓的“纸面财富”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then we look at these large obligations that we have, whether national debt or just the obligations to care for seniors, etc.. Is this sort of where it comes together that at some point maybe we don't call it a wealth tax, etc., but where the political entity feels compelled to go after the, quote, wealth, the wealth that exists on paper. Yes.</p>
</details>

是的，这在历史上一次又一次地发生，基本上是出于同样的原因。看看30年代，就是因为需要钱。所以，关注正在发生的事情。有小部分人（占人口的1%到10%）过得极其顺利。而底层60%的人在生产和效率方面遇到了困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's happened over and over and over again for basically the same reasons. Okay. If you look at the 30s, for example, or it's the same, you need the money. Okay. So just watch what's happening. Right? There's a small group between 1 and 10% of the population that, this is going unbelievably great for.</p>
</details>

60%的美国人阅读水平低于六年级。前10%的人拥有大约90%的股票。底层60%的人只拥有大约5%的股票。所以我们看到了这种财富差异。那么，钱从哪里来呢？过去获取资金的方式是借贷。债务相对于GDP或收入持续上升，然后结束，然后你就可以花钱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And then there's the bottom 60%. The bottom 60% are having problems being productive and being effective. 60% of Americans have below a sixth grade reading level. Okay. The stock ownership of the top 10%, they own about 90% of the stocks. The bottom 60% own about 5% of the stocks. So we're seeing this wealth and, and so who are you going to get the money from?</p>
</details>

但由于一些机制上的原因，我们快要无法再这样做了，这些机制值得我们理解。当一个人的资产是另一个人的资产时，如果你持有大量债券，大量政府债券，这算是一个好的财富储存方式吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The way you used to get the money was that you would borrow the money. You would the debt would continue to rise relative to the GDP or relative to your incomes. And it would end and then you'd spend. Well, we're close to not being able to have that happen for mechanical reasons that are worth understanding, because I and I'll get into that in a minute. But, well, I'll get into it now. When one man sets are another man's assets, and if you're holding a lot of bonds, a lot of government bonds, you're, that's a lot of, debt is that a good store hold of wealth?</p>
</details>

然后，当你面临正在发生的地缘政治问题和冲突时，那些持有这些债券的外国所有者（他们持有大约三分之一的债券）可能不想再持有这些债券了，因为他们认为这可能不是一个好的财富储存方式，要么是因为它正在贬值，要么是因为他们可能面临制裁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when you have the political or geopolitical problems that are going on conflicts, then the foreign ownership owners of those who owned about a third of the bonds, may not want to hold those bonds because they think it may not be a good store old wealth, either, because it's being depreciated or because they may have sanctions.</p>
</details>

如果你回顾30年代之前，总是有经济战，包括金融战，其中实体会被切断制裁——我们现在称之为制裁。所以存在这种动态，这不仅是美国的动态，也是英国、法国、中国的动态。我们正处于一个阶段，即无法再像以前那样通过出售越来越多的债券来维持现状。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you go back like into the 30s before, there's always the economic war, including the financial war in which, entities are cut off sanctions. We call them now. Okay. So there is this dynamic in which and it's not just an American dynamic, it's a UK dynamic. It's a, France dynamic. It's a Chinese dynamic in which we're at a point where it's not easy to keep doing it the way we were doing it, by selling more and more of those bonds in that way.</p>
</details>

所以，我们来看：第一，你不能像以前那样借贷了。第二，你不能征税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so then we'll look at look at it. You can't borrow like it used to. Number two, you can't tax.</p>
</details>

在政治上，我曾去华盛顿与两党领导人交谈。他们的回答是，你知道，我说我们必须将预算削减到GDP的3%。你可以通过削减一点这个、一点那个来实现，你可以做到。但发生的情况是，我得到的回答——在英国、法国、世界各地都是一样的——是：你必须明白，我必须做出一个或两个承诺，或者两者都做：我不会提高你的税收，我也不会削减你的福利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Politics okay. And so the answer I get is and it's the same in the UK, it's the same in France, same or all around the world. You have to understand that I can't I have to make one of two pledges or both. I will not raise your taxes and I will not cut your benefits. Okay.</p>
</details>

所以，你不能借贷了，能借的已经不多了。你不能继续维持现状。你不能提高税收。你不能削减开支。所以我们就在这里。这与十年前的情况不同。世界因这五种力量而变得非常不同。看起来确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now you can't borrow. It's not that much you can't borrow. Yeah. You can't keep it up as it was. You can't raise the taxes. Politics okay. You can't cut the spending okay. So there we are. It's different from where you were ten years ago when you okay. The world is very different from. I was thinking about your 10th year anniversary. Okay. 2015. Yeah. Okay.</p>
</details>

所以想想世界因这五种力量而发生了多大的变化。这正是它的样子，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So think about how different the world is as a function of these five forces. Right. That's what it looks like, right. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

我们能具体谈谈美国的背景吗？因为你提到了华盛顿。但感觉美国在十年间变化尤其大：不平等加剧，赤字创历史新高，而且政府似乎正在重新定义美国在世界上的地位。这如何融入你的五大力量框架？我应该也提一下“贬值交易”（Debasement Trade: 因债务或制裁担忧而抛售本国货币的交易），因为这是今年早些时候的一个主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So can we talk about this in a U.S context specifically since you brought up DC. But it feels like the U.S especially has changed in ten years. So rising inequality the deficit is higher than ever. And we also have an administration which seems to be redefining America's place in the world. How does that fit into, again, your five forces framework. And I guess I should bring up the debasement trade as well, because this was a big theme earlier in the year of the.</p>
</details>

是的，是的。那种人们不想要美元的想法，因为他们不确定债务会发生什么，或者因为他们担心制裁和货币限制。这都是一样的，对吧？它们都相互关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, yeah. The, the idea that, you know, people don't want to be in the dollar because they don't know what's going to happen with the debt or because they're worried about sanctions and limits on currencies. It's all the same, isn't it. And it's all interrelated. Right?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这都是可以理解的，对吧？你遇到了财务限制，你存在巨大的财富差距，你达到了一个点，你不想再谈判了。选民们受够了听这些借口。他们需要民粹主义。所以民粹主义由此而生，有左翼民粹主义也有右翼民粹主义。所以两极分化加剧，他们说：“我不想妥协我的事情，我要求兑现。”所以“为我赢”，我的价值观，我的行事方式。因此，你看到了不可调和的分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, okay, and it's all understandable, right? It's all you have a financial limitation. You have large wealth gaps. You reach the point, that, you don't want to negotiate. You're sick and tired. The electorate is sick and tired of hearing these excuses. They want populism. So populism arises from this. And populism of the left and populism of the right. So they greater polarity and they say, I don't want to compromise my things. I want it delivered. So win for me, okay. Win for me, my values, my way of operating.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你回顾历史，出现的人具有相同的特质。哦，你产生了民粹主义者，因为这种情况。而世界正在改变。我们无法维持以前的做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And therefore you have irreconcilable differences. And so if you look at history, the people who arise are of the same character. Oh, you have you produce populists because of that, that sort of circumstances while the world is changing. Okay. So what is the place in the world?</p>
</details>

我们不能维持我们以前的做法。想想美国和中国之间的关系，举个例子。中国将以具有成本效益的方式销售其廉价商品。美国购买它们，把钱寄给中国，中国人把钱投入债券。这种动态关系不能再存在了。首先，他们不信任对方。每个人都很担心。美国会担心：我不能依赖中国的进口。中国人会担心：我能拿到我的钱吗？如果研究历史，也许因为冲突，我会遇到麻烦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can't sustain what we were doing before. Think of the relationship, let's say, between the United States and China by way of example. Okay. The dynamic of, Chinese will sell, inexpensive, their goods cost effectively. Americans buy it, send them the money, the Chinese take the money and they put it into bonds. That dynamic can't exist anymore. First of all, they don't trust each other. Everybody's worried.</p>
</details>

你失去了中产阶级，因为他们是制造业者，你把制造业转移到了中国，所以你没有了制造业。你说我们必须把制造业带回来。我们需要自给自足。所以，自给自足意味着你不能再维持那种动态了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, the United States will worry. Can. I can't be dependent on imports from China. The Chinese worry that I can't be dependent, that you're going to give me my. I'm. I'm a predator. Am I going to get my money? If you study history, maybe because of conflict, I can be, a problem. You lose the middle class because they are the manufacturers you've shipped manufacturing to China, and so you don't have the man. And you say we have to bring back manufacturing. We need self-sufficiency. Okay.</p>
</details>

然后，当出现挑战时——不是军事战争，而是贸易战、技术战、地缘政治影响力战——你不能回到二战后所设想的那种多边世界秩序。美国说，我们要有一个多边世界秩序，我们要有联合国，我们要投票，我们要有世界银行，我们要有所有这些世界组织，世界贸易组织等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now self-sufficiency means you cannot continue that dynamic anymore, right? And then what do you do when there's the challenge the the wars that are not the military wars, the trade war, the technology war, the geopolitical influence war. It's not like you can go to what was imagined in the post-World War Two period that the United States said, we're going to have a multilateral world order. We're going to have a United Nations, and we're going to go vote, and we're going to have, a world Bank, and we're going to have an all these world organ, a world Trade Organization, and so on.</p>

那种想法太天真了。我们已经超越了那个阶段。所以我们从多边世界秩序转变为单边世界秩序，权力才是关键，对吧？这就是正在发生的事情。

<p class="english-text">Well, that's that's naive. We're past that. So we switch from a, you know, a multicloud or a world order to a unilateral world order where power matters, right? That's what's going on. Right.</p>

我可以问你一个私人问题吗？不算太私密，但在三月份的播客中我们听你说到美国的债务规模等等，当时正值大规模减税谈判前夕。白宫显然想推动减税。正如你提到的，你去了华盛顿，你认为可以通过一些方式将预算赤字控制在GDP的3%以内。这不是一项无法克服的任务。但现在，在支出或赤字轨迹上似乎没有任何有意义的改变。

Not that personal, but we heard you on the podcast in March, and you were talking about the scale of the U.S debt and so forth, and it was, you know, this was on the eve of when the big tax cut negotiations were happening. It was clear that the White House wanted to push a tax cut. And as you mentioned, you went to DC and, you know, you were fine. There are ways to get the budget deficit within 3% of GDP.

冥想可以说是我取得任何成功的**最重要原因**（The single most important reason: 冥想带来的心境平和是成功的基础）。它给了我一种平静（Equanimity: 沉着、镇静的心态），让我能够后退一步，看到历史的轨迹，接受生命有周期。我已经76岁了，我知道自己处于哪个阶段。

</details>

这种能力，能够让潜意识和智力头脑在感受情绪的同时，能够俯视现实是如何运作的，即使是那些我们不希望为真的事情。就像牙仙或圣诞老人。我们希望它们存在，但我们可以接受它们不存在的事实，不带先入之见，只是学习。这就是现实，以及如何应对现实。冥想在这方面帮了我很多。我认为这是正确的方法。

<p class="english-text">People, you know, there's all sorts of things that we all go through and so on to the ability to step back a line, the subliminal, that subconscious mind which has an effect, and the intellectual mind to be able to do that while still feeling the emotions, but being able to, look down on how does reality work and almost, even things we don't wish were true. You know, it's like, the tooth fairy or Santa Claus. Okay, we wish that we exist, but we can accept the fact that they don't exist, don't have our preconception, and just learn. Here's reality and how to deal with reality. Meditation has helped me a lot to do that. But I think that's the right approach.</p>

好的，如果你冥想并认识到历史的轨迹，你如何利用这些信息？尤其是在交易或投资方面。因为我认为，当我们进行这些对话时，我们谈论“债务不断增加”和“政治两极分化”，似乎这些问题没有多少解决方案，我们对这种认识能做的不多。

And it just seems like there there aren't many solutions to those problems, and there's not much we can do with that recognition.</p>

你可以通过首先理解它的机制来处理。这就是我写这些书的原因。《如何使国家破产》（How Countries Go Broke）这本书就是关于它的机制。你可以将其视为指标，进行计算，并将其与正在发生的事情对齐，这样你就知道自己处于什么位置，知道如何储存你的钱。

我认为我们希望成为的那个世界是一种习惯。我认为，如果我们从小就被教导要情感化地看待“什么是真实的”，那么现实是很有趣的，现实在某种意义上是美丽的。如果你认识到这一点并这样思考，进化和万物发生，它们可能不……就像，如果你能接受这一点，并认为这是进化的一部分，那就比说“死亡是坏的”或“这个东西是坏的”要好得多。当我们带着“这个东西是坏的”的态度去处理时，问题就出在这个东西本身，而不是“这个系统是如何运作的？我们如何应对这个系统以获得最佳结果？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think the world that we want to be part of it is a habit. So mean. I mean I think that if we're, if we're taught the emotional like What is real. Yeah. Reality is interesting. Reality is beautiful in a sense. If you take evolution and things die and and things happen, they may not. It's like if you recognize that and you think that way and it's all part of that evolution and you and you can get that in your mindset, that's so much better than being able than saying, I don't know, dying is bad.</p>
</details>

我们可以应对这个系统。例如，今天的机制很大程度上与人们如何相互对待有关，对吧？换句话说，如果我们能集体解决这些问题，并将集体福祉置于首位，我们的战争就会少得多，解决问题的能力也会强得多，而不是陷入意识形态的争斗，认为我必须为我的观点而战。

<p class="english-text">Because we could deal with the system. For example, the mechanics today has a lot to do with, how people deal with each other, right? In other words, if we were collectively being able to solve these problems and, and put the collective well-being ahead, we would have a lot less wars. We'd have a lot better solving of problems, not the ideological.</p>
</details>

这是一种可以采取的方法，即你无法控制世界，但你可以控制自己的反应，并且你可以影响世界。世界各国领导人，如果他们试图说，什么是共同利益，我们如何通过机制来解决它，这样就有人要让步，有人也要让步，但这会产生比战争更好的结果。国家领导人可以做到这一点，个人也可以做到，就他们将如何与他人相处而言。

<p class="english-text">And I have to fight for that kind of thing. So it's an approach that approach could be taken on and toward. This is the idea that you can't control the world, but you can control your reactions and you can influence the world. People together, world leaders, if they were to try to say, what is the common good and how do we work it out mechanistically so that, okay, somebody is going to give here and somebody is going to give there and then we but that'll produce a better outcome than if we go to war or, you know, there's there are better approaches that leaders of countries. Yes, there's leaders of countries can do this. And also individuals can do this in terms of what they're going to be with others.</p>

### 政治参与与个人应对机制

你有没有考虑过从政或参与政策制定？这不是一个太私人的问题，但我们在三月份听你说到美国的债务问题时，你提到过，你认为可以通过一些方式来控制赤字。但现在似乎没有实质性的改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you ever considered going into politics or policy? Is that something that. Not since I see more. Because you know what? I think it's I have great admiration, great appreciation for the people who take on that life that, we have a challenge in terms of even how the system works, because there are so many people right now who, have opinions, want to fight for those opinions, and they determine the votes.</p>
</details>

因为你知道，我对那些承担这种生活的人怀有极大的钦佩和赞赏。我们在系统运作方式上遇到了挑战，因为现在有太多人有观点，想为自己的观点而战，他们决定了选票，然后他们造就了那些正在行动的人，这不是一个有效的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then then they create people who are acting out and all of these things, you know, it's, it's not an effective I do think, though, it's very difficult to be successful.</p>
</details>

但我确实担心，我经常遇到年轻、聪明、有思想的人，当你问他们是否考虑过当选公职时，他们的回答立刻就是“不”。这有点令人不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think, though, I am worried how often young encounter intelligent people, thoughtful people, etc. and when you ask them if they ever consider elected office immediately, the answer is no. Like it's it's actually a little bit disturbing.</p>
</details>

任何理智的人都会说“我绝对不会去竞选公职”，因为看看周围的环境，环境很糟糕。但然后你会想，这对最终当选的领导人有什么样的筛选作用呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is disturbing how quickly basically anyone sane would have that it anyone who's sane was a. Of course I would never go into elected office or never pursue elected office because you look around, the environment's miserable, but then you think, well, what kind of filter does that have on the actual leaders that we end up do get?</p>
</details>

这是现实。但你认为这个筛选机制如何？你想获得优质的领导力等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a reality. It is a reality as well. But no, I know, I know, but like, what do you think about that filter? And you think about, okay, you want quality leadership etc.?</p>
</details>

看看那些看起来正常的人，他们立刻说“当然，我永远不会去竞选公职”。让我们分析一下，看看这与十年前或二十年前有何不同，以及人们现在的情况。我们应该做的第一件事是，除了说“这很糟糕”之外，我们应该看看为什么会这样？这有道理吗？是的，我们可以回答这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, look, think about anyone who seems like normally say and immediately says, of course I would never go into elected, right? So let's just look at that for a minute and take it through the perspective that I'm, trying to convey. We look at that and how it's different from 10 or 20 years ago and how the people are.</p>
</details>

然后说，好吧，我们该怎么做？也许你正在以自己的方式为好的事物做出贡献，但你必须务实，如果你想在那里产生影响，你必须影响那些掌握权力杠杆的人。他们才能影响事情，而不是我们在这里闲聊。选民也许会，但你能做些什么来帮助实现这一点？或者你需要为自己做些什么才能做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So maybe you're contributing into good things in your way and try you know, but you have to be practical if you're going to have an effect there. You have to have an effect on the people who have their hands on the levers of power. They affect things. Not us chatting away. Yeah. Okay.</p>
</details>

你必须对因果关系保持分析性和机械性。因为这回到了机制问题。如果你理解了因果关系，比如政治如何运作，人口如何运作，你就可以保持分析性，而且因为原因发生在结果之前，如果你知道因果关系并能想象出结果，你就能领先一步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the voters may be, but what can you do to help to bring about it? Or what do you need to do yourself in order to do that? So you have to be analytical and and, mechanical about what the cause effect relationships because it comes back to the mechanics cause effect relationship. If you understand the cause effect relationships, like how politics works, how the populations work, you can be analytical in doing that, but also the causes you can get ahead of the game because the causes happen before the effects.</p>
</details>

在你漫长的职业生涯经验中，有没有什么事情与历史上的先前例子或周期不符？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there anything in your, you know, very long career experience that didn't match up with previous examples or cycles in history all the time?</p>
</details>

是的。比如1971年，我当时有一个先入之见。我走进交易所大厅，然后我意识到，哇，好吧，现在我去研究30年代，然后学到了一些东西，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I mean, in 1971, in other words, I had a preconception. I walk on the floor of the stock exchange and, and I realized, wow, okay, now I go to the 30s and I learn something, right.</p>
</details>

关于桥水基金呢？我能得到的任何兴趣点。但我学到的是，我在生活中取得的任何成功，更多是因为我懂得如何处理我不知道的事情，而不是因为我所知道的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about a Bridgewater? I mean, any interest I can get. But what I've learned is that whatever success in life I've had is also more because I know how to deal with what I don't know than anything. I know. Okay.</p>
</details>

我学到了这一点：我知道一些事情，但我对未来不知道的事情仍然非常多。所以我学会了如何分散风险。我学会了通过金融工程，通过分散投资，将我的回报风险比率提高了五倍。通过保持回报不变而分散投资，可以降低风险而不降低回报。这是机制。但这源于我知道我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I learned that, okay, I know some things, but what I don't know about what the future is and so on still very large. So I learned how to, diversify. I learned how through financial engineering in terms of controlling, I could through diversification, improve my return to risk ratio by a factor of five. But by keeping the return the same and diversifying, well, that will reduce the risk without reducing the returns. That's mechanics.</p>
</details>

所以，当你以这种分析性的方式看待这些事情，并将它们视为一个谜题时，就会有很多谜题需要你去解。但如果你能冷静、分析性地处理，你就可以设计出你应对它的机制。这就是我所说的应对现实的原则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that came from my knowing that. I don't know that I can't be sure. Okay. So when you're analytical that way and you view these things as a puzzle, then there are all these puzzles and you have to solve the puzzles. But if you can do it calmly and analytically and so on, you can engineer the mechanics or how you're dealing with it. That's what I mean by principles for dealing with reality.</p>
</details>

### 桥水的文化：激进的真实性与理念精英统治

关于桥水，有没有出现过与历史周期不符的时刻？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what about it? Bridgewater was there ever and like times that yes it all the time. The moment all the time.</p>
</details>

我一直都知道我想要什么。这是优势。如果你创办一家公司，你可以塑造它，塑造它的文化应该是什么样的。用一句话来说，我想要有意义的工作和有意义的关系，通过**激进的真实性**（Radical Truthfulness: 坦诚相待，不隐瞒任何建设性批评）和**激进的透明度**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know I knew what I wanted. Okay. That that was that's an advantage. If you start a company you can make it what you want, what the culture should be. And, you know, in one sentence, I wanted meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truthfulness and radical transparency.</p>
</details>

我坚信，如果你能拥有有意义的工作，也就是说你投入到使命中，并且你与参与这项使命的人有着很棒的关系——也许是你们两个，关于《Odd Lots》。如果你在执行这项使命，并且关系很好，那是非常美妙的。但你也需要有激进的真实性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So I really believe that if you can have meaningful work, in other words, something you're in to the mission and you have great, relationships with people who are in that mission. Maybe it's you two, with, lots. Okay. I don't know what it is, but if you're on that mission and you have a great relationship and so on, that's magical. But you also need to have radical truthfulness.</p>
</details>

换句话说，如果你认为某人做得不好，反之亦然，而特蕾西看起来……你们俩组成了一个团队，我们实际上是伙伴。不，我不是针对你。不，不，不，我只是想说，我们是相当诚实的人。

</details>

让我把问题回答完。我追求那种真实性等等。所以，存在权衡。不是每个人都喜欢那样。人们厌恶审视自己的错误，厌恶审视自己的弱点。你如何克服这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me finish answering the question. Okay? Because I haven't gotten to the challenges, okay, I want that. I believe in that truthfulness and so on. So then, there are trade offs. Not everybody likes that. Okay? Not everybody. You know, there's an aversion to looking at mistakes.</p>
</details>

换句话说，我必须面对这些问题并处理它们。这就是我写第一本书《生活与工作原则》（Principles of Life and Work）的原因。当我们认识到了解自己的弱点是一件伟大的事情，是一种巨大的力量时，我们如何客观地认识到自己的长处和短处呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's, an aversion to looking at weaknesses. How do you get over that. Where in other words. And so I, I, I have to face these questions and deal with it. That's what led to my first book, Principles of Life and Work.</p>
</details>

我在网上创建了一个性格测试，对听众来说是免费的。你可以去[Principles.com](http://Principles.com)了解你的天性以及你如何处理事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in other words, when we recognize that knowing our weaknesses is a great thing, it's a great power. So how do you objectively get to the notion of knowing your strengths and weaknesses? And I created personality profile Test there, for your listeners, go to it's a free test. Principles. You you can go online and learn about your nature and what your nature is and how you deal with things.</p>
</details>

这就是不断地面对现实、你的目标和你的愿望。然后你意识到你会遇到障碍，然后你将这些障碍视为必须解决的谜题，才能达到目标，因为你有选择。如果你做出更好的选择，你就会得到更好的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's the constant encountering reality, what your goals are and what your aspirations are. And so I encountered that. I thought that's your question and I encounter that. And then you realize you encounter obstacles and then you view those obstacles as puzzles as you that you have to solve in order to get there, because you have choices.</p>
</details>

我举这个例子，认识到这对某些人来说不是最好的环境，而其他人不可能在其他任何地方工作，因为他们得不到有意义的工作和友谊，或者公司内部的政治斗争。这些人，他们中的许多人无法在其他地方工作，因为他们得不到那种真实性和那种精神。所以，是的，这是不断地通过与现实互动，然后解决谜题并发展原则来发现这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you make better choices, you get better outcomes. So that, I'm giving that as an example. So recognizing that it's not the best place for some people and that other people couldn't possibly work anywhere else because they can't get the meaningful work and bring fellowship or the truthfulness, you know, the truthfulness, the political politics that goes on in companies and so on.</p>
</details>

你谈到公司文化时，这在过去十年变得非常流行，也许更早一些。人们喜欢谈论企业文化。“这个地方有好的企业文化”，“那个地方有坏的企业文化”。硅谷的企业文化是什么？大银行的企业文化是什么？你显然在思考“企业文化”这个词上非常超前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these people, a lot of them can't work anywhere else because they can't get that truthfulness and that that spirit. So yes, it's constantly finding these things out through discovering of interacting with reality and then solving puzzles and developing principles. So it occurs to me when you're talking about this like it's become very popular, maybe in the last ten years, but probably a little bit longer. People love to talk about corporate culture.</p>
</details>

有一个词，就像，你到底想做什么？你们想如何彼此相处？在任何关系中，我们都不必使用“企业文化”这个词。如果你有婚姻，如果你有友谊，如果你有伙伴关系，你都必须面对“你们想如何相处”这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the corporate culture of Silicon Valley? What is the corporate culture of the big banks, etc.? I mean, you clearly were very one thing you're clearly very ahead of the curve is just thinking about this term corporate culture. You know, there's a term and it's just like, what do you want to do? How do you want to behave with each other? I mean, we don't have to even use the word corporate culture in any relationship.</p>
</details>

那么，如何塑造文化呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you have a marriage, if you have friendships, if you have partnerships, it's you have to face the question of how do you want to be with each other? Yeah. Well, how do you actually shape the culture then?</p>
</details>

有两种方式。我知道我认为最好的方式是什么，但我并不确定。然后我进行问答。我认为我有自己的想法，**理念精英统治**（Idea Meritocracy: 允许任何人辩论任何事情的体系）。这与价值观不同，不同的人可以过着不同的生活方式，有不同的自由选择。但我确实知道我认为最好的和我想要的是什么，然后我愿意公开辩论：这是对的吗？这是最好的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know what I believe is best and whatever, but I'm not actually sure. And then I go through the question and answer. I believe I do have an idea. Meritocracy. That's a different from values, different people could live their lifestyles, different kinds of lifestyles, freedom of choice to operate that way.</p>
</details>

因为如果你有一个理念精英统治的体系，任何人都可以辩论任何事情，你知道，桥水的任何人在任何时候都可以就任何事情挑战我。我有义务让每个人都听到我为什么认为这是最好的，而不是其他方式，然后让人们做出决定或启发我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I kind of know what I believe is best and what I want, and then I and then I have, openness to, debate. Is that right? Is that the best?

</details>

从实际层面来说，在一个鼓励透明和批评的环境中，即使是针对高级人员或初级人员，你如何处理欺凌和暴民心理的陷阱？因为我认为这与政治、社交媒体等息息相关。你如何防止开放的环境演变成暴民心理？

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I felt the obligation for everybody to hear that exchange of why I think this is best and not, and then let people make decisions or enlighten me when it comes to that trade off, because otherwise they wouldn't be invested with you, you know, to take it on a practical level, how do you deal with, in an environment in which people are encouraged to be transparent and to be critical, even, senior people or junior people?</p>
</details>

我告诉你我是怎么做的，而且要接受任何事情都不是最完美的。首先，你描绘出应该是什么样的图景。你知道，没有人的观点是客观的，那是你的观点，你的观点可能不同，要突出这一点。

And and just also accept the fact that any of these things, you're not of the most perfect. Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.</p>
</details>

如果你去看TED演讲，我有一个TED演讲展示了我们如何创建了一个叫做**点数收集器**（Dot Collector: 一种在会议中收集匿名想法和反应的工具）的工具，我们在开会时，每个人都把自己的想法输入进去。

I created a tool called the Dot collector, which everybody has put as we're having meetings, putting their thoughts in.</p>
</details>

然后就到了**可信度加权决策**（Believability Weighted Decision Making: 根据发言者过往记录来判断其意见权重的方法）。你如何判断谁是更好的决策者？每个人的优势和劣势是什么，以便他们能发挥自己的作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reactions so we feel free to give your thoughts, bring it up including critical thoughts or not. Then you get to what I call believability weighted decision making. How do you get about whether this person is a better decision maker? What the strengths and weaknesses of the person of each person is so that they can play their role?</p>
</details>

如果你设定了这样的愿景，你会找到实现它的方法。比如，你如何选择医生？你是不是找一个有空位的？差不多就是这样。但你找三个聪明人，最好的两个，寻求第二意见，以确保万无一失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if you draw, if you set that out as your aspiration, you'll find ways of doing that. Like there may be tests, there may be, you know, how do you pick your doctor? You know, you have you met one who has an appointment open? Yeah, that's pretty much it. Know.</p>
</details>

在挑选人时也是一样。你希望人们知道这对他们和组织都有好处，这个过程是公平的，而不是一个人做出裁决。当你回顾案例，发现某个情况再次发生时，你会问：“你觉得怎么样？”一旦你认为这个系统是公平的，你只是想弄清楚真相以及人们的优缺点，你就向那个目标迈出了巨大的飞跃，这与大多数公司不同，大多数公司对此避而不谈，或者在幕后操作。

<details>

And then you have to let people know that that's good for them and it's good for the organization that it's fair okay, that the process is fair.</p>
</details>

我有一个规定：如果你背后批评某人三次或更多次，你就出局。但你总是可以提出来并解决它，因为让我们解决它，让我们弄清楚问题是什么，并以那种方式解决它。所以对于欺凌，他们可以告诉那个欺凌者：“你为什么那样做？”

Once you have the notion that the system is fair and you're just trying to get at what's true and what are people strengths and weaknesses and so on, you're making great leaps toward that, as distinct from most companies in which they don't talk about that.</p>
</details>

So on the bullying, they can tell the bully, okay, you can tell the book why? Why did you do that? Why is that that way?</p>

### 多策略模式与长期主义

那么，你对多策略（Multi-strat）模式和对冲基金的看法如何？你所描述的每个人都在相互交流和挑战的文化，与那种似乎更依赖于小团队各自为政的多策略模式截然不同。

Well, so now I have to ask, what do you think about multi strats and the pot shops?</p>
</details>

有不同的方式来玩这场游戏，这是一种完全有效的方式。也许这只是一种完全功利主义的方式。它是否能有效地做出投资决策？可能非常有效，原因有很多。我可以深入探讨不相关的回报流、多种操作等等。那可能非常有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the culture that you're laying out where everyone is sort of talking to each other and challenging each other seems very, very different to the multi strat model. That seems to be much more predicated on, you know, little teams that are sort of off and doing their own thing. There's different ways to play the game. That's a totally valid way to play the game. And maybe, maybe the it's just a totally utility way.</p>
</details>

它可能无法有效地建立有意义的关系，以及那些类型的东西。因此，你将失去连续性，以及在竞争性商业问题中产生的凝聚力。换句话说，人们会追求更多的金钱，他们不是在一起的，他们没有分享生活，没有共同分享使命。

<p class="english-text">In that way. There is is it effective in making the investment decision can be very effective for lots of reasons. I can digress into uncorrelated return streams, many operations, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. That could be very effective. And, it may not be effective of creating, the meaningful relationships and those types of things.</p>
</details>

所以，也许对于投资管理来说，这是一种完全可以接受的方式，但对于建立一个50年的组织来说，它不是一个好的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, you're going to have the continuity and a competitive business problem. In other words, people will go for, you know, which is what we've seen a little bit of that, have a little bit more money, a little bit more of they're not in it together. They're not sharing their lives. They're not sharing their mission together. Yeah. And so on.</p>
</details>

这引发了一个问题：在这种环境中，**特许经营价值**（Franchise Value: 组织长期持续产生超额回报的能力）是什么？因为似乎有一种模式产生了非凡的回报，但你确实会遇到每个人都像雇佣兵一样，每个人都被丰厚的薪水和奖金所诱惑的情况。很难想象那种环境能建立起一个50年的特许经营权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So maybe it's a totally fine way for the investment management, but it's not a fine way for building a 50 year old.

What seems to be there's there's model which has produced extraordinary returns for some investors.</p>
</details>

我认为它不会持久，尤其是在这个时代。我将努力帮助实现这一点，我希望能够实现独立投资管理的能力。就像优步（Uber）一样。优步有一种技术，将个体接入其中，每个人都可以做到。从某种意义上说，我认为我们将更多地朝着这个方向发展。

我在建立我自己的能力，我想分享人们可以做某些事情的方式。但你不认为这个模式——因为它很热门——会持久吗？十年前我们没有谈论多策略，更多谈论的是基金中的基金。你听起来对这个模式能否持久持怀疑态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you said you're going to try to help it. What does that mean? Are you working on something? Well, I might I'm building my own ability, and I want to share how, people can do certain things. That's it. But you don't think this model this because it's been very hot. Again, talk about things that have changed ten years, ten years ago we were not talked about multi strand talk about fund to fund the fund of funds. Much more back then you're a little it sounds that you're skeptical that this model will endure much will endure.</p>
</details>

在每一个方面，我只是从机制上看。什么能产生凝聚力？你必须有凝聚力的需求，对吧？什么是凝聚力？什么是承诺？我认为当我们互相帮助时，我相信人们可以互相帮助。他们是在互相帮助吗？他们能变得更好吗？这就是问题所在，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think in every. But I'm just looking at mechanism. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Talk about okay. So what creates cohesiveness. You have to have the need for cohesiveness okay. What is the cohesiveness. What is the commitment okay I think when we help each other I believe in how people can help each other. Okay. Are they helping each other?</p>
</details>

所以当我们考虑多策略时，如果每个人都在那里，并且你把它们组合起来，这可以通过技术非常容易地完成，对吧？所以是什么让它粘合在一起？关系是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can they be better? And that's the question isn't it. Okay. So when we're thinking multi stripe if everybody's there and you put it together as that, that could be done technologically very easily. Right. So the going to stick it together. Okay.</p>
</details>

为了共同的使命，拥有关系等等，这不仅在效率上——因为不同的人有不同的技能，你们一起完成工作——而且在心理上也很有回报。这是幸福的最大来源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the relationship like. Okay. To be on the mission together and to have relationships and so on is invaluable not only in terms of effectiveness in terms of doing job because different people have different skills and you do that together, but it is also psychologically rewarding. The greatest source of happiness. Okay.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一件重要的事情。世界各地的幸福研究表明，收入超过一定水平后，并不能带来更高的幸福感。一旦你解决了基本需求，幸福的最大来源就是社区。我是否有社区感？有人支持我，我可以帮助他们，我为之努力。这是一个强大的力量，而且非常有益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is this is, I think, an important thing. Studies of happiness all around the world and so on shows that, income past a certain level does not bring a higher level of happiness once you get the basics taking care of that. The greatest source of happiness is community. Yeah. Do I have a sense of community?</p>
</details>

我还有一个问题。既然我们现在回顾过去，在某种程度上有些怀旧，你认为如果你今天开始创业，你能在当前的环境下创建出一个桥水这样的公司吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. It was it. My thoughts? I have one more question. Since we're being very retrospective here and nostalgic in some ways, do you think if you were setting out today, do you think you would have been able to create a Bridgewater in the current environment?</p>
</details>

是的。我认为每个人都可以做到，而创业是最明确的体现，它是最大的力量。金钱不是最大的力量。金钱会追逐那些有才能、能成就新事物的人，这就是投资者所做的。我们试图找到那些将创造奇妙新事物的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. How would you I think I think and I think that, everybody can and that entrepreneurship is, is so clearly an example that it is the greatest power. Money is not the greatest power.</p>
</details>

所以，个人的才能去吸引金钱，吸引成功所必需的资源。是的，我们可以做到。现在的问题是，你是否是那些有想法、能把事情整合起来、能为支持者争取到所需资源并不断成长的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Money will seek out the people, the entrepreneur, the person who has the talent get have enabled people, and that money will go to them to make them. That's that's what investors do. We try to find those people are going to make these new things wonderful things happen. So the talent of an individual to attract money, to attract the resources that are necessary for success.</p>
</details>

是的，我相信我们正处于一个非常非常好的时期。你需要的资源与我过去的方式不同。我过去的方式是，我从小就喜欢玩市场，喜欢市场。然后有一天我向某人推销我的想法，我做了我的事情。然后世界银行给了我500万美元的账户，因为我们只是在谈论市场，他们给了我500万美元，这开启了我机构资产管理业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, then we can do that. Now the question is how are you? Okay. Are you the next one of those who's got the ideas and can put that together and make the case for your supports that I need this, this and the other thing and grow and become better? Yes, I believe that we're in a period of time that that's very, very good.</p>
</details>

然后下一个给我账户，然后我建立业绩记录，然后我建立我需要的各种东西。现在，如果你在运营一个机构，可能会很昂贵，因为你需要合规部门，你必须处理监管问题。你有很多这样的事情，但你可以找到出路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You need different resources than you did. You know, the way I did it is I play I was a kid, I played the markets, I like the markets. Then I'm one day I make a pitch to somebody, you know, I did my thing. And then the World Bank gave me a $5 million account. And, okay, world Bank gives me a $5 million account because we were just talking about markets, and they gave me a $5 million account, and that's started me in the institutional asset management business.</p>

瑞·达利欧，桥水创始人。非常感谢你再次做客播客。

<p class="english-text">Then the next one gives me the account, then I get to build a track record, then I get to build the things I need. I mean, right now, if you're running an operation, it can be expensive because you need compliance department. You have to deal with the regulatory things. You have a lot of those things, but you can find your way. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater. Thank you so much for coming back on the podcast.</p>
</details>

很高兴回来。再次恭喜你们十周年，继续保持！非常感谢。我们期待我们的50周年纪念。那才是真正的里程碑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So good to be back. And congratulations again for your ten years. Keep it up. Thank you so much. We'll, looking forward to our 50th year. That'll be it.</p>
</details>

### 播客结束语与反思

天哪，让我们看看我们能否做到这一点。总之，这太棒了。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh man. Let's see if we can pull that off. Anyway, that was fantastic. Thank you so much. Thank you.</p>
</details>

特蕾西，50年太疯狂了，在任何领域，媒体领域，这确实是疯狂的。但当我听到他说他管理了50年，我感觉这几乎超出了我的理解范围，一个对冲基金能存活这么久，保持如此惊人的业绩记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, 50 years is insane. I mean, that's insane. Like, in any field media, it actually is it. But when I like when I said that was the end, when he said he rents that almost seems too hard to wrap my head around that you could run something for 50 a a hedge fund, that it could survive that long, like this incredible track record.</p>
</details>

是的，他说他76岁了。是的，我刚开始时非常非常年轻。我不知道。我现在心情很奇怪，既内省又回顾过去，思考未来。但我确实认为，他开创了很多东西，比如文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, he said he was 76 years old, so. Yeah. No, I just started it very, very young. Yeah, I don't know. I'm kind of in. I'm in a strange mood now, and I like introspective and retrospective and thinking about the future, but I do think, you know, it is true.</p>
</details>

我们经常听到关于桥水非常特殊、独特的文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He pioneered a lot of stuff like culture. Yeah. And we hear a lot of stuff about Bridgewater's very, special culture and distinct culture.</p>
</details>

我想说几句，作为一个中年男人，你对世界的看法开始改变，你会想：客观来说，是不是一切都变得有点疯狂了？还是只是我的人生阶段变了？我失去了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Culture? Yeah. You know, I'll say a couple of things is just that, you know, I feel like as a as a middle aged man, you know, you start to like, change your view on the world and you're like, wait, does everything seem a little crazy objectively, or is it just my state in life? And what am I losing?</p>
</details>

不，我认为这很重要。我实际上希望答案是：我脱节了，一切都很好，我只是老了，跟不上时代了。所以我不知道这让我感到安慰还是不舒服，但事实是，正在发生一些非常重大的事情，所有这些重大的历史力量，我们有很多力量同时汇聚在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, no, I think it's important. And I actually would like the answer in some way to be that I'm losing touch, like, oh, everything is totally fine. I'm just sort of like aging sort of out of touch these days. And so I don't know whether I find it reassuring or not that no, like, these are really big things that are going on.</p>
</details>

确实有大事发生。但我认为有一件令人安慰的事情，这也是为什么在变革时期人们倾向于阅读历史的原因。因为你感到非常不安，非常没有安全感。所以你回顾历史，开始看到瑞提到的这些模式，然后你会想，哦，也许一切都会好起来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all of these things, these big historical forces, we've got a bunch of them all sort of converging at once. Will they are big things going on. But I think one comforting thing, and this is why I think people tend to read history in times of change. Sure.</p>
</details>

但你也可以读到某些历史书，然后想：“哦，天哪，事情会变得很糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because you feel very unsettled. You feel very insecure. And so you look back at history, you start seeing these patterns to raise point, and then you're like, oh, okay, maybe things will be all right. But also you can read certain history books and think, oh God, things are going to be terrible.</p>
</details>

我知道，这都取决于那本书，取决于时间范围。瑞还提到了遗产方面的事情，我确实将桥水与教导很多人关于如何通过杠杆加分散投资来实现巨大回报的特定方式联系起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, I know it's it's all about the book, I suppose, about the time frame. I mean, the other thing and Ray mentioned is in terms of legacy, I do associate, Bridgewater specifically with, teaching a lot of people about the sort of specific ways that you can achieve great returns through leverage plus diversification.</p>
</details>

这就像是他们带来的魔力：我们将分散投资，而通常人们将分散投资与“我能睡个好觉，但要牺牲回报”联系起来，那也没关系。但这个想法是，也许你可以通过杠杆实现两者兼得。当然，它效果非常好，结果也说明了一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right, which is sort of like the magic that, that they brought to it, which is we're going to diversify. And you typically associate diversification with, I'm going to sleep better at night, but I'm a sacrifice return and that's fine. But this idea is like, well, maybe you can like sort of, you know, achieve both through leverage. And of course it worked, really well. And yeah, the results speak for themselves.</p>
</details>

关于关系是粘合剂的评论也很有趣，这种个人间的友谊是把整个事情维系在一起的胶水。我想，如果你和那个世界里的人交谈，钱可能很棒，但听起来那不是一份特别令人满足的生活，因为每个人都知道自己处于短期控制之下，没有真正的团队，感觉非常功利主义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also interesting. Here's a comment about I'm glad you asked this question. Sure. Because that was very interesting. Well this idea that relationships are like personal camaraderie is the glue that sort of holds the whole thing together. I think if you talk to people in that, in that world, yeah, like the money can be great, obviously, but I never, ever sounds like a particularly satisfying life.</p>
</details>

所以当你离开时，人们总是在离开。所以思考一下很有趣，虽然没有发生真正的爆炸或崩溃，但确实发生了一些内部瓦解（Implosions），你确实会想，权力平衡或者这种模式的可持续性如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of, you know, everyone is aware that they're on a short leash, etc., there's not really much of a team, etc., it seems very mercenary and so forth. So when you are leaving, people leave all the time. Yeah.</p>
</details>

我们有一段时间没有做多策略的专题了，所以这是一个很好的提醒，我们应该重新审视它，因为已经出现了一些发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it is interesting to think, you know, there have been some implosions that really blow ups per se, but implosions and it does sort, you do sort of wonder whether the balance of power or whether the how sustainable this model is. It's been a while since we've done a multi strand episode, so it's a good reminder we should revisit it because there have been some developments.</p>
