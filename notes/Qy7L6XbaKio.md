### 访谈开场与背景

**Nicolai Tangen**: 大家好，我是**挪威主权财富基金**的 CEO **Nicolai Tangen**。今天我与**里德·霍夫曼**（**Reid Hoffman**）在一起。他是**领英**（**LinkedIn**）的联合创始人、**Greylock** 的合伙人、**微软**（**Microsoft**）的董事会成员，也是硅谷最有影响力的思想家之一。今天我们将探讨正在发生的一切：**人工智能**（**AI**）、人类潜能，以及里德一直在忙碌的所有事情。里德，很高兴你能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Hi everyone, I'm Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and I'm here today with Reed Hoffman who is the co-founder of LinkedIn, partner at Greylock, board member at Microsoft and one of Silicon Valley's most influential thinkers. And today we are basically going to talk about everything that's going on, AI, human potential, all the things you've been up to, Reed. So wonderful to have you here.

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 很高兴来到这里。现代世界最奇妙的事情之一就是，我身在西雅图，你身在奥斯陆，而我们可以进行一场如此顺畅的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: It's great to be here. And you know one of these awesome things about the modern world is you know here I am in Seattle there you are in Oslo and we can have a fully robust conversation.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 简直不可思议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Unbelievable.

</details>

### AI 浪潮与历史周期

**Nicolai Tangen**: 里德，你见证了从 **Web 1.0** 到当前 AI 热潮的多个技术周期。与你之前所见相比，这次浪潮处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Absolutely now Reid you've seen multiple tech cycles from Web 1.0 to the current AI boom. Just how does it stack up compared to what you've seen before?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 每一个新的技术周期——即使你回顾历史，将印刷机等视为早期版本——都是令人印象深刻的，且都建立在旧事物之上。当前的 AI 浪潮之所以呈现出巨大的加速，比以往任何事物都更快、规模更大、影响更深，是因为它建立在**互联网**、**云计算**、海量数据以及庞大的**算力**基础之上。这使得构建这些神奇的**学习机器**成为可能。

我认为这显然是规模最大的一次。在所有重大事物中，就像在你的行业里，人们会讨论这是否是一个**泡沫**。我不认为它是泡沫，至少不是通常讨论中那种会导致崩溃的泡沫。它对整个社会的影响可能是我们有生之年见过的最大的。我认为这具有里程碑意义，因为我们已经将学习机器作为人类世界和社会基石的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, look, each new tech cycle and even if you do a bit of history and you kind of go back to printing press and other kinds of things as as early versions of this is new and impressive and builds upon the old and part of the current, you know, AI just, you know, massive acceleration, much bigger than much quicker, much larger, more impact than anything else is because it builds on the internet, it builds on the cloud, it builds on, you know, kind of the massive amount of data we have and the massive amount of compute we have which then makes it possible to build these amazing learning machines and so I think it's obviously the largest now in all large things you know you know like in your industry there's discussion of you know is it is it a bubble I don't think it is if anything like I don't think it's a bubble in the usual discussion of you know could it get to a collapse but the impact upon all of society is probably going to be the biggest of our lifetimes. And that's presuming that, you know, you and I have at least a number of decades ahead of us. And I think that's stunning because in industry and in life and in society, I think the fact that we've now made like learning machines as part of our firmament of the humanist world, the society is is landmark.

### 初创公司与大企业

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你从两方面观察这一趋势：你既是微软董事会成员（代表现有的巨头），又投资于一些更具颠覆性的新公司。这如何塑造你的思维方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now you see this from both sides given that you're on the Microsoft board which is like you know the incumbent and then you also invest in some of the new you know more disruptive companies. How does that shape your way of thinking?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 人们经常问：这会更多地惠及初创公司还是大公司？答案是两者都会极大地受益。在当前的 AI 革命中，支持初创公司和大公司都很重要，它们在工业和社会中都扮演着实质性的角色。

例如，如果没有**前沿模型**公司的支持，初创公司无法完成前沿模型所做的事情。**OpenAI** 只有在微软提供算力支持的情况下才能达到今天的地位。**Anthropic** 等公司也是如此，它们需要**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscalers）的支持。另一方面，初创公司的风险承担和创新能力将推动很多发展。

有一种常见的说法是企业部署 AI 的效果并不理想，但这是否意味着 AI 被过度炒作了？答案是否定的。如果你看看小型初创公司部署 AI 的方式，那简直是奇迹。少数员工就能实现极高的移动速度，从团队会议到生产力的各个方面都得到了赋能。大公司需要在未来几年迅速适应，否则就有可能在汽车工业兴起时沦为“马车公司”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, the frequent way that people put this kind of conversation is it going to more benefit startups more benefit large companies? and the answer is massively all and which one more I don't know but I think it's important on the AI revolution that we're doing that we support both startups and large companies both of them have a substantive role in their contribution to industry and society so for example startups can't be doing the kind of things that the frontier models are doing without at least the support of the frontier model companies. So you know like for example OpenAI could only got to its position because Microsoft supported it with compute and you know similarly that's what's happening with Anthropic and others is it requires these the hyperscalers and the massive cloud companies not only in the work they're doing themselves but in the work they're doing to support the startups on the other hand the kind of risk and innovation in the startups is the thing that will drive a lot. So like example there's another relatively common meme that is well enterprises are trying to deploy it and they're not deploying it that well does that mean that it's overhyped and the answer is well if you look at small startups and the way they're deploying AI it's magical I mean the speed at which you can move with a smaller number with an initial number of employees the way that you're you can empower all aspects from team meetings to productivity and all the rest is already like massively in motion. And it's just a question of well, those companies will grow and then the large companies will need to either adapt to that probably with some speed in the next few years or run the risk of being, you know, kind of horse and buggy companies once the automobile industry starts going.

</details>

### AI 的实质性应用

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你目前在哪里看到了最真实的巨大变革，而不仅仅是实验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Where are you seeing the most kind of genuine massive transformation now as opposed to experiments?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 我告诉人们，如果你没有发现当前的前沿模型在某些实质性方面对你的工作有用（而不仅仅是给孩子写首诗或拍张冰箱照片问菜谱），那么说明你努力得还不够。事实上，如果你在做重大的医疗决策时，你或你的医生没有使用 **ChatGPT**、**Copilot** 或 **Gemini** 来获取第二意见，那你就是在犯错。

我个人会使用严肃的 AI 来进行轻度或深度的研究。比如我正在写的新书《**超级机构**》（**Super Agency**），我会问 AI：“一位技术历史学家会对我正在做的事情提出什么样的严肃批评？”或者在我年初与 **Siddhartha Mukherjee** 共同创立的 AI 医疗公司 **Manis** 中，我们会研究不同治疗分子的属性、小分子药物的历史等，你可以得到非常深入的研究结果。

目前领先的采用领域是**编程**。工程师们理解这一点，是天然的采用者。编程中的**精准性**预示着法律、医疗等领域即将发生的事情。此外，我还投资并共同创立了 Manis，因为我想探索人们尚未思考的领域，比如**药物研发**。一家“AI 原生”的药物研发公司会是什么样子？我们将看到令人惊叹的魔法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, so the short one of the things I tell people is if you're not finding the current frontier models to be useful in some substantive way to do that like for example useful in your work not just you know create a sonnet for your kids birthday or you know take a picture of what's in your fridge and ask for what a recipe could be which are great but in some substantive way that involves information analysis research decision support etc then you're not trying hard enough and in fact you know one of the things that I think for the frontier models is if you're engaging in a substantive medical decision and you're not using you or your doctor are not using you know ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini etc for a second opinion then you're also making a mistake. I myself, probably use serious AI, not simple queries, but deep ones like if I'm working on a book like my book Super Agency, what would a historian of technology give me a serious critique in what I'm doing or if I'm thinking about kind of the different kinds of molecules for therapeutics in Manis AI company I co-founded at the beginning of the year with Siddhartha Mukherjee you know what are the different attributes of the different kind of therapeutic molecules. Now that being said, I'd say the probably leading adopters are a whole bunch of stuff in coding. Because coding gives you a precision in information work. That by the way is a kind of a foreshadowing drum to what's going to really happen in legal and medical and a bunch of other things. But part of the reason I invested in Manis was because it's like, well, but there's these other areas that people aren't thinking about yet like drug discovery. What is an AI native drug discovery company look like?

</details>

### 生产力与企业障碍

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你对我们尚未在生产力数据中看到增长感到惊讶吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Are you surprised that we are not seeing productivity gains yet we're not really seeing it in the productivity numbers?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 我还不感到惊讶。就像那句老话：“我到处都能看到计算机，唯独在统计数据中看不到。”在 **GDP** 层面，这是一种奇特的衡量方式。但在初创公司中，我确实看到了生产力的提升。

目前的情况是，公司还在摸索该怎么做。传统的实验方式是找几个人做个“概念验证”（PoC）。但我认为，在两年内（甚至现在），每个组织都应该记录所有会议，并运行 AI 来处理录音。不仅是为了转录，还要生成所有建议的后续行动。比如：“你提到了这件事，你应该告知 Nicolai 并确保落实”，或者“你需要获得 **Satya**（纳德拉）的批准”。这种技术已经存在，我已经在用了，但大多数公司还没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: I'm not surprised yet. I mean although you know of course what is that old line I see computers everywhere but not in the numbers. I definitely see it in all the startups and I think what's in part happening is companies figuring out what to do because most of the things like the classic way a company experiments with and builds technology is they go okay this group of you know three five 10 people are all going to go do a little proof of concept and we're going to see what comes of that. Well, AI can work in some of those areas, but you have to be selective of what the project is. So for example every organization should be saying we're recording all of our meetings and we're running an AI on the recording of the meeting not just for the transcript but also to do all of the suggested follow-ups. Like all of that kind of thing is already like the technology is there to go you should already be doing it I'm doing it and yet most companies aren't that.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你认为大组织有效整合 AI 的最大障碍是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What do you think are the biggest hurdles that you see for large organizations trying to integrate AI effectively?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 通常，大多数大组织出于理性的基础，会“风险优先”：先规避风险，再获取收益。这导致了一种心态：在风险降为零之前不引入任何东西。

对于 AI，人们会担心：如果有了会议记录，是否会增加法律责任？是否会导致信息泄露？这些**概率性机器**是否会误解某些内容并导致错误？这有点像说：“我要从奥斯陆开车到特隆赫姆，但在上路前我要消除每一个风险。”这行不通，你永远无法上路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, typically most large organizations for with a rational basis kind of start with a risk first. Avoid downside first, gain upside second. But that leads to a general like don't introduce anything until you've run all the risks to zero. And one of the things that with AI is it say well hey there's a bunch of unknown risks here like for example we're doing the meeting thing that I'm talking about. Well what happen if we have all these transcripts of meetings? Is that going to increase legal liability? Is that going to increase information bleed and flow? And you're like, well, that's a little bit like saying, you know, I'm going to drive from Oslo to Trondheim and I'm going to eliminate every risk before I get on the road. And you're like, yeah, it's not going to work. You'll never get on the road.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 我必须说，我对你的本地知识印象深刻。你真的开车去过那里吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: I have to say, I'm pretty impressed by your local knowledge here. Have you actually driven there?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 我没有。但我的一位挪威朋友已经跟我念叨了二十年要在峡湾航行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: I have not. A friend of mine is a Norwegian born and has been talking to me about sailing in the fjords for at least two decades.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 很有趣，因为这是我第一次看到**合规官**（Compliance Officers）有能力“杀死”公司的潜力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Very good. Now I do think it's interesting because it's the first time I've seen the potential for compliance officers to kill companies, you know.

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 没错。你需要判断这是否真的是风险，而不仅仅是“可能会有负面报道”。真正的策略应该是：部署、迭代、学习。

在硅谷和 Greylock，我们一直在记录会议，因为这能提供笔记、方便后续跟进，还能让 AI 进行即时研究。这与谷歌搜索完全不同。比如我对数据中心、能源生态系统和**绿色能源**的演变感兴趣，我可以设置 AI 进行深度研究，10 到 15 分钟就能得到非常好的初步答案。

前沿模型正在开发让算力持续运行数小时以获得结果的能力。例如，我的播客《**Possible**》发布了法语版，基本上就是让 AI 处理翻译和计算。这种让算力放大人类劳动的过程已经实现了。正如我最喜欢的科幻作家**威廉·吉布森**（**William Gibson**）所说：“**未来已来，只是分布不均。**”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: No, exactly. And it's one of the things where you got to go look is this really a risk because if it's not really a risk like deploy iterate and learn. Part of what we find in the venture community at in Silicon Valley and at Greylock is that we record these meetings all the times now because it gives us a set of notes. It gives us easy follow-ups. It gives us something that we can run through AI to say, \"Hey, can you do research on these questions.\" You can trade off call it minutes of compute to instant research, very different than what you get from a Google search. And by the way, part of what the frontier models are developing is they're developing the capability for this to work coherently in compute for hours to get to a result. For example, my podcast called Possible and we've released Possible in French because we basically had AI do all the translation and compute. So having compute be amplifying of our labor is like it's here now. One of my favorite science fiction authors William Gibson wrote Neurommancer and others. One of his quotes that I really like is the future is already here. It's just unevenly distributed.

### 硅谷、欧洲与全球竞争

**Nicolai Tangen**: 硅谷的这种主导地位是否受到威胁，例如受到移民政策的影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Do you think that dominance is under threat for for instance from immigration policies and so on?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 肯定会有影响。美国几十年来一直建立在作为全球最强移民超级大国的基础之上，硅谷就是这一点的缩影。硅谷有多少是由来自世界各地的移民建立的？包括西欧、东欧、印度、中国等。

此外，我们的全球工业能力源于良好的全球关系。但这一届政府在处理伙伴和贸易盟友关系时采取了“霸凌手段”，比如关税政策，这是极具破坏性的。

我也希望欧洲能更多地参与到技术博弈中。我曾对英国、法国、意大利的领导人说：直接进入 AI 领域非常重要。如果把 AI 比作美国和中国之间的世界杯足球赛，而欧洲试图扮演**裁判**，那就有两个问题：第一，裁判永远赢不了；第二，没人真正喜欢裁判。你必须亲自下场踢球。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, for sure. I mean, look, the US is a country for every decade built on being the best superpower for immigration in the entire world. And Silicon Valley is a microcosm of that. I mean how much of Silicon Valley is been built by immigrants from all over the world. So the immigration is one but the next of course is that part of our ability to have global industry is because we have very good global relationships. That has been most catastrophically damaged by this administration. The going out and saying, you know, give us your lunch money or we're going to tariff you as kind of a bully tactic is terrible ways to deal with partners. Now that being said, part of what I want Europe to do more of is to get more into the technology game. If you think of a AI as a football game World Cup match between the US and China and what Europe tries to be as the referee there's two problems. One is the referee never wins and two no one really likes the referee. So you got to get on the pitch, right?

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 里德，如果你有权力，你会具体怎么做来修复欧洲的 AI 现状？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So Reed, what would you do specifically? Hey Reed, can you fix Europe and AI? What do you do?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 这是一项艰巨的工作。首先，我会去与那些能构建大量算力的超大规模云服务商做交易。这些交易不一定需要钱，可以是提供能源、数据中心许可和建设能力。作为回报，我们要确保欧洲公司能够访问这些算力，用于构建新应用或进行推理部署。

其次，要利用欧洲的竞争优势。例如，欧洲拥有**中心化的医疗系统**，可以利用这些数据构建独特的全球领先的医疗应用。欧洲政府常犯的错误是只想做一个“欧洲版”或“奥地利版”的工具。技术产业只有在全球化时才最强。你应该像 **Spotify** 或 **Adyen** 那样，思考如何利用自身的优势构建全球竞争能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, one is I'd say go do deals with the various companies that hyperscalers that can build a bunch of compute. Those deals don't necessarily require money. They could just be we have facilitated a bunch of energy data center permits ability to build these data centers. In return for this facilitation, we want to make sure that you are enabling European companies to be able to access that compute. There's a tremendous amount of value in the applications. Like for example if I was a European entrepreneur I'd say well one of the benefits we have of centralized medical systems is we can use that centralized medical system to build a whole bunch of different unique medical applications and we should dominate that not just within Europe but globally. Technology industry is strongest when it's global. Which are the things that are like Spotify like Adyen and how do we get those kinds of things.

</details>

### 闪电式扩张与 AI 泡沫

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你写过关于《**闪电式扩张**》（**Blitzscaling**）的书。在 GPU 和电力成为稀缺资源而非用户的 AI 时代，这套剧本还适用吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Continuing on the topic of ramping and scaling you wrote the book on blitzscaling, right? And does that playbook work for AI where the scarce resources are GPUs and electricity and not users?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 事实上，AI 正在核心层面上应用这一剧本。闪电式扩张的精确定义是在**不确定性**的环境中冒险做大。这正是 AI 领域正在发生的事情。

我们坚信大规模训练将构建出极具价值的学习机器，因此我们投入约 600 亿美元来获取 1 GW 的算力。尽管 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 已经开始赚钱，但其他大部分投入仍处于不确定中。这就是闪电式扩张。

虽然 GPU、数据中心和能源供应有限，但能源可能会再次成为类似石油时代的**地缘政治**核心问题。此外，你还需要数据、人才和采用闭环。闪电式扩张的所有规则都在被应用，并且还在发展出新的规则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, it is actually centrally like I think if anything the AI... the precise definition of blitzscaling is taking the risk of going big in an environment of uncertainty right that is exactly what's happening with AI. We have such conviction that largescale training is going to build such interesting learning machines that we're investing like I think it's roughly like $60 billion to get a gigawatt of compute to do. And that's exactly what blitz scaling is. Now, there's limited numbers of GPUs, limited data centers, and there's limited energy. Interestingly, energy may end up being the geopolitical issue that really puts all this stuff together. But by the way, of course, you also need data and you need talent and critically you need a loop of adoption.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 谈谈算力、芯片和能源领域的资本流动。你对这种发展的速度和规模有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: When you look at the amount of capital flowing into data centers and chips and energy. What are your reflections when it comes to the speed and magnitude?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 如果 **Nvidia** 投资一家公司，该公司再买 Nvidia 的芯片，而这又是芯片唯一的用途，那这就是典型的泡沫。但我认为 AI 将带来智能的普及，智能将像电力一样 24/7 随时可用。

在微软这样的公司，每个 GPU 都在被争抢：一是客户需要的推理服务，二是内部研发，三是产品部署。即使训练速度放缓，对算力的经济需求依然巨大。我不担心 AI 泡沫会导致崩溃，它可能会有价格修正，但不会像人们担心的那样产生债务或银行连锁反应。这实际上是向“智能基础设施”时代的飞跃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Yeah. This would be a classic bubble if the only use of those Nvidia chips was doing things that didn't have separate economic productivity. Part of what I think is coming with AI is we're going to get intelligence with the scale and 24x7 availability of electricity. So intelligence is going to be as available as electricity. I don't think the AI bubble as getting to a collapse is actually in fact a real worry. The AI bubble leading to potential pricing corrections is definitely of course possible. But that doesn't create the kind of contagion and debt and banking and other kinds of things that people most worry about with bubbles.

</details>

### 未来设备与 AI 助手

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你认为未来的主要计算设备会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Related to this. What do you think the primary computing device would look like in the future?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 我不确定。虽然**智能眼镜**等很吸引人，但我们已经非常习惯手机了。我认为关键不在于设备形态，而在于每个人都将拥有一个“**全天候 AI 助手**”。

我制作了一个数字版的自己——**Reid AI**。人们常说**深度伪造**（Deepfake）是坏事，但我认为我们可以将其引向好的方向。几年内，语音信箱将会消失。当有人打电话给你时，你的 AI 助手会接听并判断是否重要到需要打断你的会议。

未来，每一个有计算能力的设备都会加入 AI。甚至洗衣机也会加入简单的计算能力，以便在电网电力过剩时运行，从而实现绿色节能。所以，答案可能是：AI 无处不在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: I'm not sure. I do think that there's a real value in all the scale compute that's going on. I do think that the notion of like an always on AI assistant for all of us is just a question of when and how. I'm one of these people who made a digital version of myself Reid AI. One of the things I realized by creating Reid AI is that it's a small number of years where like voicemail goes away because what happens when someone calls Nikolai, Nikolai AI answers. Every single device that has anything of compute capability will start adding AI to it. Like for example, washing machines as part of being green and saving electricity. So anyway, I think perhaps the answer is actually everywhere.

</details>

### 创业精神与投资哲学

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你见过这么多创业者，伟大创业者的共同特征是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: You've seen so many entrepreneurs in your life. What what are the common characteristics of great entrepreneurs?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 并没有单一的原型，但重要的特征包括：极大的**野心**（如果你不瞄准星星，你连月亮也够不到）；既有坚定的信念，又能根据数据学习和调整；能够聪明地承担风险。

此外，你必须是一个“**多能工具型运动员**”。如果你自己不擅长某项工具，你必须能雇佣到拥有该工具的人。创业公司是通过**网络**启动的。创始人需要不断组建最强的网络来实现不断演变的愿景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Important characteristics are to be super ambitious. To be both believe in that kind of huge outside capability but also learning and adjusting. They have to be able to take risks smartly. Another one is you have to be able to learn the journey. We have this phrase in American English multi-toolled athlete is really important. Entrepreneurial companies and entrepreneurs launch through networks. The founder needs to be always trying to assemble the strongest possible network to realize this vision.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 如果我走进你的办公室，你需要多久决定是否支持我？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So now you sit in your Greylock office and in I come. How long time does it take for you to decide whether I'm worth backing or not?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 这取决于情况。理想情况下，我会先做背景调查。比如投资 **Airbnb** 时，他们在演示几分钟后我就打断了他们，说我要投资，剩下的时间我们直接开始工作。

有时需要几天时间来调查竞争格局或技术成熟的时机。理想的风险投资在第 0 天看起来是疯狂的，第 2-3 年看起来是可行的，第 5-7 年看起来是理所当然的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, it depends a little bit. Ideally like I did with the Airbnb folks, I had reference checked them before I met with them. I interrupted them a few minutes into the pitch and I said, \"I'm gonna make you an offer to invest.\" Sometimes it takes days because sometimes you've got a sense of okay I need to reference check afterwards. Usually the ideal thing in a venture investment is at day zero it looks crazy, at year two and three it looks like feasible and year five to seven it looks obvious.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你曾说，错过一个伟大的投资比支持一个平庸的投资更具破坏性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now you said that it's more damaging to pass on a great investment than to back a poor one.

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 是的。如果你能投中那些伟大的公司，那才是最重要的。如果你认为某个项目可能成为伟大的公司之一，那么我更倾向于说服自己去投资，而不是寻找理由拒绝。当然，绝大多数公司都会失败，绝大多数公司都不会成为定义行业的变革者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reid Hoffman**: Well, it's still true that on the venture world and generally speaking investing in tech, if you can get into some of the great ones, that's all that matters. And missing one of those matters a lot more. If I think this could be one of the great ones then I tend to have to talk my way out of investing than talk my way into investing.

### 给“AI 世代”的建议

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Given all that and given all your experience, what is your advice to young people?

</details>

**里德·霍夫曼**: 我的第一本书叫《**至关重要的始创人**》（**The Start-up of You**）。核心观点是：在动荡时期，我们都需要更有创业精神。这不意味着每个人都要开公司，但你必须以创业的方式经营自己的职业生涯。

未来 5 到 10 年，营销人员的工作方式将因 AI 而完全不同。年轻人应该向公司推销自己：“我是 **AI 原住民**，你们需要 AI 转型，而我的经验可以帮助你们。”你们是“**AI 世代**”（Generation AI），这是你们通往成功之路应该倚仗的优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
