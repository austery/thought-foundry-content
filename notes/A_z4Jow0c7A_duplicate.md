## 引言：诺华及其首席执行官的独特背景

**Nicolai Tangen:** Hi everyone, I'm Nicolola Tangan, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm in really good company with Vas Narasiman, the CEO of Novartis. Vas has one of the most fascinating backgrounds in pharma. He is a trained physician who also worked on the front lines fighting tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries before rising to lead one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Uh we own 2.3% of Novartis and that's worth more than $5 billion. Roughly 10,000 Norwegian growner per Norwegian citizen. So Vas big thanks for joining us.

**讲述者:** 大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金的首席执行官尼古拉·坦根，今天我很高兴能与诺华（Novartis）首席执行官瓦斯·纳拉斯姆汉（Vas Narasimhan）在一起。 瓦斯在制药行业拥有最引人入胜的背景之一。 他是一名受过专业训练的医生，曾在发展中国家一线抗击肺结核和疟疾，之后才晋升为全球最大的制药公司之一的领导者。 我们拥有诺华 2.3%的股份，价值超过 50 亿美元。 大约相当于每位挪威公民 1 万挪威克朗。 所以，瓦斯，非常感谢你的加入。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Great to be here Niclay.

**讲述者:** 很高兴来到这里，尼古拉。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Um just uh briefly to uh kick off for those who are not familiar with Novartis in 10 seconds just what are your areas of focus?

**讲述者:** 嗯，简单介绍一下，对于不熟悉诺华的人来说，用 10 秒钟概括一下你们的重点领域是什么？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, we're one of the largest biioharmaceutical companies uh in the world focused on innovative medicines in oncology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience and in imunological diseases.
**讲述者:** 是的，我们是全球最大的生物制药公司之一，专注于肿瘤学、心血管疾病、神经科学和免疫学疾病领域的创新药物。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Very good. And we'll come back to uh to many of those. Um now you have a different background uh compared to many of the pharma CEOs. How do you think that has shaped your approach to approach to leading Novartis?
**讲述者:** 很好。 我们会再回来讨论这些。 嗯，现在你与其他许多制药公司的首席执行官相比，背景有所不同。 你认为这如何塑造了你领导诺华的方式？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Well, I think it's uh it's helped in many dimensions. I mean being coming coming from uh being a physician coming from a scientific background I'm definitely steeped in the R&D elements of the work we do. So I'm always thinking about the medicine how the medicines impact patients very data driven always thinking about how these medicines might fit into clinical practice. And given that the core of what a biioharmaceutical company does is find breakthrough innovations that matter for patients in the long run I think it's a really helpful background. You know, I had to learn a lot about business. I didn't go to business school. I had to learn all of the ins and outs of capital allocations and balance sheets, P&Ls, running businesses. But I think the combination of a medical background and business background has served me well. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
**讲述者:** 嗯，我认为这在很多方面都有帮助。 我的意思是，我是一名医生，来自科学背景，我无疑深深扎根于我们工作的研发环节。 所以我总是在思考药物如何影响患者，我非常注重数据，总是思考这些药物如何融入临床实践。 鉴于生物制药公司的核心是找到对患者长期有益的突破性创新，我认为这是一个非常有用的背景。 我不得不学习很多关于商业的知识。 我没有上商学院。 我必须学习资本分配、资产负债表、损益表以及运营企业的所有细枝末节。 但我认为医学背景和商业背景的结合对我很有帮助。 是的，绝对是。 绝对是。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, to be frank, uh business is is not so difficult compared to medicine. So, I think you you know the right things.
**讲述者:** 嗯，坦白说，和医学相比，商业没那么难。 所以，我认为你懂行。

## 诺华的转型之路：专注与价值释放

**Nicolai Tangen:** Now, you were you were running the uh the R&D efforts at Novartis before taking over as a CEO. So when you um when you took over what kind of changes did you implement?
**讲述者:** 在担任首席执行官之前，你曾负责诺华的研发工作。 那么当你接任后，你实施了哪些改变？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, I think the biggest change that we we to we took on was to focus the the company and the idea was our best uh our best elements of Novartis were in our R&D engine finding breakthrough medicines that that move the needle on a range of of different diseases. At the time we were a sprawling conglomerate and we had areas like consumer health, generics, uh we were in eye care and eye devices with the alcon business. And so the idea was to focus as a pure play innovative medicines company. Now it took a lot longer than than I expected uh to make that all happen. It took around five six years of spinning businesses. So we did uh we we got rid of our consumer or moved out of our consumer health business. We spun Alcon, spun Sandos, uh sold our Ro steak. And what's incredible to me now when you look at our company, our market cap is 235 billion. When you add back all of those companies that we put out uh into the public markets, you add another almost 100 billion to that market cap. So in the end, we really unlocked a lot of value by focusing.
**讲述者:** 是的，我认为我们做出的最大改变是让公司专注化，其理念是诺华最好的部分在于我们的研发引擎，它能找到突破性的药物，从而在各种不同的疾病中取得进展。 当时我们是一个庞大的企业集团，我们有消费者健康、仿制药等领域，我们通过爱尔康（Alcon）业务涉足眼科护理和眼科设备。 因此，我们的想法是专注于成为一家纯粹的创新药物公司。 现在，要实现这一切，花费的时间比我预期的要长得多。 花了大约五到六年的时间来剥离业务。 所以我们剥离了我们的消费者健康业务。 我们剥离了爱尔康，剥离了山德士（Sandoz），并出售了我们的罗氏股份。 现在令我难以置信的是，当你看到我们的公司时，我们的市值是 2350 亿美元。 当你把我们剥离到公开市场的所有那些公司加回来时，你又会给那个市值增加近 1000 亿美元。 所以最终，我们通过专注真正释放了巨大的价值。

**Nicolai Tangen:** In the old days, you could argue that you had some really stable revenue streams which kind of offset uh patent cliffs and so on. Now you are as more a a pure streamlined farmer company. What does that do to the attitudes in the company?
**讲述者:** 过去，你可以说你们有一些非常稳定的收入来源，这可以抵消专利悬崖等问题。 现在你们更像一家纯粹、精简的制药公司。 这对公司的态度有什么影响？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I mean it it there was this belief that if you had these more stable businesses that you could offset the peaks and valleys of R&D productivity in our industry because naturally we have large patent cliffs uh and we have to manage through those patent cliffs. But actually what we found is something else was happening. a lot of distraction and inability to allocate capital to where we found the most likely impact and the most most value. So in the end, you know, we're appropriately diversified within biioharmaceuticals. We're in different technology platforms and we invest a lot. I'm sure we'll talk about these advanced technology platforms. We're diversified in therapeutic areas, but being diversified across business lines just diluted our our effort. Uh and in the end, it's really interesting if you look at Novartis' history. We've actually managed through all of our patent experies, major patent experts, not because we had these other businesses, but because our innovation engine actually delivered the next wave of breakthroughs. So, in a sense, we have to bet on ourselves. Play to win and not play not to lose.
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，以前有一种观念，认为如果你拥有这些更稳定的业务，就可以抵消我们行业研发生产力的波峰和波谷，因为我们自然会面临巨大的专利悬崖，我们必须应对这些专利悬崖。 但实际上我们发现发生了其他事情。 很多分散注意力和无法将资本分配到我们认为最可能产生影响和最大价值的地方。 所以最终，你知道，我们在生物制药领域进行了适当的多元化。 我们处于不同的技术平台，我们投入了大量资金。 我相信我们会谈论这些先进技术平台。 我们在治疗领域进行了多元化，但跨业务线的多元化只是稀释了我们的努力。 最终，如果你看看诺华的历史，这真的很有趣。 我们实际上已经度过了所有专利到期，主要专利到期，不是因为我们有这些其他业务，而是因为我们的创新引擎实际上提供了下一波突破。 所以，在某种意义上，我们必须相信自己。 为赢而战，而不是为不输而战。

## 研发策略：专注、洞察与前沿技术

**Nicolai Tangen:** Do you think you structure your R&D differently uh compared to other pharma companies?
**讲述者:** 你认为你们的研发结构与其他制药公司不同吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** You know, we do do some things that that are different. I mean we have a function called strategy uh and growth which we you know created uh a few years back. It's run by a wonderful former Wall Street analyst from from Bernstein but has built a a whole team together that relentlessly looks at the outside world really brings in those insights and challenges even early stage researchers on is what they're doing really going to move the needle for for clinical care. So we bring those outside insights even into the earliest stages of of R&D. We also radically focused and that's something Novartis already always was not really good at. I mean we were in far too many therapeutic areas too diluted and what we did is we focused on four therapeutic areas cut out a lot of the other areas and then really built on the deep expertise and of our people. I think that's really um delivered delivered results. And I think that now the question is how we can use AI and other technologies to to get an edge on our peer set. I'd say the one other thing that we do that's unique is we invest in these technology platforms. We're the world leader in radolyan therapies, the world leader in cell and gene therapies, one of the world leaders in RNA therapeutics. And that's a belief that you have to keep investing at the cutting edge of science to lead in the long run. So if you think about where this industry will be in 2035, you have to keep investing in these leading edge technologies so that you're ahead of the curve.
**讲述者:** 你知道，我们确实做了一些不同的事情。 我的意思是，我们有一个叫做“战略与增长”的部门，我们几年前创建了它。 它由一位来自伯恩斯坦（Bernstein）的出色的前华尔街分析师领导，他组建了一个完整的团队，不断地审视外部世界，真正引入那些洞察力，甚至挑战早期研究人员，质疑他们所做的研究是否真的能推动临床护理的发展。 所以我们甚至将这些外部洞察引入到研发的最早期阶段。 我们也进行了彻底的聚焦，这正是诺华以前一直做得不太好的地方。 我的意思是，我们涉足的治疗领域太多，太过分散，我们所做的就是聚焦于四个治疗领域，砍掉了许多其他领域，然后真正建立在我们人员深厚的专业知识之上。 我认为这确实带来了成果。 我认为现在的问题是如何利用人工智能和其他技术来超越我们的同行。 我想说，我们做的另一件独特的事情是投资于这些技术平台。 我们是放射配体疗法（radolyan therapies）的世界领导者，细胞和基因疗法（cell and gene therapies）的世界领导者，也是 RNA 疗法（RNA therapeutics）的世界领导者之一。 这是一种信念，你必须不断投资于科学的前沿，才能在长期中保持领先。 所以，如果你考虑这个行业在 2035 年会发展到什么程度，你必须不断投资于这些前沿技术，这样你才能走在前沿。

**Nicolai Tangen:** If you were to rank uh your therapeutic areas according to attractiveness, how would you how would you stack him?
**讲述者:** 如果让你根据吸引力对你们的治疗领域进行排名，你会怎么排？

**Vas Narasimhan:** That's a tough one. And uh of course uh there there's no different metrics I think you you would you would use. I mean clearly each one of these areas has different dynamics. I mean in cardiovascular disease, you're looking at large-scale population health topics and trying to figure out how to better tackle heart disease and related cardiovascular conditions at scale. In neuroscience, we're very focused on neurodeenerative diseases and genetically driven diseases. These are much more focused areas where you're really, you know, mining the mysteries of of the mind. Um, you know, immunology has a whole set of different challenges. So, it's not easy to to rank. I I really like to think that we need to be strong in all of these these four areas. It it does bring to mind an important tangent though that that I think we always have to remind ourselves when we think about R&D uh in our sector. I mean what we do is remarkably hard. I mean when you think about it we are trying to unpack two billion years of evolution of cells and these processes that happen in multisellular organisms and to find a single drug target and then actually drug that target so that it impacts the human body in effective way is an incredibly daunting enterprise and the fact that we do it at all I like to tell our people it's a miracle that fits in the palm of your hands. It's a miracle we do this at all, much less doing this multiple times over 200 200 years. So I think it's always important to remind oneself of how hard it is to do the work we do in each one of these therapeutic areas or the modalities that we work in.
**讲述者:** 那是个难题。 当然，我认为你使用的衡量标准不会有所不同。 我的意思是，这些领域中的每一个都有不同的动态。 我的意思是，在心血管疾病领域，你关注的是大规模人群健康问题，并试图找出如何更好地大规模治疗心脏病和相关心血管疾病。 在神经科学领域，我们非常专注于神经退行性疾病和基因驱动疾病。 这些是更集中的领域，你真正地，你知道，挖掘大脑的奥秘。 免疫学有一整套不同的挑战。 所以，排名并不容易。 我真的很喜欢认为我们需要在这四个领域都强大。 不过，这确实让我想起一个重要的题外话，我认为我们在考虑我们行业的研发时，总是需要提醒自己。 我的意思是，我们所做的工作非常困难。 我的意思是，当你想到它时，我们正在试图解开细胞 20 亿年的进化以及多细胞生物中发生的这些过程，并找到一个单一的药物靶点，然后真正地作用于这个靶点，使其以有效的方式影响人体，这是一项令人难以置信的艰巨任务，而我们能做到这一点，我喜欢告诉我们的人，这是一个奇迹，它就在你的手掌中。 我们能做到这一点本身就是个奇迹，更不用说在 200 多年里多次做到这一点了。 所以我认为，提醒自己我们在这些治疗领域或我们所从事的模式中，工作是多么困难，这一点总是很重要的。

## 科学突破与创新前沿

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, we we're living in a we living at a time where there are more miracles than uh than normal because of uh the way science is moving, right?
**讲述者:** 嗯，我们生活在一个奇迹比以往更多的时代，因为科学发展的方式，对吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** So when you look at um everything you you are involved with what are the most significant scientific uh breakthroughs on the horizon that you are excited about?
**讲述者:** 那么，当你审视你所参与的一切时，在即将到来的科学突破中，哪些最让你感到兴奋？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, I think I think a couple things and and they range across a whole spectrum. I I think on the on one part in terms of population health, our ability to intervene earlier and earlier in disease to hopefully prevent diseases from even getting to late later stages I think will be incredibly important. uh demography in the world is is only getting more challenging. Huge aging populations, health care systems under strain, uh not enough young people always with the fertility rate falling to actually fund these healthare systems. So, we're going to have to prevent disease. And our experience is, you know, you can go earlier. We're working very hard to find how can you intervene earlier and earlier in various cancers. We just had another important data set in prostate cancer intervening early. And the idea is how how can you intervene so that the the cancer doesn't get to a stage where ultimately it requires hospitalizations. So I think early intervention is a is a huge area of focus. I think another exciting area clearly is the idea of can you completely reset diseases. This all comes out of the world of cell and gene therapies where we already learned that for certain genetic diseases and Novartis is one of the leaders here. we're able to almost deliver a cure or a dramatic response by using the gene therapies to actually replace a gene in the body. So now what we've learned and there's actually data coming out just this week that you can actually use cell therapy to reset the immune system. And there's a whole range of imunological diseases that are very severe affecting young people and old people. And the idea here is with these therapies using cell therapy you can reset the immune system and turn back the clock on their disease by 15 or 20 years. And so this is I think a staggering innovation that will change the lives of you know hopefully over time millions and millions of people. Another area I'm very excited about is an area called RNA therapeutics that allows you to give medicines that you usually take every day. You only need to take them every six months or maybe once a year. And most people don't take their preventative statins or other medicines. So if we can get to infrequently uh administered therapies, that would be incredibly exciting as well. And if you'll indulge me, just one other I I think is super exciting is is radioarmaceuticals or radolyan therapy where Novartis is a pioneer here. What we've learned is we know radiation can can attack tumors and and stop tumors from growing or even eliminate tumors. But now we can micro basically target radiation right to where the tumor is in the body using a drug linked to a radioactive particle and this is opening up a whole new area of medicine. So these are just some of the examples that we see.
**讲述者:** 是的，我认为有几件事，它们涵盖了整个范围。 我认为在人口健康方面，我们能够更早地干预疾病，希望能阻止疾病发展到晚期，我认为这将非常重要。 全世界的人口结构正变得越来越具有挑战性。 老龄化人口庞大，医疗系统不堪重负，年轻人总是不足，生育率下降，无法真正为这些医疗系统提供资金。 所以，我们将不得不预防疾病。 根据我们的经验，你可以更早地进行干预。 我们正在努力寻找如何在各种癌症中更早地进行干预。 我们刚刚在前列腺癌早期干预方面获得了另一组重要数据。 我们的想法是如何进行干预，使癌症不会发展到最终需要住院治疗的阶段。 所以我认为早期干预是一个巨大的重点领域。 我认为另一个令人兴奋的领域显然是能否完全“重置”疾病。 这都源于细胞和基因疗法领域，我们已经了解到，对于某些遗传疾病——诺华在这方面是领导者之一——我们可以通过基因疗法实际替换体内的基因，从而几乎实现治愈或显著的反应。 所以现在我们了解到，本周刚刚公布的数据显示，你实际上可以使用细胞疗法来重置免疫系统。 还有一系列非常严重的免疫疾病，影响着年轻人和老年人。 这里的想法是，通过这些使用细胞疗法的治疗方法，你可以重置免疫系统，并将他们的疾病时钟倒转 15 或 20 年。 所以我认为这是一项惊人的创新，有望随着时间的推移改变数百万人的生活。 另一个让我非常兴奋的领域是 RNA 疗法，它允许你服用通常每天服用的药物，你只需要每六个月服用一次，或者每年服用一次。 大多数人都不服用他们的预防性他汀类药物或其他药物。 所以如果我们可以实现不频繁给药的疗法，那也将令人难以置信地兴奋。 如果你允许我再提一个，我认为非常令人兴奋的是放射性药物或放射配体疗法，诺华在这方面是先驱。 我们了解到的是，我们知道放射线可以攻击肿瘤，阻止肿瘤生长甚至消除肿瘤。 但现在我们可以使用一种与放射性粒子连接的药物，基本上将放射线微观靶向地直接输送到体内肿瘤所在的位置，这正在开辟一个全新的医学领域。 所以这些只是我们看到的一些例子。

## 领导力与创新管理

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, so these are some of the examples but I mean how do you how do you personally stay on top of this?
**讲述者:** 嗯，这些都是一些例子，但我的意思是，你个人是如何掌握这些最新进展的呢？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I'm quite passionate about it. I mean, as I said, I'm a physician scientist, and you know, my favorite meeting of of the month always is our innovation management board, which I've I've chaired now for 13 years since I was the head of development all through my time as CEO. Uh, I read every one of those documents because, you know, that that's in the end, I think, what a company like us has to deliver. I mean, for us to stay.
**讲述者:** 我对此非常热情。 我的意思是，正如我所说，我是一名医生科学家，你知道，我每个月最喜欢的会议总是我们的创新管理委员会，从我担任开发负责人开始，直到现在担任首席执行官，我主持这个会议已经 13 年了。 我会阅读所有这些文件，因为，你知道，我认为最终像我们这样的公司必须交付的正是这些。 我的意思是，为了我们能保持。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Tell me tell me tell me about that meeting. So it's once is this is this like the is this like the the lifeblood meeting of the company?
**讲述者:** 告诉我那个会议。 所以这是，这是公司的命脉会议吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I do feel like it's the lifeblood meeting of the company. We review the projects that our research teams are bringing into later stages of research which are so how many I'm sorry.
**讲述者:** 我确实觉得那是公司的命脉会议。 我们会审阅研究团队带入后期研究阶段的项目，这些项目…抱歉，有多少人？

**Nicolai Tangen:** So how many how many people so so who who are in the meeting? How many people are you?
**讲述者:** 那么有多少人参加会议？ 你们有多少人？

**Vas Narasimhan:** H well there's a lot of people who end up attending but the core members is about seven seven leaders head of research development strategy and growth are commercial leaders and myself and the CFOs maybe eight people how long does it last sometimes it's two four hour meetings sometimes it's one six hour meeting uh but it is it is a long meeting it's not for the the do you run it I do I I chair it and I I've chaired it now for uh a number of years from development times to to today but Of course, chairing a meeting like this is really just getting the best perspectives from all of the leaders in the room. I mean, what can I possibly know compared to all of these experts, but we always have the teams come in, our experts, uh, in whether it's cancer or heart disease or research experts or development experts, scientists, physicians. Uh, and I think one of the most important things we've gotten much better at is having a debate. And I think debate is the only way you can navigate these complex topics and finding these these miracles that we talk about. If you're not willing to have the counterveiling position in the room, if it's just rubber stamping, then of course you're liable to easily fall into all of the biases that come in to taking decisions in in medicine and R&D.
**讲述者:** 最终会有很多人参加，但核心成员大约有七位领导人，包括研发战略和增长部门的负责人，还有商业负责人，我自己和首席财务官，大概八个人。 会议持续多久呢？ 有时是两次四小时的会议，有时是一次六小时的会议，但它确实是一个很长的会议，不适合那些……你主持吗？ 是的，我主持。 我主持这个会议已经很多年了，从开发阶段到现在。 当然，主持这样的会议，实际上只是为了从会议室里所有领导人那里获得最好的观点。 我的意思是，和所有这些专家相比，我能知道什么呢？ 但我们总是有团队成员和我们的专家参与进来，无论他们是癌症或心脏病领域的专家，还是研究专家、开发专家、科学家、医生。 我认为我们做得越来越好的一件最重要的事情就是进行辩论。 我认为辩论是你在这些复杂话题中航行并找到我们所说的这些奇迹的唯一途径。 如果你不愿意在会议室里接受反向意见，如果只是橡皮图章，那么你当然很容易陷入在医学和研发领域做决策时出现的所有偏见。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So V, I'm now your uh I'm now top uh cancer researcher. Okay. I come into this meeting uh you know on you know uh I've given you 200 pages to read beforehand and and here I come Nikolai Tangan the great cancer guy. So what happens I I come in there I do I present or you just go straight to questions or what what happens?
**讲述者:** 那么 V，我现在是你们顶级的癌症研究员。 好的。 我带着你事先阅读的 200 页资料来到这个会议，我是尼古拉·坦根，那位伟大的癌症专家。 那么会发生什么？ 我进去后是做汇报，还是你直接提问，或者会发生什么？

**Vas Narasimhan:** We've evolved this over the years. We used to have long presentations. Now we assume the pre-eread is read and we ask the person the the leader to give us you know just a three minute summary um of the case and then um we usually try to also put up a slide that has from the team's view what were the reasons to do the project or what were the reasons not to do the project. Uh we also have a portfolio analytics group that gives us lots of data and analyses on these projects and then we have a discussion and my role is to get that the room to really discuss the topic and have a debate and see uh are we doing the right thing by funding this project to the next tollgate and if you were to terminate uh a project does that happen in these meetings?
**讲述者:** 多年来我们已经发展了这种模式。 我们以前会有很长的演示。 现在我们假设预读材料已被阅读，我们会请负责人给我们一个三分钟的案例总结，然后我们通常还会放一张幻灯片，从团队的角度说明做这个项目的原因或不做这个项目的原因。 我们还有一个投资组合分析团队，为我们提供大量关于这些项目的数据和分析，然后我们进行讨论，我的职责是让会议室真正讨论这个话题并进行辩论，看看我们是否正确地为这个项目提供资金以进入下一个关卡。 如果要终止一个项目，那会是在这些会议中发生吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yes, that and that is I think one of the most important things a well-run R&D organization has to do. You have to be intellectually honest as to where projects are. Do they fit in your strategy? Do they have the data to support going? Uh and you have to have the courage to kindly but firmly explain to teams that we have to stop here and we've got to use the resources for other things. That's obviously never uh easy, but we always try to celebrate the teams and tell them it's not the teams that failed. If they did their work right, the science simply didn't deliver the way we expected. And that's okay. That's just part of the work that we do. most of our projects ultimately fail.
**讲述者:** 是的，我认为这是一个运作良好的研发组织必须做的最重要的事情之一。 你必须在知识上诚实地对待项目所处的状态。 它们符合你的战略吗？ 它们有数据支持继续进行吗？ 而且你必须有勇气和善而坚定地向团队解释，我们必须在这里停止，我们必须将资源用于其他事情。 这显然从来都不容易，但我们总是努力表彰团队，告诉他们失败的不是团队。 如果他们工作做得对，只是科学没有像我们预期的那样带来成果。 这没关系。 这只是我们工作的一部分。 我们的大多数项目最终都会失败。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, I have to say I would have loved to sit in in that meeting. That sounds even more interesting than our investment meetings at uh in the fund, you know.
**讲述者:** 嗯，我不得不说，我真想参加那次会议。 那听起来比我们基金的投资会议更有趣。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, our six can get a little tough. So, that's uh that that's where I think I've built up some meeting endurance over the over the years.
**讲述者:** 是的，我们六个可能会有点艰难。 所以，那也是我这些年磨练出了一些会议耐力的地方。

## 人工智能在制药业的应用

**Nicolai Tangen:** Um moving on, um AI and digital, you've been you really have been a champion in the digital transformation in pharma. Now what um you mentioned briefly in the beginning some of the digital initiatives but what would you say are the most important ones that you have?
**讲述者:** 接下来，关于人工智能和数字化，你一直是制药行业数字化转型的倡导者。 那么，你在一开始简要提到了其中一些数字化举措，但你认为其中最重要的有哪些？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I I think clearly AI's impact in research and development in our industry will likely have the longest lasting ex impact. There's a lot that's happening in operations manufacturing supply chain finance uh and that I think is is important clearly having an impact already but ultimately will become I think standard across our sector and other sectors. The biggest question here is can you use AI um to either discover what is a drug target? So think of it as the key lock that we need to unlock. So find those key locks and then can you also use AI to optimize the key into the lock so that that key can ultimately unlock the biological process that we're talking about. Uh now as to where we are today, we're already using AI with Isomorphic Labs, the Google Deep Mind Company, other partners to optimize those keys. So we have some ideas for the keys. AI get takes all of the information known uh out there and inside the company and optimize those candidate drugs and then helps us speed up the process by predicting how it will ultimately do in pre-clinical safety toxicology uh in terms of its uh pharmacocinetics its manufacturability that process is now and that's really happening now at scale and companies like ours and at other companies uh and I think that will hopefully shorten the drug development early drug development process by years and that's I think really exciting and then the bigger question is could you actually unlock biological processes with AI and actually understand and that I'm think we're further away from so I you work with Microsoft Palanteer but you mentioned the um isomorphic labs which is Habis's uh venture right you got the uh Nobel Prize um inside uh inside Google just how do you work with them what do they do for you yeah so it's a it's a very I think we're one of their two partners and basically ally what we do is we give them again to take the the key the key lock and the key analogy we give them some locks that we know or we hypothesize are very important in diseases like cancer or heart disease that we simply have not been able to drug or i.e find the key for and we say we've struggled with our traditional methods can AI can their capabilities uh ultimately enable us to to find those keys and so what they do is they use AI to design new drugs and what's been very interesting is they come AI comes up with drug structures that you know we've not thought about or really explored um and so we're starting to see the early results I think we now have over six different projects going with them and hopefully to expand more into the future and we'll If AI can solve what we call our undruggable targets.
**讲述者:** 我认为人工智能对我们行业研发的影响显然可能具有最持久的外部影响。 在运营、制造、供应链、财务方面发生了很多事情，我认为这很重要，显然已经产生影响，但最终我认为将成为我们行业和其他行业的标准。 这里最大的问题是，你能否使用人工智能来发现什么是药物靶点？ 所以把它想象成我们需要解锁的“钥匙锁”。 找到这些“钥匙锁”，然后你还能否使用人工智能来优化“钥匙”插入“锁”，这样那把“钥匙”最终就能解锁我们正在谈论的生物过程。 现在，就我们今天的现状而言，我们已经在使用人工智能与 Isomorphic Labs（Google DeepMind 公司）、其他合作伙伴一起优化这些“钥匙”。 所以我们对“钥匙”有一些想法。 人工智能获取所有已知信息，包括外部信息和公司内部信息，然后优化这些候选药物，然后通过预测其在临床前安全性毒理学方面的最终表现，以及其药代动力学和可制造性来帮助我们加快进程。 这个过程现在正在大规模进行，在像我们这样的公司和其他公司都在进行，我认为这有望将药物开发的早期药物开发过程缩短数年，我认为这非常令人兴奋。 然后更大的问题是，你是否真的能用人工智能解锁生物过程并真正理解，我认为我们离那还有距离。 所以你与微软和 Palantir 合作，但你提到了 Isomorphic Labs，那是哈比斯（Habis）的合资企业，对吧？ 你们在谷歌内部获得了诺贝尔奖，你们是如何与他们合作的？ 他们为你们做了什么？ 是的，这非常，我认为我们是他们的两个合作伙伴之一，基本上我们所做的是，我们再次给他们，用“钥匙锁”和“钥匙”的比喻，我们给他们一些我们知道或假设在癌症或心脏病等疾病中非常重要的“锁”，而我们根本无法对其进行药物开发，也就是说找不到“钥匙”，我们说我们用传统方法遇到了困难，人工智能，他们的能力能否最终使我们找到这些“钥匙”？ 所以他们所做的是，他们利用人工智能设计新药，而非常有趣的是，人工智能会提出我们从未想过或真正探索过的药物结构。 所以我们开始看到早期结果，我认为我们现在与他们有超过六个不同的项目正在进行，并希望未来能进一步扩大。 如果人工智能能够解决我们所谓的“不可成药靶点”（undruggable targets）。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So, can the AI help us drug the undruggable? That's the question.
**讲述者:** 那么，人工智能能帮助我们研发出针对“不可成药靶点”的药物吗？ 问题就在这里。

**Vas Narasimhan:** It's interesting how relationships with uh technology companies has been key to success in pharma, right?
**讲述者:** 有趣的是，与科技公司的关系已经成为制药业成功的关键，对吗？

**Nicolai Tangen:** Because that wasn't the case in the old days. H how how do you see this changing going forward?
**讲述者:** 因为以前不是这样。 你认为这种变化未来会如何发展？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Just it's a big shift. I mean, I think you know, we've learned over the years. Palanteer has been an amazing partner of ours. We've been working with them since 20 2017. They've helped to build a data lake we call data 42 which we think is one of the most advanced in the industry. Helps us mine all of our data just using a simple text field. Microsoft Research Labs has been a great partner. I think what it is is, you know, you have to find the right use cases. It's easy to try to chase all kinds of things and we fell into that trap. We chased far too many AI and data science projects. But as we've learned over the years, if you get the right use cases and you find the right partners, I mean, Amazon has helped us completely automate our patient services in the United States as another example, you need those partnerships because we simply don't have the technological know-how in house.
**讲述者:** 这只是一个巨大的转变。 我的意思是，我认为多年来我们已经学到了很多。 Palantir 一直是我们出色的合作伙伴。 我们从 2017 年就开始与他们合作。 他们帮助我们建立了一个名为 Data 42 的数据湖，我们认为这是行业内最先进的数据湖之一。 帮助我们只需使用简单的文本字段就能挖掘所有数据。 微软研究院实验室一直是一个很棒的合作伙伴。 我认为关键在于，你必须找到正确的用例。 很容易尝试追逐各种各样的事情，我们也曾陷入过那个陷阱。 我们追逐了太多的人工智能和数据科学项目。 但正如我们多年来所学到的，如果你找到了正确的用例并找到了正确的合作伙伴，我的意思是，亚马逊（Amazon）已经帮助我们完全自动化了我们在美国的患者服务，这是另一个例子，你需要这些合作伙伴关系，因为我们内部根本不具备这些技术专长。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Do you think you're better at working with the tech companies than your competitors?
**讲述者:** 你认为你在与科技公司合作方面比你的竞争对手做得更好吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I don't know. You'd have to ask the the the tech companies. I mean, I do think, you know, one of the great things about Novartis is we're willing to pioneer at the cutting edge. edge. I mean, if you look at a lot of the technology areas in our industry, whether it's therapeutic platforms, AI, data science, we're always at the leading edge. That also means we often have to fight through many of the early challenges and often means also we have the failures associated with that, but that's kind of the ethos of our company. We're at the leading edge.
**讲述者:** 我不知道。 你得去问那些科技公司。 我的意思是，我确实认为，诺华的伟大之处在于我们愿意在尖端领域开创先河。 我的意思是，如果你看看我们行业中的许多技术领域，无论是治疗平台、人工智能还是数据科学，我们总是处于领先地位。 这也意味着我们经常需要克服许多早期的挑战，也常常意味着我们也会因此而失败，但这正是我们公司的精神。 我们走在前沿。

## 欧洲制药业的挑战与变革

**Nicolai Tangen:** You've been uh very outspoken about the challenges facing the European pharma industry. And I I I heard you for instance in divorce and I was just like wow this guy is actually he's he's pretty outspoken you know he's like he's telling us what he really thinks and and there are many cos who actually don't do that. So so tell us about this tell us about the situation of pharma in Europe in kind of no uncertain terms and and that I I've pretty consistently done uh to to also directly to the senior leaders.
**讲述者:** 你一直对欧洲制药业面临的挑战直言不讳。 我曾听你在达沃斯（Davos）的发言，当时我就想，哇，这个人真的很直率，他告诉我他真实的想法，而很多首席执行官并不会这样做。 所以请你毫不含糊地告诉我们欧洲制药业的现状，我也一直如此直接地向高层领导传达。

**Vas Narasimhan:** You know, Europe has been the the home of the pharmaceutical industry. I mean, when you look at it 100 years ago, the earliest pharmaceutical companies all came up along the Ryan River and in related parts of of Europe, it's where the industry ultimately was created. And over the last century, it still has been the real powerhouse of the world. When you look at where drugs are most most manufactured right now, uh it's in it's in Europe where a lot of R&D activity is happening in Europe. Clinical trials is happening in Europe. But at at the same time what's happened is European governments have just commoditized the innovation that that we deliver and more and more through budget uh constraints constraining how they uh reward innovation propping up the generics industry with artificially elevated prices not taking on the hospital sector they've constrained and constrained to the point now where Europe at population slightly larger than the United States its market size is half or even less than half of of the US and not growing whereas the US and now China I mean China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world growing almost at 20 or growing certainly double digit and so Europe needs to do something because clearly you know the US administration wants manufacturing to move we've seen $250 billion of announcements from companies saying they're going to invest more US and European companies saying they're going to invest more in the US so Europe has to act they have to figure out how to reward innovation by not capping drug prices, penalizing companies when they have new technologies and new uh innovations, not artificially finding ways to really constrain the innovation environment or it it will over time leave. I mean, it's just the economics is Europe acting not fast enough.
**讲述者:** 你知道，欧洲一直是制药业的故乡。 我的意思是，如果你回溯 100 年前，最早的制药公司都沿着莱茵河以及欧洲相关地区兴起，那里最终成为了这个行业的发源地。 在过去一个世纪里，它仍然是世界真正的动力源。 当你看看现在大部分药物的制造地，是在欧洲，许多研发活动也在欧洲进行。 临床试验也在欧洲进行。 但与此同时，发生的情况是，欧洲各国政府将我们提供的创新商品化，并通过预算限制越来越多地限制他们如何奖励创新，通过人为抬高价格来支持仿制药行业，而不是承担医院部门的压力，他们一直在限制，限制到目前欧洲人口略多于美国，但其市场规模只有美国的一半甚至更少，而且没有增长，而美国和现在中国，我的意思是，中国是世界第二大制药市场，增长率几乎达到 20%，或者肯定达到两位数，所以欧洲需要做些什么，因为显然，你知道，美国政府希望制造业转移，我们已经看到公司宣布了 2500 亿美元的投资，表示他们将更多地投资美国，欧洲公司也表示他们将更多地投资美国，所以欧洲必须采取行动，他们必须弄清楚如何通过不限制药品价格，不惩罚拥有新技术和新创新的公司来奖励创新，而不是人为地寻找方法来真正限制创新环境，否则它将随着时间的推移而流失。 我的意思是，这只是经济学问题，欧洲的行动不够快。

**Nicolai Tangen:** No, I mean I think Europe is trying at the European level to do what they what they can uh easily, but I think the real hard conversations still have to happen and I think certainly the the trade situation will push that topic even even harder as will the Trump administration's push on international reference pricing.
**讲述者:** 不，我的意思是，我认为欧洲正在欧洲层面努力做他们能轻易做到的事情，但我认为真正艰难的对话仍然必须发生，而且我认为贸易形势肯定会进一步推动这个话题，就像特朗普政府推动国际参考定价一样。

**Nicolai Tangen:** What's but what's what's preventing Europe from moving? That's a good question.
**讲述者:** 但是什么阻止了欧洲前进呢？ 这是个好问题。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Right. I mean I think it's political will um ultimately and and a fundamentally a belief that the industry won't move or or it won't lead to a shift and as you know I mean these shifts don't happen like you know rapidly but slowly over time in 10 years from now you start to say today about 40% of new drugs 30 to 40% of new drugs are not launched in Europe. European patients don't get access to them. They're primarily launched in the US to some extent China and Japan. That number will slowly increase. Slowly but surely you'll see manufacturing leave. Novartis had four manufacturing plants in the UK. We have zero today. Uh step by step you'll see and then suddenly I think it'll get to a unfortunately to a crisis as it did in Japan for the pharmaceutical sector and then governments will act because patients will demand where are these medicines. Governments will be looking at where do the jobs go. But unfortunately I think until we get to that crisis point it's easy just to hope that the status quo will be good enough.
**讲述者:** 是的。 我的意思是，我认为最终是政治意愿，以及一种根本性的信念，即这个行业不会转移，也不会导致转变。 而且你知道，这些转变不是迅速发生的，而是随着时间的推移缓慢发生的。 从现在起十年后，你就会开始说，目前大约有 30%到 40%的新药没有在欧洲上市。 欧洲患者无法获得这些药物。 它们主要在美国，在一定程度上也在中国和日本上市。 那个数字会慢慢增加。 你会看到制造业缓慢但肯定地离开。 诺华在英国曾有四家制造工厂。 今天我们一家都没有了。 你会一步一步地看到，然后突然间，不幸的是，我认为它会像日本制药行业那样，达到一个危机点，然后政府才会采取行动，因为患者会要求这些药物在哪里。 政府会关注工作岗位流向何处。 但不幸的是，我认为在我们达到那个危机点之前，很容易只是希望现状就足够好。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Is the problem uh Brussels or is it the individual countries?
**讲述者:** 问题出在布鲁塞尔还是各个国家？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I mean I think I think that the challenge of course Brussels would say they don't control innovation ecosystems and individual markets. Um and so individual countries have to make their own decisions. uh that said I think with a 27 member block without some sort of coordinated action given the trade is ultimately managed at the EU level it's going to be very difficult to tackle this problem because of the just this the dispar the differences in uh GDP per capita across the European Union and so I think Brussels needs to come up with a framework to guide the countries otherwise we won't get out of the situation what would what would it take for the countries to think more about the uh common destiny of Europe rather than just their on situation because it's not only in the farmer industry we seeing this right we're seeing it in pretty much every industry
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，我认为这个挑战，布鲁塞尔当然会说他们不控制创新生态系统和各个市场。 嗯，所以各个国家必须做出自己的决定。 尽管如此，我认为在一个拥有 27 个成员国的集团中，如果没有某种协调行动，鉴于贸易最终是在欧盟层面管理的，要解决这个问题将非常困难，因为欧盟各国人均国内生产总值（GDP）的差异很大，所以我认为布鲁塞尔需要制定一个框架来指导各国，否则我们将无法摆脱困境。 那么，各国需要做什么才能更多地考虑欧洲的共同命运，而不仅仅是自身的情况呢？ 因为这不仅在制药行业中出现，在几乎所有行业中我们都看到了这种情况。

**Vas Narasimhan:** it's true and it's not and of course I think governments would say they've got to figure out defense they've got to figure out energy they've got figure out the pharmaceutical sector I mean I think it's going to take ultimately leadership and uh you know I think some more of the European leaders have to galvanize support across Europe uh and I think that of course that's challenging but you need I think some senior leaders in Europe to say they're going to take this on. I think if each country sits in their corner and kind of hopes that this will work itself out, I think the the story will keep unfolding the way it's unfolding.
**讲述者:** 这是事实，当然，我认为各国政府会说他们必须解决国防问题，他们必须解决能源问题，他们必须解决制药行业的问题。 我的意思是，我认为最终需要领导力，而且我认为一些欧洲领导人必须在欧洲范围内争取支持，而且我认为这当然具有挑战性，但我认为你需要一些欧洲高级领导人站出来说他们将承担起这个责任。 我认为如果每个国家都坐在自己的角落里，希望这个问题能自行解决，那么这个故事就会按照它目前展开的方式继续展开。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, I mean, Draghi wrote the report, but uh I guess not so much is happening. Um despite um the despite the world changing, right, with uh tariffs and barriers and so on uh moving, are you are you surprised that not more is happening after this report?
**讲述者:** 嗯，我的意思是，德拉吉（Draghi）写了报告，但我猜没什么进展。 尽管世界正在变化，对吧，关税和壁垒等等都在变化，这份报告之后，没有发生更多的事情，你感到惊讶吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I mean I think there was at least recognition and I I have to say that at at least the tone uh from the European Commission is much more about economic competitiveness and less about uh you know the whole period of time where we had so many new bureaucratic elements being added whether it was CSRD or uh the due diligence or water and all of these things added on top of each other. Um that said I think action has been been slow. Uh I think uh and I think while the talk has been you know high ultimately companies respond to when they see real concrete action. Uh the EU did put out new pharmaceutical proposed pharmaceutical legislation which improves somewhat from their already really damaging approach to protecting pharmaceutical data. But already that's still worse than where we were 3 years ago. So we actually went from a place where we got much worse and now we're less worse and then that's supposed to be a victory. Um so you know I I think there has to be more of a sense of urgency.
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，我认为至少得到了承认，我必须说，欧盟委员会的基调更多地是关于经济竞争力，而不是关于我们增加了许多新的官僚主义因素的整个时期，无论是企业可持续发展报告指令（CSRD）还是尽职调查或水资源等所有这些叠加在一起的东西。 尽管如此，我认为行动一直很缓慢。 我认为，尽管讨论热度很高，但最终公司只有看到真正的具体行动时才会做出回应。 欧盟确实发布了新的制药立法提案，这比他们之前已经非常损害制药数据保护的方法有所改进。 但那仍然比我们三年前的情况更糟。 所以我们实际上是从一个变得更糟的地方，现在变得不那么糟了，然后这应该算是一个胜利。 所以我认为必须有更强的紧迫感。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So Vas, I'm giving you this magic wand. You can change three things in European farmer. What would you change?
**讲述者:** 那么瓦斯，我把这根魔杖交给你。 你可以在欧洲的制药行业改变三件事。 你会改变什么？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I would say the that we should have uh Europeanwide uh list price system that then countries can adjust based on GDP per capita that then gives us a framework for list prices across Europe. Uh I think second there should be no allow allowance for capping growth of the pharmaceutical sector. So basically like if you take a country like Italy, our entire growth in Italy is paid back to Italy at the end of the year. Uh and so it's very hard to to grow a business if you're always paying back your growth to the to the c many countries have this. So we've got to end this end this practice. Um and then and then third I think uh Europe has to end also its practice of propping up the generics industry. Uh go to the US model where we have high innovation and then generics prices that are the lowest in the world. Uh and then you'll find the fiscal space to invest in innovation. These are three I think very doable uh changes. We tal wrote about it in the financial times and let's see how does the new geopolitical situation impact the way you think.
**讲述者:** 我会说，我们应该建立一个全欧洲范围内的标价系统，各国可以根据人均 GDP 进行调整，从而为我们在欧洲的标价提供一个框架。 其次，我认为不应该允许限制制药行业的增长。 所以基本上，如果你拿意大利这样的国家来说，我们在意大利的全部增长在年底都要返还给意大利。 因此，如果你总是把增长返还给国家，就很难发展业务，很多国家都有这种情况。 所以我们必须结束这种做法。 第三，我认为欧洲还必须停止扶持仿制药行业的做法。 应该效仿美国模式，在那里我们有高创新，然后仿制药价格是世界上最低的。 然后你就会找到投资创新的财政空间。 我认为这三个改变都是非常可行的。 我们在《金融时报》上写过这个，我们看看新的地缘政治局势如何影响你的思维方式。

## 诺华的适应性与中国创新

**Vas Narasimhan:** Well, I think first what I tell my people is we've been around for 250 years. We have to focus on our controllables, focus on our finding the next wave of medicines, launching them well and doing our work. That's where the energy of Novartis has to go. Now, I think on how we adjust uh to the current situation, I think the most important thing is to have more flexibility. And what we've decided to do is ensure we have manufacturing capacity in the US for the US so that we can manufacture our most important medicines for the US in the US for Europe and then similarly have manufacturing in China so that flexibilizes our our supply chain. We're also working to flexibilize our R&D clinical trial ability so we can obviously adapt. So I think you have to create much more adaptable systems in your company and much more ability to react to how how the policies uh change.
**讲述者:** 嗯，我认为首先我告诉我的团队的是，我们已经存在了 250 年。 我们必须专注于我们可控的事情，专注于寻找下一波药物，成功地推出它们并做好我们的工作。 这就是诺华的精力必须投入的地方。 现在，我认为关于我们如何适应当前形势，最重要的是要有更大的灵活性。 我们决定确保在美国拥有针对美国市场的制造能力，这样我们就可以在美国为美国和欧洲生产我们最重要的药物，然后类似地，在中国也拥有制造能力，从而使我们的供应链更具弹性。 我们还在努力使我们的研发临床试验能力更具弹性，这样我们就可以明显地适应。 所以我认为你必须在公司中创建更具适应性的系统，以及更强的能力来应对政策的变化。

**Nicolai Tangen:** When it comes to China, you have you've called the Chinese innovation ecosystem a wakeup call for the industry and you also talk about staggering pace of clinical trial recruitment in China. Just um tell us what um why are they getting it right there?
**讲述者:** 谈到中国，你曾称中国的创新生态系统是行业的一个“警钟”，你还提到了中国临床试验招募的惊人速度。 那么，请告诉我们，为什么他们能在那里做得这么好？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Well, you know, China the story is interesting. And when you go back to 2014, uh, China was not a power player in in biioharmaceuticals. First, they made some important uh changes in their policy and regulatory framework. They modernized their drug regulator and increased the quality standards for all manufacturers which kind of eliminated a lot of the local players who were below uh appropriate standards. They created a national reimbursement system called the NRDL list for new medicines. But then they also decided to create a process called valuebased pricing VBP that when drugs are at the end of their life cycle they become extremely cheap. They put all of this together into a package and then step by step they began to speed up their regulator speed up their clinical trials. Now there was a big boom five six years ago uh and then ultimately uh it didn't pan out and of course there was then retrenchment and then as often is the case as you know uh now the sectors come back very strong and what we see the biggest shifts are one u we're no longer seeing fast follower alone we're actually seeing novel innovation novel drug targets novel technologies two the pace of clinical trial uh start and recruitment in China is now the fastest in the world it's outpacing eur Europe certainly outpacing um the US. Three, the drug regulator has sped up. So you can get approvals now in China almost at the same speed as you get um in the US and I think there's capital as well flowing into the Shanghai biotech uh se uh sector and that's creating you know a lot of company formation. So this has led I think now to the for the first time multiple new drugs in recent years novel drugs originating from China getting approved in the US and the pace of that is only continuing. So I think all big bioarma now is looking to Shanghai um alongside Boston and San Diego and some of the other hubs.
**讲述者:** 中国的故事很有趣。 回到 2014 年，中国在生物制药领域还不是一个强大的参与者。 首先，他们在政策和监管框架上做出了一些重要改变。 他们对药品监管机构进行了现代化改造，并提高了所有制造商的质量标准，这在一定程度上淘汰了许多不符合标准的本土企业。 他们还建立了一个国家报销系统，即新药国家基本医疗保险药品目录（NRDL）列表。 但后来他们还决定创建一个名为“价值定价”（VBP）的流程，规定当药物生命周期结束时，价格会变得极其便宜。 他们将所有这些整合在一起，然后一步步加快了监管机构的审批速度，加快了临床试验的速度。 大约五六年前曾有过一次大繁荣，但最终并没有成功，当然也出现了收缩，然后正如你所知，现在这个行业又非常强劲地回来了，我们看到最大的变化是：第一，我们不再仅仅看到快速追随者，我们实际上看到了新颖的创新、新颖的药物靶点和新颖的技术。 第二，中国临床试验的启动和招募速度现在是世界上最快的，肯定超过了欧洲，也超过了美国。 第三，药品监管机构加快了审批速度。 所以你现在在中国获得批准的速度几乎和在美国一样快，而且我认为也有资本流入上海的生物技术领域，这催生了许多公司的成立。 所以我认为，这导致了近年来首次有多个源自中国的新药在美国获得批准，而且这个速度还在持续。 所以我认为所有大型生物制药公司现在都在关注上海，与波士顿、圣迭戈和其他一些中心并驾齐驱。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Is there a risk that US and China will stop accepting each other's clinical data?
**讲述者:** 美国和中国会停止接受对方的临床数据吗？存在这种风险吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** There's a risk. I think it would be very damaging. I mean the whole ecosystem at the moment is built around the fact that we run global clinical trials. I mean the US is usually about 30% of most clinical trial recruitment. Uh clearly China now makes up an increasing proportion. If you were to bulcanize the world of clinical clinical trials, this would be hugely damaging for bio biioharmaceutical innovation. I mean, you will set back drug timelines significantly simply because you just can't fully recruit in the US. Europe is also slowed down. So, we need Asia to kind of complete our trial recruitment at the appropriate pace. And also, if you think about it from an efficiency standpoint, we can get approvals in both markets around the same time. So, that of course increases our return profile. Otherwise, you know, you're going to have big discrepancies in timelines between the geography.
**讲述者:** 有风险。 我认为这将非常具有破坏性。 我的意思是，目前的整个生态系统都建立在我们进行全球临床试验的基础之上。 我的意思是，美国通常占据大多数临床试验招募的约 30%。 显然，中国现在所占比例越来越大。 如果你把全球临床试验的世界“巴尔干化”（bulcanize，指分裂成小而相互敌对的区域），这将对生物制药创新造成巨大损害。 我的意思是，你将显著推迟药物上市时间，仅仅因为你无法在美国完全招募到足够的受试者。 欧洲也放慢了速度。 所以，我们需要亚洲以适当的速度来完成我们的试验招募。 而且，如果你从效率的角度考虑，我们可以在两个市场大致同时获得批准。 所以，这当然会提高我们的回报率。 否则，你知道，不同地理区域之间的时间线将会出现巨大差异。

## 全球健康承诺与个人领导力

**Nicolai Tangen:** We we touched on on on pricing here, but um Novartis is ranked number one in in the access to medicines index. Um tell us about your your commitment to global health generally.
**讲述者:** 我们在这里提到了定价，但诺华在药物可及性指数中排名第一。 请告诉我们你们对全球健康的整体承诺。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah. I mean, look, I started as a as a global health uh physician deeply passionate about, you know, that personally. I've worked on as you mentioned malaria, TB, HIV, AIDS. So, that's a passion project of mine. Now the reason you know we're really I think viewed as a leader in access is we not only provide access to our efforts in tropical diseases where malaria leprosy and related conditions we made it a priority uh you know seven eight years ago to say we want to provide access to our latest innovations as fast as possible in low-income countries to when we provide access in high-income countries. We do that through a variety of different mechanisms, emerging market brands, uh other approaches that that hopefully get these medicines to more and more patients and that allows us to have much more reach perhaps than many of our of our peers and I take great pride in that. So you can get a Novartist uh hematology medicine or heart failure medicine or immunology medicine uh anywhere in the world and we we figure out access programs so that no patient gets left behind in many of these diseases.
**讲述者:** 是的。 我的意思是，你看，我最初是一名全球健康医生，个人对这个领域充满热情。 我曾参与你提到的疟疾、肺结核、艾滋病的工作。 所以，那是我热衷的项目。 现在，我们之所以被视为药物可及性领域的领导者，是因为我们不仅在疟疾、麻风病及相关疾病等热带疾病领域提供药物，而且在七八年前，我们就将一个目标定为优先事项，即以最快的速度向低收入国家提供我们最新的创新药物，就像我们在高收入国家提供药物一样。 我们通过各种不同的机制来实现这一点，包括新兴市场品牌以及其他方法，希望能将这些药物带给越来越多的患者，这使得我们可能比许多同行拥有更广泛的覆盖范围，我对此深感自豪。 所以你可以在世界任何地方获得诺华的血液病药物、心力衰竭药物或免疫学药物，我们都会制定可及性方案，确保在许多这些疾病中没有患者被遗漏。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Moving on to leadership. Um, what's the most fun part of your job?
**讲述者:** 谈到领导力。 你工作中最有趣的部分是什么？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I think interacting with people around the world. I mean, I think about this year, I've already been, you know, I've been in Japan, I've been in China, um, I've been all across Europe, in the in the US, and interacting with our people. And that's an evolution. I mean, I would have said, I think earlier on in my time, I love the science and the most fun part of my job is that IMB meeting and being involved in all the scientific decisions. But, you know, now that I'm in year eight, I realize so much of this role is providing energy to the people. You have to I mean, you're the chief energy officer and you have to give energy. You have to build belief. Um, and that comes through human interaction in the end. Uh, and that's what really powers a company to navigate all of the challenges that that we have. Uh, so that that's definitely what gives me the most energy.
**讲述者:** 我认为与世界各地的人们互动。 我的意思是，想想今年，我已经去过日本、中国，嗯，我走遍了欧洲和美国，与我们的人交流。 这是一种进化。 我的意思是，我想我早些时候会说，我热爱科学，我工作中最大的乐趣是参加 IMB（创新管理委员会）会议并参与所有的科学决策。 但你知道，现在我已经是第八年了，我意识到这个角色很大一部分是为人们提供能量。 你必须，我的意思是，你是首席能量官，你必须给予能量。 你必须建立信念。 最终，这都来自于人际互动。 这才是真正推动公司应对我们面临的所有挑战的力量。 所以，那无疑是给我最多能量的。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Have you always been the energy officer?
**讲述者:** 你一直是“能量官”吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** No, I don't think so. I've learned I've learned so much. You know, how do you learn how do you learn to How do you learn to be an energy officer?
**讲述者:** 不，我不这么认为。 我学到了很多。 你知道，你如何学习如何成为一名“能量官”？

**Vas Narasimhan:** You know, I've I've I've had great coaches. I've had to I think um really reflect on what does the role mean? I mean, so much of giving energy is having energy. So, I you know, whole approach around mindset, movement, nutrition, recovery for myself to make sure I can show up every day um with energy. But I also think the unlock is when you realize that leadership is really about the possibilities you create for your teams and the people around you. Leadership is not about the org chart. It's not about the hierarchies. It's about the possibilities that you create. And if you make that mental jump, then you realize it's all about the energy you give, possibilities you can create. Um, and then it becomes of course a, you know, self self-fulfilling cycle. You feel the energy, you give the energy. Um, and I think that was a certainly a big jump for me over my leadership journey.
**讲述者:** 我有过很棒的教练。 我不得不，我认为，真正反思这个角色意味着什么？ 我的意思是，给予能量很大一部分是要拥有能量。 所以，你知道，我整个方法都围绕着心态、运动、营养、恢复，确保我每天都能充满活力地出现。 但我也认为，关键在于当你意识到领导力实际上是关于你为你的团队和你周围的人创造的可能性时。 领导力无关组织结构图。 它无关层级。 它关乎你所创造的可能性。 如果你做出了这种思维上的飞跃，你就会意识到这都是关于你所给予的能量，以及你能创造的可能性。 然后，这当然会成为一个自我实现的循环。 你感受到能量，你给予能量。 我认为这无疑是我领导旅程中的一次巨大飞跃。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Did you have a particular moment where it became clearer to you?
**讲述者:** 有没有哪个特定的时刻让你对此有了更清晰的认识？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, I mean I think I don't know if there was a particular moment, but there were definitely moments where I think my old leadership model was not working. I mean, I started out as a very technical, very intelligent kind of know-it-all leader. There was a point you hit a wall, especially when you're in front of sales forces and you have to inspire and motivate a team that has to walk into a doctor's office and get, you know, basically told no 10 times uh and then hopefully get the one yes. Different leadership, different approach. and I led R&D organizations where you have to get people to motivate through failure. Only one out of six, seven, eight projects succeed and uh you got to motivate people through that. So I think with each one of these experiences I've adapted and tried to learn how to lead lead better. I think of myself as a always as being a student of leadership.
**讲述者:** 是的，我的意思是，我不知道是否有某个特定的时刻，但肯定有一些时刻，我意识到我旧的领导模式行不通了。 我的意思是，我一开始是一个非常技术化、非常聪明、什么都懂的领导者。 有时候你会撞墙，特别是当你面对销售团队，你必须激励和鼓舞一个团队，他们必须走进医生办公室，基本上被拒绝 10 次，然后希望能得到一次“是”。 不同的领导力，不同的方法。 我领导过研发组织，你必须让人们在失败中保持积极性。 六、七、八个项目中只有一个成功，你必须通过这个过程来激励人们。 所以我认为，通过每一次这些经历，我都适应并努力学习如何更好地领导。 我认为自己永远是领导力的学生。

**Nicolai Tangen:** I mean how do you keep working on it getting better?
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，你如何持续在这方面努力并变得更好？

**Vas Narasimhan:** There's no destination on that leadership journey, but you have to keep asking yourself how can you adjust and get better at at this.
**讲述者:** 在领导力之旅中没有终点，但你必须不断问自己如何调整并在这方面变得更好。

**Nicolai Tangen:** But I mean, did you transform from like a nerdy introvert to to the extrovert you are today or I think I'm still probably a nerdy introvert at heart.
**讲述者:** 但我的意思是，你是否从一个书呆子般的内向者转变为今天的外向者，或者说我心里可能仍然是一个书呆子般的内向者。

**Vas Narasimhan:** I would probably Well, you hiding it well, read books. Yeah, exactly. I think I've learned to be more more adaptable uh and and sort of uh you know, see see how best to bring I think the best out of every situation. Um I don't know if there was a moment, but certainly the CEO job pushes you, right? it pushes you in directions because you're immediately, you know, thrust in front of so many different stakeholders u and learning the language of those different stakeholders, learning how to navigate all those different stakeholders. Um you have to fail at it as you go and hopefully you learn and get better and better and I think that's that's how the process obviously unfolds.
**讲述者:** 我可能会……嗯，你隐藏得很好，多读书。 是的，没错。 我认为我已经学会了更强的适应能力，并且能够更好地从每种情况中发挥出最佳状态。 我不知道是否有某个特定的时刻，但首席执行官的工作无疑会推动你，对吧？ 它会把你推向不同的方向，因为你立即就会面对这么多不同的利益相关者，学习这些不同利益相关者的语言，学习如何驾驭所有这些不同的利益相关者。 你在实践中肯定会犯错，但希望你能从中学习并变得越来越好，我认为这就是这个过程的自然发展方式。

**Nicolai Tangen:** You mentioned um the importance of uh being energized yourself. Where do you get your energy from?
**讲述者:** 你提到了让自己充满活力的重要性。 你的能量来自哪里？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, I think I think our a few things. I think our people gives me a tremendous uh energy. So interacting interacting with them, you know, I I believe so deeply in the work that we do. I I always still I still when I see a clinical trial result, which I'm very fortunate to be with the one of the first ones to see and it ultimately a medicine that worked in a phase three clinical trials, I cry because it is so hard to do what we do. This is the collective work of thousands of people around the globe likely for over a decade and then we get a result where we actually move the needle for patients with a disease and then it you know you say let's keep going right in the face of whatever setbacks that you have that gives you energy. Uh letters from patients I'm very fortunate to get letters from patients who are are medicines uh whose lives they've transformed. I mean all of these things give you that little jolt, that little push to fight through some of the more trying moments of being a CEO.
**讲述者:** 是的，我认为有几点。 我认为我们的人民给了我巨大的能量。 所以与他们互动，你知道，我深深相信我们所做的工作。 我总是，我仍然会，当我看到临床试验结果时，我很幸运能成为最早看到结果的人之一，如果最终一种药物在三期临床试验中奏效了，我就会哭，因为我们所做的事情太难了。 这是全球数千人可能超过十年集体努力的成果，然后我们得到了一个结果，我们真正地为患有疾病的患者带来了改变，然后你就会说，让我们继续前进，无论你遇到什么挫折，这都会给你能量。 患者来信，我非常幸运能收到患者的来信，他们的生活因为我们的药物而改变了。 我的意思是，所有这些都能给你一点冲击，一点推动力，让你能够度过作为首席执行官的一些更艰难的时刻。

**Nicolai Tangen:** But you mentioned also your own you you mentioned also your own physical health and so on just uh and nutrition and what are the kind of things you are particularly Oh yeah.
**讲述者:** 但你也提到了你自己的身体健康等等，还有营养方面，你特别关注哪些方面？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah. So look I I I got taught very early on from my uh a coach that I work with today named Scott Pelton this this this approach mindset, movement, nutrition and recovery and I stick with it. Um so mindset you know clearly mindfulness meditation observing yourself observing why you think the things you think why you feel the things you do uh and then setting yourself up in the right mindset each day and for each interaction or each moment uh even when I have to show up on the in good company podcast. Um you know nutrition you know I think you have to think why do you eat the things you eat and how you eat will affect your performance even in small ways. So something I always think about obviously movement I mean exercise has a lot of impact on the nervous system. Over the years I've learned that exercise can reset your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. By the way so much of leadership comes down to managing your nervous system. You're likely not going to make a good decision when you're on high sympathetic drive. When you're more balanced parasitic sympathetic, you're more likely to get all the inputs that you need. So observing that in yourself uh is is hugely important. And then recovery. I've learned over the years the power of sleep. I mean, I'm obsessed with trying to optimize my sleep. I've got, you know, technology, sleep technology, sleep supplements, all kinds of things to really say, how can I get seven plus hours of very high quality sleep and and recover and all of those things compound over time and then give you the energy you need.
**讲述者:** 是的。 早期，我的教练斯科特·佩尔顿（Scott Pelton）就教会了我这种方法：心态、运动、营养和恢复，我一直坚持着。 所以，心态方面，你知道，显然是正念冥想，观察自己，观察你为什么会有那些想法，为什么会有那些感受，然后每天为自己设定正确的心态，为每一次互动或每一个时刻都做好准备，即使我必须出现在《In Good Company》播客上。 营养方面，你知道，我认为你必须思考你为什么吃你吃的东西，以及你如何吃会影响你的表现，即使是微小的方面。 所以我总是在思考运动。 运动对神经系统有很大影响。 多年来我了解到，运动可以重置你的交感神经系统和副交感神经系统。 顺便说一句，很多领导力都归结为管理你的神经系统。 当你处于高度交感神经兴奋状态时，你很可能做不出好的决策。 当你处于更平衡的副交感神经状态时，你更有可能获得所需的所有输入。 所以观察你自己这一点非常重要。 然后是恢复。 多年来我学会了睡眠的力量。 我的意思是，我痴迷于尝试优化我的睡眠。 我有睡眠技术、睡眠补充剂，各种各样的东西，来真正地问自己，我怎样才能获得七小时以上的高质量睡眠并恢复，所有这些东西都会随着时间的推移而累积，然后给你提供你所需的能量。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, you're very thoughtful about these things. When do you wake up in the morning?
**讲述者:** 嗯，你对这些事情考虑得很周到。 你早上什么时候醒来？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I wake up 5:30 every day.
**讲述者:** 我每天早上 5 点半醒来。

**Nicolai Tangen:** What's the magic ingredient uh that you eat? What is your most kind of strange thing that you eat?
**讲述者:** 你吃的“神奇成分”是什么？ 你吃的最奇怪的东西是什么？

**Vas Narasimhan:** Strange thing that I eat? Um, if there's anything strange, I'm a lifelong vegetarian, so I've never had meat in my life. So, you know, that may be strange, maybe not so strange. Obviously, there's many.
**讲述者:** 我吃的奇怪的东西？ 嗯，如果有什么奇怪的，我是一个终生素食者，所以我一生中从未吃过肉。 所以，你知道，那可能很奇怪，也可能不那么奇怪。 显然，有很多。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, I mean, I mean, a lot of people in Well, I mean, India has a lot of vegetar, you know, I mean, it's very common, right? And your parent. Yeah, it is. It is. It is. Yeah. Absolutely. You know, nothing nothing really strange.
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，印度有很多素食者，我的意思是，这很常见，对吧？ 还有你的父母。 是的，确实如此。 真的。 绝对是。 你知道，没什么特别奇怪的。

**Vas Narasimhan:** I mean, I I I eat whey protein every morning. Two scoops of whey protein every day. It's kind of a a way I start my day. Um, nothing else magical I can think of. I mean, I do I do I do try some of the uh the various supplements like ashwagandha and some of this stuff I have. It's probably all a placebo effect, but nonetheless, I I definitely I definitely test these things out.
**讲述者:** 我的意思是，我每天早上都吃乳清蛋白。 每天两勺乳清蛋白。 这就是我开始新的一天的方式。 嗯，我想不到其他什么神奇的东西了。 我的意思是，我确实会尝试一些各种补充剂，比如南非醉茄（ashwagandha）和一些我有的东西。 这可能都是安慰剂效应，但尽管如此，我肯定会尝试这些东西。

## 诺华的企业文化与领导力风格

**Nicolai Tangen:** How would you define the corporate culture at Novartis?
**讲述者:** 你会如何定义诺华的企业文化？

**Vas Narasimhan:** you know we we we call it inspired curious and unboss and that that was something that we put together in 2017 when I first started and we stuck with it and it's very much grounded actually in work by uh many psychologists who really understood for for knowledge workers three things really motivate knowledge workers a sense of purpose so that's inspired a sense of growth and learning and a sense of they're improving theself that's curiosity and a sense of autonomy so can you create kind of an unbossed environment with the appropriate, you know, uh, guide rails and objectives. So, that's what we set up to out to do. It was very bumpy. We came from a very top- down, you know, much more hierarchical culture. Um, I think we've made a lot of progress, but we still debate it. And I always tell my people, it's great that we debate it. And as long as we're debating the culture, the culture is probably getting better and we're probably thinking about how we want to interact with one another. But those are the three key elements and we stick with it.
**讲述者:** 你知道，我们称之为“受启发、好奇和无老板”（inspired, curious and unboss），这是我们 2017 年我刚开始时就确立并一直坚持的，它实际上是基于许多心理学家的研究，他们真正理解对于知识工作者来说，有三件事能真正激励他们：目标感，即受启发；成长和学习感，即好奇心；以及自主感，即你能否在适当的指导和目标下创造一种“无老板”的环境。 所以，这就是我们设定的目标。 这过程非常坎坷。 我们来自一个非常自上而下、更加层级化的文化。 我认为我们取得了很大进步，但我们仍在争论。 我总是告诉我的团队，我们能够争论文化是件好事。 只要我们还在争论文化，文化就可能正在变得更好，我们也可能正在思考我们希望如何彼此互动。 但这些是三个关键要素，我们坚持它们。

**Nicolai Tangen:** But I mean unbossed that doesn't sound very Swiss.
**讲述者:** 但我的意思是，“无老板”听起来不怎么像瑞士风格。

**Vas Narasimhan:** No, actually I think it's Scandinavian. So actually you guys probably should take the take the take the credit for it. The idea is but the idea is um you know can you it's more of a servant leader empowered culture. So can you actually create ownership at every level of the organization uh where the leader is creating the environment removing obstacles creating clarity and you and that's some of the things I learned. I mean UNBOS initially was really misinterpreted. It was kind of interpreted as anarchy or and people can do whatever they want. Actually, what we want to say is we have clear objectives, clear goals, but we want to create this high support, high challenge environment. You're supported. You got to make your own calls, but we challenge. We hold accountability and we expect results. And if you can get that right, it really really drives performance. and snap and I look at the last you know three three four years we've been at the top of the league tables on TSR and growth um so it's paid off but it's been a long journey for sure
**讲述者:** 不，实际上我认为它是斯堪的纳维亚风格的。 所以实际上你们应该为此邀功。 这个想法是，它更像是一种仆人式领导（servant leader）的授权文化。 所以你是否真的能在组织的每个层面创造主人翁意识，领导者创造环境，消除障碍，创造清晰度，这些都是我学到的一些东西。 我的意思是，“无老板”最初被严重误解了。 它被解读为无政府状态，人们可以随心所欲。 实际上，我们想说的是，我们有明确的目标，明确的使命，但我们想创造一个高度支持、高度挑战的环境。 你得到支持。 你必须自己做决定，但我们会提出挑战。 我们承担责任，我们期望结果。 如果你能做到这一点，它真的能极大地推动绩效。 如果我看看过去三四年，我们一直在总股东回报率（TSR）和增长方面的排行榜上名列前茅，所以它已经取得了回报，但这无疑是一段漫长的旅程。

**Nicolai Tangen:** India has produced some of the most impressive leaders we have in the world today uh has your your Indian background you think informed your leadership style in any way
**讲述者:** 印度培养了当今世界上一些最令人印象深刻的领导人，你认为你的印度背景在任何方面影响了你的领导风格吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** I do I think I think yes I mean I was I was raised uh kind of very phil in a very philosophical environment um my grandparents and my parents uh all all deeply Hindu but also always trying to uh expose us to philosophical thinking and so even to this day I would say some of the best leadership books are books like the Bhagavat Gita or the Dao Ching which really talk about servant leadership or finding a sense of purpose and and and direction. So I think it certainly had a very strong guide. I think also when you observe immigrant parents who have to come up and and fight for everything from where they come from very little and living that experience I think certainly you know builds resilience and determination as as a child for sure.
**讲述者:** 我认为是的。 我的意思是，我是在一个非常哲学化的环境中长大的，我的祖父母和父母都是虔诚的印度教徒，但他们也总是试图让我们接触哲学思想。 所以即使到现在，我也会说一些最好的领导力书籍是像《薄伽梵歌》（Bhagavat Gita）或《道德经》（Dao Ching）这样的书，它们真正谈论的是仆人式领导（servant leadership）或寻找目标感和方向。 所以我认为它无疑提供了一个非常强大的指引。 我认为当你观察移民父母时，他们必须白手起家，为一切而奋斗，从一无所有的地方来到这里，经历这样的生活，我认为这无疑能培养孩子的韧性和决心。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well in India even the gods have to be humble. Are you um are you humble? Am I humble?
**讲述者:** 在印度，甚至神灵都必须谦逊。 你谦逊吗？ 我谦逊吗？

**Vas Narasimhan:** That's like a trick question. I sometimes feel like I think I try to be I try to be humble. I try to, let's say, keep my feet rooted in the ground. I think one of the hardest things as as a CEO is it's easy to get lost in all of it, right? It's easy to think um not separate who you are as a person with the role. It's a role, right? It's a role we have the honor to play for a period of time in our lives, but it's not not who you are. So, you have to keep staying grounded. I think family is super important. I have an incredible wife, great kids, great parents that keep me grounded. Uh but you have to stay grounded otherwise these roles can you know build up an ego um and and you get really lost. There's a great book about this actually called the power paradox um from yeah Dr. Kelner and he talks about how unchecked you know power will you will lose your empathy considerations you'll lose your understanding of humility um and you'll lose the very things that actually afforded you the opportunity to be a leader ironically yeah it's a I agree it's a very very um it's a very good book um now um what do you read I'm I'm a big non-fiction reader um you know right now I'm I'm working my way through Nexus uh from Uvil Noah Harari.
**讲述者:** 这就像一个陷阱问题。 我有时觉得自己努力做到谦逊。 我努力，比如说，脚踏实地。 我认为作为首席执行官最困难的事情之一是很容易迷失在这一切中，对吧？ 很容易认为你作为一个人与这个角色无法分开。 这只是一个角色，对吧？ 这是一个我们有幸在生命中扮演一段时间的角色，但它不是你。 所以，你必须保持脚踏实地。 我认为家庭非常重要。 我有一个很棒的妻子，很棒的孩子，很棒的父母，他们让我保持脚踏实地。 但你必须保持脚踏实地，否则这些角色会让你产生自我，然后你会真正迷失。 有一本关于这个的非常好的书叫做《权力悖论》（Power Paradox），来自凯尔纳博士（Dr. Keltner），他谈到不受约束的权力如何让你失去同理心，失去对谦逊的理解，讽刺的是，你会失去那些真正让你有机会成为领导者的东西。 是的，我同意，那是一本非常非常好的书。 那么，你读什么书？ 我是一个非虚构类书籍的忠实读者。 现在我正在读尤瓦尔·诺亚·赫拉利（Yuval Noah Harari）的《智人：人类简史》（Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind）系列中的《枢纽》（Nexus）。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Um you know I think uh very interesting author and often you know great great insights from from those books. Um so you know I love I love you know science uh and non-fiction books. Um, some I mean probably my my favorite uh one of my favorite books is uh Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker which is grounded in the data that we live despite all of the challenges we read about in the newsfeed we live in the greatest moment in human history and if we can remind ourselves of that and keep building on that on a science-based way not easy in today's world um yeah that's that's where progress lies and and talking of which um last question what advice would you to young people.
**讲述者:** 你知道，我认为他是一位非常有趣的作家，他的书通常能提供非常深刻的见解。 所以，你知道，我喜欢科学和非虚构类书籍。 其中，我最喜欢的一本书是史蒂芬·平克（Steven Pinker）的《当下的启蒙》（Enlightenment Now），这本书以数据为基础，告诉我们尽管新闻中充满了各种挑战，但我们生活在人类历史上最伟大的时刻。 如果我们能提醒自己这一点，并以科学的方式在此基础上继续前进——这在当今世界并不容易——那么，进步就在于此。 说到这个，最后一个问题，你会给年轻人什么建议？

## 给年轻人的建议

**Vas Narasimhan:** Yeah, I I think I wish not one piece of advice but a few pieces of advice. One, build range, build breath and experience early on. I mean, try to get diverse experiences. It's so tempting and I fell into the trap of wanting to race up the ladder and actually it's such a and Novartis actually ended ended up pushing me into all kinds of lateral directions in in R&D in marketing in manufacturing and all of those experiences actually now enable me to do the job that I have right now though I didn't realize it at the time. So I think building range and getting different experiences, functions, geographies, uh even things you may not expect. You'll always learn something if you go in with an open, curious mindset. Um I think too, you know, there's not it's not a race. I mean, it feels like it's a race. It's not a race in the end. You you got to enjoy the whole process of whatever direction. And there's no plan. I never expected to be a CEO. Most of my career moves were not the plan that I actually had, frankly. they ended up going in a different direction. Um, so there's no plan. It's not a race. You got to you've got It sounds cliche, but you've got to find a way to be in the moment of the journey while still obviously pushing pushing yourself uh forward and then find great sponsors. You got I mean, I would not be where I am today if some people did not take huge bets on me. And you need to find those sponsors.
**讲述者:** 我希望不是一条建议，而是几条建议。 第一，尽早培养广度、深度和经验。 我的意思是，尝试获得多样化的经验。 追求快速晋升的诱惑太大了，我也曾陷入那个陷阱，但实际上，诺华最终推动我在研发、营销和制造等各个领域进行横向发展，而所有这些经历现在都使我能够胜任我现在的工作，尽管当时我并没有意识到这一点。 所以我认为，培养广度和获得不同的经验，包括职能、地域，甚至是你可能意想不到的事情，都非常重要。 如果你带着开放、好奇的心态去尝试，你总会学到一些东西。 我也认为，你知道，这不是一场比赛。 我的意思是，感觉像是一场比赛。 但最终它不是一场比赛。 你必须享受整个过程，无论它走向何方。 而且没有计划。 我从未想过要成为一名首席执行官。 老实说，我职业生涯中的大部分变动都不是我原本的计划。 它们最终走向了不同的方向。 所以，没有计划。 这不是一场比赛。 你必须，你必须，这听起来很老套，但你必须找到一种方式，在旅程中活在当下，同时显然还要推动自己向前，然后找到优秀的引路人。 我的意思是，如果没有一些人对我押下重注，我就不会有今天。 你需要找到那些引路人。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, uh, Vas, I can easily understand why people have taken uh, huge uh, bets on you. Uh you you clearly have the range, you enjoy what you do and and you are in the moment and uh a very very impressive CEO. So big thanks for for being with us today and all the best going forward.
**讲述者:** 嗯，瓦斯，我很容易理解为什么人们会对你押下重注。 你显然具备广度，你享受你所做的事情，而且你活在当下，你是一位非常非常令人印象深刻的首席执行官。 所以非常感谢你今天与我们在一起，祝你未来一切顺利。

**Vas Narasimhan:** Thank you so much, Sinclair. It's an honor to be here. Thank you.
**讲述者:** 非常感谢，辛克莱。 很高兴能来到这里。 谢谢你。
