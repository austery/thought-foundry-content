title: 从“佐兰经济学”看正统与异端经济思想的演变
summary: 本访谈深入探讨了新古典经济学作为主流经济学正统的形成过程及其局限性，并将其与古典政治经济学和制度主义经济学进行对比。嘉宾强调经济学应与社会、历史和政治现实相结合，而非将其视为脱离现实的“机器”。讨论触及了市场失灵、政府干预、社会成本以及政策制定中的民主原则，并以住房政策和税收为例，探讨了异端经济思想在解决实际问题中的应用，同时分析了美国与欧洲在经济政策传统上的差异。

### 纽约市长与经济政策挑战

**Jill Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听《奇思妙想》播客的又一期节目。我是**Jill Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Jill Weisenthal

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，今天是1月28日。我觉得我们纽约市的新市长，他虽然没做什么大事，但暴风雪似乎应对得相当不错，没有造成太多大的混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Tracy, it's January 28th. I think our new mayor in here in New York City, I mean, he hasn't done much, but the snowstorm seemed to go fairly well. Not too many big disruptions.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我当时不在，但你能够四处走动，走出公寓。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I wasn't here, but you were able to walk around, get out of your apartment.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 有几位市长因为无法应对暴风雪而声誉扫地，所以他似乎通过了第一次考验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: There have been several mayors whose like entire reputation failed because they couldn't handle a snowstorm and so he seems to have passed the first test. So, I

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我得说，这对于纽约市长来说门槛有点低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: it feels like a low bar for New York mayors. I got to say

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我猜，如果我们看看，我同意这门槛很低，但另一方面，这就像是新政府的第一次大考，似乎做得不错。不过，我并不认为**佐兰·多尼 (Zoran Donni)** 政府最终会以除雪能力来评判，历史可能不会这样记住他的表现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: my guess is if we looked at uh I agree it is a low bar but on the other hand it's like okay first big test of the new administration seems to be doing well. I don't think however ultimately the Zoran Donni administration will be judged on snow removal like this is not going to be how history probably remembers how well

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 不，他当然不是因为除雪能力而当选的。尽管我确实看到了他拿着铲子铲雪的视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: no and he certainly wasn't elected on his snow removal capabilities. Although I did see the videos of him, you know, getting his shovel out and

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 他太擅长零售政治了。那真是太棒了，他在这方面做得太好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: he's so good at like retail politics. Like that was like such he was so good at that. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但说到考验，我是说，接下来会有更大的考验，对吧？主要集中在经济政策方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But speaking of tests, I mean there are bigger tests coming up, right? Mostly concentrated in the economic policies here,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？我想我们知道，当然我们也和他谈过，纽约市的**可负担性**问题显然是竞选活动中最重要的核心议题之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right? I think we know like sort of and of course we talked to him but like the affordability question in New York City clearly central one of the if the most central topic in the campaign

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我想说的是，他提出的一些想法，虽然不是全部，但至少有少数是那种经济学家会讨厌的想法。特别是任何政府干预租金的措施，比如租金管制之类的想法，在经济学家中可能没有比这更令人讨厌的了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and what I would say is that the very most not all of them but at least a handful of the ideas that he has proposed are the types of ideas that like economists hate them right so especially anything where the government is intervening in rent the idea of like I there might not be a more hated idea among economists than anything that smacks rent control or anything like that.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？所以，我对实际的经济理论及其随时间发展的方式了解不多。但我确实知道一件事，那就是我们今天看到的许多传统经济理论，比如**新古典经济理论**的先驱或祖先是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Right? So I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to actual economic theory and how it's developed over time. But one thing I do know is that you know the sort of forerunner or ancestor of a lot of traditional economic theory that we see today like neoclassical economic theory

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **亚当·斯密 (Adam Smith)**，对吧？谈论的是市场的**自由之手**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Adam Smith right talking about like the free hand of the market

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 以及如果市场运作良好，一切都应该没问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: and how if the market is functioning like everything should be fine right

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，而且我认为，即使是那些几乎所有但最真正的**自由放任 (laissez-faire)** 经济学家也会说，有些领域他们称之为**市场失灵 (market failure)**，对吧？在某些情况下，我们可能不能指望市场来完成这项工作。他们可能会说，比如“哦，拥有私人消防部门真的没有意义。”尽管有些人确实提出了私人消防部门，但即使是那些最真正的自由主义或新古典经济学的信徒，他们也会说，“哦，是的，确实存在市场失灵。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: yeah and and I think like economists even like you know almost all but the most sort of true hardcore less afair economists would say that there are areas that you know they call market failure, right? There are certain situations in which maybe we can't expect markets to do the job. Maybe they'd say like, "Oh, it really doesn't make sense to have like private fire departments for example." Although some people actually do propose private fire departments, but yeah, you know, even the most sort of like true believers sort of liberal or neoclassical economics, they're like, "Oh yeah, well there are market failures,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？在这种情况下，政府应该...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right? In which case the government should

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 然后就有了政府的角色，但只有在市场失灵的情况下，除非你定义某个领域，比如“好的，市场在这个特定领域不起作用是有原因的”，但在限定了少数这些情况之后，就会觉得“好的，尽可能地，你就是想让它们...”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and then there is a role but only in failure that it unless you that you like define some area it's like okay there is a reason why markets don't work for this particular area but that after then sandboxing a few of those things then it's like okay as much as possible you just want to you want to let them

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 别干预。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: out don't interfere

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 让**价格信号 (price signals)** 发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: let the price signals do their work.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。所以这已经成为，我猜，正统观念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah. So this has become I guess the orthodoxy.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。而**马达尼 (Madani)** 很大程度上属于...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. And Mumani is very much in the

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 异端。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: the heterodox.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **异端 (heterodox)**。是的。当人们谈论——当经济学家谈论他们不喜欢的政策时，这个词总是会出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: The heterodox. Yeah. That's a word that always comes up when people are talking about well when economists are talking about policies that they don't like.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 没错。没错。这是一个委婉的说法，指那些他们不喜欢的政策，他们会说，“哦，不。至少有少数人会佩戴那个徽章。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: That's right. [laughter] That's right. It's a euphemism for policies that they they're like, "Oh, no. At least a handful of people wear that badgely."

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 但这些历史，它们是如何成为正统的呢？等等，对吧？它不像万有引力定律，对吧？或者地球是圆的，这些都是有充分理由的正统观念。有些人不相信地球是圆的，但我们有充分的理由相信它是圆的。那些不相信地球是圆的人，他们不是异端，他们是怪人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But like these history, how did they become the orthodoxy, etc., right? Like it's not like the law of gravity, right? Or that the earth is round, which are orthodox ideas for a good reason. There are some people who don't believe that the earth is round, but they're like I think we it's pretty good. We have good reason to believe it. And there the people who don't believe that the earth is round, they're not heterodox, they're cranks,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？对。这就像是有一种区别。那些是怪人。那么，这些正统观念是从哪里来的呢？为什么有些想法会被归入异端或其他类别呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right? Right. Like that's like there's sort of a difference. Those are cranks. And so, but where did these orthodoxies emerge from? How did some ideas get shunted into the category of heterodoxy or whatever?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 它们又是如何演变的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And how did they evolve?

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我不知道。我是说，我读过一些关于过去的书，但对这方面了解不多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I have no idea. Like I mean, I've read a little bit about the past, but uh this is not much I don't know much about this.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们应该谈谈。我们应该，特别是因为我们的新市长实际上可能会推行一些关于经济管理的异端思想。总之，我非常高兴地说，我们确实请到了最合适的嘉宾。我们将与**Jamee Moudud**交谈。他是**莎拉劳伦斯学院 (Sarah Lawrence College)** 的经济学教授，也是**法律与政治经济学集体 (Law and Political Economy Collective)** 的董事会成员，他写了很多关于这些主题的文章，包括一些经济思想的**思想史 (intellectual history)**。所以，**Jamee**，非常感谢你来到**Oblad**。非常感谢你和**Tracy**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: We should talk about it. We should, especially because I our new mayor may in fact pursue some heterodox ideas about economic management. Anyway, I'm very excited to say we really do have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Johnny Modude. He is a professor of economics at Sarah Lawrence College, also a board member of the law and political economy collective and he's written a lot about these topics including sort of the intellectual history of some of these economic ideas. So, uh, Jamie, thank you so much for coming on Oblad. Thank you so much and Tracy.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你最近在**莎拉劳伦斯学院**教孩子们什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: What kind of stuff are you teaching the kids at Sarah Lawrence these days?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 有趣的是，我教授**经济理论与政策导论 (Introduction to Economic Theory and Policy)**，这是一个为期一年的讲座，它实际上处理了一些核心问题：市场、货币、货币体系等等。我实际上也教**计量经济学 (econometrics)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So the interesting thing is I teach introduction to economic theory and policy which is a year-long lecture and that actually deals with some of these central questions markets money the monetary system and so on and I actually teach econometrics.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你说“实际上”是因为人们不期望这种非正统的思想家会真的去处理数字和技术性的东西。所以你这样说很有趣，因为我在经济计量学中确实教的一件事就是**方法 (method)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: When you say actually it's because like people don't expect the sort of unorthodox thinker to like actually [laughter] do the numbers the technical stuff. So it's interesting that you posed that way because one of the things that I do teach in econ econometrics is method

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 就像，你知道，当你不仅仅是处理数字，而是从哪里获取这些数字时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: like you know like when you're it's not just about number crunching but where do you get the numbers from?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 是的。所以，当我们试图理解社会和经济现实时，将这些方法问题编织进去，这使得经济学训练非常扎实。你知道，这些方法问题被编织到理论的构建中。是的。这在一定程度上影响了我的教学方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Yeah. And so like weaving in these questions of method as we're trying to understand social and economic reality is it makes for a solid training in economics and you know so those questions of method woven into the construction of theory. Yeah. That kind of informs the way I teach

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 以及这为什么重要，不仅仅是一种智力练习，而是为什么它对实际问题很重要，就像你们刚才谈论的那样。所以，他确实是完美的嘉宾。也许我们先从定义一些术语开始。你知道，**Joe**和我的**新古典经济思想**总结可能很糟糕，但在你看来，什么是**正统 (orthodoxy)**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and why that matters not just as kind of a an intellectual exercise but why that matters for practical issues like what you what you guys were talking about. So truly the perfect guest. Maybe just to begin with, we could perhaps define our terms a little bit. You know, Joe and I gave a probably terrible summary of neoclassical economic thought, but in your mind, what is the orthodoxy?

</details>

### 经济学正统的定义

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以，**正统**就是**新古典经济学**。它源于一种思想传统，所以如果我可能与你关于**亚当·斯密**的说法有所不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So the orthodoxy is neoclassical economics. It comes from an intellectual tradition which so if I may differ a little bit with what you said about Adam Smith

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: **亚当·斯密**并不是**新古典经济学**的先驱。“**看不见的手 (invisible hand)**”这个表达，事实上，我每次都让我的学生做这个实验，因为**《国富论》(The Wealth of Nations)** 是一本800页的书，其中“**看不见的手**”这个表达出现了多少次？只有一次。所以这里的重点是，对于市场和资本主义是什么，曾经有一种更古老的观念，这种观念在1920年代和1930年代再次复兴，我稍后会谈到。但那种更古老的观念，被称为**古典政治经济学 (classical political economy)**，它没有对人类行为做出任何假设，比如人类天生是理性的，市场在充分就业时以最佳方式运作，知识或多或少是完美的——这些都不是**古典政治经济学**的假设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Adam Smith is not the forerunner of neoclassical economics the expression invisible hand in fact I have my students do this experiment every time because it's an 800page book the wealth of nations how many times does the expression invisible hand appear there once so the point here is that there there was an older idea of what markets and of capitalism are and that gets revived again in the 1920s and 30s and I'll talk about that later but that older idea which is called classical political economy did not make any assumptions about human behavior that human beings are inherently rational that markets behave in this optimal manner at full employment that would be neoclassical economics right that knowledge is more or less perfect there was none of that

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你指的是**新古典经济学**之前的**古典经济学**。没错。或者说说我们这里指的是哪些年份和哪些思想家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: you talk into the classical economics prior to neoclassical. Exactly. Or talk what years and what thinkers are we talking about here.

</details>

### 古典政治经济学与制度主义

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以，你知道，我们可以谈谈**亚当·斯密**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So let you know we could just talk about Adam Smith.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的。哦，是的。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Okay. Oh yeah. Great.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 在某种程度上还有**大卫·李嘉图 (David Ricardo)**、**卡尔·马克思 (Karl Marx)**、**重农主义者 (the physiocrats)**。我是说，你有很多不同范围的作者，他们在意识形态上不一定一致，但他们对资本主义有一个共同的愿景，所以经济学最初的名字是**政治经济学 (political economy)**，这意味着你不能在不同时考虑政治的情况下谈论经济问题，而且这些人中有许多实际上受过法律培训，所以法律在构建经济中的作用问题，这种思想一直潜藏在这种知识传统中。其中一个含义是，经济不是某种自然的、跨历史的制度或事物，而是历史的深刻产物。我认为这就是巨大分歧产生的地方，因为如果你教授或研究**新古典经济学**，它的教学方式是把经济视为某种永恒的、几乎是自然主义的东西，因此...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: To some extent David Ricardo, Karl Marx, the physiocrats. I mean so you had a range of authors in a wide range you know who ideologically not necessarily on the same page but they had a vision of capitalism which so the original name of economics was political econ economy and that meant that you you cannot really talk about economic questions without thinking simultaneously about politics and many of these folks were actually trained in law so the question of law's role in structuring the economy. This kind of lurks in that intellectual tradition. And one of the implications was that the economy is not some natural transhistorical institution or thing but is profoundly a product of history. And I think that's where the big split arises because if you teach or if you study neoclassical economics, it is taught in a way by which the economy is treated as something eternal as something almost in naturalistic terms and therefore

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 就像重力一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: like gravity.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 就像重力一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Like gravity,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 经济总是存在的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: the economy is always there.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 没错。但同时，像理性个体、**一般均衡理论 (general equilibrium theory)** 等所有这些东西都被认为是自然发生的。从这个意义上说，**自由放任**的观念认为经济从根本上是**前政治的 (prepolitical)**，它先于政治而产生，就像核桃仁一样，而核桃壳，如果你认为它是宪法或政治或法律，它源于政治，会包围这个被称为经济的东西。只有在这种**新古典经济学**的极端意义上，如果存在所谓的**市场失灵**，国家才能稍微介入做这做那，但从根本上来说，要让市场自由发展，你对这种论点和思想很熟悉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Exactly. But but but also like the rational individual general equilibrium theory all of these things are supposedly just happen. And in that sense this idea of less affair that the economy is fundamentally prepolitical that it arises before politics rather like the kernel of a walnut in which the walnut which is the shell is if you think is you know constitutional law or politics or law that e emanates from politics that would enase this thing called the economy and only under extreme sense of this neoclassical economics if there is quote unquote market failure then the state can step in a little bit to do this that or the other but fundamentally leave the market be and you're familiar with this argument this idea

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 这在**斯密**那里并不真正存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: is not really there in Smith

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 人们有时会感到惊讶的一件事，我总是告诉我的学生，去读**《国富论》** 中关于工资的那一章，他非常清楚地指出，拥有财产的人和不拥有财产的工人之间存在权力差异。所以，市场是平等人见面签订合同的地方这种想法，在**斯密**那里没有，在**李嘉图**那里也没有。当然，在**马克思**那里也没有。但人们如果提到**马克思**，通常会说，你谈论的是社会主义。但是**斯密**不是社会主义者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: and one of the things that people sometimes get surprised about and I always tell this to my students is read his chapter on wages in the wealth of nations and he says very clearly that there is a difference in power between those who own property and workers who don't own property so this idea that The market is sort of this place where equals meet to create contracts. That was not in Smith. It was not in Ricardo. And of course, you know, that was not there in Marx. But people, if you evoke Marx, then people often say, well, you talk about socialism. Well, but Smith was not a socialist.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 他的想法是什么？他的贡献是什么？我承认，我也有点内疚，会说“哦，**亚当·斯密**，**看不见的手**，屠夫，他们都一起工作，等等等等”。但我被告知，我也听说过，我们对**斯密**的这种漫画式理解是错误的。他的计划是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: What was his idea? Like what what what was his contribution? Or I admit like I'm like guilty to like, oh, Adam Smith, Invisible Hand, the Butcher, they all work together, blah blah blah. But I have been told and I have heard that the sort of caricature that we all have of Smith is wrong. What was his project?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以我认为思考这个问题的方式是，你知道，只是为了提出一些我认为很重要的东西，那就是**制度 (institutions)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So I think the way to think about it is you know just to sort of get out something which I think is kind of important which is institutions.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 好的。现在对**亚当·斯密**有很多不同的解读，所以我稍后会谈到。但就先提出来，当你谈论**制度**时，你指的是我们所处的隐性和显性社会约束系统，对吧？所以我们正在进行自发的对话，但这是在一个建筑物的背景下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Okay. Now there have been many different readings of Adam Smith and so I'll come to that in a little bit. But just to get it out there, when when you talk about institutions, you're talking about the system of implicit and explicit social constraints within which we exist, right? So we are having the spontaneous conversation but in the context of a building

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 它受到某些分区法律等的约束。我们可能，你知道，在当前的分区法律下我们不能吸烟，但我们过去是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: uh which is subject to certain zoning laws and so on. We may and you know in in current zoning laws we cannot smoke but we were

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 有某些期望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: there are certain expectations involved in

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 但这些期望被编纂成一种法律框架，对吧？所以**制度**，正式的**制度**是法律，非正式的**制度**是文化规范以及对是非、正义等观念。所以**亚当·斯密**，我认为一个令人信服的观点认为，他是一个**制度主义者 (institutionalist)**。他明白，是的，私人行为、私人互动、**自由放任**的领域实际上是建立在人类创造的基础之上的：财产权体系、权力关系体系等等。所以政治已经存在了。经济并不是**前政治的**，如果你读**亚当·斯密**在**格拉斯哥大学 (Glasgow University)** 17年的讲座，你知道那是在**《国富论》** 之前，他写得很清楚。但后来发生的是，19世纪末**新古典经济学**的兴起，它摧毁了那段历史，改变了故事，政治从**政治经济学**中消失，变成了**经济学**，即**经济学原理**。于是这一代经济学家被训练成将经济视为与政治完全分离的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: but those expectations are codified in a kind of a legal framework right so institutions the formal institution is law and informal institutions are cultural norms and notions of right and wrong and justice and all this so Adam Smith according to I think is a convincing strain of thought was an institutionalist he understood that Yes, the sphere of private behavior, private interactions, lesser affair actually sits on a foundation which is of human creation. The system of property rights and the system, you know, the system of you power relations and all of that. So politics was already there. It's not that the economy was pre-political and those ideas if you read Adam Smith his Glasgow University lectures 17 you know that was before the wealth of nations it's very clear that he he's writing that but what happens is the rise of neoclassical economics in the late 19th century eviscerates that history and it changes the story the political goes out of a political economy and it becomes economics so the principles of economics and so then this generation of economists trained to think of the economy as completely separate from politics

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 而在战后时期，这就导致了所谓的**瓦尔拉斯一般均衡理论 (Walrasian general equilibrium theory)**，我很乐意解释这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: and that in the post-war period uh so that leads to what is called the Walrasian general equilibrium theory and I'll be happy to explain that yeah

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我可以问一下吗？我已经有很多问题了，但是是什么样的环境催生了**新古典经济学**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: can I just ask I I have so many questions already but what was the environment that actually gave rise to the neocclassical

</details>

### 新古典经济学的兴起与演变

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以这真的很有趣，因为我们谈论的是19世纪末。这是一个社会动荡巨大的时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: so this is really interesting because we're talking about the late 19th century And this is a time of enormous social turmoil,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以，认为市场理想化观点会在19世纪90年代大萧条时期出现，这很奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So to think that an idealized view of markets would arise when you know you've got the Great Depression of the 1890s

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 然后又经历了第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: and then it goes through World War I and World War II.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 是的。是的。但在这个传统中发生了一件有趣的事情。所以美国经济学有趣的地方在于，**美国经济学会 (American Economic Association, AEA)** 是由**制度主义者**创立的，但不是**新古典**那种**制度主义者**。他们是明确的。所以这些作者，比如**理查德·T·伊莱 (Richard T. Ely)** 等人，他们受过**德国历史学派 (German historical school)** 经济学的训练，而**德国历史学派**经济学的方法是，理论必须在与社会现实的对话中构建。**W.E.B. 杜波依斯 (W.E.B. Du Bois)** 在柏林接受训练，但他作为一名社会学家，将这种方法带入对美国种族不平等的**研究**中，他通过考察美国黑人的生活水平来构建种族和阶级理论。对吧？所以这是一种特殊的方法，它不是演绎的，而是归纳的。它与社会现实相结合。所以，当**美国经济学会 (AEA)** 成立时，这些都是那种**制度主义者**，他们主导了美国经济学，一直到1930年代，影响了许多成为**富兰克林·罗斯福 (Roosevelt)** 智囊团一部分的经济学家和律师。我是说，这些人中有许多是律师，但你也有那些受过训练的人，他们绝对反对经济是**前政治的**这种观念。

**Jamee Moudud**: Yeah. Yeah. But here's the funny thing that happens in this tradition. So what is interesting about American economics is that the American economic association is founded by institutionalists but institutionalists not of the neoclassical kind. They were explicit. So they were trained these these authors like um Richard T. Eli and others they were trained in the German historical school of economics and the method of the German historical school of economics was that theory has to be constructed in dialogue with social reality. Web Duboce trains in at Berlin but as a sociologist and he brings that method to the study of racial inequalities in this country in which he's constructing a theory of race and class by looking at actually the the living standards of black people in this country. Right? So it's a particular method that was not deductive but it was inductive. It was engaging with social reality. So what happens is that when the AEA is constructed of American economic association, these are institutionalists of that kind and they come to dominate American economics right through the 1930s informing many of these uh economists and lawyers who who were part of Roosevelt's brains trust. I mean many of those folks were lawyers but you had these folks who were trained in a way by which they were absolutely opposed to this idea that the economy is prepolitical

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对，1940年代发生的是，你知道，战争，然后你有了这个角色。**菲利普·米洛夫斯基 (Philip Mirowski)** 在他的书**《机器之梦》(Machine Dreams)** 中讨论了这一点，他是一位经济思想史学家，他在书中指出，经济学最终被数学家和工程师主导，他们消除了社会、政治和历史，将经济构建成一台由**半机械人 (cyborgs)** 组成的机器，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right what happens in the 1940s is the you know the war and then you had the role and so Philip Morowski discusses this in his book he's a historian of economic thought uh machine dreams in which he argues that economics eventually becomes dominated ated by mathematicians and engineers who who kind of eviscerate society and politics and history and construct the economy as a machine populated by cyborgs right

**Tracy Alloway**: 预先编程的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: pre-programmed

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 完美理性，无所不知，无所不包等等。这种经济学概念化方式取代了旧传统，并在1950年代和1960年代变得主导。从这个意义上说，这在很大程度上是一个国家项目，因为这些人受雇于那些从**美国国防部 (Department of Defense)** 获得大量资金的机构。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: perfectly rational all knowing allseeing etc etc and that way of conceptualizing economics eclipses this older tradition and in so doing becomes dominant in in the 1950s and60s and in this way it was very much a state project in the sense that these folks were employed at institutions that got a lot of money from the department of defense. M

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以有一种非常像是关于经济的知识框架正在被构建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: so there was a very sort of like an intellectual framework is being constructed about the economy

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 其中许多作者非常明确地试图模拟武器系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: in which many of these authors were very explicitly trying to model weapon systems

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 投入产出，那种东西，以及如何优化这个投入产出系统，比如飞行中的飞机如何被击落等等。所以经济变成了这个引擎，变得越来越数学化，但这样做也脱离了社会现实。在1985-86年，**国家科学基金会 (National Science Foundation)** 召集了一次关于顶尖研究生院经济学教学状况的研讨会，他们对所教授的内容感到非常担忧。这导致了**经济学研究生教育委员会 (Commission on Graduate Education in Economics)** 的成立。这是一项针对顶尖经济学研究生项目的调查，相关文章发表在**《经济文献杂志》(Journal of Economic Literature)** 上，结果相当令人沮丧，因为它指出这些学生在学习数学经济学，但他们无法将其应用于社会现实。结论非常有趣。他们说，令人担忧的是，这个行业正在培养**白痴学者 (idiots savants)**。这是**《经济文献杂志》** 文章中的原话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: input output that kind of thing and that how do you optimize this input output system that the flying plane how to shoot it down etc. So the economy becomes this engine and becomes increasingly more and more mathematically sophisticated but in so doing divorced from social reality. In 198586 the National Science Foundation convened a symposium on the state of economics teaching in the top graduate schools and they were extremely concerned about what was being taught. that led to uh the commission on graduate education in economics. It was a survey of the top graduate programs in economics and the article in question was published in the journal of economic literature and what and it was pretty dismal because it was saying that these these students are learning math econ but they cannot apply this to social reality and the conclusion was quite interesting. They said the concern is that the profession is training idiots savons. That was an exact term in the JAL article.

**Tracy Alloway**: 这不是对经济学家最糟糕的评价。

**Tracy Alloway**: It's not the worst thing that's ever been said about economists.

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的，没错。没错。

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah, that's true. That's true.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以，这个学科本身是如何掌控话语权的，其中数学被视为严谨，而不是历史和社会。因此，政府干预和不干预就成了斗争的焦点。但我认为，这是一场虚假的辩论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So this issue of the way by which the discipline itself has sort of captured the narrative in which math becomes rigor as opposed to history and society. And so then government intervention and non-intervention become the sort of flash points of the fight. But it's a false debate, I would argue.

### 战后欧洲重建与产业政策

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们可以多谈谈1940年代之后的战后环境吗？我的直觉是，如果我当时在那里，我会觉得“哦，你知道，政府可以是绝对的怪物，对吧？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can we talk a little bit more about the post-war environment coming out of the 1940s? My impulse I feel like if I were there it's like oh you know governments can be absolute monsters right and

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你在说**麦卡锡主义 (McCarthy)** 吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: talking about the McCarthy

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 不，我指的是世界各地军事独裁者的崛起，那种真正的、可怕的创造物。当然，20世纪上半叶的特点就是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: no I'm talking about the rise of dict militaristic dictators like all around the world like true like true the sort of like monstrous creations and of course the first half of the 20th century was like characterized by the rise of like

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 伴随着强大的**产业政策 (industrial policy)**。我的直觉是，如果我在1940年代，我会想，“哦，我们需要提出一种尽可能限制国家的经济学，因为我们刚刚目睹了国家可以多么可怕和具有破坏性。”当然，在那之前就是**大萧条 (Great Depression)** 等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: with strong industrial policy my impulse like I think if I had been around in the 1940 I was like, "Oh, we need to like come up with an economics that constrains the state as much as possible because we've just witnessed how the state can be absolutely monstrous and destructive." And of course, right before that was the Great Depression, etc. Like

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我不知道。我，我，我会有，我只是在我脑海中...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I don't know. I I I would have I just in my mind

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我当时会对这种观点抱有很大的同情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I would have a lot of sympathy for that view at the time.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 当然。但事情是这样的。我在我的书中的一章讨论了这个问题，我写得很开心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Sure. Here's the thing though. So this I discussed this in one of the chapters in my book and I had a lot of fun writing about this

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 那就是如果你看看二战后的欧洲重建，它涉及的绝不是**自由放任**，完全不是。它涉及**产业政策**和社会政策，对吧？中央银行的动员，实际上美国国会对欧洲中央银行在动员金融和信贷以促进**产业政策**和社会政策方面的作用进行了两项研究。你知道，重建医院等等，以及法国和德国的出口经济等等。所以你确实有相当强大的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: is that if you look at post second world war European reconstruction it involved it's not less affair not at all it involved industrial and social policies right the mobilization of central banks and actually the US Congress had two studies done on European central banks role in mobilizing finance and credit to promote industrial and social policies you know the reconstruction building of hospitals etc etc and the export economies and France and Germany and so on so you did have pretty strong state

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 但这些是社会民主国家，这是一个重要的点。我是说，你知道，所以，例如，**法国银行 (Bank of France)** 在1945年或1944年被国有化，而作为**法国银行**核心的**国家信贷委员会 (National Credit Council)** 包含了法国社会的不同组成部分，工会、雇主、农民等等，他们参与规划信贷向社会不同部门的分配。在德国边境，你有**德国复兴信贷银行 (KFW)**，这是一家公共银行，同样有不同的利益相关者，包括工会，他们通过信贷分配参与经济和社会重建。但这些是民主国家，你知道，我是说，我理解你的意思，即当然你可以有一种与威权主义相符的**产业政策**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: but these were dem social social democratic states and this is an important point I mean the you know so so for example the bank of France is nationalized in 1945 or 444 and the national credit council which is at the core of the bof has in it different constituents of French society, unions, employers, farmers and so on who are sort of involved in planning the allocation of credit to different sectors of society. Across the border in Germany, you have the KFW which is a public bank again with different stakeholders including unions and they are involved in sort of the economic and social reconstruction through credit allocation. But these were democratic states you know sort of I hear you that in the sense that for sure you can have industrial policy of a type which is consistent with authoritarianism.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 我们所有人都反对威权主义，但也有社会民主主义的**产业政策**，我们有大量来自战后欧洲的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: And all of us would be opposed to authoritarianism but there was industrial policy of a social democratic kind also and we have plenty of examples of those just from post-war Europe.

</details>

### 异端经济政策的实践

**Tracy Alloway**: 那么，为了更好地理解，也许我们可以将一些理论应用于当前的经济政策。当你审视**马达尼**的议程时，比如租金冻结，或者现在热门的话题是向亿万富翁征税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So just to better understand maybe we could apply some of the theory to current economic policies. when you look at Madani's agenda, you know, things like [snorts] a freeze on rent or um I think right now the hot topic is attacks on billionaires,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这如何融入经济学的思想史？我想，与我们一直在谈论的**正统**相比，它有多**异端**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: How does that fit into the intellectual history of economics? And I guess how heterodox is it versus the orthodoxy that we've been talking about?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 嗯，我是说，这是一个大问题，因为我可以从两个方面回答。一个是这种政策会搞垮经济的说法。所以我们先谈谈税收部分。先把它说清楚。这种对亿万富翁的小幅增税会搞垮经济。我的回答是，天哪，那资本主义早就死了，因为**第十六修正案 (16th amendment)** 早就扼杀了美国资本主义。所以那是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Well, I mean, it's a it's it's a it's a big question in the sense that I can answer it in two two ways. One is the narrative that this is going to tank the economy. So let's just talk about the tax part. Let's just get that out of the way. That this this small increase in the billionaire tax is going to tank the economy. And my responses, well, gez, then capitalism would have been dead a long time ago because the 16th amendment would have killed American capitalism. So that was

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 等一下，那是...哦，那是赋予联邦政府能力的那个吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: wait what's the uh oh is that the one that gave the government the federal government the ability to

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 嗯，**第十六修正案**实际上使累进所得税合法化，对吧？所以如果你看看整个西方世界，你知道，就像在美国，税率在50年代和60年代实际上要累进得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: well that was the 16th amendment really legalized prog income taxes right and so if you look at across the western world you know like in the US tax rates were actually much more progressive in as you know in the 50s and 60s

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 其他国家也有这种累进税的增长，英国和法国等等，所有这些都没有导致资本主义的崩溃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: other countries had this growth of more progressive taxes Britain and France and so on none of that led to the collapse of capitalism and the

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 很多人说那是**资本主义的黄金时代 (golden ages of capitalism)**。好的。所以问题真的不是税本身，而是它被用来做什么，对吧？所以那是一个单独的对话，但这是否必然与**正统**相悖？是的，在某种程度上是，因为它回到了这个观念，即从分析角度看，我是说，每本教科书都会告诉你，你有一个自给自足的黑箱，叫做经济，它在**一般均衡 (general equilibrium)**、**生产可能性边界 (production possibility frontier)**、**帕累托最优 (Pareto optimality)** 等所有这些正统方面达到均衡。所以任何国家干预的行为都会自动产生一些负面结果。对吧？所以从这个角度来看，我会说它与**正统**是深刻对立的。但如果我们把**正统**视为试金石或黄金标准，那么你当然会说这些是异想天开的想法。但如果你不陷入那种思维，你就会说，嗯，是的，但这已经做过了。所以这有什么奇怪的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: many people say those were the golden ages of capitalism Okay. So the question really is not the tax per se but what is it being used for and right and so that's that's a separate conversation but is that necessarily is that contrary to orthod orthodoxy and yes in a way it is because it comes back to this idea that analytically I mean every textbook will tell you well you've got this self-contained black box called the economy which equilibrates at general equilibrium the production possibility frontier par optim mality all these sort of aspects of orthodoxy. So any act of state intervention into it will automatically generate some negative outcomes. Right? So from that standpoint I I I would say that it is profoundly opposed to the orthodoxy this way of thinking about it. But if we think of the orthodoxy as a touchstone or as a gold standard then of course you would say well these are outlandish ideas. But if you don't fall into that then you would say well yeah but this has been done. So what is so weird about it?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们可以回去吗？我想更多地谈谈现在时态，但我们不能完全跳过战争。你已经谈到了重建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can we go back? I want to talk more about the present tense, but we can't just like jump over the war completely without a you have you've talked about reconstruction.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 不，不，不。但是，抱歉，我想回到战争，而不是重建。你正在读或者你读过**《毁灭的工资》(Wages of Destruction)**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: No, no, no. But uh sorry, I want to go back to the war and not reconstruction. Uh you're reading or you did read Wages of Destruction,

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 没错，这就是我提到德国**产业政策**的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: right? Which is why I mentioned I mean German industrial policy.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 但我突然想到一件事，我觉得很有趣，我经常思考，我很想听听你的看法。比如，如果现在我们听说某人是经济学家，对吧？你知道，他们会提出一堆大想法，他们有理论，他们会进行测试，写论文，并试图施加影响。但当你想到，比如，当时参战的任何国家的战争部门的经济学家等等，这似乎是一个更谦逊的职业，从某种意义上说，很多工作似乎只是计数。甚至不是高级数学本身，但这项工作似乎是一种非常像...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: But it occurs to me there's something I think is very interesting that I think about it a lot and I'd love your take on this. Like if we hear like someone is an economist these days, right? You know, they come up with a bunch of like big ideas, they have theories and they run tests and write papers and try to influence. But when you think of like, okay, the economists in the department of war in whatever country was fighting at the time, etc. It seemed like a more humble profession in the sense like a lot of the jobs seem to just be counting. Not even like advanced mathematics per se, but the job seemed to be a sort of like very like

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 那些追踪经济体内资源的人，那些就是经济学家，这在我听来与我们今天听到某人是经济学家时脑海中经常出现的画面非常不同。这公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: the people who keep track of the resources within the economy and those were the economists which sounds to me very different than the picture that we would often get in our head today if you hear that someone is an economist. Is that fair?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这对历史的理解公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Is that a fair understanding of history?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 我不确定我是否同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: I'm not sure that I agree.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的，没关系。因为我认为，我是说，在某种意义上，你说的有道理，因为很多参与战争规划的经济学家，他们确实在做这些。我是说，你知道，是的，他们确实在做数学建模。我是说，整个战后数学经济学的数学化，我是说，所有这些都确实来自复杂的数学模型。所以它确实来自那里。但我想也许你在这里想表达的是，但你知道，告诉我这是否是你试图表达的。至少我听到的是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Okay, that's fine. Because I think that I mean in some sense there's truth to what you're saying because a lot of these economists who were involved in war planning that's exactly what they were doing. I mean you know yeah they were actually but they were actually doing math modeling. I mean the whole mathematization of post of post-war you know math econ I mean all of that really came from like sophisticated mathematical models. So it did come from that. But I think maybe what you might be getting at over here, but you know, just tell me if this is what you're trying to say. At least what I'm hearing

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是这个...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: is that this

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 经济是一个引擎，经济学家就像一个技术员，只是在摆弄东西的观念，对吧？我认为这个想法，所以经济学家就是这样构建这个引擎的，而不是一个实际上试图修复引擎，但也试图了解其组成部分是如何构建的经济学家。换句话说，社会、历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: notion that the economy is an engine and the economist is like this technician who's just like tinkering around with things, right? And I think this idea and and so that's how the economist is kind of constructing this engine as opposed to an economist who is actually attempting to fix the engine but also trying to see what the component parts are built on. In other words, society history.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我会把你说的拿过来，并把它变成我本来想说的，因为我，我确实，我要作弊了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I'm going to take what you said and make it what I meant to say because I I do I'm going to cheating.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的，这就是我说的意思。哦，这正是我想要表达的方式。谢谢你验证了我的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah, that's what I meant this. Oh, that's exactly how I meant to put it. Thank you for validating my perspective on this.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 好的。我认为这些反映了两种非常对立的方法论。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Okay. And I think those reflect two very rival methodologies. Okay.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以我认为，在经济学教学和学习中经常被忽视的一点是，学生们没有学习方法。你知道，他们可以说，我是说，教科书应该说，好的，这是**新古典经济学**。这里使用了一种方法，这里是另一种选择。随便你怎么称呼它。我通常不用**异端经济学 (hetrodox economics)**。我称之为**批判政治经济学 (critical political economy)** 或类似的东西。它采用了一种不同的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So the I think that one of the things that so often gets missed out in the in the teaching of economics and then the learning of economics is that the students don't learn method. You know they could say that I mean a textbook should say okay this is neoclassical economics. Here is a method that is used and here is this alternative. Call it whatever you like to. I generally don't use hetrodox economics. I say critical political economy or you know that kind of thing. It employs a different method

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 这就是它为什么重要。现在，如果你只是花几章来做这件事，那已经为一场明智的对话奠定了基础。但如果你不这样做，而只是说这就是经济学，那么结果就是它排除了理解世界的任何可能性。对吧？所以中国，中国的经济奇迹，日本的经济奇迹，这些都被视为某种程度上...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: and here's why it matters. Now if you just do like spend a few chapters on that that already sets the stage for an intelligent conversation. But if you don't do that and it's just that this is economics then what happens is it it kind of leaves out any possibility of even understanding the world. Right? So Chinese, the Chinese economic miracle, the Japanese economic miracle, those are seen as somehow

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我不知道他们是不是在作弊。

**Jamee Moudud**: 而不是说，嗯，他们使用了某种**产业政策**。战后瑞典也以不同的方式使用了**产业政策**。我们能从理论上学到什么吗？这又说明了政治与经济之间的关系，这正是我们开始对话的地方，我认为对话应该这样进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: as opposed to saying well they use no they use industrial policy of a certain kind. So did Sweden of a different kind uh in the post-war period. And can we learn something from that theoretically? And what does that say about the relationship between politics and economics which is exactly where we started out with and I think that's the way the conversation should go.

</details>

### 市场失灵与社会成本

**Tracy Alloway**: 明白了。你能很快提醒我一下吗，**新古典经济学**是如何解释我们确实存在**市场失灵**这一事实的？因为理论上，如果市场完美运作，总是产生最佳结果，总是处于供需平衡或其他什么状态，那么它们就不应该发生，对吧？然而，纵观历史，我们一直都有**市场失灵**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Got it. Can you just remind me very quickly but how does neocclassical economics actually explain the fact that we do have market failures right because in theory if the market is perfectly functioning and always generating um an optimal outcome always at equilibrium between supply and demand or whatever they shouldn't be happening right and yet throughout history we have market failures all the time

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以这就是我会说**市场失灵**实际上并不存在的地方。因为我是说，想想一个经常被描述为**市场失灵**的例子：**污染 (Pollution)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: so that's the way where I would say that market failures don't actually exist Because I mean think about one instance of what is often characterized as market failure. Pollution

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 现在**污染**无处不在，对吧？我是说，任何生产行为都涉及原材料的投入，这些原材料从某个地方提取，然后你有一个物理化学过程，产出一个输出，它可能是一个无形的输出。它可能是你电脑的输出，对吧？然后有废物，有**污染**。所以现在如果**污染**和废物无处不在，如果**市场失灵**无处不在，那么它们就不是**市场失灵**。从逻辑上讲，它们是财产权的法律设计，使得工厂所有者能够倾倒化学废物，或者**谷歌 (Google)** 能够获取你和我的私人数据。对。这让你直接回到一个事实，即行业可能造成的**社会成本 (social cost)** 取决于行业的法律设计。所以在**1969年国家环境保护法 (National Environmental Policy Act of 69)** 之前，行业有更大的自由倾倒化学废物。所以我会说，是的，我认为我们需要摆脱**市场失灵**这个概念，然后，你知道，这是一个常见的辩论，即好吧，既然有**市场失灵**，那么我们是否需要国家干预？我在书中指出，这有点像是自由主义者和保守主义者之间的一场家庭辩论，因为双方都同意存在**市场失灵**，然后一方说我们可能不应该有国家干预，另一方则持相反意见。我的观点是，总是存在**社会成本**，而政治通过法律将构建这些成本的构成和水平。所以，我认为对话应该转向那里。所以这是一个关于最小化或避免哪些成本的政治决定，而不是经济决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: now pollution is ubiquitous right I mean any act of production involves inputs of raw materials which are extracted from somewhere then you've got a physicochemical process out comes an output and it could be an intangible output. could be you know the output from the your computer right and then there's waste there's pollution so now if pollution and waste are ubiquitous and if market failures are ubiquitous then they're not market failures logically they are the legal design of the property rights that enabled the owner of the factory to actually dump chemical waste or for Google to take your and my private data Right. It's a it's a that brings you straight back to the fact that the social cost that industry, you know, can inflict depends on the legal design of industry. So before the National Environmental Policy Act of 69, industry had far greater leeway to dump more chemical waste than after that. So I would just say that yeah I think we need to move away from the this notion of market failure uh and then you know so that's a usual debate that well okay so you got market failure then do we want state intervention or not and I argue in the book that that's a bit of like a family debate between liberals and conservatives because both sides agree that there's market failure and then one side say well we should probably not have state intervention and the other side says the opposite. My point is there are always social costs and politics through the law is going to be structuring the composition and level of those costs and so I think that's where the conversation I think should go to. So it's a political decision about which costs to minimize or avoid versus an economic

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 我是说，它一直都是这样，这就是我认为从这个意义上说，如果你回到**可负担性**等问题，我会说，如果你让房价随心所欲，以至于人们失去家园，那就像房地产的政治结构一样。你明白我的意思吗？是的，所以无论如何政治都在那里，问题是谁受益，谁受损。我认为对我来说，这就是问题。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: I mean it's always been that and that's where I think in that sense if you come back to issues of affordability and such I I would say that if you let housing prices be whatever they are so that people lose their homes that's as much a political structure ring of real estate as otherwise you see what I'm saying it yeah so it's not any which way politics is there the question is who's benefiting and who's losing. This is I think for me this is the question.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的。所以有些事情市场运作得很好，对吧？你知道，如果我们想要非常好的百吉饼，那么很有可能一个好的方法就是有很多面包店企业家。绝对是。他们会在价格和质量等方面竞争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Okay. So there are some things where markets work very well, right? You know, if we want to have really good bagels, then there's a good chance that like a good way to get there is you have a lot of bakery entrepreneurs. Absolutely. And they're competing on price and quality and so forth,

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: etc.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Sure.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 但他们会排放废物。所以我们回到**污染**的例子，在这个过程中，我们说，好的，市场在制作百吉饼方面运作得非常好，但我们有一个问题，那就是他们正在制造必须解决的废物，即使那是良性的，你知道，这就像，当然任何人都会，但即使它不是污染最严重的东西，也会有一些废物产生。所以我们需要某种，好的，那么**新古典经济学**就会说，是的，存在**市场失灵**，这就是为什么我们必须有公共卫生工作者，对吧？因为否则他们都会把垃圾倾倒在街上。所以，好的，我们有公共卫生工作者。你重新定义了这一点，你说，不，**市场失灵**不是正确的思考方式。它是生产固有的。它是市场运作方式的一部分。它不是失败。那么我们如何处理这些信息，以便我们不再将这些视为市场大部分时间运作良好或经常运作良好，但随后出现**市场失灵**的边缘情况。你完全颠覆了这一点，你说**市场失灵**不是一个有用的概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: But then they're going to emit waste. So let's just go back to the pollution example in the process and we say like okay the market worked really well in the creation of the bagel but we have this problem which is that they're creating they're creating waste that has to be solved and even that's benign you know it's like of course anyone is but there's going to be some waste involved even it's not the most polluting thing so we need some sort of like okay so then the neocclassical economics yeah there's market failure this is why we have we have to have a public the the sanitation worker ers, right? Because otherwise they'd all just be dumping it out on the street. And so, okay, so we have public sanitation workers. You reframe this and you're like, no, market failure isn't the right way to think about it. It's endemic to production. It's part of how market works. It's not failure. What do we then do with this information so that we know we no longer conceive of these sort of like edge cases of mostly markets work or frequently markets can work, but then you get market failures. You flip this entire thing on the head and you're like market failures are not a useful thing.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的，我们接受这个前提。那么我们如何利用这个新的，我们有了这个新的视角，然后我们看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Okay, we accept that premise. Then what do we do with that new we have this new lens and then what do we see?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 其中一些**社会成本**需要**内部化 (internalized)**。换句话说，它们会像过去一样，对吧？纵观资本主义历史，再说一遍，这不仅仅是一个武断的说法。但如果你纵观资本主义历史，资本主义活动的**两面性 (Janus-faced nature)**，一方面是财富创造，另一方面是**社会成本**，然后在不同的时间点，一些**社会成本**非常高，比如对某些东西收取的费率。**1877年伊利诺伊州曼维尔案 (Manvy, Illinois, 1877)**，这是一个里程碑式的最高法院案例，它源于**州际商业法案委员会 (Interstate Commerce Act Commission)**，该委员会对铁路和谷物升降机设置了上限，因为当时农民储存谷物时，被谷物储存升降机和铁路收取了极高的费用，导致食品价格上涨。因此，伊利诺伊州立法机构对此设置了上限，该案一直上诉到最高法院，最高法院裁定支持对这些费率设置价格上限，因为他们说这具有**社会重要性 (social importance)**。食物应该**负担得起 (affordable)**。在美国宪法史上，这有很长的历史。这基本上例证了基本观点，即在某些时刻和不同时刻，一些**社会成本**被认为过高，然后以某种方式，它们需要被**内部化**，或者，你知道，也许小企业无法**内部化**其中一些成本。好的，给他们一些**税收抵免 (tax credit)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Some of those social costs would need to be internalized. In other words, they would as they always have been, right? Throughout the history of capitalism, again, so this is not just an arbitrary statement. But if you look at throughout the history of capitalism, this Janisface nature of capitalist activity, wealth creation on the one hand and social costs on the other hand, and then at some in various moments in time, some of the social costs were extremely high in terms of the rates charged on something on the other. Manvy, Illinois, 1877, landmark Supreme Court case came out of the Interstate Commerce Act Commission which put caps on railroads and on grain elevators because what was happening was that the uh the farmers were storing they were charging extremely they were being charged extremely high rates by grain storage elevators and and train and railroads and what was happening was the price for food was rising. So the Illinois state legislature put a cap on that went up to the Supreme Court and so there was this whole idea and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of price caps on these rates charge because they said well this is this is of social importance. Food should be affordable. There's a very long history of this in American uh constitutional history. That is basically exemplifying the basic point that at some points and in various points some of these social costs were deemed too high and then in some way they would need they they had to either be internalized or or you know maybe smaller businesses could not internalize some of these costs. Okay, give them some kind of a tax credit.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Right?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 你明白我的意思吗？有思考公共政策的明智方式。所以**马达尼**的政策，无论它们是什么，它们可能会以不同于大企业的方式影响小企业。所以那些现金流较少的企业可以获得**税收抵免**作为冲销，对吧？我是说，你可以从这些政策的各个方面来思考，至少我是这样从实际角度思考的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: You see what I'm saying? There's there's intelligent ways of thinking about public policy. So Mandani's policies whatever they may be they may affect um I don't know smaller businesses differently from a larger ones. So the ones that have less cash flow they can get a tax credit as a write off right I mean you can think about all of these kinds of policies in then at least that's the way I think about it in practical terms.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我正在努力思考如何提出这个问题，我可能说得不对，但就这样吧。我们最近做了很多关于**委内瑞拉 (Venezuela)** 的节目，所以如果我想到，你知道，一些著名的**异端经济政策**可能出了问题，那会是一个很好的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I'm trying to think how to frame this question and I probably won't get it right but here goes. We've been doing a lot of episodes on Venezuela recently and so if I think about, you know, some famous heterodox economic policy that perhaps went kind of wrong, that would be a good example

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当你考虑设计实际的经济政策时。如果你在优先考虑政治或基于政治的基础上进行设计...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: when you're thinking of designing actual economic policy. If you're doing it prioritizing politics or on a political basis

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 而你没有那种在**新古典思想**中固有的科学理性框架...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and you don't have that sort of scientific rational framework that is so endemic in neocclassical thought

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这有助于你设计政策吗？这对你来说是一个有用的框架吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: does that help you design policy? Is that a useful framework for you?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 我想问题在于如何定义科学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: I guess the question is what defines science. M

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以，例如，我刚才谈到的**制度经济学家 (institutional economist)**，他们设计政策的方式是基于**证据 (evidence-based)** 的理论，社会现实、历史现实、法院案例，你知道，这类事情。然而，**新古典经济学**不是那样做政策或理论的，它是演绎的，它假设，所以它是在没有证据的基础上构建这个模型。所以**新古典经济学**...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: so the way for example the institutional economist that I was talking about the way they designed policy was on the basis of theory that was evidence-based social reality historical reality court cases you know this kind of thing um neoclassical economics doesn't do policy that way though or theory it's deductive it assumes so it's constructing this model on the basis of no evidence so neoclassical economics

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 基于一个实际上不存在的现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: on the basis of a reality that does not in fact exist.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 没错。谢谢你这样说，因为这已经说明了问题所在，那就是你如何在一个没有经过任何理论，你知道，任何与现实的智力接触的理论基础上设计政策？在2007-2008年金融危机之后，当著名的**新古典经济学家**被问到，等一下，你们现在是否要重新思考你们的模型，因为按照**新古典框架**，这不应该发生。他们说不。我认为这就是问题所在，政策正在以这种特定方式，基于这种性质的理论来设计。但是，如果你引入一种更具参与性的政策思考方式，以及政治，那么政治的性质就很重要。我是说，谁，你知道，它是一个威权国家还是一个民主国家？所以我不喜欢威权主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Exactly. Thank you for putting it that way because that already exemplifies the problem which is that how on earth are you designing a policy based on a theory for which you have which has not been subjected to any kind of theoretical you know any kind of intellectual engagement with reality in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007208 when prominent neocclassical economists were asked wait a second are you now going to rethink your models because this should not have happened per the neoclassical framework. They said no and I think that's the problem here that policy is being designed in this particular way on the basis of theory of this nature. But if you bring in a more engaged way of thinking about policy and politics then the nature of the politics matters. I mean who who you know is it an authoritarian state is it a democratic state? So I don't like authoritarianism.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Sure.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以我认为政策应该在广义上反映基于民主原则的理论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So I think policy should reflect theory on the basis of democratic principles in some in a broad sense.

</details>

### 政治现实与政策障碍

**Tracy Alloway**: 你知道，回到现在纽约市关于住房的当代辩论，还有其他人可能会完全认同你所说的概念视角。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know going back to the contemporary debates about housing in New York City right now and there are others who might buy exactly what you're saying at the conceptual lens

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 他们会说，你知道，关于一切，**Jamee**是完全正确的。问题在于现有的政治使得建造房屋变得过于困难。问题在于现有的政治使得我们为劳动力支付过多的费用等等。问题在于现有的房东控制力过强，并且限制了新建筑的建造。这让我觉得，你的框架有很多版本，将其应用于具体的政策时，不一定会导致“因此租金管制是可行的”这样的结论。你可以说，看，我们当前的系统充满了政治，而民主参与的方式和思考这个问题的方式是，我们需要**自由化 (liberalize)**。解决**可负担性**问题的办法是废除一些分区法律等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: and they would say you know what is completely correct about everything. The problem is that existing politics have made it too hard to build. The problem is that existing politics have made it so that we're paying too much for labor, etc. The problem is that existing landlords control have too much influence and are constraining the building of new uh that they like it strikes me as there are many versions of your framework that to take it to specific policies that don't necessarily lead to and therefore rent control is okay. that you could say, look, there's our current system is riven with politics and that the way to engage democratically and the way to think about this is is we need to liberalize the the solution to affordability is getting rid of some of these zoning laws, etc.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 在我看来，你可能会同意你对其中一些挑战的概念化，但仍然在政策回应方面得出非常不同的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It seems to me like that you could agree with sort of the your conceptualization of some of these challenges and yet and still arrive at very different outcomes in terms of a policy response. So

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 事实上，事实上，**佐兰 (Zoran)** 本人甚至可能同意这一点，因为我们知道，在利用私人资本开发新住房方面，他比左翼的许多人更自由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: in fact in fact I Zoron himself may even agree with that because we know that he is more liberal than say many on the left when it comes to the role of private capital for developing new housing.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 好的。所以我的回应是，如果我们，首先要承认，我认为在任何讨论中，你都要承认对方所说的话，而这确实是关于当前政治和权力结构障碍的事实。但情况一直如此。情况一直如此。所以，如果我们认为这是真正改善事态的最高障碍，那么我们就会放弃社会，放弃任何让汽车更安全的尝试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Okay. So my response is that if we this is true first of all to concede I think in any kind of a discussion you concede what the other person is saying and this is true uh about the sort of impediments of current politics and power structures this that and the other but that's always been the case. It's always been the case. And so like if if if we thought of that as the supreme impediment to actually making things better, then we would have abandoned society would have abandoned any attempts to let's say have safer cars.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Sure.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 因为汽车工业几十年来一直竭力反对安全带，反对让汽车更安全。你知道，整个汽车设计。所以这里的重点是，提出一项政策并不意味着你挥舞魔杖它就会发生。会有无法克服的问题，会有障碍。但是情况一直如此。这并不意味着，你知道，你不能忘记这样一个事实，即**可负担性**的缺乏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Because the automobile industry fought tooth and nail against seat belts for decades making them safer. You know, the whole design of cars. Uh so the point here is it's not as though that proposing a policy implies that you wave a magic wand and it just happens. There are going to be insuperable problems and there's going to be impediments. Um but that's always been the case. That doesn't mean that you know you you cannot lose track of the fact that lack of affordability

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 是的。在这个国家和世界其他地方，已经严重侵蚀了民主。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Yeah. in this country and elsewhere in the world has seriously eroded democracy.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 正如我们所知，并助长了威权政治。经济不安全与威权主义之间存在明确的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: As we know and had has has fueled authoritarian politics. There's a clear relationship here between economic insecurity and and authoritarianism

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 毫无疑问。不过，为了进一步探讨这一点，住房领域的人们喜欢说的一件事是，几年前有一项规则改变。讽刺的是，那是在**库默 (Cuomo)** 政府时期。有一项规则改变，使得房东在租客离开后，更难提高租金稳定型建筑的租金。然后，新租客进来后，他们就不能大幅提高租金。与此同时，我们面临通货膨胀。所以我们有了这种效应，至少根据许多住房领域的人士的说法，很多供应已经从市场上撤出，因为他们不能提高租金。法律阻止他们提高租金，而他们的维护成本却上升了，所以这些房子不再经济划算。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: undeniably. Just to press further on this, however, so one of the things that the housing people love to say is that, you know, there were rule there was a rule change several years ago. Ironically, it was under the Cuomo administration. There was a rule change that made it harder for landlords to raise the rent of a rent stabilized building after the tenant left. And then so then the new tenant comes in, they like can't move it up by much. Meanwhile, we have inflation. And so we have this effect, at least according to many housing people, where a lot of supply has been taken off the market because they can't raise the rent. The law prevents them from raising the rent and their maintenance costs have gone up and so like these are no longer economical to run

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 现在。再说一遍，我的观点不是他们对错，随便。我的观点是，所有这些都可能是真的，所有这些框架都可能非常有用，但它不一定会导致**佐兰**在价格限制方面采取更强硬立场是正确的结论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: now. Again, like my point is not they're right, they're wrong, whatever. My point is that all of this could be true and all of this framework can be very helpful, but it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that Zoron is right to to take a stronger line on what you can just do by fiat in terms of price constraints.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 嗯，你知道，是的，它确实。我是说，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Well, I you know, yeah, it does. I mean,

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我想我不同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I think I would disagree.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 好的，太棒了。因为我认为，如果按照这个逻辑，那么我们根本就不应该做任何事情，对吧？所以我们本可以，你知道，所以，例如，反对，我是说，所以，把讨论稍微从住房问题移开，但比如说税收，对吧？我们之前谈过税收，在**镀金时代 (guilded age)** 有大规模的反对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Okay, great. Because I think that if by that logic then we shouldn't have ever done anything anyways right so we could have you know so so for example opposition I mean so like sort of moving this sort of the discussion a little bit away from housing but let's say to taxation right we were talking about taxation earlier on there was massive opposition during the guilded age

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 如果你实行累进税制，即使有**第十六修正案**，这也会摧毁整个社会。所以**镀金时代**的斗争，最终导致了**第十六修正案**，这例证了这样一个观点：是的，我是说，会有反对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: that if you have progressive taxation if you even have the 16th amendment this is going to destroy the whole society and so the struggles in that guilded age period period which ultimately led to the 16th amendment exemplifies the point that yeah I mean there are going to be there is going to be opposition.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 抱歉，那么限制原则是什么？或者你可能说过，好的，有不同的经济学方法，你说**新古典**是一种方法，其他人有其他方法。我们怎么知道，好的，比如说我们想对租金上涨施加更严格的上限，我们不知道它会好还是坏，对吧？我假设你会同意有办法做得非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Sorry just well then what is the limiting principle or maybe you said okay there are different methods to to doing economics and you say the new classical one method and other people have other methods. How do we know like okay let's say we want to impose more stringent caps on how much you can raise rent like we don't know like it could go well and it could go bad right I assume you would agree that there are ways to do this very badly

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: yeah of course

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 那么我们能采用哪些方法，是**新古典主义者**所看不到的，以便我们能正确地制定这项政策？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: so what are the methods that we could employ that the neocclassicals are blind to such that we can get this policy right

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 我们可以，例如，为那些小房东，或者那些现金不足以修补漏水、维护建筑的房东提供**税收抵免**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: we could for example provide so for for the for the smaller landlords the ones or the less m or the you the ones who are they don't have enough cash to fix the leaks you know upkeep the building that they could be given tax credits.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 对。所以，对**租金管制 (rent control)** 的补偿是，如果你是一家大型房地产公司，并且拥有大量现金流，那么你显然有现金流来解决问题。但如果你是一个小房东，那么你可以获得某种**税收抵免**。你可以获得某种公共补贴来解决这类问题，这又直接回到了所有这些公共融资的问题。对吧？所以，至少我是这样初步思考这个问题的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Right. So that compensation for the rent control would be that okay if you're a large real estate corporation and you've got lots of cash flows then clearly you do have the cash flow to to deal with the problems. But you if you're a smaller landlord then you could be given some kind of a tax credit. You could be given some kind of public subsidy that could deal with that kind of an issue which you brings you straight back to the question of the public financing of all of this. Right? So that's the way at least I would tentatively think about the issue.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 既然我们基本上整个讨论都在谈论政治，我想谈谈当前的政治现实。是什么样的限制阻止了这种**异端政策 (heterodox policy)** 在美国这样的地方成为常态？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Since we've been talking about politics for basically this entire discussion, I want to talk about political realities for right now. What are the constraints that have prevented this kind of heterodox policy from becoming the norm in a place like America?

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 嗯，这是一个很好的问题，我认为问题在于这些想法不在公共领域。所以每当你使用“经济学”这个词时，比如说它出现了，比如说谁是来**CNN**的专家，他们已经隐含地，即使他们不说，也带着这样的想法：市场是首要的，然后其他一切都随之而来。所以我是说，为了反击这一点，你需要进行更多关于这个学科的对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Well, that's a great question and I think I think the issue is that these kinds of ideas are not in the public domain. And so whenever you use the word economics, let's say it comes up, let's say who are the experts who come say let's say to CNN, they're already coming implicitly even if they don't say it from this idea that markets are sort of prime and then everything else follows afterwards. So I mean in order to push back against that you need to have more conversations about the discip.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 谢谢你。谢谢你。我认为这类对话很有帮助，因为它至少为思考打开了空间，我是说，好的，当你谈论像市场经济这样的基础问题时，你到底指的是什么？你知道，这些就是我认为的问题。所以回到你的问题，这是一个障碍，因为如果你要说，好吧，我想让社会服务的某个方面，我不知道，变得**负担得起**或什么的，那么你总是会遇到这个障碍，即你是一个国家干预主义者，而这是自由市场，这是通用语，这是困难的部分，要说，好吧，把对话推得更远，而不是说，好吧，你知道，如果你以不同的方式思考市场，那么可能很难做出改变，但至少市场不是**前政治的**，所以对我来说，这就是问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Thank you for that. Thank you. I think that these kinds of conversations are helpful because at least it opens up the space for thinking about that well I mean okay so when you're talking about foundational questions like the market economy what exactly do you mean by that and you know so those are the kinds of questions I think so come backing coming back to your question that's an impediment because if you're going to say that well I want to make some aspect of social services u I don't know affordable or something then you'll always come up to this impediment that well are you a state interventionist whereas this is the free market and that's the lingua frana and that's the hard part of it that to say that well okay to push the conversation farther as opposed to saying well okay you know if you think of markets in different ways then it may be hard to make the change but at least the market is not pre-political so for me that's the problem

### 美国与欧洲经济模式差异

**Jill Weisenthal**: 从历史学家的角度来看，欧洲和美国为什么会走向不同的方向？显然，民主社会主义传统在欧洲要强大得多。我是说，它在美国从未真正...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: what's the basic gist of why Europe and the US from the historian perspective sort of went different directions and obviously the democratic socialist the democratic socialist tradition obviously much more robust in Europe. I mean it's never really

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你知道，它在美国的历史远不如欧洲那么悠久等等。工会在整个欧洲都强大得多。那为什么会这样？一般来说，除了可能几十年的时间，为什么在美国从未真正扎根任何社会主义传统？我很好奇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: you know it doesn't have as nearly as much history in the US etc. Union's much more robust throughout Europe. How did that what like generally speaking except for maybe like a couple decades partly it just there's never any sort of like socialist tradition ever really took root in the US. I'm curious.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 所以首先，我们国家确实有悠久的**市政社会主义 (municipal socialism)** 历史，被称为**苏社会主义 (su socialism)**。我是说，所以，你知道，换句话说，我是说，实际上有很多关于**马达尼**正在做的事情的文章，这背后有很长的历史。历史学家**盖尔·拉德福德 (Gale Radford)** 曾写过这方面的内容。我认为问题在于，这是第一点。第二点是，如果你看看，这又回到了**Tracy**你的问题，那就是在公共话语中，我们不知道有一种观念认为**新政 (New Deal)** 是一个异类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: So first of all we do have a long history of municipal socialism called su socialism in this country. I mean so there's you know of so you know in other words I you know there a lot has been written actually that what Mandani is doing here. It's actually pretty there's a long his history behind that. Gale Radford has written about this a historian. I think the the issue is and so so that's the first point. The second point is that uh if you look at and this comes back I think uh Tracy to your question which is that in the public discourse we don't know there's a kind of an idea that the New Deal was an outlier.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。因此我们需要基本上回到某种**新政**之前的浪漫化的小政府。你知道，**史蒂夫·班农 (Steve Bannon)** 就是这样说的，这就是为什么对**行政国家 (administrative state)** 的攻击以此为前提。问题是，许多法律史学家和法律经济史学家都指出，这并非事实，美国在重建时期发展了一个非常强大的**发展型国家 (developmental state)**。所以那里确实有很多历史，但它不是公共领域和经济学话语的一部分，因为经济学教学不要求学生真正阅读经济史，在大多数地方，他们的培训中不要求这样做。所以他们不了解历史，因此这种新的市场观念盛行，然后他们不了解自己的历史。我不认为这在欧洲有什么不同，我们可以谈谈，但这里有一些有趣的问题。所以，例如，历史上美国的税收制度比欧洲累进得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah. And therefore we need to basically go back to some pre-new deal romanticized small government. You know Steve Bannon makes this kind that's why the attack against the administrative state is premised on this. The problem is the many legal historians and legal economic historians have pointed out this is not true that the US developed a very robust developmental state in the reconstruction period. So there's a really a lot of history there that is not part of the public domain and the and the discourse on economics because the teaching of economics does not require students to actually require not as an elective but require them to actually read economic history in most places in their training. So they don't know the history and so this new notion of the market prevails and then they don't they don't know their own history. I don't think that's any different in Europe and we can talk about that but there are interesting issues here. So for example the American historically the American taxation system was much more progressive than in Europe.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 对。所以有这一点。但我认为战后，二战后时期发生的是，那种情况给很多人带来了冲击，我认为那在某种程度上复兴了左翼，因为法西斯主义，并且人们清楚地认识到大规模不平等是1920年代和1930年代法西斯运动兴起的原因之一。因此，减少不平等，将社会和经济权利写入宪法，我这里想到的是**德国宪法 (German constitution)**，这作为一种至少在一定程度上防止那些恐怖重演的保障，非常重要。所以这创造了一种不同的社会模式，基于这些进步的宪法。我们没有那样的。我们的宪法...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Right. So there is that. But I think what happens in the post war period, postcond world war period is that that kind of sent a jolt for a lot of people and I think that kind of revived the left in some sense because fascism and there was a clear understanding that massive inequality was you know is one of the one of the ingredients of the rise of fascist movements in the 1920s and 30s. And so reducing inequality, embedding social and economic rights and constitutions, I'm thinking here with the German constitution, super important as a kind of insulation at least to some extent against a repetition of those horrors. So this created a kind of a different social model based on these progressive constitutions. We haven't had that. Our constitution

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 是一部第一代宪法，因此在这方面没有明确的经济和社会权利承诺。**人类尊严 (Human dignity)** 这个表达，我认为在美国宪法中没有出现。它确实出现在许多欧洲宪法中，这一点很重要。你有**人格权 (rights of personhood)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: is a first generation constitution and in that way there are no explicit commitments to economic and social rights. Human dignity the expression I don't think appears in the US constitution. It does appear in a lot of these European constitutions and that matters. You have the rights of personhood

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 对，**第十四修正案 (14th amendment)**，但你很清楚它是如何被武器化用于**法人人格 (corporate personhood)** 等等。我认为这是福利国家在欧洲比这里更强大一些的原因之一，尽管它在欧洲也出现了裂痕，而这里则不是这样。我们仍然停留在这样一部宪法上，至少在我看来，它不是一部非常好的宪法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: right the 14th amendment but you know that you know very well that how that's been weaponized for corporate personhood and so on. That's I think part of the story as to why the welfare state has been somewhat more robust. Though it's also seen fractures in Europe than here where that has not been the case. We we're still stuck with this a constitution which at least in my view is not a very good constitution.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我没想到宪法分析会进入这次对话，但我认为它确实说明了你关于政治与经济交织的观点。我能再问一件事吗？也许它甚至没有意义或不适合这次对话，但当我想到**自由放任**市场或经济学时，似乎强调的是**绝对收益 (absolute gains)**，即**正和结果 (positive sum outcomes)**，比如两个国家开始互相贸易，无论是枪支还是黄油，两国都变得更好了，它们之间谁更好并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I wasn't expecting constitutional analysis to come into this conversation but I think it does illustrate your point about the intertwining of politics and the economy. Can I ask one more thing and maybe it doesn't even make sense or fit into this conversation but when I think about lassair markets or economics there seems to be an emphasis on absolute gains so positive sum outcomes where it you know two countries start trading with each other guns and butter whatever both the countries are better off it doesn't matter how much better off they are relative to each other.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 当我们思考**异端经济学**和政治的重要性时，我们是否基本上是在说，每一个政策决定，重点更多地放在**相对收益 (relative gains)** 而不是**绝对收益**上？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: When we think about heterodox economics and the importance of politics, are we basically saying that every policy decision the emphasis is much more on relative gains versus absolute gains?

</details>

### 市场活动与社会成本

**Jamee Moudud**: **Tracy**，我不知道。至少从我的角度来看，我确实认为市场以及市场中的私人倡议确实能创造财富。我是说，你回到**斯密**，他就是这么说的。所以从这个意义上说，市场活动确实能创造巨大的社会财富，这是真的。是的，它确实。但人们往往忘记的是，它也有另一面，即**社会成本**。所以我们必须思考，好的，我们能否以某种方式减少一些**社会成本**，在**可负担性**、**污染**或**气候危机 (climate crisis)** 方面。我认为这说明，好的，市场很棒，但它们建立在什么之上？我刚才谈到的那个基础设施，它正在导致大量的温室气体排放。我是说，那显然是不可持续的，我们都知道。所以我觉得我不知道我是否会必然从**正和 (positive sum)** 或**负和收益 (negative sum gains)** 的角度来思考。我只会说，市场活动确实创造了巨大的社会财富，但也创造了巨大的**社会成本**，所以这就是我认为对话必须转向如何减少我们的**社会成本**的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: I'm not aware of that, Tracy. At least not from my standpoint. I I I I do think that markets and the sort of private initiatives in markets that does generate wealth. I mean that you go back to Smith, he says that. So in that sense it's true that market activity does generate enormous social wealth. Yes it does. But what people tend to forget is that there's also a flip side to that the social costs. And so we have to then think about okay can we somehow do we reduce some of those social costs in terms of affordability or pollution or climate crisis. That's I think saying that okay markets are great but what are they sort of embedded on that that infrastructure that I was talking about that is sort of leading to massive emissions of greenhouse gases. I mean that's clearly unsustainable and we all know that. Uh so I feel like I I don't know that I would necessarily think about it in terms of positive or negative sum gains. I would just say that market activity does generate enormous social wealth but also enormous social costs and so then that's where I think the conversation has to go to how to reduce our social costs.

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Jami Modud**，非常感谢你，这是一次非常引人入胜的对话，感谢你的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Jami Modud thank you so much for it's really fascinating conversation appreciate your time.

</details>

**Jamee Moudud**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jamee Moudud**: Okay.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: **Tracy**，我们应该多做一些**思想史**的节目。我真的很喜欢这个话题。我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Tracy, we should do more intellectual history episodes. I really like that topic. I don't know. Like

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我想我仍然被大学时学习国际关系留下的创伤所困扰，每当有人谈论特定理论的**思想史**时，我都会有点紧张。我想，我们不如把整个播客都做成那样。不，我确实认为这真的很有趣。看，我认为这是一次非常及时的对话，因为有一件事，你知道，他最后提到了**班农 (Bannon)**。我感觉，无论现在许多人在政治光谱的哪个位置，似乎都有一种深刻的直觉，即许多人对不平等对社会的腐蚀作用，或者说不平等对社会的腐蚀作用有着深刻的直觉。我认为你的问题真的很好，那就是许多经济学家可能会说，看，你在这段关系中也过得更好，**优步 (Uber)** 司机，也许你觉得你的工作不太好，但另一种选择是什么都没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I think I'm still scarred from doing international relations at college and whenever someone talks about intellectual histories of particular theories, I kind of I get nervous. I think let's just make the whole I I'd be down to make the whole podcast that. No, I do think this is like really interesting. Look, I think this is a very timely conversation because one thing, you know, he mentioned Bannon there at the end. One thing that I feel is that regardless of where many people are on the political spectrum these days, there seems to be a deep intuition that many people have about the corrosive effects of society on inequal or the corrosive effects of inequality on society. And I thought your question was really good which is like many people economists could say like look you're better off too in this relationship you Uber driver like maybe you feel that you're uh maybe people find it to not be great work but the alternative is nothing or whatever

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 你不是亿万富翁，但至少你有工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: you're not a billionaire but at least you're employed

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你有工作，对吧？而这就是，很多人说，看，每个人在纸面上，甚至在现实中，都从这组交易中受益，对吧？但随后它累积起来，变成了一些我认为人们觉得非常不稳定（destabilizing）的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: you're employed right and this is something and a lot of people say look everyone is on paper or maybe even in reality better off from this set of transactions right but then it aggregates up to something that I think people find to be very destabilizing.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？所以直觉上，很多人似乎对他们目前的状况不满意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Right? So intuitively a lot of people seem unhappy with their current situation.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 所以从微观意义上讲，交易让每个人都更快乐。但当所有人都，当一切都扩大规模时，这种深刻的不平等，谁有创造的手段，谁有能力真正做些什么，谁又不是处于那种位置？我认为这再次让人感到非常不稳定。是的，我确实认为，我是说，正如**Jami**所说，很多事情都归结为政治，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So the transaction makes everyone happier in the micro sense. But then when everyone when it all scales out this sort of like deep inequality, who has the means to create, who has the ability to like actually do something, who is just u sort of who is not in that position? I think it feels very again destabilizing. Yeah, I do think I mean to Jami's point like it it does feel like so much of it just boils down to politics, right?

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah. Right.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 就像经济本身，回到我们开始这次对话的方式，它不是从宇宙中凭空出现的。它是一种人类建构，我们投入了大量的思考和努力来研究它实际是如何运作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Like the economy itself to go back to how we began this conversation did not spring forth from the universe. It was it's a human construction and we put a lot of thought and effort into how it actually works

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 那是一个政治现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: and that's a political that that's a political reality.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。而且，你知道，我们可以谈论所有这些东西，而且与中国的**产业政策**的对比，我认为非常有帮助，原因有二。一是，好的，你可以从各个方面来看，然后说，嗯，这实际上非常有效，公共部门发挥了作用等等，但如果像我们现在这样互相攻击，那么你永远不会有任何希望去实现这些想法。这就是为什么我之前说过，我感觉有些社会问题确实先于经济学。解决那些表面上看起来是经济问题的工具包并不完全存在于经济学中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. And like you know we could talk all this stuff and like the contrast with Chinese uh industrial policy I think is very helpful for two reasons. One is okay you could look at it at various things and say well this is actually very effective and there was a role for the public sector and so forth but if like we're all at each other's throats right then you're never going to have any like hope of like operationalizing these ideas. And this is why I've said this before like I feel like there are certain societal problems that truly like precede economics. The the toolkit does not entirely exist in economics to solve problems that on paper look economic

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对，我认为这很重要，因为在新古典主义的视角中，一切都源于经济，焦点在于经济本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right this I think is important because in the neocclassical perspective so everything springs from the economy and the the focus is on the economy

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: itself.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 与此同时，作为一个社会，你知道，你可能想优先考虑不同的结果。比如也许我们都应该快乐。我，你知道，我希望优先考虑每个人的幸福。而正如你所说，如果我们都专注于**相对收益**，如果自由市场资本主义正在加剧不平等，那么这可能不一定会实现这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Meanwhile, as a society, you know, you might want to prioritize different outcomes. Like maybe we should all be happy. I, you know, I would like to prioritize everyone's happiness. And to your point, like if we're all focused on relative gains, if free market capitalism is increasing inequality, then that might not necessarily do that.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我们应该优先让每个人都放下设备去阅读，然后我想我们会有一个...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: We should prioritize everyone getting off their devices and reading, and then I think we'll have a

**Tracy Alloway**: 接触自然。

**Tracy Alloway**: touch grass.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我们会有更好的结果。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: We'll have better outcomes. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 呃，我们正危险地接近谈论**不丹 (Bhutan)** 和国家...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Uh, we're getting dangerously close to like talking about Bhutan and national

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我们得揭穿。我读过一些相当...

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: we got to debunk. I' I've read some pretty

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，我知道。我知道。这就是为什么我们应该停下来。我们就在此打住吧？

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, I know. I know. That's why we we should stop. Shall we leave it there?
