### 就业数据与英伟达财报主导市场开盘

早上好，各位。欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。我们今天提前开始了，因为有重要的就业数据要公布，还有很多事情要讨论。显然，我们看到了英伟达的财报，看起来黄仁勋（Jensen）可能拯救了市场，成为了2025年的圣诞老人。让我们直接进入正题，就业数据大约在5分钟前发布了，我们来分析一下当前的市场状况。

<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live and we are early because we've got some jobs data. We've got a lot to talk about. Obviously, we had Nvidia earnings. It seems like Jensen might have saved the market and become Santa Claus for 2025. Let's get right into that jobs data came out about 5 minutes ago and then we'll analyze and see what we've got going on.</p>
</details>

### 九月份就业数据详解

这是九月份的**非农就业数据**（Non-farm Payrolls: 美国劳工统计局发布的衡量非农业部门就业状况的月度报告，是反映经济健康状况的关键指标）。数据显示，就业人数强劲增长了119,000人。这是自四月份增长158,000人以来的最佳表现。回顾上个月，数据从最初的22,000人下调至负4,000人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Here we go. This is September non-farm payrolls. Are up a robust 119,000. 119,000 would be the best since April when we were up 158,000 in the rear view mirror. Well, last month was downgraded from 22,000 to minus 4,000.</p>
</details>

再来看失业率，它从4.3%意外地上升到了4.4%。我们上一次达到这个水平还是在2021年10月，当时是4.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if we look at what's going on with the unemployment rate, it ticked up from 4.3 to 4.4. That was unexpected. 4.4 would uh last time we were at that level. Boy, I have to go back a ways. October of 2021 when it was 4.5%.</p>
</details>

劳动力参与率有所上升，这是个好消息，达到了62.4%，与五月份持平。要找到更高的数字，得追溯到今年四月份的62.6%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if we look at labor force participation rate, it ticked up. That's a good thing. 62.4 equals where we were in May. You have to go to April of this year when it was 62.6 to find a higher number.</p>
</details>

从收入方面看，平均时薪月度环比增长了0.2%，略显疲软，因为市场预期是增长0.3%。0.2%的增幅与六月份持平。要找到更低的数字，得回到2023年8月，当时仅增长了0.1%。从同比角度看，情况有所好转，从上次的3.7%和预期值上升到了3.8%。3.8%将是自七月份3.9%以来的最佳表现，因为这一数据一直在下降。不过，今年的最高纪录是3.9%，并且有四个月都达到了这个水平，其中年初的前三个月均为3.9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of the earnings. Average hourly earnings month over month up 2/10. That's a bit on the week side. We're expecting up 3/10 up 2/10 equals where we were in June to find a lower number. You are going in the wayback machine to August of 23 when it was up one-10th. Take a year-over-year perspective. This gets better from 3.7 our last look and expectation to 3.8. 3.8 would be the best since July when it was 3.9 because these have been trending lower. The high water mark though for the year is 3.9 and we've had four months of that. The first three of the year were 3.9%.</p>
</details>

工作时长这个重要指标保持在34.2小时。要找到更低的数字，需要回到一月份的34.1小时。最后，我们来看看**U6失业率**（U6 Rate: 一种更广泛的失业衡量标准，包括了未充分就业和“边际附加”工人，即那些想工作但已放弃寻找工作的人），上次是8.1%，这次降至8.0%。8.0%与二月份持平，要找到更高的数字，则要追溯到2021年10月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we look at the uh hours worked and this is always important. It remains at 34.2. To find a lower number, you're going to January when it was 34.1. And finally, we get U6, the underemployment rate. It was 8.1 our last look. It comes in at 8%. 8% would equal where we were in February. To find a higher number, you're going all the way back to October of 2021.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还有截至11月15日当周的初请失业金人数。我们预期是227,000人，实际为220,000人。这些数字并未反映出劳动力市场的紧张情绪，表现得相当平稳。220,000人是自七月中旬以来的最低水平。最后，持续申领失业金人数略有上升，达到1,974,000人，这是自2021年11月以来的最高水平。我们看到利率在数据公布后有所波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we have initial jobless claims. This is for the week of November 15th. As I said, there's weeks missing. We're expecting 227,000 comes in at 220,000. These numbers do not reflect nervousness in the labor market. They've been very well behaved. 220,000 would be the lowest level of claims since mid July. And finally, on continuing claims, it ramped up just a bit. 1,974,000, and that would be the highest level since uh November of 2021. we see that interest rates had gyrated a bit. Uh but after the</p>

### 美联储的困境：数据缺失与政策抉择

好的，以上就是就业数据。这些是今天本应公布的非常重要的数据。我们看到就业人数增加了119,000，坦白说，这个数字远超预期。它表明劳动力市场表面上可能没有那么多问题。我认为这里面有很多微妙之处需要我们深入分析，但这份就业报告显示，新增11.9万个就业岗位，远高于5.3万的预期。失业率上升至4.4%，也高于4.3%的预期，这是自2021年10月以来的最高水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so those are the job numbers. These were the very important numbers that were supposed to come out today. Uh folks, we're looking at essentially an increase of 119,000 jobs, which is quite the number in terms of the uh amount of jobs that we got. Way better than expectations, quite frankly. way way way better than expectations and it's signaling that well we might not have that many issues in the labor market perceptually. I think there's a lot of nuance to this that we'll break down but this jobs data right here 119,000 jobs above expectations of 53,000 uh unemployment rate up to 4.4% above expectations of 4.3% that's the highest since October 2021.</p>
</details>

请记住，这是九月份的数据，不是十月份的。我们看到的许多裁员公告，比如今天早上Verizon宣布裁员13,000人，还有亚马逊、UPS、英特尔、美国航空等公司在十月份的裁员，这些都应该计入十月份的就业数据中。但我们没有十月份的就业数据。**BLS**（Bureau of Labor Statistics: 美国劳工统计局，负责收集、分析和发布关键经济数据的联邦机构）昨天表示，我们不会得到十月份的数据。你可能会问为什么，我也没有答案，但这是BLS的官方说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, remember that is September, not October. A lot of the announcements we saw, we got a new announcement by this morning in Verizon, uh 13,000 more layoffs. Amazon, UPS, Intel, American Airlines, all those companies that we saw laying off people in October. You know, that that probably counts in the October jobs data because it happened in October. But we don't have that October jobs data. The BLS yesterday, Bureau of Labor Statistics said that we are not going to get that October data. You might be saying, why are we not going to get that data? I don't really have an answer for you, but that is officially what the BLS said. we are not going to get that October data.</p>
</details>

十一月份的数据将在12月10日公布，而那天正好是**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会，是美联储系统内制定货币政策的关键机构）会议的日子。所以，问题在于，降息概率从50%降至35%的原因是美联储缺少了十月份的关键数据。然而，美联储得到的九月份数据却远好于预期。问题就变成了，在不知道十月份情况的背景下，仅凭九月份相对健康的就业市场，是否足以让美联储决定不降息？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The November data is going to come out um on December 10th, which is the day of the FOMC. So, the problem here and the reason why rate code probabilities went from 50 to 35% is because the Fed is missing a crucial piece of data for October. However, the Fed is getting a crucial piece of data for September, which is way better than expected. The question becomes, is it enough to say that we don't need to cut rates given that the job market was relatively healthy in September?</p>
</details>

尽管新增就业岗位比预期多了53,000个，但失业率却达到了自2021年10月以来的最高水平，为4.4%。记住，在2023年10月底，这个数字还是3.5%。所以我们已经有了显著的增长。如果失业率接近4.7%或4.8%，我们显然会看到这对整体经济产生影响。现在，美联储需要根据九月份的就业报告、即将公布的十一月份报告、缺失的十月份报告以及失业率的上升来做出判断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh if we don't know what happened in October, now even though we added 53,000 more jobs than expected, unemployment is at the highest level since October 2021 at 4 and a half or 4.4%. Remember, this was three and a half% at the end of October of of 2023. So, we are up a significant amount since then. If that gets anywhere near 4.7 4.8 obviously we are going to see that impact on the broader economy if we have that many jobs get laid off. Now it's up to the Fed to kind of make a conclusion on how they think of the September jobs report the upcoming November jobs report the lack of the October jobs report and the increase in the unemployment rate.</p>
</details>

然而，今天我们将会发现，是否存在一种可能性，即市场已经不再关心这些了？我们稍后会谈到英伟达的财报，但正如你所见，盘前股市中，英伟达股价上涨4.5%，几乎没有变动。AMD仍上涨3%，特斯拉上涨2%，甲骨文上涨3%，Meta上涨2%，标普500指数上涨1.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, is there an argument and we're going to find out today. Is there an argument uh that the market doesn't care anymore? The market doesn't care anymore. I mean, we're going to get into Nvidia earnings, but as you can see, stocks in the pre-market, Nvidia not really budging, up 4 and a.5%. AMD still up 3%, Tesla up 2%, Oracle up 3%, Meta up 2%, S&P 500 up 1.4%. It's down slightly from 673, but still holding 67197.</p>
</details>

是否可以说，英伟达的财报如此出色、如此强劲——我们确实需要黄仁勋交出这样的季度成绩，而他也确实做到了——以至于市场可以忽略这些就业数据？或者，当市场开盘时，我们会因为数据太好而下跌，这意味着我们不会得到降息？如果得不到降息，经济将面临更大的问题，那么英伟达的业绩再好也无济于事。我不知道。但在接下来的一个小时里，我们将看到市场如何在这个问题上来回摇摆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there an argument that the Nvidia earnings were so good and so strong, which we're going to talk about, but my goodness though, we needed that type of a quarter from Jensen and boy did he deliver. Uh, were those earnings good enough for the market to overlook this? Or when the market opens, do we dump because of the data being too good, which means we're not getting a rake in. And if we don't get a rake up, we're going to have bigger problems in the economy and then Nvidia is not good enough. I don't know. But in the next hour, we're going to find out kind of how the market goes back and forth on this.</p>
</details>

不过，这就是我们从这些数据中看到的情况，相当不可思议。哦，是的，你说得对，就业数据是12月16日公布，不是10号。美联储FOMC会议是在10号。所以美联储甚至拿不到十二月，抱歉，是十一月的就业数据，这让事情变得更加复杂，因为这是他们得到的唯一一份数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but nonetheless, this is kind of what we're seeing in the context of this data and this is quite incredible. Oh yeah, you're right. Jobs date is December 16th, not on the 10th. The Fed FOMC meeting is on the 10th. So the Fed's not even going to have the December jobs data or the October job, sorry, November jobs data, which makes this even more complicated because this is the only piece of data they get.</p>
</details>

当然，未来几周他们还会得到一些其他数据，比如PPI、CPI等，但直到FOMC会议六天后才能拿到十一月的报告。所以他们现在实际上必须根据对十月报告的感知、我们刚拿到的九月报告，以及失业率从4.3%上升到4.6%来做判断。这对美联储来说是个难题。在我看来，这本不该那么难。有足够多的新闻头条可以轻易地说，嘿，也许我们应该降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they'll get a couple more things over the next coming weeks like PPI, CPI, etc., But they're not going to get the November report until six days after FOMC. So they literally have to now judge it on the perception of the October report, the September report we just got. And then the increase in unemployment up from 4.3 to 4.6. I mean, it's a difficult thing for the Fed. In my opinion, it shouldn't be that difficult. There's enough headlines to easily say, hey, maybe we like should be cutting</p>
</details>

降息概率从35%上升到了39%，昨天一度只有27%。所以你看到了大约7%的提升，这对降息概率来说是好事，但这可能还不够。最终，在未来几周，我们会得到更多数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fed probabilities right here from 35 to 39%. At one point, it was at 27% yesterday. So you are getting uh about a 7% boost which is good on the rate cut probabilities but it might not be enough and ultimately over the next coming weeks we're going to get a bit more data.</p>
</details>

对于刚加入的朋友们，九月份的就业数据是新增11.9万个工作岗位，高于预期，这是好消息。我们没有得到十月份的数据，大多数人认为这是坏消息，这本应是给美联储降息的警示信号。失业率现在是4.4%，高于之前的4.3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for those that are just joining the jobs data is 119,000 jobs in the month of September above expectations which is good. Uh we are not getting the October data which most people perceive as bad which would be kind of the warning sign to the Fed to cut rates and unemployment is now 4.4 versus 4.3.</p>
</details>

关于美联储，最后说一点，然后我们转向英伟达。美联储会议纪要昨天公布了，内容一点也不乐观。坦白说，大多数与会者认为年底前维持利率不变是合适的。只有少数人建议进一步降息，而大多数与会者担心降息会增加通胀上行的风险。这是昨天将降息概率压低至35%的另一个因素。所以美联储并不倾向于降息。数据可能会改变他们的想法，但除了失业率上升0.1%之外，我们提供的数据类型并不足以改变他们的想法。实际上，你需要一份相当糟糕的就业报告才能让他们觉得是时候降息了，而且降息比通胀更重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last thing we'll say on the Fed real quick and then we'll get to Nvidia is the Fed minutes came out yesterday and they were not pretty at all. Just being quite frank, I mean most participants in the Fed felt that it is appropriate to keep rates unchanged for the end of the year. Uh only as several of them suggested further cuts and most participants were concerned that cuts could add to the risk of higher inflation. Uh which is another thing that really tanked the rate cut probabilities yesterday to 35%. So the Fed is not on the side of rate cuts. data could change their mind. We're not giving them the type of data that would change their mind outside of the unemployment rate going up by 0.1%. But realistically, you need like a pretty crappy jobs report to get them to think, hey, it is time to cut and that matters more than inflation.</p>
</details>

我们将拭目以待，看他们最终是否会得到这些数据，或者他们是否认为感知到的数据足以支持降息。这就是我们从就业数据中得到的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're going to find out if they end up getting the data or if they end up perceiving the data is going to be enough to cut. So that's what we got on the jobs data.</p>

### 英伟达财报震撼市场，圣诞行情或已提前开启

然而，这一切可能都无关紧要了。因为英伟达的业绩简直是碾压式的。昨天是我们见过的英伟达最好的财报之一，他们真的需要拿出这样的表现。他们必须拿出一些惊人的数字来拯救这个市场。从盘前交易来看，确实感觉如此。谷歌股价创下历史新高，Cipher在数据中心领域达成新协议，Iran、Nebius这些公司股价都在上涨。看看谷歌，304.35美元，在昨天上涨3%之后又上涨了4%。对于谷歌这样的公司来说，这并不容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, it might not matter. It might not matter because Nvidia absolutely smashed. Yesterday was one of the best earnings we have ever seen from Nvidia and they really needed to deliver like they had to put up some big freaking numbers to save this market. And based on the pre-market action, it really does feel we'll see what happens when the market opens. Google trading at alltime highs. Cipher got a new deal in the data center space. Iran, Nebius, all these companies getting a move. Google right there. Look at that. 30435. That's up another 4% after being up 3% yesterday. That's not easy for a company like Google to do.</p>
</details>

Amcor，向所有持有Amcor的朋友们致敬，盘前上涨了10%，这都得益于英伟达。CoreWeave，哇，我今早都没看，上涨了10%。Nebius上涨8%，甲骨文上涨3%，Meta重回600美元上方，上涨2%。标普500指数上涨1.55%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amcor, shout out to all my folks that got Amcore. That's up 10% in the pre-markets. That is because of Nvidia. Core Wee, wow, I didn't even look at Cor this morning. That's up 10%. Nebus is up 8%. Oracle's up 3%. Meta's back above 600 at 2%. And then the S&P 500 up 1.55%.</p>
</details>

真的，真的感觉圣诞老人回来了。而这位圣诞老人穿着英伟达CEO的衣服。那么，财报到底说了什么？我相信昨天很多人和我一起观看了。感谢所有和Tanner、Neil、Jose和我一起关注这份财报的人。这是一份非常重要的财报，无论你是否持有英伟达的股票。他们真的需要提高标准，在一个大部分市场感觉存在AI泡沫的世界里交出漂亮的答卷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It really, really feels like Santa Claus is back. And that Santa Claus is dressed as the CEO of Nvidia. So, what did we get on the earnings? I'm sure a lot of people were watching with me yesterday. Thank you for everyone who was here uh with Tanner, Neil, Jose, and I watching these earnings. This was a big one. Regardless of if you own Nvidia stock or not, they really needed to up the ante and deliver in a world in which most of the market feels there is an AI or not most of the market, but the perception of many parts of the market feels there's an AI bubble.</p>
</details>

市场普遍认为**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 指公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产（如财产、建筑、技术或设备）的资金）不真实，AI是假的，没有用处，过去两年半的这场革命毫无意义，一切都将崩溃，这就是个泡沫。迈克尔·贝瑞（Michael Burry）等等，过去几周你听到了所有这些担忧，导致标普500指数下跌了4%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Capex is not real. AI is fake. It's not useful. this whole revolution over the past two and a half years is meant for nothing. It's all going to collapse. It's a bubble. Michael Burry yada yada. I mean, you had all these concerns over the past couple weeks, which led to this 4% decline in the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

而英伟达交出了570亿美元的营收，同比增长62%。**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，是衡量公司盈利能力的重要指标）为1.30美元，同样超出预期，同比增长60%。数据中心营收，华尔街预计为490亿美元，他们实现了512亿美元，同比增长66%。毛利率高达73.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Nvidia delivered 57 billion in revenue. That's up 62% year-over-year. A$130 of EPS, that's a beat as well, up 60% year-over-year. Data center revenue. Street thought they would come in at 49 billion. They came in at 51.2. Up 66% year-over-year. 73.4% gross margins.</p>
</details>

对我来说，本季度最重要的事情是营收指引。华尔街预计他们会达到610亿美元，而他们给出的指引是650亿美元。这是40亿美元的营收指引上调。我想他们已经好几个季度没有在营收指引上超出这么多。通常他们会超出15亿或20亿。这次是一个巨大的营收超出，我认为英伟达知道他们必须展示出这样的超出，才能让市场不再那么害怕泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing that I got from the quarter was the revenue guide. Street thought they would come in at 61 billion. They came in at 65. It's a 4 billion increase on the revenue guide. I mean, I don't think they beat by four billion on revenue guide in a couple quarters. Like usually they beat by a billion and a half, two billion. This one was a monster revenue beat and I think Nvidia knew they had to show that type of a beat to continue getting the market to not be that afraid about a bubble.</p>
</details>

黄仁勋表示，Blackwell芯片的销售“火爆异常”，云端GPU已售罄。计算需求在训练和推理两方面持续加速并复合增长，两者都呈指数级增长。我们已经进入了AI的良性循环。AI生态系统正在快速扩展，有更多新的基础模型制造商，更多跨行业、跨国家的AI初创公司。AI正在无处不在，无所不能。

<p class="english-text">Jensen Huang says Blackwell sales are off the charts and cloud GPUs are sold out. Comput demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference, each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI.

</details>

他在财报电话会议上开场就说：“有些人认为AI是泡沫，我们的看法不同。”接着，他花了五分钟解释为什么我们不在泡沫中，为什么这一切都非常真实，列举了AI的各种用例，从机器人技术到Waymo，再到特斯拉FSD和智能体工作流等等。他基本上是在含蓄地告诉所有人闭嘴，认识到这是一家正在以一种前所未有的规模和体量创造着惊人数字的公司，这是人们梦寐以求的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing that he started off with uh on the earnings call was some people think AI is a bubble. We see it differently. And then he goes on for the next five minutes to explain why we're not in a bubble, why a lot of this is very real. all the different use cases of AI from robotics to way mode to Tesla FSD to agentic workflows etc etc and he basically try I mean implicitly he was telling everyone to shut the hell up and realize that this is a company that is putting up numbers that has never been seen before at a scale and size that can only be dreamt of</p>
</details>

我们生活在这个时代，这个市场，这个经济体中，能看到这样的图表，从几年前的10亿美元营收扩展到每个季度510亿美元，这对英伟达来说简直难以置信，但我们正在亲眼见证。问题就来了，这一切都是假的吗？都是泡沫吗？都是炒作吗？这一切会随机崩溃吗？难道英伟达增长如此之快没有任何基础设施或基础范式支撑吗？难道都是虚假和捏造的交易吗？不，需求远大于供给。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean with the fact that we are living at this time in this market in this economy to see these types of charts the scaling from a billion in revenue a couple years ago to 51 billion every quart. I mean, this is just unbelievable for Nvidia, but we're seeing it. And the question then becomes, is all is this fake? Is all this a bubble? Is all of this hoopla? Is all this just going to randomly collapse? Is there no infrastructure or foundational paradigm for why Nvidia is growing this much? Is it all just deals that are fake and manufactured? It's like, no, there is way more demand than supply.</p>
</details>

黄仁勋表示，他们正在尽可能快地发货GPU。他们非常严格地遵守一年的升级周期，以确保公司保持正轨，并且每年对这类产品的需求都在增加。所以，关于我们处于泡沫中的想法，我认为这些担忧并未完全消失，但你需要像我们现在看到的这样一份来自英伟达的财报，至少让人们开始意识到，这种增长可能是非常真实的，而且可能不会很快停止。这种增长可能正在产生非常深远的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As for Jensen, they are getting the GPU shipped as fast as pos possible. there is a one-year upgrade cycle that they are being very very stringent on to make sure that they uh stay the course for that and they have more demand every single year for these types of products. So, I mean, the idea that we're in a bubble, again, I think those fears are not fully gone, but you needed a type of quarter from Nvidia like we're getting right here to get people to at least start realizing maybe the growth is very real and maybe that growth is not stopping anytime soon. And maybe that growth is having very meaningful implications.</p>
</details>

我认为，英伟达昨晚说了很多。除了毛利率扩张和指引外，最重要的一点是他们重申了未来五个季度5000亿美元的营收机会。首席财务官Colette不仅重申了5000亿，她还说：“我们相信，到明年，即2026年，这5000亿的机会还会增长。”换句话说，他们不仅仅是实现650亿美元的营收。他们将在第四季度碾压那个650亿美元的数字，并且很可能在进入2026年后进一步碾压预期。

<p class="english-text">And uh Nvidia, I think, you know, said a lot of things last night. We'll talk about them. The number one thing outside of the gross margin expansion, the guidance is that they reaffirmed the $500 billion uh revenue opportunity in the next five quarters. And the CFO, Colette, she didn't just reaffirm the 500 billion. She said, "We believe that 500 billion opportunity will grow going into the next year for 2026." Aka, they're not going to just do 65 billion in revenue. They are going to crush that $65 billion number in Q4 and likely crush the expectations going even further uh going into 2026.</p>
</details>

因此，华尔街很兴奋。今天早上，各大投行纷纷上调英伟达评级：Evercore给出买入评级，目标价352美元；Melius买入，目标价320美元；KGI买入，目标价296美元；Barrett买入，目标价275美元；巴克莱买入，目标价275美元；Bernstein、花旗、法国巴黎银行、摩根大通、Stifel、Key Bank、Wolf、Jefferies、高盛、Rosenblatt、Mizuho、William Blair、德意志银行、晨星、摩根士丹利、Wedbush，全都给出买入评级。所有这些评级都从210-215美元的区间大幅上调至250美元以上，最高的Evercore和Melius Research甚至给出了300多美元的目标价。我的意思是，每一位分析师都像是在说：“等一下，这里发生了什么？这比预期的要好太多了。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">And as a result, the streets excited. So upgrades across the board this morning for Nvidia. Evercore buy at 352. Melius buy at 320. KGI buy at 296. Barrett buy at 275. Barkclays buy at 275. Bernstein buy. City buy. BNP buy. JP Morgan buy. Stifl by. Key Bank. Wolf buy. Jeff buy. Goldman buy. Rosenblot buy. Mazuo buy. William Blair buy. Deutsche Bank. Morning Star by Morgan Stanley. Buy. Wedbush. Buy. All of these upgraded from 210 to 215. Well into the 250s. the highest being 300s with Evercore and Melius Research. I mean, every single analyst is like, "Wait a second. What is going on here? These are way better than expected."</p>

简单算一下，如果我们假设英伟达在2027年将实现8.5美元的每股收益，那么现在它的市盈率是22倍。这不是泡沫。这不是500倍或1000倍的市盈率。这并不算过高。谁能给我解释一下，22倍的远期市盈率怎么就成了泡沫或狂热？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Simple math on this, and we'll get more deeper into the math as we dive into the numbers over the coming weeks. But if you assume Nvidia is going to do 850 of EPS in 2027, right now they are trading at 22 times earnings. That is not a bubble. That is not 500 times earnings, a thousand times earnings. That is not overly. Someone explain to me how 22 times forward earnings is a bubble or euphoric.</p>
</details>

当然，你可能认为英伟达无法实现那样的每股收益增长，因此22倍的市盈率不存在，因为他们永远达不到每股8.5美元。这很公平。你可以不同意他们创造这些收益的能力。但要说这些市盈率倍数是狂热的，那就有点过了。英伟达的股价得在275到300美元左右，才能让那些远期估值达到40到50倍的范围。有人可能会争辩说，鉴于公司的质量，他们理应获得40到50倍的远期估值。但这更符合那些声称是泡沫的人的论点，因为他们会说，看看这个两年后的倍数，万一发生什么事呢？万一需求下降呢？他们怎么能以这样的水平交易？而现在，他们的交易倍数是22倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you may think Nvidia is not going to put up that EPS growth. Therefore, there is no 22 times earnings because they're never going to get to $8.50 a share in 2027. That's fair. You can disagree with like their ability to generate those earnings. But to say that those earnings multiples are euphoric. I mean, Nvidia would have to be trading somewhere around 27530 to even think those forward estimates are in the 40 to 50 range, which you know, one could argue they deserve a forward estimate of 40 to 50 uh just because the quality of company that they are. But that would be a lot more suited to the argument for the people that are saying it's a bubble because they would be saying look at this multiple two years into future. What if something happens? What if you know the demand goes down? How can they be trading at these levels? They're trading at 22 times.</p>
</details>

所以，这真的说不通。而且那些盈利预期只会越来越高。所以，20倍、25倍、30倍，这些都不是疯狂的倍数。因此，我认为这就是为什么股价上涨了5%，华尔街也为此感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's like it really is not making a ton of sense. And those earnings estimates are only going to go further higher and higher. So, you know, 20 times, 25 times, 30 times. These are not crazy crazy multiples. And as a result, I think that's why the stock is up 5% right here. And the street is getting excited.</p>

### 直面迈克尔·贝瑞的“泡沫论”

现在我们来谈谈贝瑞（Burry）。贝瑞昨晚在推特上发表了一系列言论，我对他的情况有些看法。但英伟达直接回应了贝瑞。他们在财报电话会议上说，贝瑞最大的担忧是什么？是关于折旧，以及折旧不足导致盈利被夸大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now let's talk about Burry. So Burry went on a tweet storm last night and I have some thoughts about what's going on with Burry. But Nvidia answered Burry straight up. So they said in the earnings call, what is Burry's biggest concern? It's about depreciation and the over depreciation that is leading to the uh restate or the underdepreciation that's re re leading to the overstating of earnings.</p>
</details>

英伟达表示，他们六年前出货的A100 GPU，那些感觉像是上个世纪的模型，如今仍在满负荷运行，并且由大幅改进的软件栈提供支持。他们说，凭借**CUDA**（Compute Unified Device Architecture: 计算统一设备架构，是NVIDIA创建的并行计算平台和编程模型，允许软件开发者使用NVIDIA GPU进行通用目的处理）、NVLink以及更好的软件更新能力，他们能够延长芯片的生命周期。这就是为什么他们说自己不再仅仅是一家游戏公司，而是一家全面的人工智能数据基础设施公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia said the A100 GPUs we shipped six years ago. So models from from what feels like a lifetime ago are still running at full utilization today powered by vastly by an improved software stack. We have evolved over the past 25 years from a gaming CPU company to now an AI data center infrastructure company. Essentially, they're saying uh with CUDA, with Envy Link, with their ability to have better software updates, which is essentially what we we've been talking I mean, Ticker, you did a great video on this, and he said that the software updates from Nvidia uh position their ability to extend the life cycle of their chips. And that's why they're saying we're not just a gaming company anymore. We are a full-on AI data infrastructure company.</p>
</details>

他们六年前出货的芯片在各种客户那里仍然完全可用。而且很多客户无法获得Blackwell，因为他们不是XAI，没有优先权。所以他们需要使用像A100这样的产品。从这个角度来看，我真的认为贝瑞是在吹毛求疵。我不是说他完全错了，也不是说他不可能对，更不是说英伟达已经完全摆脱了困境。我的意思是，这只股票可能因为各种不同的原因下跌。但在核心问题上，他的论点开始变得有点可疑了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the chips that we shipped six years ago are still fully operational in a variety of different customers. And a lot of those customers can't get their hands on Blackwell because they're not XAI. They don't have first priority. And so they need to use something like the A100. So from that perspective, I mean, I really do think Burry is is gasping at straws here. I'm not saying he's completely wrong. I'm not saying that he can't be right. I'm not saying that we are even out of the woods on Nvidia. I mean, this stock could go down for a variety of different reasons. But at its core, his claim is starting to get a little sus.</p>
</details>

你知道，一个人在推特上谈论这些东西越多，我就越觉得他们只是在 cố gắng đưa ra một luận điểm。我的意思是，昨晚他从GPU转向谈论股权激励。他说，如果我们看看英伟达从2018年以来的股权激励，再看看股权激励带来的稀释，拜托，这不是人们会真正关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, the more someone tweets about this stuff, the more I think they're they're they're just trying to make an argument. I mean I mean like literally last night he switched from GPUs to start talking about stockbased compensation. He's like, wait, if we look at Nvidia from 2018 and their stockbased comp and then if we look at the dilution from the stockbased comp, it's like, dude, this is not this is not something that people are going to meaningfully care about.</p>
</details>

我也认为这并非更广泛的机构投资者社区所担心的。是的，公司会发行股票，这是他们吸引世界上最优秀人才的方式。顶线和底线的增长率，以及他们的毛利率，这些才是对英伟达这样规模的公司发展轨迹至关重要的基本面。抱怨2018年的股权激励，并试图做一些反向工程数学来证明它被严重高估，这就像在说，嘿，没人会关心这个。如果这是他让整个AI泡沫崩溃的论据，通过抱怨股权激励，那他需要更多的人相信英伟达的故事会继续走高。这个故事在重要的指标上持续显示出上升趋势。投资者会容忍更多的股权激励。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nor is this a concern that I think the broader institutional investor community has. I mean, like, yes, companies will issue stock. That's how they get the best talent in the world. The growth rate on the top and the bottom line, their gross margins, those are the things that fundamentally matter at at at at the trajectory of the company that Nvidia is scaling at. Complaining about stockbased compensation from 2018 and trying to do some reverse engineering math to be like, well, this means that it's deeply overvalued. It's like, no, dude, no one's going to care. Like if if that's his argument to get the entire AI bubble to collapse by complaining about stockbased comp. It's like you need more people to believe there's a story to Nvidia that continues going higher. That story continues to show on the metrics that matter. That's going higher. Investors will tolerate more stockbased comp.</p>
</details>

然后他又发推文说，下面列出的每家公司都有可疑的收入确认方式。他回到了循环融资的论点上。黄仁勋正面回应了这些担忧。他说这不是循环融资，因为那些公司（如Anthropic、OpenAI等）有来自其他业务或其他客户的独立收入。所以，这不仅仅是我们给他们钱，他们再还给我们，然后我们再给他们更多钱，他们再还给我们。他们实际上是在向世界各地的其他人、企业和客户收费，但同时利用我们的投资来扩大业务规模。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then he tweeted that every company listed below has a suspicious revenue recognition. The actual chart with all the give and take deals would be unreadable. So he's going back to the circular financing argument. Jensen addressed those concerns headon. He said it's not circular financing because those companies have independent revenue, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc. from other businesses or from other customers. So they're not just like we're not just giving them the money, they're giving it back to us, and then we're giving them more money, they give it back to us. Like they are actually charging other people, enterprises and customers across the world for money, but they are using our investment in the meantime to be able to scale those businesses.</p>
</details>

第二，他说：“我们有很多钱。”黄仁勋基本上是在说：“伙计，我们钱多得不知道怎么花。”比如，我们不能只是增加两分钱的股息，也不能一直回购股票。他们本季度确实回购了相当一部分股票。他们有600亿美元的现金。他们必须将其投资于整个生态系统。黄仁勋特意解释了为什么他们要投资并支持这个生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, he said, "We have a lot." He essentially, Jensen was like, "Dude, we have so much money, we don't know what to do with it." Like, we can't give a dividend. Uh we can't increase the dividend to two pennies. We can't just keep buying back our stock. They did buy back a decent chunk of stock this quarter. They have 60 billion in cash. Like they have to invest it in the overall ecosystem. And Jensen made a point to really explain why they're investing in that ecosystem and supporting that ecosystem.</p>
</details>

第三点是对AMD的巧妙一击，但也证明了黄仁勋的观点，那就是我们没有放弃公司的股权，而是在获取这些公司的股权。所以，如果你想把事情说得非常循环，比如“哦，这家公司只买你们的芯片，因为他们将获得你们公司的股份”，你或许可以这样争辩，但同样，如果这些公司能够成长，那就不是什么大问题。黄仁勋的意思是：“伙计，我们投资公司，给他们一些资金，让他们能够继续执行他们的需求，如果他们做得好，我们就获得股权。”换句话说，如果OpenAI或Anthropic倒闭了，英伟达是最终的接盘者。他们持有股权。所以，如果英伟达想把这个盘子做大，只是为了在最后接盘，因为这是一个神奇的泡沫，那就没什么意义了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the third point was a nice shot at AMD, but nonetheless, it kind of proves Jensen's point, which is that we are not giving up equity in our company. We are getting equity in these companies. So, if you want to call things super circular that, oh, this company's only buying your chips because they're going to get a stake in your company, like you can maybe make an argument for that, but again, if those companies can grow, then it's not going to be the biggest deal in the world. Jensen's like, "Dude, we're we're investing in companies and we're giving them some funding to be able to keep executing on their needs and if they do well, we get equity." Aka, if OpenAI collapses or Anthropic collapses, Nvidia is the one holding the bag. They're the one with the equity. So, it's like if Nvidia wants to pump up the bag just to hold it at the end of the day because it's some magic bubble. It doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

### 对迈克尔·贝瑞动机的心理分析

关于迈克尔·贝瑞，我的简单看法是，我认为他怀念2008年的辉煌岁月。我真的认为，从心理分析的角度来看，迈克尔·贝瑞在过去15年里一直在追逐他想重温的那种快感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now in terms of Michael Burry my my simple answer right here to what's going on with Burry is that I think and I said this a couple days ago but I I really do think it's based on a his tweet storm last night. I really do think this is true. I think he misses the glory days of 2008. I really think Michael Burry from a psychoanalytical perspective has been chasing the high that he has wanted to get back to over the past um 15 years.</p>
</details>

当你孤身一人，与全世界为敌，全世界都告诉你你错了，而你坚持己见，说：“不，我会是对的。”然后你最终被证明是对的，并赚了十亿美元。我的意思是，作为一个人，如果我们都退一步思考一下，那是一种非常特别的感觉。那种感觉一定是一种极度的快感，他再也无法企及，所以从人性的角度来看，你会想再次获得那种感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's a very special feeling when you're on the island, you're by yourself, you're up against the world, the world tells you you're wrong, and you stick with your guns and you say, "Nope, I'm going to be right." And then you end up being right and you make a billion dollars. I mean, just like as a human being, if we all step back and we think about that and you know what is investing? Investing is at the end of the day where we're dealing with emotion, psychology, etc. like that feeling must have been such a euphoric high that he has never been able to achieve again that as as you know just like from a human nature perspective you would want to get that feeling</p>
</details>

他试图再次追逐，但每次都错了。他从未有过第二次“大空头”。我认为他正在审视AI领域，将循环融资、估值、折旧等点点滴滴联系起来，然后回到了那种心态：“嘿，我觉得我正在像当年处理抵押贷款支持证券危机时一样，把这些点串联起来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he's tried to chase it again he's tried and he's been wrong every time he's tried to he has never had a big short 2.0 Oh, and I think he's looking at the AI landscape. He's connecting the dots around circular financing, valuation, uh, depreciation, yada yada, and he's going back into that mindset of, hey, I feel like I'm connecting the dots just like I was with the mortgage back securities crisis.</p>
</details>

他一生中可能再也不会有这样的机会，去识别一个他现在试图拼凑的谜题，然后将自己的名字与这个谜题联系在一起，称之为现代历史上最大的泡沫。如果不是AI生态系统，我不知道是否还会有这样的机会。现在，作为投资者，你必须问自己，你真的相信这是一个泡沫吗？我想我们大多数人都同意它不是。我们正在用数据来支持这一点。但我认为，从心理分析的角度来看，贝瑞是在说：“这是我的机会。这是我再次成为那个人的机会。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's never going to be an opportunity again, probably for the rest of his life, where he can identify some puzzle that he is now trying to put together and then be able to attach his name to that puzzle as the biggest bubble in modern history. Like if it's not the AI ecosystem, I don't know if there would ever be an opportunity like that again. Now, this is where as an investor, you have to ask yourself, do you actually believe it's a bubble? I think majority of us agree that it's not. And we're looking at the data to back that up. But Burry I think is from a psychoanalytical perspective saying this is my opportunity. This is my shot to be the guy again.</p>
</details>

### 中国因素：出口管制或将松动

我们一直说，我们对中国的预测是零。我们展示的所有预测指引都是零。她还说，中国对我们来说是一个非常重要的市场。这对美国很重要，对中国也很重要。我们非常希望有机会能用我们提供的优秀产品重新进入中国市场，并能够在全球范围内竞争。中国市场今年非常大，我猜大概有500亿美元。我们能在中国市场竞争对美国人民来说是件好事。我们能向中国市场提供英伟达的技术对他们来说也是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've said for some time now, our forecast for China is zero. All of our forecast guidance that we showed zero. We should start that's the most important thing that she said. She also said that effectively China is a very important market to us. It's very important to United States. It's very important to China. We would love the opportunity to be able to re-engage the Chinese market with excellent products that we deliver and to be able to compete globally. The Chinese market is very large this year. My guess is probably about $50 billion. It's great for the American people that we're able to compete in the Chinese market. It's great for the China market that we're able to provide Nvidia's technology to them.</p>
</details>

现在，所有这些指引都是在不考虑中国市场的情况下做出的。昨晚深夜，我们从彭博社得到了一个更新，这再次为英伟达可能不是泡沫的论点提供了支持。据彭博社报道，白宫正在要求国会否决一项限制英伟达对华出口的法案。这个消息是昨晚深夜传出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this. Now, all this guidance is without China. And late last night, we got an update from Bloomberg, which is again fueling the argument for Nvidia potentially not being a bubble. The White House is asking Congress, as for Bloomberg, to reject a bill curbing Nvidia exports to China. That came out late last night.</p>
</details>

现在，我对这部分有点困惑，因为几周前，特朗普在空军一号上明确表示，我们不会将Blackwell芯片运往中国。他非常明确地说，我们不想把Blackwell运到中国。而马可·卢比奥是说服特朗普不要这么做的主要人物之一。但过去几周发生了一些事情。主要发生了什么？第一，股市下跌了。第二，生活成本危机变得更加严重，人们开始担心通货膨胀和生活成本等问题，特朗普在股市上开始失去一些动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this part I'm a little confused on because Jensen or not Jensen, Trump literally on Air Force One a couple weeks ago said that we are not going to have um we are not going to have uh Blackwell shipped to China. I mean, he quite literally said we don't want to ship Blackwell to China. And Marco Rubio was kind of the main guy that convinced Trump to not do this. Um but things have happened over the past couple weeks. What are the main things that have happened? Number one, the stock market's gone down. Number two, uh this affordability crisis started becoming a lot bigger of a thing and you know people started being concerned about inflation and and and and the cost of living etc. and and Trump kind of started losing some steam in the stock market.</p>
</details>

我认为特朗普正在从战略角度看待英伟达财报对市场的影响。如果你认为特朗普昨晚没有看到市场，没有看到英伟达财报超预期，整个市场市值增加了近7000亿美元，其中英伟达增加了约3000亿美元，那你就错了。特朗普看到了，我认为他意识到，好吧，我们得让这场派对继续下去。为了让派对继续，我们可能不得不牺牲一点国家安全，以允许英伟达开始向中国销售芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Trump is taking a strategic look at what Nvidia earnings just did to the market. I mean if you're thinking Trump did not see the market last night and didn't see Nvidia beat earnings and the entire market adds almost 700 billion in market cap, Nvidia adding about 300 billion. Trump saw that and I think he's realizing, all right, we got to keep this party going. We got to keep this party party going. And in order to keep this party going, we might have to sacrifice a bit of national security in order to allow Nvidia to start selling chips into China.</p>
</details>

现在，我仍然怀疑他们能否获得批准，因为特朗普这个人，你永远不知道他会怎么做。但根据彭博社的报道，似乎白宫和政府官员，比如大卫·萨克斯等人，都认识到英伟达对国内每一个401k账户是何等重要，如果这家公司崩溃将是多么糟糕。而让它不崩溃并保持其强劲的收入机会的一部分，就是中国市场。顺便说一句，即使没有中国市场，他们也已经获得了300美元的目标价上调。有了中国市场，你每年将增加200到300亿美元的收入。我的意思是，这完全改变了估算，并可能让英伟达保持强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I'm still skeptical that they're going to get the clearances because again with Trump, you just never know. But based on that Bloomberg reporting, it does seem like uh the the the the president or the the the White House and administration officials, you got David Sax, all those guys are recognizing how unbelievably vital Nvidia is to every single 401k in the country, how abysmal it would be if this thing collapses and part of it not collapsing and keeping the revenue opportunity as strong as it is. And by the way, without China, it already I mean, without China, they're getting upgrades to $300. with China, you're talking about an extra 20 to $30 billion a year in revenue. I mean, that completely changes the estimates again and likely keeps Nvidia strong.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为有一种说法是他们会重新获得中国市场。如果他们做到了，那就太好了。他们昨天重新获得了中东市场，沙特阿拉伯签署了一份7万颗芯片的协议。还有另一份60万颗芯片的协议正在准备购买。我们目前从英伟达获得的所有收入和所有指引都不包括中东。如果你把中东带回来，再把中国带回来，也许这真的会对更广泛的经济有很大帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I I think there is an argument that they get China back and if they do, they did they got the Middle East back yesterday. Saudi Arabia signed a deal for 70,000 chips. There's another deal for 600,000 chips that they're getting ready to purchase. Uh all the revenue, all the guidance that we've got so far from Nvidia does not include Middle East. you bring the Middle East back, you bring China back, maybe that ends up really really helping the uh the broader economy.</p>

### 沃尔玛业绩稳健，消费市场显现分化

沃尔玛公布了财报。这家主要的消费品牌今天早上发布了业绩。沃尔玛报告调整后每股收益为62美分，增长7%，比华尔街共识高出2美分。营收为1795亿美元，同比增长5.8%，也高于华尔街1774.3亿美元的预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Walmart, we got Walmart earnings. Let's bring those up. Walmart slightly flat right here in the pre-markets, but we did get a major consumer brand with their earnings this morning. Just coming in with its earnings. Uh we've been waiting for that release. Courtney Reagan is standing by and she has the numbers. Hi Beck. Yes. So Walmart reporting adjusted adjusted earnings here of 62 cents. That's up 7% and it is 2 cents above the streets consensus on revenues of 179.5 billion. That's up 5.8% from last year. Also above the streets 177.43 billion estimate.</p>
</details>

在本财年还剩一个季度的情况下，该零售商第二次上调了全年销售和盈利预测。现在预计营收将增长4.8%至5.1%，盈利将在2.58至2.63美分之间，调整后营业利润将增长4.8%至5.5%，高于此前持平的预测。

<p class="english-text">With one quarter left in the fiscal year, the retailer is upping its fullear forecast for sales and earnings for the second time. Now expecting revenues to grow between 4.8 and 5.1% and for earnings to fall in a range of 258 to 263 cents. and adjusted operating income to grow between 4.8% to 5.5%. That's up from its previous forecast of flat.</p>
</details>

美国可比门店销售额增长了4.5%，好于分析师4%的预期，这也是连续第45个季度的增长，表现出广泛的强势。美国电子商务增长了28%，略高于全球电子商务的增长速度。广告业务Walmart Connect在美国增长了33%，全球增长了53%。

<p class="english-text">Now, US comparable store sales grew 4 and a half%. That's bettering analysts 4% estimate. also the 45th straight quarter of growth with broad-based strength. E-commerce grew 28% in the US. That's slightly outpacing the global e-commerce growth. Walmart Connect, that's the advertising business, it grew 33% in the US, 53% globally.</p>
</details>

我与首席财务官John David Rainey交谈，问他沃尔玛为何没有像其他公司那样感受到宏观经济压力。他说：“如果消费者面临一点额外的压力，他们只会变得更加挑剔，寻找更多的价值，变得更有选择性。我们继续证明，我们的价值主张与我们的会员和消费者产生了非常强烈的共鸣。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I spoke with CFO John David Rainey and asked how Walmart didn't see the same macroeconomic pressure on its results as others have called out. He said, "If there's a little incremental strain on the consumer, they're only going to become more selective to to look for more value, going to become more choiceful. We continue to demonstrate that our value proposition is resonating really strongly with our members and consumers."</p>
</details>

这很有道理。归根结底，如果人们在成本意识方面开始感到压力，他们显然会去像沃尔玛这样价格最低的地方。他们上调了全年预期，我认为这相当了不起。沃尔玛股价上涨了3%。顺便说一句，至少据我从CEO过去的言论中了解，沃尔玛这样做并没有将成本转嫁给消费者，因为他们非常希望与特朗普政府保持良好关系。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, look, this makes sense. Walmart, at the end of the day, if people start feeling some pressure when it comes to um being costconcious, they're obviously going to go to places like Walmart that already have the lowest prices. The fact that they increased their uh fullear estimates I think is quite incredible. Walmart right there 3%. And by the way, Walmart's doing this, at least from my understanding, from what the CEO has said in the past by not putting the cost on the consumer because they really want to keep a good relationship with the uh with the Trump administration</p>

上调预期，营收和每股收益双双超预期，股价上涨3%，进入假日季节。对于像沃尔玛这样的公司来说，这并非坏事。这也帮助了许多防御性股票，如家得宝、塔吉特、劳氏等，它们的盈利也保持稳定。当然，塔吉特昨天降低了部分指引。所以，很多这取决于你公司的实力。但你并没有看到大型零售商普遍下调盈利并说消费者不行了。你没有看到这种情况。你从Chipotle和星巴克那里看到了，这可能是Chipotle和星巴克的问题，不应忽视其对消费者整体健康状况的影响，但你没有从沃尔玛那里看到，这是非常重要的一点。

<p class="english-text">increasing estimates, beating revenue, beating EPS up 3% going into the holiday season. Not the worst thing for a company like Walmart. And that's actually helping a lot of the defensives like a Home Depot, Target, Lowe's, etc. that have been uh holding up their earnings as well. Now again, Target decreased some of their guidance yesterday. So, a lot of this comes down to how good of a company are you? But it's not like you're seeing broad-based uh big box retailers like slash their earnings and say the consumer sucks. No one's buying stuff. Everyone's scared. You know, we have a real issue. You're just not seeing that. You're seeing that from Chipotle and Starbucks. And maybe that's a problem with Chipotle and Starbucks and that shouldn't be ignored for the overall health of the consumer, but you're not seeing it from a Walmart, which is a very important thing.</p>

我们采访了克利夫兰联邦储备银行行长贝丝·哈莫克。她对今天早上的就业报告的看法是：“我们只有很短的时间来分析这份报告，而且这只是一个数字。我们不会对任何单一报告做过多解读。而且这份报告有点过时了，因为它来自九月份。看起来这是一份好坏参半的报告，但这符合我的预期，即我们会看到就业市场进一步走软，这凸显了当前货币政策的艰难时期，因为我们看到劳动力市场出现了一些疲软迹象，但通胀迹象依然高企。”

<p class="english-text">I am at the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank with the president, Beth Hammock. Uh Beth, thank you for having us here in Cleveland. Steve, we're thrilled that you came out and made the trip. Great. What an interesting conference you're putting on about financial stability. A good time for that, but also good time to talk about the outlook for Fed policy. Uh let's start with the easy thing, which is my question about your takeaway from this morning's jobs report. Um well, we've only had a short amount of time to break down the report, and it's only just one number. Again, we don't make too much of any one individual report. And this one is a bit stale. It's a bit dated because it comes from September. Um, it does look like it was a mixed report, but it's in line with my expectation that we we would see some further softening in the jobs market, which just highlights the difficult time that this is for monetary policy because we are seeing some signs of softening in the labor market, but we're still seeing elevated signs of inflation.</p>

基本上，她是在说不降息。可悲的是，普通美国人没有时间去理解这些。当她说我们需要更具限制性时，我们所有人都明白这意味着什么，因为我们每天都在关注。但对于不关注美联储的普通人来说，即使他们生活中的每一个货币决策，无论是买房、买车还是信用卡，都取决于这些利率，他们也没有时间去理解她的话。但她基本上是在说：“不，我们不打算降息。”考虑到我们看到的劳动力市场数据，这相当荒谬。但这是又一位站在基本立场上说我们限制性还不够的美联储主席。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Basically, she's saying no. And the sad thing is the average American does not have time to peace like the fact that when she says we need to be more restrictive, all of us have an understanding of what that means because we're like we're in it every day. But the average person who does not keep up with the Fed, even though their entire life and every monetary decision they make in terms of a house or a car or credit cards, all of that depends on these interest rates. They don't have time to understand what that what she's saying. But she's basically saying, "No, we're not going to cut rates." And it is quite ridiculous given the type of labor market data we're seeing. But this is another Fed president that's on the side of basically saying we're not restrictive enough,</p>

### 市场深度回调，宏观担忧压倒企业业绩

我们刚刚突破了标普500指数的50日移动平均线。看，股市在这些财报面前下跌，意味着我同意你的看法，史蒂夫。这真的与英伟达无关。这是别的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We just lost the 50-day moving average on the S&P. So, look, the the the fact that stocks are falling in the face of these earnings means I think I agree with you, Steve. This really has nothing to do with Nvidia. This is some</p>
</details>

不，这与英伟达无关。我的意思是，这是……大家真的想一想，当你看到这些数字时，如果你把英伟达的股价定在225美元，它的市盈率是24倍。我将高亮显示英伟达，225美元时是24倍。你可以把它定在250美元，26倍，它仍然比苹果在250美元一股时便宜。

<p class="english-text">No, it has nothing to do with Nvidia. I mean this is and really think about this everybody when you look at these numbers okay if you put Nvidia 225 okay it's 24 times let's I'm going to highlight Nvidia 24 times at 225 you can put it at 250 26 times it's still cheaper than Apple at 250 a share</p>
</details>

宏观环境不好，我现在就可以告诉你。看，所有那些试图把AI问题轻描淡写的人，他们都错了。AI将成为就业市场的一个问题。我很抱歉，但我对未来10到15年就业市场的状况感到极度担忧，但这并不能改变这些公司正以有吸引力的估值进行交易的事实。一件事与另一件事无关。现在，我们的民选官员需要为AI和就业问题想出办法，但这与股市无关。每个人都需要把这两件事分开。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The macro is not good. I will tell you that right now. Look, all the people that are trying to play this off like AI isn't a problem and all this stuff, they're wrong. AI is going to be a problem in the job market. I'm sorry, but I am deathly worried about what the job market becomes in the next 10 or 15 years, but that doesn't change the fact that these companies are trading at attractive valuations. One thing does not have to do with the other. Now, our elected officials need to figure something out for AI and jobs, but that has nothing to do with the stock market. And everybody needs to separate those two things.</p>

是的，但公平地说，AMD在过去一年里仍然上涨了50%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But in all fairness, AMD is still up 50% over the past year.</p>
</details>

嗯，看，这就是问题所在，人们听到这个会觉得烦，但这是事实。我也必须在像英伟达、Palantir、Hood这样的股票上内化这一点。这些股票都上涨了，Robinhood今年仍然上涨了200%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, see, and that's the thing, and people get annoyed hearing this, but it's true. And I have to internalize this myself on names like Nvidia Pounder Hood. These names are up, Robin. It's still up 200% this year. Like</p>
</details>

大多数人不是在200美元买入AMD的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">most people weren't buying AMD at 200.</p>

是的。我只是说，市场上有许多事情正在形成一个与其它公司无关的整体故事。我只是这么说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm just saying that there are things about the market that are creating an overall story that has nothing to do with other companies. That's all I'm saying.</p>

我同意这一点。显然有一些名字，比如你提到的很多量子计算公司、核能公司、Oaklo，很多这类股票都疯狂上涨。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I agree there. There are obviously names like you got a lot of quantum names, nuclear names, Oak, like a lot of this stuff ran up like crazy.</p>

所以，我同意你的看法。只是当你看到像Meta或英伟达这样的公司受到如此大的冲击，然后显然会把Rocket Lab这样的公司拉下水，而且幅度更大，这就为很多人制造了一场丑陋的风暴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so I agree with you there. It's just when you see like a Meta or an Nvidia get hit the way they're getting hit and then obviously it's going to take a rocket lap down way more than than that that creates an ugly storm for a lot of people.</p>
</details>

看，很多持有英伟达的人平均成本在110到120美元之间。所以，我们真的在抱怨它现在是189美元吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And look, a lot of people that are in Nvidia have an average of 110 to 120. So yeah, are we really complaining that it's at 189?</p>
</details>

不。而且我，我，我也不认为……我同意。我认为没有理由抱怨。我的意思是，即使我们，你和我之前都说，即使财报后股价能维持在185美元，我们也会很高兴。只是那种几乎每天都会发生的“拉地毯”式的下跌，先是上涨，然后……我认为这才是真正让人们在情感上……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. And I I I I don't I agree. I don't think there's cost to complain for I mean, even if we even I you and me said if we even stay at 185, we'd be happy after earnings. It's just the the rugpull that seems to happen almost every day where we go up and that's I think what's really emotionally</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我不知道我们是否能说Alphabet在299美元是拉盘，或者亚马逊在223美元是拉盘。我的意思是，我们可以说……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I I don't know if we can say that Alphabet at 299 is a rug pull or Amazon 223 is a rug pull. I mean we can say</p>
</details>

亚马逊绝对是。亚马逊在260美元时，那一次把所有人都拉下水了。谷歌，你说得对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon definitely Amazon at 260. That one pulled everybody. Google, you're right.</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，看，亚马逊在223美元。我仍然认为它被低估了，但我们没有看到它跌到150美元。看，有些公司需要回归现实，有些公司值得更高。但每个市场都是这样，这让人沮丧，但看，仍然有很多伟大的公司，我们需要完成一些事情。你需要海外的战争结束。你需要更低的利率，我们需要美联储开始降息，就这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean look, Amazon 223. I mean I it's still I think undervalued but we're not seeing it at 150. Look there are companies that need to come back to reality and there are companies that deserve to be higher but that's every market and it's getting frustrating but look there are still great companies out there and we need to get some things done. You need the war to end overseas. You need lower rates and we need to have the Fed start cutting that period.</p>
