title: 顶级绩效教练：《内心卓越》作者揭示在高压下保持冷静与实现人生意义的原则
---

### 决定生活质量的三大基石

**Shane:** 我想从《内心卓越》这本书开始。你写了这本书，希望整理出一本关于如何在压力下保持坚韧心智和卓越表现的手册。我在这本书里划的第一个重点，甚至还没到正文页码，就在序言里。你提到，人生的质量取决于三个要素：你由思想、情感、信念和欲望构成的内心世界；你看待世界的参照系和心态；以及你的人际关系。你是如何得出这个结论的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: I want to start with this book, Inner Excellence. So, you wrote this book. You wanted to put together a manual on mental toughness and performance under pressure. And the first thing I highlighted in this book, it's it's not even on a page number. It's in the preface here is the quality of your life is based on three elements. your inner world of thoughts and feelings, beliefs and desires, your frame of reference, mindset from which you see the world and your relationships. How did you hit on that?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 嗯，这本书是我五年全职写作和研究的成果。所以这是一种非常整体性的方法，我认为如果你想实现人性的优化，你就需要这样做。我们需要采取整体性的视角，需要超越思维层面，深入到内心和潜意识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Well, I mean this was the book was 5 years of full-time writing and research. And so that is a very holistic approach and that and I think that's what you need if you want human optimization. We need to be holistic. We need to get deeper than just the mind. We need to go into the heart into the subconscious.</p>
</details>

所以，在五年全职写作和研究并最终凝结成《内心卓越》的过程中，我最早意识到的事情之一就是，如果你想真正帮助任何人——无论你是顾问、父母、教练，还是你自己——我们都需要触及你最深的恐惧和你最伟大的梦想。那个潜意识、心灵、精神、神经的层面，就是我们必须达到的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's one of the in the 5 years of full-time writing and research that became inner excellence. That was one of the first things that I realized is that if you want to really help anybody, whether you're a counselor, a parent, a coach, yourself, we need to get to where your greatest fears are and your greatest dreams. And that subconscious, heart, spirit, neuro level is where we got to get to.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 你生命中是否有某个瞬间让你意识到这一点，还是这是一个缓慢觉醒的过程？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: Is there a moment in your life where you realize this or was it this slow sort of awakening?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 我想我的背景都在其中发挥了作用，我经历的一切都在训练我。我生命中所有艰难的、真正可怕和低谷的时期，上帝都在训练我。当时我并不知道，但现在我能看得更清楚了。这不仅仅是写书的五年，还包括我所有的经历，你知道，我母亲的背景，我父亲加入哈特派的社区背景，我兄弟和我的精神背景，所有这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Well, I think my background kind of all played into it and and I think everything that I've been through has been training me. All the all the hard times, the really scary times and low times in my life, God's been training me. I didn't know it at the time, but now I can see it much clearer now. It was not just the five years of writing the book, but there was all my experiences and, you know, my mom's background and community background that my dad got into with the Hutterites and my brother and the spiritual background, all of that.</p>
</details>

### 卓越表现与美好生活是同一条路

**Shane:** 这本书的核心领悟似乎是，追求非凡表现和追求最美好的人生是同一回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: The key realization of the book seems to be that the pursuit of extraordinary performance and the pursuit of the best possible life are the same thing.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的，在沙漠中意识到这一点，对我来说确实是改变人生的经历。事情是这样的，我舍弃了超过一半的财产，去过一种独居的生活，想弄清楚我的人生该做什么。我想找到一件可以奉献一生去追求的事情。在那里，我决定成为职业棒球运动员的私人教练，教他们如何在压力下保持平和与自信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah, that was that was really a life-changing thing for me to realize in the desert. So, kind of how that happened was I give away over half my possessions to go live in a life of solitude to figure out what to do with my life. I wanted to find something that I could devote my life to. And when I was there, I decided to become a personal coach to pro baseball players and teach them how to have peace and confidence under pressure.</p>
</details>

在我最初的两个客户取得了惊人的成绩后，我开始为未来的客户整理这本手册。在研究过程中我意识到，如果我花一辈子让人们变得非常成功——无论是赢得奥运金牌、成为世界第一，还是赚取数百万美元——但如果这并未在他们的内心和这个世界上产生任何改变，如果只是让他们更成功，那甚至可能不是一件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so then I started to put together this manual for future clients after my first two clients did amazing. And what I realized in the research was that what good is it if I spend my life making people really successful? Whether it's winning an Olympic gold medal or being world number one or making millions of dollars, if it doesn't make a difference in their heart and in the world, if it just makes them more successful, like that may not even be a good thing.</p>
</details>

后来我发现，教导一个人如何在最大压力下保持最佳沉着状态的路径，与过上最美好人生的路径是相同的——那是一种有意义、充实的生活，充满了奇妙的经历和深刻丰富的关系，在其中你不断学习、成长并创造价值。这是同一条路，一条全心投入的路。当我意识到这一点时，一切都改变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then when I found out that to teach someone how to have the most poise under the most pressure is the same path as living the best possible life, a meaningful fulfilling life with with amazing experiences and deepen enriching relationships where you're learning and growing and making a difference. It's the same path, a wholehearted path. When I when I realized that, that's when everything changed.</p>
</details>

这就是**内心卓越**（Inner Excellence）的含义：教导一个人如何全心投入，如何行走在爱中而非恐惧中，如何发展自我、优化自我，并成为真实的自己。然后，你在每个方面都会变得更好——你成为一个更好的运动员、更好的父母、更好的教练，你变得更加临在、更加优雅、更加有觉知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what inner excellence is. is to teach someone how to be wholehearted, how to walk in love and not fear and develop yourself as a person and optimize that and become your true self. And then you're better at every you're a better athlete, you're a better parent, better coach, you're more present, more gracious, more aware.</p>
</details>

### 一本无人问津的书如何一夜成名

**Shane:** 我想深入探讨一下如何发展自我，并利用这期节目来教导人们什么是内心卓越，以及他们如何在压力下表现，同时过上更有意义的生活。但在那之前，我想谈谈这本书。这本书是怎么来的？我们花点时间聊聊这个，因为据我了解，你写了这本书，然后几乎没人读过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: I want to dive into this developing ourselves as a person and use this episode as a a means to sort of teach people inner excellence and how they can perform under pressure and also live a life of more meaning. But before we get there, I want to talk about the book. How did the book come about? Let's spend a beat on this for a second because my understanding is you wrote this book and then almost nobody read it.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的，没错。这本书在2009年出版。我写这本书是因为我想写出有史以来最好的关于心智坚韧的书，并想用它作为我客户的手册，我可以把它交给他们说：“这是你训练心智和内心的方法。”它在这方面效果很好。它不是一本畅销书，但在这方面效果极佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah, that's right. So the book came out in 2009 and uh I wrote the book because I wanted to write the best best book ever on mental toughness and I wanted to use that as a manual for my clients to use that that I can give them and say here's how you train your your mind and your heart. It worked great for that. It wasn't a big seller but it worked great for that.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，我手机上曾设置过提醒。我建议我所有的客户都设置这些无声的提醒，这些自我肯定的话语每天都会在一天中不断出现。我其中一条就是“我是一位《纽约时报》畅销书作家”，这个提醒持续了15、16年，但一直没有实现。所以几年后，我把它删掉了。这本书作为我最初设想的手册，以及为吸引其他客户，都做得很好。这很棒，但它不是一本畅销书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And interesting enough I had on my phone I I I recommend to all my clients that they they have these reminders silent reminders that come up these affirmations every day throughout the day. And one of mine was that I'm a New York Times bestselling author and it had been 15 years 16 years and so and that had happened. So after a few years I took it off. The book was was doing great for what I wrote it for as this manual and and for other clients to to get other clients. So that was amazing but it wasn't a big seller.</p>
</details>

然后在2018年，我从麦格劳-希尔公司拿回了版权，之后我又花了两年时间，每周大约20小时进行修订。修订版在2020年出版。我原以为新版会有15%的不同，但结果大约85%都是新故事，概念相同，但故事是新的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then so 2018 I got the rights from McGraw-Hill and then I spent two more years of of uh part-time maybe 20 hours a week revising it. So that came out in 2020. The book I I thought it was going to be 15% different, but it turned out to be about 85% new stories and same concepts, but new stories.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 然后我猜大多数人发现它的方式和我一样。我当时在看NFC季后赛，看到AJ·布朗在场边读这本书，然后这突然成了所有人谈论的焦点。你当时在哪里？发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: And then I assume most people found it the way I did. I was watching the NFC playoff game and saw AJ Brown on the sideline reading this book and then that became the focal point of what everybody was talking about all of a sudden. Where were you? What happened there?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的。当时我在德克萨斯州的达拉斯。我在那里是为了举办一个国际静修活动。我待在酒店房间里。那一周非常紧张，原因有很多。那是1月12日，星期天。我母亲在1月16日去世了，她91岁，度过了精彩的一生，对我的生活产生了巨大影响，教会了我很多。她的离世是对祈祷的回应，因为她当时正在受苦。但那是一个非常沉重的星期，也是我生命中一段缓慢的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah. So, I was in Dallas, Texas. Um, I was there to write to do an international retreat and uh I'm in my hotel room. What was amazing about that week, it was such an intense week for many reasons. So January 12th was that Sunday. My mom died January 16th and she was 91. She had an amazing life, had a huge impact on my life and taught me so much. So it was an answer to prayer because she was suffering. But it was a very somber week and also kind of a slow week um in my life.</p>
</details>

多年来，我的父母和姐姐相继去世，我一直努力照顾他们，事情进展缓慢，生意也很惨淡。一月份我甚至没有还清信用卡。我有一些投资，但支票账户里没有钱。那个周日下午，我抬头看着达拉斯市中心的一座摩天大楼，我刚写完一本名为《最美好的人生：无论如何都能活出深刻的满足、喜悦和自信》的书。这是一本更小、更容易读的书，关于精神生活，可以看作是《内心卓越》的总结。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and just it'd been years of kind of my both parents died and my sister died and trying to care for them and things were slow and business was slow and I actually didn't pay off my credit cards in January. I had money in investments but I didn't have any in my checking and I look up at the skyscraper in downtown Dallas that Sunday afternoon and and I had just written a book called The Best Possible Life: How to Live with Deep Contempt, Joy, and Confidence No Matter What. It's a a a much smaller, easier book to read and on the spiritual life and kind of a summary of inner excellence.</p>
</details>

那本书刚出版，我记得那天下午看着那座摩天大楼，一个念头闪过：吉姆，你是愿意拥有那座价值数亿美元的摩天大楼，还是愿意写出《最美好的人生》这本书？我想，不，我不会用它换取数亿美元。所以我对自己说，好吧，至少你拥有这个，这很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that book had just come out and I remember looking at the skyscraper that afternoon and and the thought came to me was Jim, would you rather own that skyscraper for whatever hundreds of millions of dollars it's worth or would you rather have written the book the best possible life? And I thought, no, I wouldn't trade it for hundreds of millions of dollars. And so I thought, well, at least you got that. That's pretty cool.</p>
</details>

几个小时后，一切都变了。我的人生彻底改变了。我当时正在看一场已经结束的宾州州立大学对阵圣母大学的碗赛重播。我看了看手机，发现有很多短信，我以为是我妈妈去世了，不然怎么会有这么多短信？然后有人说：“你得打开老鹰队的比赛看看。”我打开电视，看到了那一幕。就在那时，我和全世界一起发现，他（AJ·布朗）在读这本书，每场比赛都带着，赛前读以保持专注，每次进攻结束后也读。我一个月前看到过一张他在场边拿着书的照片，但当时并不了解背景。是的，从那时起，大量的采访请求和所有事情都接踵而至。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then a couple hours later, everything changed. My whole life changed. I'm watching Penn State play Notre Dame, a bowl game that had already happened. I look at my phone and I see all these texts and I thought my mom died because why all the texts? And then obviously someone said, "You need to turn on the the Eagles game." And so I turn it on and I see it. And that's when I found out with the rest of the world that that he was reading the book, you know, bringing the book to every game, reading it before games to get centered and reading it after every drive. I saw him with a picture of him with a book on the sidelines a month before, but I had no context. And so, yeah, that's when the barrage of interview requests and and everything started happening.</p>
</details>

### 清洁燃料 vs. 肮脏燃料：你的动力源自何处？

**Shane:** 有几件事让我觉得很有趣。我想稍微回溯一下。你的一个自我肯定是成为《纽约时报》畅销书作家。这听起来像是一个结果导向的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: It's interesting to me in a couple things. I want to go back just for a second. One of your affirmations was to be a New York Times bestselling author. That sounds like an outcome.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 我是这么想的：我的工作是帮助人们实现结果，他们付钱给我。他们不是来找我感觉更好或过上更有灵性的生活，至少过去10到20年我的收入来源是这样。但我们是通过一种精神性的方法来做到的。当我说精神性，我指的是一种以心灵为中心、比我们生活的交易世界更深层次的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: The way I think about this is so I get paid to help people achieve outcomes. They don't come to me to feel better or have a more spiritual life. as far as my the way I've been paid the last 10 20 years, but we do it through a a spiritual approach. When I say spirit, a heartfocused much deeper approach than the transactional world that we live in.</p>
</details>

我把我们生活的这个充满结果和境遇的世界称为“第一世界”，把你的内心世界称为“第二世界”，而“第三世界”是那个看不见的、永恒的世界，它拥有所有美好的事物，如爱、喜悦、和平、内在力量和心智坚韧。所以，在充满结果和境遇的“第一世界”里，我确实有目标，比如成为《纽约时报》畅销书作家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I have what I call third world goals. I use I call the the world that we live in of of results and circumstances the first world. And the second world is your inner world. And then the first world is the unseen world that's uh eternal and has every good thing like love, joy, peace, inner inner strength, mental toughness. And so the third world of results and circumstances, I have goals there. Like one goal was to be a New York Times bestselling author.</p>
</details>

但关键是，这些都只是暂时的东西，我甚至不知道它们是否对我有益。我的意思是，我们都有目标，但它们对你有好处吗？它们是你的最佳选择吗？我们甚至不知道。所以我试着对它们保持一种轻松的态度，知道我确实有这些欲望和目标，但与我正在成为的那个人相比，它们微不足道。我的使命是与世界分享上帝的好消息——他的爱、智慧和勇气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the crucial thing is those are just temporary things that I don't even know if it's good for me. I mean there's we all have goals, but are they good for you? Are they the best thing for you? We don't even know if they're good for you. And so I try to hold them loosely knowing that that yeah, I have these desires and goals, but they're nothing compared to who I'm becoming. And uh to share God's good news with the world, his love, wisdom, and courage. I that's my purpose.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 当你的目标实现后，你感觉如何？你登上了《纽约时报》畅销书榜，不仅上榜，还拿了第一名，卖出了十万册以上，这无论如何都是巨大的成功。这有点像梦想成真，对吧？你写了这本书，去了沙漠，埋头苦干，然后什么也没发生。突然有一天，有人认识到这部作品的惊人之处。这让你感到满足，还是空虚？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: and how did you feel after you made so your goal came true? You hit the New York Times bestseller list. Not only did you hit it, you were number one, you sold 100,000 or more copies of the book, which is just a runaway success by any measure of any book ever. And it's sort of like this dream, right? Like you wrote this book, you went to the desert, you put your head down, and then nothing happened. And then one day suddenly somebody recognized how amazing this work was. Did that feel satisfying to you or did it feel empty?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 非常、非常超现实，也极其不可思议。它绝对没有让我感到空虚。也不是那种“哦，现在我成个人物了”的感觉。感觉很棒，因为这就像是上帝和我一起在做一件事。这才是最棒的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Very very surreal and extremely incredible. It it it it definitely didn't feel empty. It wasn't like oh now I'm somebody. It felt amazing because it was like God and I are doing something together. That's what was amazing.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 当你告诉我那个故事时，我有点难过，不是为你，而是为我自己。我来解释一下，也许这是自我中心主义。我的朋友布伦特·贝肖尔有个关于“清洁燃料”与“肮脏燃料”的理论，探讨你的动力来源。你的燃料听起来非常清洁，是目标驱动的，充满意义。而我的燃料更像是一种混合物，是肮脏的，是我肩上的一块芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: When you tell me that story, I kind of feel bad, not for you, but for myself. And I'll put this in perspective. And maybe this is self-centeredness. And you know, my friend Brent Beshore has this idea of clean fuel versus dirty fuel. And how are you powered? And your fuel sounds very clean. It's purpose- driven. It's meaningful. And my fuel is more a mix. It's dirty. It's a chip on my shoulder.</p>
</details>

我也上过《纽约时报》畅销书榜，但我当时的第一反应并不积极。我想起2018年《纽约时报》一篇文章下的一条评论，写着：“我希望帕里什先生能享受他这15分钟的名气。”对我来说，这更像是一种肮脏的燃料。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's I also hit the New York Times bestselling list. But the first thought that I had was not positive. It was I remembered a comment on an article in the New York Times from 2018 saying, you know, I hope Mr. Parish is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame. And to me, that's more of a dirty fuel.</p>
</details>

我最近一直在思考清洁燃料与肮脏燃料以及动机的问题。我非常钦佩的人之一是汤姆·布雷迪。他的燃料听起来也是一种混合物，你知道，在密歇根的经历无疑在他肩上留下了一块芯片，驱动着他、推动着他。我发现，至少对于某些性格类型的人，包括我自己，所谓的“肮脏燃料”似乎永不燃尽，永不过期。我还记得我九年级老师当年对我说的话。他们现在不这么做了，但以前他们会写下真实的想法。她在我的成绩单上写道：“谢恩能高中毕业就算幸运了。”我到现在还想着那句话，每隔几周就会在我脑海里冒出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I've been thinking about a lot about clean fuel versus dirty fuel and motivation lately. And the people that I admire a lot is Tom Brady. And you know, he's got a mixture of fuel. It sounds like, you know, there's definitely a chip on his shoulder from Michigan driving him and pushing him. And what I find with the dirty fuel, if you will, at least for certain personality types, myself included, is it just never burns out. Like it never expires. I remember things that my grade nine teacher told me, you know, back in the day. They don't do this anymore, but they used to write what they actually think. And she wrote in my report card that went home to my parents like, "Shane will be lucky to graduate high school." [snorts] And I like still think about that. Every like few weeks that pops in my head.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 你对此有何反应？我们都是凡人，我们最大的需求是爱和接纳。所以我们都有一个总是感到受威胁、总是在比较、永不满足的头脑——我称之为**小我**（Ego: 在心理学中指代自我意识和自我认同，此处特指那个不断寻求外界认可、害怕失败、驱动比较和竞争的心理部分）的那个部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: What's your reaction to that? We're all human. And so our greatest need is for love and and acceptance. And so we all have a mind that's that's always threatened, always comparing, and never satisfied. the the part of the mind I call the ego.</p>
</details>

所以这是我们作为人总是在与之斗争的东西。小我说，如果你更成功，你就会得到你最想要的东西。它不会大声或用特定的词语说出来，但它总是在暗示：如果你成功了，你就会得到你最想要的——那种爱和连接。如果你卖出更多的书，获得更多的粉丝，更多的钱，或更多的晋升，你就会得到你最需要的东西。但反过来说，如果你失败了，你不仅得不到，还会得到相反的结果——你会被拒绝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's something that as humans we're always battling with. The ego says if you're more successful, you're going to get what you want most. It doesn't say this out loud or or in certain words, but it's that's what it's always implying is if you're successful, you're going to get what you want most, which is that love and connection. If you sell more books or get more followers or more money or more promotions, you're going to get this thing that you need most. But the flip side is if you fail, you're gonna not only are you not going to get that, you're going to get the opposite. You're going to get rejected.</p>
</details>

### 走出“竞争者陷阱”

**Shane:** 我发现自己和大多数你合作过的运动员非常相似，就这种动力带我走了多远而言。但也许它不能带我走得更远。你知道，我失败过无数次，我的失败是公开的，每个人都看得到。在我看来，你从中学习，然后继续前进，放手，不执着于它。但你对成功也做同样的事。所以，快乐和悲伤之间的波动范围变得非常窄，因为你从不过于快乐，也从不过于悲伤，你只是有点像斯多葛主义者那样前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: I would imagine I'm very similar to most of the athletes you've worked with in terms of like how far this has gotten me but maybe it doesn't get me and maybe failure and you know I've failed million well millions of times I mean my failures are public you know everybody watches them uh everybody sees them and in my mind you learn from that and you just move on you let it go like you don't hold on or attach to it but you do the same with success so the variance between sort of like happiness and sadness is like so narrow because it's like you never get too happy and you never get too sad and you just sort of like stoically go forward.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 我在像你这样非常有才华的人身上看到的情况，正是你所说的：下一个，下一个，我们再定一个目标，再实现点别的。这真的是一个危险的陷阱。你越有才华，就越有可能陷入这个陷阱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: What I've seen with people that are very talented like yourself is that exactly what you said is just next next like let's get another goal let's achieve something else. It's it's really like productivity is is really really important uh because achievement is is the whole the end goal. It's a dangerous trap. The more talent you have, the more likely that you can get in this trap.</p>
</details>

这个陷阱是：我设定一个目标，为之努力，得到一个结果，然后我在脑海里处理这个结果。我喜欢它吗？是好是坏？我赢了还是输了？在我脑海里处理完之后，我会产生一种感觉。如果我得到了我想要的，这种感觉会是积极但短暂的。如果我没得到我想要的，它会是消极的。这会影响我的信念，因为信念就是感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the trap is I set a goal, I work at it, I get a result, and then I process that result in my mind. Do I like it? Was it good or bad? Did I win or lose? And then after I process it in my mind, I'm going to get a feeling. And that feeling is going to be if I got what I wanted, it's going to be positive but temporary. If I didn't get what I wanted, it's going to be negative. And that's going to impact my beliefs because beliefs are feelings.</p>
</details>

因为如果你有才华，你现在会怎么做？再定一个目标。假设你实现了第一个，你会想，好吧，也许我能行。你在脑海里处理，是的，我能做这些事，我会成为一个人物，我会实现这些事。你设定一个更高的目标，然后你没实现它。然后你在脑海里处理，哦，这太糟了。你产生一种消极的感觉，影响了你的信念，也许我做不到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I'm going to be like that belief will be oh maybe I can achieve my dreams or maybe I won't. But because if you're talented now what are you gonna do? It's another goal. And so say you achieve the first one you're like okay maybe I can. You process in your mind yeah I can do these things and and I'm going to be somebody and I'm going to achieve these things. You set another higher goal and then you don't get it. Then you process in your mind like oh this sucks. So you get a negative feeling impacts your belief maybe I can't do this.</p>
</details>

但你越有才华，当你实现这些事情时，你得到的“欢呼”就越多，因为它们会比大多数人的成就更大。这会把你吸入一个循环：我必须不断地实现目标。如果我能不断实现目标，我才能对自己感觉良好。就像杰瑞·宋飞，他可能是史上最著名、最成功的喜剧演员。他说：“我为什么工作？”他说：“嗯，我一直工作，因为这是我唯一能真正感觉到……的方式。”我不记得他确切的用词了，但这和我一遍又一遍听到的故事是一样的。当人们退休时，他们失去了目标，因为工作在本质上让他们保持分心。

<p class="english-text">And but the the more talented you are, the more tears you're going to get when you do achieve these things because they're going to be bigger than most people. And that sucks you in to just this cycle of I just got to keep achieving. If I can feel okay about myself if I keep achieving. It's like Jerry Seinfeld. He's uh maybe the most famous successful comedian ever. And uh he said, you know, why do I work? He's like, well, I I keep working because that's the only way I can kind of really feel. I don't remember the words he he used exactly but it was it's the same story I hear over and over and over like when people retire they lose their purpose because the work in essence kept them distracted</p>

### 忙碌是逃避的手段吗？

**Jim:** 忙碌是我们所做的最重要的事情之一，这样我们就不必深入内心，面对我们的恐惧，从更深的层次看待生活。而那个更深的层次，就是你在最开始提到的：我们是为关系而生的。当你明白你要么行走在爱中，要么行走在恐惧中时，爱是为他人牺牲的意愿，而恐惧是我们自然建立的这些墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: and busyness is one of the biggest things that we do so we don't have to get deeper and face our fears and and look at life at a deeper level and that deeper level is what you alluded to in the very beginning we're created for relationship and when you understand that you're either walking in love or fear then love is is this willingness to sacrifice for others and fear is this these walls that we naturally build.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么更深入地思考你的生活，走出那种忙碌，进入独处，真正思考“我为什么想要我拥有的这些目标？”以及“在我生命的尽头，我希望回顾时拥有什么？”是如此重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's this self-centerness that's inherent in human nature that um that is important to take care of ourselves and and be safe, but also we build these walls that imprison us. So that's why it's it's so important to think deeper deeper about your life and and get out of that busyness, go into solitude and really think why do I want these goals that I have and what is at the end that I that I want to look back on my life and and have</p>
</details>

**Shane:** “忙碌”让我想起了多年前我在某些人身上观察到的现象，他们会投入工作作为一种逃避的方式。他们逃避自己的家庭和自己创造的生活。这和度假是一样的。我经常和人们有这样的对话，他们会说：“哦，我等不及要去度假了。”我就会想：“为什么？”你知道，对我来说，这就像：“你为什么会建立一个你想要逃离的生活？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: the busyiness brought to mind something that I observed many years ago with certain people and they would dive into work as a means of escape. They were escaping their family and their life that they've created and it's the same as you know vacation. And I often have these conversations with people and they're like, "Oh, I can't wait to go on vacation." And I'm like, "Why?" You know, for me, it's like, "Why do you have a life that you've built that you want to escape?"</p>
</details>

你如何帮助一个正在逃避某事的人？我第一次离婚时就这么做了。我逃避处理我需要处理的事情，逃避审视我需要审视的东西，逃避我需要经历的过程。我逃避的方式就是投入工作。所以我也在别人身上注意到了这一点。你如何帮助一个正在逃避的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that part I find interesting. And how do how do you help somebody who's avoiding something? And I did this when I first got divorced. I mean, I avoided dealing with what I needed to process and what I needed to look at and how I needed to go through this. And the way that I did that was diving into work. And so I notice it in other people as well. How do you take somebody who's avoiding something like that?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 你提到度假很有趣，因为你一说度假，我脑子里想的也是完全一样的事情。我写过一篇文章叫《如何度假》。我经历的大多数人，实际上很有趣。两年前，我一个朋友，他的妻子刚去世，他邀请我和他一起去法属波利尼西亚航海两周。我第一个念头是，我不去度假。但后来我开始想，同行的还有他和他的儿子，那个刚失去母亲的孩子。我想，也许我可以去，为他们的生活带来一些积极的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: was interesting you mentioned vacation because the second you said vacation that's the exact same thing I was thinking about. I wrote an article called how to be on vacation and what I've experienced most people it's actually it's interesting so two years ago I had a friend of mine and his his wife had just died he invited me to be to go sailing with him in French Polynesia and um for two weeks and my first thought was I don't go on vacation but then I started thinking about it was going to be him and his son who had just lost his mom and I thought you know maybe I could go and be something positive in their lives</p>
</details>

但关于度假这件事，那篇《如何度假》的文章，其核心观点是大多数人去度假是为了逃避他们的生活。就像你说的，他们普遍的想法是：“我要去度假，我不想考虑工作，我们不要谈论工作，不要谈论家里的任何事，我们只想放松。”这是一个非常普遍的想法，对吧？这有点像逃离你的生活。就像你说的，你为什么会有一个你想要逃离的生活？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but this this thing about vacation the article how to be on vacation is the idea that most people go on vacation to escape their lives. Like you said, they're what they the common thing is I'm going to go on vacation. I don't want to think about work. Let's not talk about work. Let's not talk about anything back home. We're just going to relax. That's a very common idea, right? And it's it's kind of like escaping your life. And like you said, why do you why do you have a life that you want to escape from?</p>
</details>

所以文章的主旨是，与其去度假逃避你的生活，最好的假期是那种你去提升你生活的假期。那么，你该怎么做呢？首先，我们需要停止所有的忙碌。所以，停止所有的思考和所有的行动一两天，然后深入思考你的人生目标，你为什么会在这里，以及当你回到正常生活时，你如何能朝着那个目标前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the gist of the article is rather than going to escape your life on vacation, the best vacation is one where you go to enhance your life. Well, how do you do that? Well, first of all, we need we need to to stop all the busyiness. So, stop all the thinking and all the doing and and uh stop all that for a day or two and then think deeply about your life purpose and why you're here on this earth and how can you move towards that when you go back to your regular life.</p>

### 作者的信仰与人生转折

**Shane:** 你是如何找到信仰的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: How did you find religion?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 你说“宗教”很有趣。我是在我母亲是纯正的日本人的家庭中长大的。她的家人在她父亲临终时成为了一个基督教家庭。这要从武士说起，我在书里谈到过。我曾曾祖父的父亲是一名武士。当武士时代结束时，他因为失去所有权力而成了酒鬼。于是他的儿子开始思考人生的意义，他意识到他想过一种赋予他人力量的生活，而不是对他人拥有权力。这改变了我人生的轨迹，当然也改变了我母亲的人生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: It's interesting you say religion. I grew up in my mom is full Japanese. Her family became a Christian family when her father was dying. And well, it it kind of started with with um I talked about this in the book with with the samurai and how my great greatgrandfather his father was a samurai. When the samurai era ended, he became an alcoholic because he lost all his power. And so his son started to think about what is the meaning of life and he realized that he wanted to live a life where he empowered others instead of having power over others. And that kind of changed the trajectory of my life, you know, obviously my mom's life.</p>

我的旅程是，我一生都相信上帝。但我的生活在2010年，在丹佛市中心遇到一位无家可归的竖琴手时发生了巨大改变。因为我花了五年时间，每周50到60个小时全职写作《内心卓越》。但写完后，我几乎精神崩溃。我花光了毕生积蓄，还负债9万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My journey was was I I believed in God my whole life. But my life greatly changed when I met this homeless harpist in in downtown Denver in 2010 cuz I I spent 5 years full-time writing in the writing inner excellence, 50 to 60 hours a week. But I came out of that with a near mental breakdown. I had spent my life savings $90,000 in debt.</p>
</details>

当时我正在科罗拉多州丹佛市的这些高中演讲，我在想：“好吧，是的，这本书在世界各地的书店里都有卖，这很棒，但你没有钱雇人来营销这本书。你不知道怎么做营销，而且你不喜欢推销自己。这不是一个好的营销计划。如果没人听说这本书，就没人会买。如果没人买，那么巴诺书店就会把它下架，五年的全职工作就会付诸东流，还有所有的钱。”我完全看不出这怎么可能不发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There came a point where I was speaking to these these high schools in Denver, Colorado. I was thinking, "Okay, yeah, the book is in bookstores around the world. That's great, but you've got no money to hire someone to market the book. You don't know how to do marketing, and you don't like promoting yourselves. This is not a good marketing plan. If no one hears about the book, no one's going to buy the book. If no one buys the book, then Barnes & Noble will pull it off the shelves and 5 years of full-time work is going to go down the drain plus all that money. And I just could not see how that was not going to happen.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 实际上那确实发生了，对吗？巴诺书店把它下架了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: And effectively that did happen. Correct. The Barnes & Noble pulling off the shelves.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的，最终是这样。我不记得它在书架上待了多久。不是几周内发生的。过了一段时间，他们把它下架了。我当时正陷入螺旋式下降。当你孤立自己时，我们是为关系而生的。当你孤立自己，没有人告诉你关于你是谁以及你可能实现什么的真相时，你就会开始真正地螺旋式下降，就像我当时一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah. Like it didn't eventually um I don't I don't remember how long it was on the shelves. It it didn't happen in a matter of weeks. After a while, they they pulled it. I was spiraling. And and when you isolate yourself, we're created for relationship. And when you isolate yourself and have no one to tell you the truth about who you are and what's possible for you, then then you can start to really spiral like I was.</p>
</details>

所以我打电话给我的朋友瑞奇·斯克拉格斯。我说：“嘿，告诉我该怎么做。”他说：“找一个无家可归的基督徒，帮助他。”于是我在拐角处找到了这位无家可归的竖琴手，这家伙在弹奏一架全尺寸的竖琴。真的很奇怪。我听他弹奏音乐，看了看我的钱包，里面有100美元。我一定是取了现金预支。我的大部分信用卡都刷爆了。我拿出所有的钱给了他，然后离开了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I called my friend Ricky Ricky Scruggs. I said, "Hey, tell me what to do." And he said, "Find a homeless Christian and help him." And so I I find this homeless harpist around the corner, this guy playing a full-sized harp. Really strange. I listened to him play the music. I look at my wallet. I had $100. So I must have taken a cash advance out. Most of my credit cards were maxed out. And so I took all the money and I I gave it to him and and I leave.</p>
</details>

我回到我常去的地方，在跑步机上跑步，试图喘口气。我回到丹佛的同一个区域，坐在星巴克里，只是凝视着深渊，充满了焦虑。那个无家可归的竖琴手从我身边走过，停下脚步说：“你是那个给我钱的人吗？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I go back to where I stand and run on the treadmill to try and breathe. I come back to that same area in Denver. I'm sitting in the Starbucks just staring off into the abyss.

</details>

当我写这本书的时候，我问我教会的一个女孩，我说：“你能读读这本书，确保它与《圣经》一致吗？因为我想确保它充满了智慧，没有任何谬误。”她读了《内心卓越》后说：“你听说过‘Zoe’这个词吗？”她说：“我读了你的书。你听说过‘Zoe’这个词吗？”我说：“没有。”她说这是一个希腊词，意思是“生命”。它在《圣经》里出现很多次，意思是“生命的丰盛”。我说：“是的，这本书就是关于这个的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I was writing the book, I asked this girl from my church. I said, "Can you read this book and make sure it lines up with the Bible because I want to make sure it's filled with wisdom. It has no falsehoods in it." And she reads Interex and she says, "Have you ever heard of the word Zoe?" And she said, "I read your book. Have you ever heard of the word Zoe?" I said, "No." actually said it's a a Greek word that means life. It's in the Bible a lot. It means fullness of life. I said yes, that's what this book is about.</p>
</details>

我一生都痴迷于这些关于成功的交易，而我一直真正想要的，是感觉自己完全活着。所以我开始围绕追求生命的丰盛来构建我的书，让其他一切都加给你。

</details>

所以，我坐在星巴克里，那个无家可归的人离开了，又回来了，他给了我一个他做的手镯、一张卡片和一盒巧克力。我打开卡片，上面写着：“非常感谢你关心我。爱你的，Zoe。”他的名字是Zoe。

</details>

我说：“你知道你名字的意思吗？”他说：“不知道。”我说：“它的意思是‘生命的绝对丰盛’。我研究了五年，刚写了一本关于它的书。”我拿了一本书，写道：“亲爱的Zoe，非常感谢你今天与我分享你美妙的音乐。你不知道那对我意味着什么。爱你的，吉姆。”我把书给了他，再也没见过他。那是我生命中彻底转变的开始。

### 小我、自信与全然临在

**Shane:** 小我、自我中心和自信之间是如何相互作用的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: Where does ego and sort of selfcenteredness and self-confidence interact?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的，这是一个很好的问题。因为大多数人，尤其是年轻运动员，会遇到这样的困惑：我知道为了在运动中实现我的目标，我需要自信。那么，这是否意味着我需要谈论自己？我需要变得傲慢自大吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah, that's a great question because what happens to most most people, especially young athletes, is they have this confusion like I know that for me to achieve my goals in sports, I need to be confident. And so, does that mean I need to talk about myself? Do I need to be brash and boastful?</p>
</details>

一年半前，我与一位大联盟高尔夫明星有过一次很棒的对话。我说：“职业运动员来找我，因为他们想要自信。”这很棒。自信非常有帮助，但有比自信更强大的东西，那就是**全然临在**（being fully present）。我说：“如果你有两个天赋相同的运动员或表演者，我每次都会选择那个全然临在的人，而不是那个完全自信的人。因为当你自信时，你可能会变得粗心大意。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had this great conversation with a major league golf star a year and a half ago. I said, "Pro althletes, they come to me because they want confidence." And that's great. Confidence is super helpful, but there's something even more powerful than confidence, and that's being fully present. I said, "If you have two athletes that are or performers that are the same talent, I'll take the fully present person over the fully confident one every single time because when you're confident, you can get careless."</p>
</details>

**Shane:** “临在”是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: What does it mean to be present?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 这是一个很好的问题，因为很多人理解得不够深入。他们只是觉得“不要想除了你能看到的东西以外的任何事”或者“活在当下”。对我来说，这是一种非常局限的看法。如果你是教练，解释清楚这是什么意思至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: That's a great question because a lot of people they take it they don't go far enough. They just like just don't think about anything but what you can see or be where your feet are. And that's such a limiting view for me. It's super important if you're a coach to explain what this is. What is what does it mean?</p>
</details>

我们追求的是一种自由感，一种“一切皆有可能”的感觉，一种高度的觉知。为了获得那种自由，我称之为“共振之流”，你与一切同步，感觉非常连接、扎根、居中。没有对自我的担忧。想象一下，你看到了你见过的最伟大的艺术品，或者那件艺术品是大峡谷、彩虹、一本好书或一部好电影，无论是什么，你都为之着迷，完全沉浸其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
p class="english-text">And so what we're going for is this sense of freedom. this sense that anything is possible. This heightened awareness and to get that freedom, what I call this flow of resonance where you're in sync with you just feel really connected, grounded, centered. There's no concern for self. Imagine that you're you see the greatest piece of art ever you've ever seen. Or maybe that art is is the Grand Canyon or a rainbow or a great book or movie, whatever it is, but you're enraptured. you're totally caught up in it.</p>
</details>

你会关心自己吗？你会自我意识过剩吗？会想“别人怎么看我？”“如果我做不好怎么办？”当你处于那个时刻，没有关于自我的想法。那正是我们处于最佳状态的时候。没有自我。正如蒂姆·凯勒所说，是“忘我”的。这就是为什么无私即无畏。恐惧通常是关于自我的，是一种以自我为中心、关乎未来的事情。“我完成这次表演后会发生什么？我拉完小提琴、做完这次演讲后，会发生什么？人们会怎么想？”但如果没有对自我的担忧，那么就有自由。而自由是当今表演中最缺乏的东西之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you concerned about yourself? Are you self-conscious? What what are people thinking about me? What if I don't do this right? There's no thoughts of self when you're in that moment. And that's when we're at our best. There's no self. It's as Tim Keller says, self forgetful. And that's why selfless is fearless. There's fear is a self in general. It's a self-centered future thing. What will happen to me next after I do this performance? After I perform, play the violin, give this talk, what will happen? What will people think? It's a but if there's no concern for self then there's freedom and freedom was one of the biggest things that that are lacking in performance today.</p>

### 拥抱不适，培养勇气

**Shane:** 我们如何教导人们拥有勇气或自信去占据那个空间？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: How do we teach people to have courage or self-confidence to to take that space? Like it</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 那就是无私。那就是驾驭小我。那就是愿意看起来愚蠢，并且理解……我给你举个例子。我曾在一个PGA巡回赛季后赛的练习轮中。我跟着的那位高尔夫球手，他们当时在玩每抓一只小鸟100美元的赌局。另外两位球手在前两个洞都抓了小鸟。现在他落后了。他在第三个洞有一个很短的小鸟推，但他错过了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: that's the selflessness. That's that's the master of the ego. That's the willingness to look foolish and and understand. So here's how I'll give you an example. So I was at this playoff um PJ tour playoff in this in practice round and the golfer that I was with they're playing $100 a birdie and the other two golfers birdie the first two holes. Now he's behind. He has a short birdie putt in the third hole and he missed it</p>
</details>

他说那是个很短的推杆，他很紧张。我说：“你错过那个球是因为你的小我。”他说：“你什么意思？”我说：“在你的主场练习时，你会错过那个球吗？”他说：“可能不会。”我说：“是的，你当时在想他们，你在担心他们会怎么想，你真的不想在他们面前错过这个球。这导致了紧张和压力，让你错过了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he said it was a short one and he said he was nervous and I said you missed that because of your ego and he said what do you mean? I said would you have missed that in in practice um at your home course? He said probably not. And I said, "Yeah, you were thinking about them and you were concerned what they would think and you really did not want to miss this in front of them. And that's what caused the nervousness and the tension that caused you to miss."</p>
</details>

大多数人会来到他们生活中感到非常不舒服的时刻。也许他们在发表演讲，或者在一群人面前打乒乓球。不管是什么，如果你紧张，并且有别人在看，他们来到那些非常不舒服的时刻，然后他们会退缩，因为他们太不舒服了，太害怕在别人面前出丑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happens to most people is that they come to these points in their lives where they're really uncomfortable. Maybe they're giving a speech or playing pingpong in front of a bunch of people. It doesn't matter what it is. You if you're nervous and other people are watching, they come to those moments where they're really uncomfortable and they back away because they're too uncomfortable. They're too afraid of of looking foolish in front of others.</p>
</details>

然而，最成功的人，他们愿意看起来愚蠢，他们愿意犯错。所以我想很多人知道这一点，但我们如何做到呢？在那个时刻，关键是意识到，当我最不舒服的时候，那正是关键时刻。这是内心卓越的第一原则：一切都是来教导我、帮助我的，一切都在为我的益处而运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whereas the most successful people, they're willing to look foolish. They're willing to make mistakes. And so I think a lot of people know that, but how do we get there? And so in that moment, it's ask it's realizing that when I'm the most uncomfortable, that's the moment that's the key for you. And it's it's principle number one for inner excellence. Everything is here to teach me and help me. It's all working for my good.</p>
</details>

所以我们要去寻找那些你最不舒服的时刻，并提醒自己：“这是我的老师。”内心卓越在于扩展你认为可能的事物。内心卓越有三大支柱：信念、自由和专注。要完全投入当下，拥有像孩子一样玩耍的自由，并扩展你认为可能的事物，去做你从未做过的事，成为你从未成为的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we're going to go look for those moments when you're most uncomfortable and and say and remind yourself, this is my teacher. And inner excellence is about expanding what you believe is possible. There's three pillars of inner excellence. Belief, freedom, and focus. To be fully engaged in the moment, have freedom to play like a child and and expand what you believe is possible to become to do things you've never done and become someone you've never been.</p>
</details>

要扩展你认为可能的事物，这个关键支柱是，我们需要找到那些我们不舒服的时刻，我们需要拥抱那个时刻。我们这样做的方式是，我们明白这里的关键不是结果，而是我愿意待在这个时刻而不退缩。即使你失败得很惨也没关系。你这样做10次，失败得很惨10次，最终你会在那些时刻变得舒服，然后你的技能将能够匹配并实现突破。但人们无法突破，因为他们来到那些时刻就退缩了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And to expand what you believe is possible. Kind of that crucial pillar is we need to find those moments where we're uncomfortable and we need to embrace that moment. And the way we do it is we understand that the key thing here is not the outcome. But it's my willingness to be in this moment and not back away. It doesn't matter if you fail horribly. You do that 10 times and fail horribly 10 times. Eventually you're going to get comfortable in those moments and then your skills will be able to match and and break through. But people don't break through because they come to those moments and they shy away.</p>

### 现代世界的“比较陷阱”

**Shane:** 你觉得现代世界在多大程度上加剧了这种比较？过去，比如回到1920、30年代，你的比较参照系基本上就是你的街道，也许是你的小镇。人们的生活水平大致相当。但现在我们生活在一个你打开Instagram，就能看到明星坐私人飞机，或者像史高治·麦克老鸭那样在钱堆里游泳的世界。这对我们有多大影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: How much do you think the modern world has really played with that comparison? It used to be like I I'm just picturing you go back to like 1920s, 1930s. It's like your your reference for comparison was basically like your street maybe your town. People lived reasonably within the same socioeconomic status. George or Beth might have got a new car, but by and large everybody's sort of in the same boat. But now we live in a world where you flip open Instagram and these celebrities who are flying on private jets or people like you remember the Scrooge McDuck thing. They're like they're swimming in their money or rappers burning sort of money on videos. And how much does that mess with us?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 哦，影响巨大。是的，现在非常非常困难。24/7的全天候比较，你可以看到世界上任何人在做什么。这会给头脑带来焦虑，因为有太多的想法来自太多的担忧。如果你想在任何事情上长期保持良好状态，我们需要减少得多的想法，甚至减少得多的呼吸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Oh, it's huge. It's huge. Yeah, it's it's very very difficult now. 24/7 comparison and you can you can see what anyone's doing all over the world now. It creates anxieties of mind with too many thoughts from too many concerns and that's what it brings. It's just way too many thought. We need if you want to be good at anything for a long period of time. We need to have way less thoughts and even way less breaths.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 我不确定这是否真的那么糟糕。在个人层面上，这可能很糟糕，对心理健康有害。但在社会层面上，它实际上带来了非常好的结果，因为它激励了吉姆或谢恩更努力地工作，更多地推动，更多地挑战，去挑战我们的极限。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Shane: One of the things that stood out to me, you know, when I when I thought about this before reading your book, and I'm still mulling this over, so this conversation is part of my processing. I was like, "Oh, I don't know if that's really bad." On an individual level, it's probably bad. It's bad for mental health, you know, for Shane or for Jim. Uh, but on a society level, it actually results in really good outcomes because it motivates Jim or it motivates Shane to work harder, to push more, to challenge more, to be more aggressive, to push our limits.</p>

**Jim:** 我认为你说得很好，它在很多方面推动了世界前进。但同时，技术也有其好处。中国有人有个想法，我们在美国马上就能看到。现在提高生产力、效率和成就的能力大大提高了。所以这很了不起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: I think that's very well said. that drives the world forward in many ways. But also, so there's the benefit of technology. Someone has an idea in China and we can see it right away in America. The ability to be more productive and efficient and and achieve more is so much higher now. So that's amazing.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 但这是有代价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: But it comes at a cost,</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 但代价巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: but it comes at a huge cost.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 代价是个人的，但好处主要是社会性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: And the cost is individual, but the benefits are largely societable.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 嗯，看看现在的色情内容。色情内容无处不在。在互联网出现之前，它不是无处不在的。你得从杂志上获取。现在这个负面的东西因为技术渗透到了每一个地方。技术确实可以帮助提高生产力，但它也可以非常快地传播邪恶。它可以传播阴谋论和负面思想及谬误。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Jim: Well, look at pornography now. Pornography is everywhere. It wasn't like before the internet. It wasn't everywhere. You had to get it from a magazine. This negative thing now is infiltrated every single place because of technologies. Technology can really help with productivity, but it can really spread evil fast. It can spread conspiracy theories and and uh negative ideas and falsehoods.</p>
</details>

### 教练的第一场对话：你真正想要的是什么？

**Shane:** 如果我是一名运动员，或者我就是谢恩，来找你。第一次对话会是什么样的？“吉姆，你知道，我一直很成功，但总觉得有些不对劲，感觉不可持续。”那第一次对话会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: What's the process if I'm an athlete, I come to you or I come to you and I'm shamed? Like what's that first conversation like? Jim, you know, I've been successful but something doesn't feel right, doesn't feel sustainable. What does that first conversation sort of look like?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 我想知道你真正想要什么。比如，你为什么联系我？除了成为世界第一或其他什么，你真正想要的是什么？我想知道你在生活中想有什么样的感觉，以及你不想有什么样的感觉。如果我们合作，我会帮助你学习原则和工具，培养思想和行动的习惯，以及如何更频繁地获得那种感觉。什么会增加它？什么会减少它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: I want to know um what you really want. like why did you why did you contact me? What is it that you really want um besides being world number one or whatever it is? I want to know how you want to feel in your life and how you don't want to feel. If we work together, I'm going to help you learn principles and tools and develop habits of thought and action and how to get that feeling more often. What adds to it? What takes away from it?</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 你知道，我想要平静。我想被清洁的燃料驱动。然而，回过头来看，肮脏的燃料一直非常有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: You know, I want to be driven think I want to be driven more by clean fuel. And yet just tying that back, it's like the dirty fuel has been very effective.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的，所以理解这一点至关重要，就是那句“肮脏的燃料一直非常有效”。恐惧可以完成很多事，愤怒也一样。它们真的可以驱动人们。但长期的影响是很多人不想要的。例如，失去内心的平静和喜悦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah. And so that's such a crucial thing to understand is that the that quote right there, the dirty fuel has been very effective. Fear can accomplish a lot. So can anger. You can that can really drive people. But the long-term effect is something that a lot of people don't want. For example, losing inner peace and joy.</p>
</details>

我从不告诉人们该做什么。我只是想帮助他们澄清他们最想要什么。这是一个很好的例子，非常有才华的人会陷入我所说的“竞争者陷阱”。就是“我要提高效率”，因为每次我取得成就，我都能得到某种爱，比如我的孩子很兴奋，我的家人，我的同事，整个世界，他们会说：“哦，干得好。”我得到了欢呼。这就是陷阱，我们无法更深入地思考我们的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't tell people what to do. I try never to tell people what to do. I just want to help them clarify what they want most. And and this is a good example is is people that are very talented. They get caught up in what I call this competitor's trap. It's just I'm going to be more productive because every time I achieve something, I'm getting that sort of love from like my kids are excited, my family, my co-workers, the world, they're like, "Oh, great job." I get the cheers. And that's the trap is that we we aren't able to think deeper about our lives.</p>
</details>

### 重新定义成功：打破轻松生活的幻觉

**Jim:** 很多人，尤其是在西方文化中，他们只是不断地为自己和孩子争取越来越好的环境，让生活变得更容易。大多数人都是这么做的，不是吗？这就是巨大的幻觉。一个更容易的生活并不是最好的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: What happens is most people, especially in Western culture, they're they're just constantly trying to get better and better circumstances for themselves and their kids to make life easier. That's what most people do, isn't it? And that's the great illusion. An easier life is not the best life.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 我想反驳一下，因为我的思维自然会进入“是”与“否”的模式。是的，我有一部分同意。但也有一部分，我看着这里的这些摄像机，心想，如果没有人追求梦想和抱负，这些东西就不会存在。是的，也许他们是以牺牲社交关系、为人父母、成为最佳伴侣为代价做到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: I mean, to push back on that just for a second because my mind just naturally goes into yes and no again. Yes. I there's a part of me that agrees with that. There's a part of me that looks at these cameras here and is like these would not exist without people pursuing a dream and ambition. Yeah. and doing that perhaps at the cost of social relationships, at the cost of being a parent, at the cost of being the best partner they could be.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: For sure.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 我不主张任何人无意识地做这些事。然而，有意识地，他们是我们拥有医学的原因，是社会进步的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: And I don't advocate for those things for anybody unconsciously. However, consciously, they're the reason we have medicine. They're the reason like society</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 人们做出了牺牲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: people have sacrificed.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 是的。我脑海里有这些对立的想法，在个人层面上，我百分之百同意你的观点，但在社会层面上，我不知道那是否是社会的最佳结果。但我确实认为，在个人层面上，这可能是个人的最佳结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: Yeah. people have or you know I look at what happened where I used to work post 911 is like people worked 16 hours a day 7 days a week for 7 years and in that process what they were doing was sacrificing for something larger than themselves they felt a part of something and it wasn't religion or God it was but there was meaning and purpose to it and the byproduct of that was sacrificing being a parent sacrificing the relation relationships with other people in order to achieve that, in order to push that forward. And so I have these like dueling sets to my mind where on individual level I'm like, you're 100% correct, but on a societal level, I don't know if that's the best outcome for society. But I do think on an individual level, it's probably the best outcome for individuals.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 好吧，让我们看看“最好的生活一只脚踏在喜悦中，另一只脚踏在苦难中”这个观点。首先，这不是我偏爱的方式。我不是苦难的粉丝。我想说的是，我相信这就是宇宙的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Okay, let's look at the um the best possible life has one foot in joy and one foot in suffering. Mhm. First of all, this is not how I would prefer it. I'm not a fan of suffering. What I'm saying is that I believe that this is just how the universe works.</p>
</details>

如果你想锻炼更强的肌肉，你必须先分解它们。这就是宇宙的运作方式。你不能坐在沙发上做到。你必须让肌肉牺牲和受苦，才能让它们变大。智慧和勇气也是如此。你不能通过不断让自己越来越舒服来获得勇气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not something I'm advocating for. I'm just explaining what I found. Um, and first just the basic one is is um physical fitness you're talking about. If you want to build stronger muscles, you have to break them down. This just is how the universe works. You you can't do it sitting on the couch. You have to you have to make the muscles sacrifice and suffer to get them bigger. That's just how it works. And it's the same thing with wisdom and courage. You can't gain courage by constantly uh just making yourself more more and more comfortable.</p>
</details>

### 从关注终点到关注下一步

**Shane:** 听起来我们做的很多事都是在改变我们头脑的关注点。我给你举个例子。我和艾米丽·巴尔塞蒂斯博士聊过，她谈到马拉松运动员或任何运动员在比赛中撞墙时该怎么办。她说，世界上最顶尖的运动员，在她的研究中，他们会改变关注的焦点。如果你跑马拉松到一半，腿开始疼，而你只盯着终点线，你永远也到不了。但如果你专注于50米前的那个停车标志，或者你能看到的那个红绿灯，然后当你到达那里后，再专注于下一个目标，你就能跑完比赛，而且成绩会很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: It sounds like a lot of what we're doing is changing the area of focus from our mind. And I'll give you an example. I was talking with Emily Balcetis. She's a doctor. And one of the things that stuck with me about this conversation was she talked about how runners who are running a marathon or athletes who are doing any sort of sport and they hit a wall while they're in the competition. and what do you do when you hit this wall? And she said the the world's best performers, like you know, in her research where they change the area of focus. Like if you're halfway through a marathon, your legs start hurting and you're focused on the finish line, like you're never going to make it. But if you focus on the stop sign that's 50 m in front of you or the red light that you can see or the next visible and then you you focus on the next thing once you achieve that, you'll finish the race and you'll do it in great time.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的。刘易斯·戈登·皮尤，他在北极只穿着一条泳裤游了一公里，大多数人说这是不可能的，会死的。但他没有死。我认为寒冷和跑步时感到非常痛苦很相似。寒冷的问题在于头脑在思考未来。如果你非常非常冷，但我问你，你能再坚持一秒钟，然后我们就把你放进热水浴缸或桑拿房吗？大多数人会怎么说？甚至再坚持五秒钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: That's right. Yeah. Lewis Gordon Pugh, he swam a kilometer at the North Pole and just a speedo, which most people said would would be impossible. They'd die. And he didn't die. One thing about the cold, I think, is very similar to the running when you're really hurting. The problem with the cold is the mind that's thinking of the future. If you're super super cold, but if I asked you, can you last one more second and then we're going to put you in a a hot tub or a sauna? What would most people say? Or even five more seconds.</p>
</details>

问题在于我们回顾过去的痛苦，并投射到未来，思考会发生什么。但当我们能活在当下，拥抱此刻我们所拥有的一切痛苦和挑战，就只是现在，然后迈出下一步，这就是她分享的力量所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, there's a sauna right there. Can you go five more seconds? I think most people would say yes. Right? It's the fear of, oh, how long is this going to last? I don't it's it's this projection and the expectation and how all those circumstances do we look at the past and the pain that we've had and project to the future and what's going to happen that's the problem but when we can be in this moment and embrace whatever pain and challenge we have in this moment right just right now and then take the next step that that's the power that she was sharing you know</p>
</details>

所以刘易斯·戈登·皮尤做的是，他的绩效教练说：“如果你只想我要游一公里，你永远也做不到。我们必须把这分解成更小的步骤。”所以他们每100米设置一面旗帜，代表他团队中的一群人。然后他的教练说：“我不想你考虑任何事，除了那面旗帜。你只需要到达下一面旗帜。就只是下一面旗帜。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what Lewis Gordon Pugh did was his performance coach said you're never going to make it if you just think I'm going to swim one kilometer we've got to break this down into smaller steps. And so they had a flag every 100 meters that represented a group of people on his team. Then his coach said, "I don't want you to think about anything except for that flag. You just got to get to the next flag. Just the next flag."</p>
</details>

### 给予当下可用的100%

**Shane:** 你有一个我发现非常强大的口头禅，但我也对它有个问题。你说：“给予当下可用的100%”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: you have mantras and one of them I found really powerful which is but I also have a question about you say give 100% of what's available.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 是的。所以如果你今天只有40%的状态，你没睡好，昨晚熬夜了，也许和朋友喝多了，不管怎样，你给出那40%的100%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: Yeah. So if you have 40% today, you didn't sleep well, you were up late last night, you had maybe too many drinks with your friends, whatever, you give 100% of whatever that 40% is,</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 当我听到这个时，我脑海里立刻浮现的问题是，我首先感到一种解脱。就像，啊，终于有人理解我了。但另一方面，这又像是一个借口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: the question that comes to my mind immediately when I hear that is like I have relief. That's my first feeling. It's like, h finally, like somebody understands me. On the other hand, it's like that's an excuse.</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 今天来这里的路上，我想到了“目标一：尽你所能”这个想法。我想，你知道，今天可能是一个30%或40%的日子。我能给的不多，但我会尽我所能。这对我非常有帮助，就在我走进这个房间之前。这在某种程度上是赋能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: This morning I drove here from central New Jersey and uh the GPS said it was going to take under two hours and it was all close to four hours and through rush hour traffic into Manhattan and I've been working on a book and um not a ton of sleep lately and so the thoughts on the way here the one I was really working hard and not getting caught up in my circumstance of rush hour traffic for 4 hours. Um, but the thought of what if I'm forgetful or it doesn't go well and and I don't um share some good ideas and uh I was in the bathroom as soon as I got here and then I thought about that idea of of goal number one. Give the best of what you have. And I thought, you know, today could be today's like a 30 or 40% day. I don't have a lot to give, but I'm going to give the best of what I have. And that was very helpful to me as I just before I walked into this room. It's empowering in a way.</p>
</details>

然后我脑海里有另一面，就像我大脑的两边在为这个口头禅争论。一面是：“是的，这很完美。”另一面是：“好吧，如果你连续两三天都这样，那你算什么？你是什么人？为什么那样可以？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there's this side of me that on the other side like the two sides of my brain if you will like fighting about this this um mantra and I'm like you know one side is like yes this is perfect and the other side is like well if you do that like two or three days in a row like what are you what is that? Who are you like why would that be okay?</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 我想，有时候，有些星期，有些月份，有些季节，就会是那样的。我认为知道这一点非常重要。但我想你的性格，让我想起那些有才华、有驱动力、并且你称之为“内疚感”的人。无论是内疚感还是其他什么，他们头脑里的那个部分会说：“你在偷懒。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: And so I think and well there are sometimes some weeks, some months, some seasons where it's going to be like that. And I think it's super important to know. But I think about your personality. I think it reminds me of people that are um talented and driven and have you called it guilt. Whether it's guilt or some other that part of their mind says you're slacking.</p>
</details>

### 对你来说，什么是成功？

**Shane:** 我们总是用同一个问题来结束这些采访。我很好奇你的答案会是什么。对你来说，现在的成功是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shane: That's a really good point. We always end these interviews with the same question. I'm so curious what your answer is going to be, which is what is success for you</p>
</details>

**Jim:** 现在世界上有太多的痛苦、苦难和饥饿，在美国，有太多的分裂和需求。所以我从两个方面来思考成功。一是成为我被创造出来的样子，实现我的使命，与世界分享上帝的爱、智慧和勇气。然后，在这样做的过程中，为那些饥饿的、被囚禁的、难民、寡妇和孤儿提供切实的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jim: right now? There's so much um pain in the world, suffering and starvation and and um in in America, so much division and and need. So I think of success for me and in two things. One is um to become the person that I was created to become to live my purpose to to share God's love, wisdom, and courage with the world. And then in doing that to provide uh um tangible help to people that are hungry and and imprisoned and and uh refugees and widows and orphans to help them.</p>
</details>

**Shane:** 这是一个很棒的答案。非常感谢你今天抽出时间。
