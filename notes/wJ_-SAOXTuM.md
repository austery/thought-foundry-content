### 野心的传统观念

**主持人**: 今年格莱美颁奖典礼上，音乐人兼制作人**法瑞尔·威廉姆斯**告诉观众：“永远不要停止奋斗，永远不要停止工作。停止做任何除了工作之外的事情。” 我们习惯了听到野心是件好事，我们不应该永远满足。但是，在野心之后的生命里，一位优秀的传记作家和播客主持人**阿米尔·尼亚齐**（Amil Niaz）挑战我们用一种全新的方式来看待我们的生活和成就。阿米尔加入了我们的录音室。你怎么样？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: At the Grammys this year, musician and producer **Pharrell Williams** told the audience, "Never stop grinding and never stop working. Stop doing anything else but working." And we're used to hearing that ambition is a good thing, that you should never be satisfied. But in life after ambition, a good enough memoir writer and broadcaster, **Amil Niaz**, challenges us to look at our lives and accomplishments in a whole new way. Amil joins us in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 我很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: I'm good. How are you?

</details>

**主持人**: 我很好。祝贺你的回忆录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm doing well. Congratulations on the memoir.

</details>

**嘉宾**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 从一位千禧一代到另一位，我必须问，千禧一代的承诺和责任是如何塑造了野心的观念的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: From one millennial to another, I have to ask, how did the promise and the responsibilities of the millennial generation sort of shaped the ideas of ambition?

</details>

### 千禧一代的野心与幻灭

**嘉宾**: 嗯，我是说，我很高兴你提到了法瑞尔的引言。我记得他说了那句话，我当时就想：“不，不，这正是我不想再听到的。” 我认为，像这样的信息，你可能还记得小时候经常听到：“努力工作，牺牲你生活中的一切来实现你的梦想，即使我们只有极少数人能实现那个梦想。” 但是“永远不要停止奋斗，永远不要停止拼搏，永远不要停止工作。” 这就是我成长的环境。当时的观念是，无论你的处境如何，无论你是在贫困中长大，无论你是一个移民，无论生活给了你什么，只要你愿意非常努力地工作，牺牲一切，拼搏，奋斗，你就能拥有**美国梦**，你知道的，你就能拥有它。房子。你可以有一个家庭。你可以有两辆车。你可以有一栋小屋。你可以每年都去度假。我43岁了。我不知道你拥有其中多少东西。我没有多少。我是说，我有一个美满的家庭，我过着很棒的生活，但我并不是通过遵循那些步骤来实现的。对。所以，我认为野心的这种观念，正如我们被承诺的那样，并且与我们被承诺的精英主义观念紧密交织在一起，我认为在我们这一代人的生命中已经彻底破灭了。你知道，我们经历过多次金融危机。我认为，**9/11**事件在文化上确实改变了我们看待许多不同事物的角度。所以，是的，我认为千禧一代的梦想很久以前就破灭了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Well, I mean, I'm so glad you brought up the Pharrell quote. I remember him saying that and me just thinking, "No, no, this is exactly what I don't want to hear anymore." I mean, it's messages like that that I think, you know, you may recall having heard a lot as a kid: "Work hard, you know, sacrifice anything in your life in order to achieve your dream, even though only a handful of us are ever going to get that dream." But "never stop grinding, never stop hustling, never stop working." And that's what I grew up with. That was the idea was that no matter your circumstance, no matter if you grew up in poverty, no matter if you were an immigrant, you know, no matter whatever life handed you, if you were willing to work really hard, sacrifice everything, hustle, grind, then you could have the American dream, you know, you could have it. The house. You could have a family. You could have two cars. You could have a cottage. You could go on vacations every year. I'm 43. I don't know how many of those things you have. I don't have many. I mean, I have a wonderful family and I have a great life, but I didn't get it following those steps. Right. And so I think that idea of ambition, as we were promised and very much interlaced with this idea of meritocracy that we were promised, I think has really exploded in our generation's lifetime. You know, we've lived through multiple financial crises. 9/11, I think, really culturally shifted how we looked at a lot of different things. So, yeah, I think the millennial dream went bust a long time ago.

### 移民家庭的现实

**主持人**: 好的。我们来谈谈你的家庭，我们谈论了那个承诺，但我想更多地谈谈来自移民家庭的现实。你如何看待这些现实让你感到困难，你知道，我称之为家里的“内部”与你在教室、学校、工作中面临的现实之间的对比，以及你在回忆录中记录的所有那些事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk a little bit about sort of I want to take it back to when with your family, we talk about the promise, but I want to talk about a little bit more of the realities being specific from an immigrant family. How did how did some of that make it difficult, you know, in terms of, I would call it the inside where you're at home versus what you were facing in the reality of your classroom, school, work and all of that stuff that you document in your memoir.

</details>

**嘉宾**: 是的，我是第一代移民。我的家人来自**巴基斯坦**。他们不会说英语。他们来到这个国家时，几乎身无分文。你知道，我的几个叔叔在这里，所以他们只有最基本的支持。他们抛弃了一切来到这里，为了更好的生活。这也意味着他们大部分时间都在努力安顿下来，努力找个住处，找工作，努力弄清楚这个非常、非常不同的官僚体系。他们没有多少精力来帮助我们弄清楚这一切。对。就像移民的孩子们常常被扔给社会自己去闯荡。而且很多时候我们也说不了当地的语言。但是，你知道，孩子们，孩子们不像你想象的那样欢迎外来者。尽管我们愿意相信其他情况，你知道吗？所以我记得我感到非常迷茫，非常困惑，不知道该向谁寻求指导和帮助。我的父母忙于为自己解决问题，而我作为长女，也得为我的弟妹们解决问题。所以我感到很大的压力。有时我不得不帮助我的父母处理文书工作，当然，对吧？是的。公民考试。我帮他们学习。我在努力学习英语的同时，也在教他们英语。所以当你已经承担了所有这些事情时，就很难再去专注于你的学业或你自己，并弄清楚我到底想要什么，因为我忙于确保我父母的这个愿景在我们来到这个新国家后不会破灭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Yeah, I mean, I'm first generation to this country. So my family came from **Pakistan**. They didn't speak the language. They had very, very little money to their name when they came to this country. You know, a couple of my uncles were here, so they had just the most bare bones of support. They left everything behind to come and have a better life. And that also meant that they were really spending most of their time trying to get set up right, trying to get a place to live, trying to get jobs, trying to figure out this very, very different bureaucratic system. They didn't really have that same energy to spend on helping us figure it out. Right. Like the kids of immigrants often are just thrown to the wolves. And so we're many times not speaking the language either. But we, you know, kids, kids are not as welcoming as you would think to outsiders. As much as we want to believe otherwise, you know? So I remember just feeling very lost, very confused and not really knowing where to turn to for guidance and for help. My parents were busy figuring it out for themselves, and I, as the eldest daughter, was was kind of also the one to figure it out for my siblings. So I felt a lot of pressure. Sometimes I would have to help my parents navigate paperwork, of course, right? Yes. Citizenship tests. I was helping them study. I was teaching them English while I was trying to learn it myself. And so when you're already taking on all of that stuff, it's really hard to then try and concentrate on your studies or yourself and figure out what is it that I really want, because I'm so busy trying to make sure that this vision that my parents had doesn't crumble once we're in this new country.

### 职场的天花板

**主持人**: 好的。你在书中早些时候写道：“当野心被不平等所钝化或被用来对付你时，它就变成了一件奇怪的事情。它呈现出一种锯齿状的形状，似乎是为了伤害任何仍希望抓住它的人。然而多年来，我仍然试图抓住它，在不同的公司里艰难地向上爬，我接受了战略性的降薪和职位，承担了更多的工作但没有额外的薪水，希望野心能以某种方式让我解脱。让我们谈谈职场。在晋升的道路上，职场是如何与你在生活中所经历的不符的？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Alright. Early in the book you write, "Ambition becomes a funny thing when it is blunted by inequality or used against you. It takes on a jagged shape, one that seems designed to maim anyone still hoping to grasp it. Yet for years, I still tried to grab on, inching my way up and across different companies, I took strategic pay cuts and job titles that included a lot more work with no extra salary, in the hope that ambition would somehow set me free. Let's talk about the workplace. How is the workplace on the way up the ladder, not aligned with what you were experiencing in life?"

</details>

**嘉宾**: 是的。你知道，我是学新闻学的，希望……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Yeah. You know, I mean, I, I studied journalism in the hopes that...

</details>

**主持人**: 你没有选择轻松的专业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You didn't pick an easy.

</details>

**嘉宾**: 不，我没有。那不是最明智的选择。我是说，我能预测到整个行业会自己崩溃吗？不能。我也选择它是因为它在某种程度上接近我的梦想。对。它是那种，可以说是父母认可的版本，但我真正想做的是，就是正确的。对。当时我在**温哥华**。那是一个非常、非常困难的时期，试图找到我想要的那种工作。我无法在该行业找到一份工作。我搬到了**多伦多**，最终找到了一份工作，我非常兴奋。然后我接受了。那个想法——“努力工作，埋头苦干，不要制造太多噪音，做好工作，你就会爬上阶梯。” 不幸的是，我认为这对很多女性、年轻女性、有色人种女性来说都不是现实，存在着无形的障碍，我们作为一个社会已经开始谈论它。你知道，人们对我能取得多大成就抱有期望，但存在着一种无形的上限，我无法超越它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: No, I did not. It was not the wisest. I mean, could could I have predicted that the entire industry would essentially collapse in on itself? No. I also picked it because it was sort of adjacent to my dream. Right. It was the like, kind of parental approved version of what I really wanted to do, which was right. Right. And I was in **Vancouver**. It was a very, very difficult time to be trying to find the kind of work that I was looking for. I could not get a job to save my life in the industry. I moved to **Toronto** and I finally did find something, and I was so excited. And I took that. That idea 'work really hard, put your head down, don't make a lot of noise, and just do a good job and you will climb up the ladder.' Unfortunately, that's not the reality for a lot of, I think, women, young women, women of colour, there are invisible barriers and we've started to talk about it as a society. You know, people had expectations of how much I could accomplish, and there was a sort of an invisible ceiling that where I just couldn't progress beyond it.

### 创伤与成长的力量

**主持人**: 我想谈谈你书中必须非常难以详述的一件事。你描述了一次可怕的袭击，然后又发展出一种成瘾。这些事件是如何影响你最终追求的目标的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to talk about something that must have been very hard to detail. In your book. You describe a horrific assault and then also developing an addiction. How did those instances derail what you were ultimately aiming for?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 是的。你知道，那是我生命中的一个时刻，我感觉自己被分成了两半。有一半的我完全不知道，你知道，如此可怕的事情会发生在一个人的身上。然后是另一半的我，经历过这一切，我必须决定我是否会走出来，以及如何走出来。当时，我生活中唯一不变的、唯一稳定的东西就是工作。所以我认为找到一种方法来应对如此悲惨、可怕且改变人生的事情，同时又在工作中做得很好，这一点非常重要。我非常害怕我所经历的事情会影响我的职业生涯。我把它写进书里，因为我认为很多人都经历过。很多人都有过这样的悲剧。我认识的一个人，她的丈夫刚去世，我当时想到的就是：“她工作怎么办？” 你知道，“在这种环境下，她能负担得起请假吗？” 这太令人难过了。我认为你在**疫情**中也看到了这一点。这对很多人来说是生死攸关的情况。然而，我们很多人都在谈论工作。我们能保住工作吗？我们能继续下去吗？比如，我们如何继续制造小玩意儿？即使我们很多人都在为整个家庭担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Yeah. You know, it was one of those moments in life where you I really felt I was like split into two. There was the version of me that had no idea that, you know, something that terrible could happen to a person. And then there's the version of me that has lived through it, and I have to decide if I'm going to come out the other side and how. And at the time, the only thing, the only constant, the only stable thing in my life that I could turn to was work. And so I just felt it was so important that I find a way to navigate something so tragic and and awful and life changing, while still doing a great job at work. I was terrified to let what had happened to me affect my career. I put it in the book because I think a lot of people go through that. A lot of people have these these tragedies. Someone I know, her husband just died and I'm all I could think about was, "What is she going to do about work?" You know, "Can she afford to take time off in, in this environment?" Like, it's it's so sad. And I think you saw it in the pandemic. It was a life or death situation for so many people. And yet the biggest conversation a lot of us were having was about work. Could we keep our jobs? Could we keep going? Like, how do we keep making widgets? Even though many of us are afraid for our whole families?

### 疫情中的写作与目标感

**主持人**: 当你提到疫情时，我想谈谈你在那段时间的写作。跟我谈谈在疫情期间，谈论痛点，这种工作是如何给你带来目标感的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: As you bring up the pandemic, I want to talk about what you were writing during that time. Tell me a little bit about how, during that pandemic, talking about the pain points, how that kind of work gave you purpose.

</details>

**嘉宾**: 在疫情的那个时刻。我怀着第二个孩子，家里还有一个蹒跚学步的孩子，我和丈夫刚从**伦敦**搬回来。我们没有工作，或者我们在找工作，而我正试图工作、照顾孩子，还要照顾我妈妈，她也住在这里，这一切都在一个超级小的空间里。我感觉我的大脑快要着火了。我做了我当时唯一知道该怎么做的事。我开始写作，我首先在社交媒体上分享其他父母的经历。然后编辑们开始联系我，说：“你知道，这很有共鸣。你能为我们写这个吗？” 所以它真的变成了一种呐喊求助。这引起了很多人的共鸣，并最终催生了我在**《The Cut》**上的专栏，现在仍在继续，名为“艰难的部分”（The Hard Part），它还催生了许多其他病毒式传播的文章，讲述了我们作为父母、作为职业父母、作为新手妈妈所经历的一切，因为你知道，为人父母变得如此不同。如果你在疫情期间刚生了孩子，你无法真正与其他人产生共鸣，因为你无法去探望亲友。你可能甚至不去公园，对吧？你无法与其他朋友见面。你没有任何支持系统。所以，你知道，我当时也经历着这一切。是的，我找到了一个社群。我认为我在很多方面找到了我的声音。它也催生了这本书本身，因为那是我终于想清楚的时候了：这就是我必须做的，这就是我想做的。我终于觉得没有什么可失去的了。放手去做吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: In that moment in the pandemic. Pregnant with my second, having a toddler at home, my husband and I had just moved back from **London**. We didn't have jobs or or we were looking for jobs, and I was trying to work and parent and and take care of my like my mom was in the house as well and do it all in this super tiny space. And I felt like I was like my brain was on fire. And I did the only thing I knew how to do, really, in a time like this. And I wrote and I and I was out there first on just on social media, sharing what other parents were sharing. And editors started reaching out and saying, "You know, this is very relatable. Will you write this for us?" And so that it really became this, like cry for help. That resonated with a lot of people and that it did spawn. Ultimately, my column in **The Cut**, which continues now called The Hard Part, and it's spawned a lot of other viral pieces about just like what we were all going through as parents, as working parents, as new moms, because, you know, parenthood was so different. If you just had a baby in the pandemic, you couldn't really relate to anyone else because you weren't going to like drop-ins. You weren't maybe even going to the park, right? You couldn't meet up with other people. You had no support system. And so, you know, I was going through that myself. And yes, I found a community of people. I found my voice, I think, in many ways. And it did it did create a kind of the book in itself, because that was where I finally figured out, like, this is what I have to do, this is what I want to do. And I finally, there's nothing to lose. Let's go for it.

### 重新定义“足够好”

**主持人**: 在我们最后几分钟里，我们来谈谈这个。在你的书的后记中，你写道：“我一生中很多次试图逃避自己，成为一个更好的人。我抛弃了过去，否认了自己很多部分，试图吸引一种被告知是唯一值得追求的成功。我让贫困塑造了我的欲望。我让暴力威胁了我的事业。我让别人对母性的看法改变了我的焦点。一旦我学会拥抱我自己的每一个部分，我就找到了一个值得讲述的故事。” 你的书名副标题是《一本足够好的回忆录》（A Good Enough Memoir）。“足够好”是什么？是野心的新观念吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Let's talk about it in our last couple of minutes that we have here. In your book's epilogue, you write, "So many times in my life I tried to run away from myself to be someone better. I pushed away the past and denied so many parts of myself to try and attract a type of success that I was told was the only one worth pursuing. I let poverty shape my desires. I let violence threaten my career. I let other people's idea of motherhood change my focus. Once I learned to embrace every single part of me, I found a story worth telling." Your story subtitle is A Good Enough Memoir. How is Good Enough? A New Idea of ambition?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 你知道，我想说实话，很长一段时间，我觉得它非常外部化，比如，“你够格留在这里吗？你够格成为一位母亲吗？” 它是由别人为你定义的。而现在，我选择它作为我自己定义的。我够格留在这里。我够格成为一位母亲，因为我爱我的孩子，他们吃饱了，他们快乐，他们被爱着。我认为这可以非常有力量。你知道，很多时候“平庸”这个想法会受到人们的鄙视。我认为如果我们将其重新定义为满足和满意，就像我说的，为自己重新定义“足够好”。这可以非常自由。我感觉我职业生涯中最快乐、最满足的时刻，就是当我感到不对劲时说“不”并离开，并为自己定义“好”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: You know, I think truthfully, for a long time it was something that I felt was very external, like, "Are you good enough to be here? Are you good enough to be a mom?" And it was something that was being defined for you. And now I choose it as something I define for myself. I am good enough to be here. I am good enough as a mother because I love my kids and they're fed and they're happy and they're loved. And I think that that can be very empowering. You know, a lot of times this idea of mediocrity, it's it's shunned upon. And I think if we reframe it as contentment and satisfaction and like I said, redefine 'good enough' for yourself. It can be very freeing. I feel the happiest I've ever felt the most satisfied in my career that I've ever felt, saying no and walking away when I feel like something's not right and and defining good for myself.

</details>

**主持人**: 这太美了。我们就到这里吧。非常感谢你。真的很感激。祝贺你的书。
