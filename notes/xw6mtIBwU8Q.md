**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm **Gilbert Cruz**, editor of the **New York Times Book Review**, and this is the **Book Review Podcast**. **Bridgetgerton**, one of the biggest hits in **Netflix** history, is back for another season based on the series of hit romance novels set in early 1800s England and revolving around the love lives of the Titular family. Part one of the show's fourth season debuted a few weeks ago. The final four episodes are going to debut on the streaming platform at the end of February. Joining me on this week's episode is **Julia Quinn**, the person who started this all, author of the books from which the show is adapted. Her **Bridgetgerton** series kicked off in the year 2000 with **The Duke and I**. Julia, welcome to the book review podcast.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 谢谢你的邀请，这简直是梦想成真。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Thank you for having me. This is a dream come true.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我也有同感，谢谢你的到来。我们的谈话将在**情人节**周末发布，所以现在和你交谈感觉非常合适。作为一名以撰写浪漫故事为职业的人，你对这个节日有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I feel the same way. Thanks for being here. Our conversation is going to publish over **Valentine's Day** weekend. So, it actually feels incredibly appropriate to be speaking with you. How do you feel about this holiday as someone whose job it is to write about romance?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我觉得这是一个不错的节日，但我清楚地记得我第一次作为情侣度过情人节的时候，我当时想“终于来了”。所以我明白其他人是什么感受。这确实是一个有点残酷的节日，因为我们并非都是情侣。所以我真的很喜欢我们现在也有这个“情人节”的东西。我不知道男士们有什么，但……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I think it's a nice holiday, but I do remember very distinctly the first **Valentine's Day** I had where I was part of a couple and and thinking just like finally. And so I get it what it's like for everyone else. So it it is kind of a cruel holiday because we're not all part of couples. And so I really love that we now have this **Valentine's Day** thing, too. I don't know what there is for the guys, but

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 什么都没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: There's nothing.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 抱歉，我丈夫我觉得比我更浪漫，在好的姿态和礼物方面。所以，情人节对我来说一直都很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I'm sorry. My husband, I think, is more romantic than I am in terms of really good gestures and gifts and stuff. So, so **Valentine's Day** has been very, very good to me.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你把所有的浪漫情怀都倾注在你的作品里了，所以他就像在说：“别担心，亲爱的，我搞定了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You know, you're putting all your romantic flourishes in your work. And so, he's like, "Don't worry, honey. I got it."

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yes. Yes.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我们之所以交谈，是因为正如我所说，**《布里奇顿》**这部电视现象级剧集又出了新一季。这对所有观众来说都是一件大事，但我必须想象这对你来说也是一件大事。我很好奇，每当新一季播出时，你有什么感受？它们基本上每两年推出一次。我想知道，你每次都需要做好准备吗？比如，“好吧，新一季要来了，作为这些书的作者，我肩负着责任，我必须再次出现在公众视野中，或者我必须做某些事情。”跟我说说每隔几年兴趣高涨时，你内心涌动着怎样的情感？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: We're talking because, as I said, there is a new season of **Bridgetgerton**, this TV phenomenon. It's a big thing for everyone who watches the show, but I also have to imagine it's a it's a big thing for you. And and I'm curious what it's like for you when a new season drops. They basically come out every two years. And I'm wondering, do you have to like gear up every time? Like, okay, a new season's coming. And now, as the author of these books, I have responsibilities if you do or I have to be back in the public eye or there are certain things I have to do. Talk to me about what are the feelings that are wrapped up in the swelling up of interest every couple years.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 坦白说，**《布里奇顿》**已经成为一个巨大的力量，是的，每隔几年兴趣确实会高涨，但它从未真正消失，这对于作为作者的我来说是件好事。这很累人，因为你要出差更多，做很多公关活动。我觉得现在不像一开始那么多了，但它也如此令人兴奋，以至于疲惫感真的不重要了。他们今年在巴黎举行了首映式，那真的很有趣，因为——这也很有趣——我被归入“人才”一类。所以，当他们提到“人才”时，指的是所有演员和我，这真的很……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Well, to be completely frank, **Bridgetton** has become such a juggernaut that the yes, the interest does swell up every couple years, but it never actually disappears, which as as the author of the books is wonderful. It's exhausting because you are doing so much more travel. You're doing PR stuff. I I feel like it's not as much as it was at the beginning, but it's also so exciting that the exhaustion doesn't really matter. They had the premiere in Paris this year and it was actually really funny because well, this is really funny, too. I get loop looped in with talent. So, when they refer to talent, it's all the actors and me, which is really

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这太不可思议了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: That's incredible.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的，太不可思议了。我心想，我就是“人才”！天哪！我虽然不像他们那样做所有的事情，但我只是在这个标题之下。所以所有的“人才”都在聊天，我们都在说：“有人知道我们为什么在巴黎吗？”实际上没有人知道。没有人能确切指出他们为什么让我们在巴黎举行首映式，但没有人抱怨。我们都只是说：“太棒了！下次他们会把我们送到哪里呢？”所以这很超现实，也很棒，因为我从未想过自己会因为红毯首映被空运到巴黎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yeah, it's incredible. I'm like, I'm the talent. Oh my gosh. And and I don't do all the same things they do, but I just under that header. So all the talent were talking and we were like, "Does anybody know why we're in Paris?" Nobody actually did. Nobody could pinpoint why they had us do the premier in Paris, but no one was complaining. We're all just going, "But it's great. It's like, where will they send us next time?" So it's just it's surreal and wonderful because I certainly never thought I was going to be getting flown to Paris for a red carpet premiere.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你必须走红毯吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Do you have to walk the red carpet?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。而且我觉得今年红毯真的是红色的。我记得**《布里奇顿》**第二季的时候是绿色的。我们走的是绿毯，它们都有些不同。你知道，你必须经过这条媒体线，每个人都会说“看这边，看这边，看这边”，他们还得教你如何站立和摆姿势。我当时觉得这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: You do. And I think it was actually red this year. It see I remember season two of **Bridgetton**. It was green. We had a green carpet and they're just they're all they're all a little different. You know that you have this press line you go through where everybody's like look this way, look this way, look this way and and they have to teach you how to like stand and pose. I'm going like this is nuts.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么，学习“定点拍照”都需要做些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So what what is involved in learning the step and repeat?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 哦，定点拍照。你看，我甚至都不记得这个名字了。其实没涉及太多，他们只是说“这就是定点拍照，你就这么做”。我到现在也算不上专家，因为当你走到那里时，所有演员都知道该怎么站，他们都带着一种有点严肃的表情，从不露齿而笑，而我却在那里……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Oh the step and repeat. See I couldn't even remember the name. There wasn't much involved. They just said this is step and repeat and this is what you do. And I I still am not remotely an expert because when you get out there, all the actors know exactly how to stand and they all have this this expression which is a little bit serious and they're and they they never show teeth and I'm out there like,

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: “嘿，看我，我在笑！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: "Hey, like grinning, look at me, I'm smiling." And

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我总是，不是说我幻想过这个，但我总是想，如果我真的要走红毯，那真的会是关于表情，关于露齿的问题。比如，我该笑得多大？是咧嘴笑？是微笑？还是假笑？到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I always, not that I've fantasized about this, but I always thought if I ever had to walk on a red carpet, it really would be the face, the the like the teeth thing. It's like, how big am I smiling? Is it a grin? Is it a smise? Is it a smirk? What is the

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 有这些，你还会想，我需要挺胸，挺胸，站直，站直，因为我姿势不总是很好，所以你脑子里会想很多事情，你会感觉有点像冒牌货，因为那通常不是作家会去的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: There's all that and you're also thinking to yourself, I need to like posture, posture, stand up straight, stand up straight because I don't always have great posture and so there's a lot going through your head and you feel a little bit imposterike because that's just not where the writers usually are.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 但这很有趣，也很疯狂。**《布里奇顿》**这部剧，我希望我的书也是如此，它们真正的主题是**快乐**。这是一部非常欢乐的作品，一切都围绕着寻找爱情。别误会，我也喜欢那些前卫的剧集，我喜欢那样的东西，但**《布里奇顿》**我认为非常不同，因为它做到了这一点。所以它是一个非常快乐的现象，因此它就是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: But it's it's fun and it's crazy. And the thing about **Bridgetton** as a show and I hope as books as well is that they're really about joy. And it's a really joyful work and it's all about finding love and and don't get me wrong, I'm there for all the edgy shows. I like stuff like that, but **Bridgetton** I think was very different in that it does that. So it just it's a very happy phenomenon and so it just

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 太棒了。我想带你回到世纪之交，我知道对于仍然活着的人来说，这是一个奇怪的说法，一个奇怪的短语，但是当第一本**《布里奇顿》**系列小说**《公爵与我》**出版时，你已经出版了六七本书了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: It's wonderful. I want to take you all the way back to the the turn of the century, which is a weird thing to say, a weird phrase to use, I know, for people who are still alive, but when that first **Bridgetgerton** book, **The Duke and I**, was published, you had already put out six, seven books.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 嗯，这是我的第八部小说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Mhm. This is my eighth novel.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那是你的第八部小说。你对第一本**《布里奇顿》**系列小说有什么期待？你觉得这个系列会是什么样子，或者你当时就知道它会是一个系列吗？已经出版了几本书之后，你觉得这本书必须成功，或者必须达到某个成功水平吗？你是如何投入其中的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: It was your eighth novel. What were your expectations for that first **Bridgetgerton** book? What what did you think it was going to be, the series, or did you know it was going to be a series? And and having published several books already, what did you think this this is this has to succeed or this needs to succeed at a certain level? How did you go into it?

</details>

### 浪漫小说家的职业生涯

**Julia Quinn**: 作为类型小说作家，尤其是在我刚入行的时候，是没有一夜成名的。你必须以老式的方式建立你的职业生涯，从榜单底部开始，希望每出版一本书，你都能增加更多的读者，而不是失去读者，然后慢慢增加你的印刷量，变得越来越受欢迎，我当时就是这么做的，缓慢但稳健。所以当我写到第一本**《布里奇顿》**系列小说时，我不是一个主要作者，这也不是我的出版社推出的主打书。我不是在底部，他们称之为中游，但他们也把底部称为中游，所以……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: So, the thing about being a writer of genre fiction, especially then when I was coming up through the ranks, is that there were no overnight successes. You you had to build your career the oldfashioned way which is starting out at the bottom of the list and hoping that with every book you add on a few more reader you add on more readers than you lose and just keep slowly growing your print run and becoming more and more popular and that's what I was doing slow but steady and so by the time I got to the first **Bridgetgerton** book I was not a lead author this was not a main title coming out from my publishing house I wasn't at the bottom it was they call it mid list but they call the bottom mid list also so who

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这太具体了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: It's too specific.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我知道我们现在正在深入出版术语的细节，但我认为它会像我一直以来努力的那样，比上一本做得更好一点。这就是你建立职业生涯的方式。这确实是我建立职业生涯的方式。所以，我希望它能比上一本做得更好一点。上一本是我第一次登上全国畅销书榜单。我想我登上了**《今日美国》**榜单的第126名左右。我非常激动。所以这一本，你知道，希望能做得更好一点，它也确实做到了，但它没有登上**《纽约时报》**榜单。它没有做出任何惊人的成就，但在我的浪漫小说领域，在我那个小核心读者群关注的地方，它是一个提升，是一个显而易见的提升。我认为这很大程度上是因为**惠斯尔顿夫人**，因为在书的结尾，我没有说她是谁。所以你会看到这些人会说：“什么？”因为浪漫小说必须以幸福结局告终。我总是小心翼翼地告诉人们，这并不比任何其他类型小说更公式化，因为想想看，如果你读一本**赫尔克里·波洛**的推理小说，结尾他只是拍拍额头说“这可真难住我了”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I I know we're getting into the weeds of publishing terms right now, but I thought it was going to do what I had been trying to do all along, which is do a little better than the last one. And that's that's how you built a career. That's that's really how I have built my career. And so, I wanted to do a little better than the last one. The last one had been the first time I'd hit a national bestseller list. I think I'd hit the **USA Today** list at like 126 or something. I was thrilled. And so this one, you know, wanted to do a little better and it did, but it didn't hit the **New York Times** list. It didn't do anything amazing, but within my field of romance novels where my little core group of people were watching, it was a bump and it was like a visible noticeable bump. And I think it was in large part because of **Lady Whistledown** because at the end of the book, I don't say who she is. So you'd have these people going, "What?" Because the thing about romance novels is that they have to end with happy ending. And I'm always careful to tell people this is no more formulaic than any other type of genre fiction because think if you read say a **Hercule Puero** mystery and at the end he just slaps his forehead and says that's a stumper.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你会非常沮丧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You would be really upset.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。因为如果你读一本推理小说，你期望开头有尸体，结尾凶手被抓。如果你读一本浪漫小说，你期望开头两个人相遇或重逢，结尾有一个幸福的结局。就是这样，中间的一切都是开放的，但你有一些参数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yeah. Cuz if you read a mystery you expect a dead body at the beginning and it to be the murder to be solved at the end. Well, if you read a romance you expect two people to either meet or rem at the beginning and to have a happy ending at the end. It's just and and everything in between is open, but you have these parameters.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 所以，**惠斯尔顿夫人**这个线索在结尾并没有被解开。我只是把它悬在那里，这在当时并不常见。尽管浪漫小说充满了三部曲，讲述三个兄弟或三个最好的朋友的故事，但每一部都相当完整。所以，在结尾，人们会说：“什么？她什么都没说？”所以，它确实引起了一些轰动。但我当然从未想过它会被改编成电视剧。我的意思是，没有人改编浪漫小说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And so, **Lady Whistledown** is that was a string that did not get tied up at the end. I just left that one hanging, which you didn't see very much of. Even though like romance was filled with trilogies where it was about three brothers or three best friends, the each one was pretty wrapped up. And so, at the end, people like, "What? She didn't say anything?" So, it kind of got a bit more buzz. But certainly, I never thought it was going to get picked up for television. I mean, nobody adapted romance novels.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你当时有没有想过这个系列最终会写多少本书，或者至少你希望写多少本？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Did you have a sense how many books it would stretch out to in the end or did you have a hope at least?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 实际上，我一开始以为我会写三本，主要是因为浪漫小说充满了三部曲。这基本上就是我们常做的事情。我写过一个三部曲，然后写了两套两本的，我想，好吧，我再写一个三部曲。我写了**达芙妮**，然后书中塑造最完整的次要角色是**安东尼**和**科林**。所以我想：“好吧，我就写他们。”然后我的编辑说：“也许只写两本吧，因为我觉得三部曲通常是第一个角色大家都很兴奋，然后你把真正神秘的角色留到最后，然后第二个角色就……”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Well, actually, I started out thinking I was going to write three mostly because again, romance is full of trilogies. It's just that's sort of what we do. And I' done I'd done a trilogy and then I'd done I think two sets of two and I thought, okay, I'll do another trilogy. And I had Daphne and then the the most filled out characters, secondary characters in the book were Anthony and Colin. So I thought, "Okay, I'll I'll do that." And then my editor actually said, "Maybe just do two books because I feel like with trilogies often you have the first character who everybody's excited about and then you save the really enigmatic one for last and then the second one's

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我说：“嗯，我确实有这三个角色想写。”所以她说：“好吧，没问题。”于是我开始写**安东尼**的书，因为当然，你知道我是在**《公爵与我》**出版之前就开始写的。然后那本书开始走红。然后到我开始写第三本书的时候，我说：“我觉得这本书比我们预期的更受欢迎。也许我应该为**本尼迪克特**写一本书。”因为我之前没有这个计划。她说：“是的，我觉得这是个好主意。现在我们可能要考虑写四本书了。”然后到我签下一份合同时，它明确规定这些必须是**《布里奇顿》**系列的书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And I said, "Well, I really have these three characters I'd like to do." So she said, "All right, okay." And so I started working on Anony's book because of course you know I'm working on it before the **Duke and I** comes out. And then that started taking off. And then by the time it was time for me to start the the third book, I said, "I feel like this is becoming a little more popular than we expected. Maybe maybe I should do a book for Benedict." Cuz I hadn't been planning to. And she said, "Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Now we're thinking maybe four books." And then by the time I signed my next contract, it specifically said these need to be **Bridgetgerton** books.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 但我从未计划写八本。我甚至不记得为什么我写了八个孩子。我只是想让她有一个大家庭。不知怎么的，就有了这么多孩子。如果我计划写八本，我本可以更好地规划情节。我确实有好几次把自己逼到了绝境，当时我心想：“天哪，我现在该怎么办？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: But I had never planned to do eight. I I don't even remember why I made eight kids. I just I wanted her to have a big family. And somehow that's how many kids there were. And if I had planned on eight, I I would have plotted things out better. I really there were a number of places where I really wrote myself into a corner where I was like, "Oh gosh, what am I going to do now?"

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你什么时候把自己逼到绝境的？这个系列中有三本书几乎同时发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: When did you write yourself into a corner? There are three books in the series which take place pretty much at the same time.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 那可不好玩。所以，我会稍微做些不同的处理。然后我还意识到，我将连续写三个28岁的未婚女性。我心想：“天哪。”我的意思是，你可以做不同的事情，但后来在第三本书中，我想是第三本书，我只是写道：“哦，可怜的**弗朗西斯卡**结婚了，然后成了寡妇。”然后我就把她放在一边，最终我写到**弗朗西斯卡**的书时，心想：“哦，我需要弄清楚发生了什么。”我只是为了有一个不同的设定而把那段写进去的，当时真的没想过，最终你得把这事儿搞清楚。而我最终也确实搞清楚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: That was not fun. So, I would have done that a little differently. And then also, I realized I was going to have three 28-year-old spinsters in a row. And I thought, "Oh gosh." I mean, you can do different things, but so then in in the third, I think it was the third book, I just put in there like, "Oh, poor Francesca got married and then was widowed." And then I put her aside and then eventually I got to Franchesca's book and was thought, "Oh, I need to figure out what happened." I just put that in there so I would have a different setup. Really not thinking to myself, eventually you're going to have to figure this out. And and eventually I did.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你解决了一个短期问题，却埋下了一颗需要拆除的长期炸弹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You're solving a short-term problem, but putting a long-term bomb out there that you have to diffuse.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。我相当确定我不是唯一一个这样做的作者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yes. And I I'm fairly certain I'm not the only author who does that.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我相信你曾说过你不记得为什么这个家族有八个孩子。但是，把这个家族作为一个整体来思考，并且有几乎荒谬数量的孩子让你来编织故事，这其中有没有什么吸引力呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm sure you said you you can't remember why the family had eight kids. Was there an appeal though in in the thinking about this family as a unit and just in having an almost absurd number of children that you're spinning stories out for?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我当然想要一个大家庭，因为我想要大家庭的动态，我认为这是人们喜欢**布里奇顿**家族的地方，我认为这也是这部剧做得非常好的地方，它展现了家庭的感觉。他们会争吵，他们确实会争吵，他们也确实感觉像一个家庭。所以，我想要一个大家庭，至于为什么是八个，我真的有很多事情不记得为什么我那样做了，人们问我相关问题时，我不得不说，你知道，那是很久以前的事了。我写了很多字，我不记得每一个字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I definitely wanted a big family cuz I wanted the big family dynamic and I think that's something people love about the **Bridgettons** and I think it's something that the show does incredibly well is showing that sense of family. They bicker. They absolutely bicker and they absolutely feel like a family. So, so I wanted a big family and why eight I really there are actually a lot of things I don't remember why I did and people ask me questions about it and I'll have to say you know it's a really long time ago. I don't I've written a lot of words in my career and I don't remember every one of them.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你以前是浪漫小说的忠实读者吗？你读过谁的作品？你是如何接触到这个类型的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Had you been a big reader of romance novels? Who did you read? How were you introduced to the genre?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我最早的记忆实际上是读一本缩写版的浪漫小说，我想是**凯瑟琳·伍德维斯**写的，她基本上发明了现代浪漫小说。她有一本书在1972年出版，叫做**《火焰与鲜花》**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: So my earliest memory of it is actually reading an abridged romance novel I think by **Kathleen Woodwis** who basically invented the modern romance novel. She had a book that came out in 1972 called **The Flame and the Flower**.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 它有很多页，是那种史诗般的、夸张的、非常描述性的长篇小说，与我们现在看到的很不一样，但那是你第一次在书页上看到性爱。它取得了巨大的成功，并开启了整个类型。我想她的一本书被缩写并收录在**《好管家》**杂志中。我就是这样开始接触成人……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: It was many pages long. It was the one of these epic over-the-top very sort of descriptive long it's it's quite different than what we have now, but it was the first time you'd had seen Sex on the Page. And it was a massive hit and that kind of started this whole genre and I think one of her books was abridged and included in **Good Housekeeping**. That's how I started with the adult

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 那些为成人写的书，然后我发现了**维多利亚·霍尔**，她有几个不同的笔名。那实际上是一个笔名，她写了那些哥特式小说，里面有很多浪漫元素。我放学回家路上会去公共图书馆，因为我小时候是走路上学的，我会去借书，然后还回去。所以我就这样爱上了这些书。人们会问：“你为什么写浪漫小说？”很简单，因为我喜欢读。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: The novels written for adults and then I discovered **Victoria Hol** who and she has several different pen names. That is a pen name actually who wrote these gothic novels with a lot of romance in them. And I would stop at the public library, you know, on the way way home from school because I was a kid who walked to school and I would get them and then I go back and turn them in. And so I just kind of fell into these books and and loving them. And so people say, "Well, why did you write romance?" And it was simply because that's what I like to read.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 为什么不呢？你知道，有一分钟，我曾想：“哦，我要大学毕业，然后写一部伟大的美国小说。”然后我突然意识到，我甚至不喜欢读伟大的美国小说。我为什么要写一部呢？当你读**《好管家》**上的这些缩写版本时，吸引你的是它们是成人读物吗？吸引你的是浪漫元素吗？吸引你的是里面可能有一些性爱或类似的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And why not? And you know, for about a minute, I thought, "Oh, I'm going to graduate from college and write the great American novel." And then it occurred to me, I don't even like reading the great American novel. Why would I write one? When you're reading these abridged versions in **Good Housekeeping**, was the appeal that they were grown up? Was the appeal that it was about romance? Was the appeal that there was maybe some sex or something analogous to that in there?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我不认为有，我觉得**《好管家》**把所有性爱内容都删掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I don't think there I think **Good Housekeeping** edited all the sex out.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我觉得是浪漫元素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I think it was the romance.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。我记得我读过一些其他的书，比如我妈妈青少年时期的一些书，像**《樱桃·埃姆斯》**系列，**《樱桃·埃姆斯：飞行护士》**，**《樱桃·埃姆斯：学生护士》**，里面总会有一点浪漫元素，而那些就是我反复重读的部分。所以我想我一直都喜欢浪漫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yeah. I can remember some other books I read like my mom had some books from when she was a teenager like **Cherry Ames**, **Cherry Ames Flight Nurse**, **Cherry Ames Student Nurse** and there was always a little romance in it and I those were the parts I was rereading. So I I think I just always liked the romance.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么你是什么时候开始尝试写你的“伟大的美国小说”的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, when did you first start writing your attempt at the great American novel?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 不，我从未真正那样做过。所以这实际上有两个部分。我给你讲第二个部分，实际上我是在大学三年级和四年级之间的那个夏天开始写作，后来成了我第一部出版的小说。我当时在工作，时间比较多，也在阅读，然后我就开始写了。我想那个夏天我写了四章，我说：“我会在大四的时候继续写。”当然，我大四的时候并没有坚持下去。但后来我毕业后继续写，最终写完了这本书，并找到了经纪人。我们设法把它卖出去了，同时我还在申请医学院，因为我以为自己会成为一名医生。实际上，我拿到第一份图书合同的那个月，也被医学院录取了。所以那是一个非常激动人心的月份。然后我决定推迟入学医学院，因为我知道我将无法继续写作。所以我那样做了，然后又推迟了一次。然后我经历了所谓的“四分之一人生危机”，我当时想：“天哪，我什么都不合格。我所有的朋友都去读研究生了。如果我不想做写作这件事怎么办？如果写作不成功怎么办？”我慌了。我做了我称之为“最短的入口通往最长的公路”的事情，那就是敲开医学院的门，当时已经是八月了，我说：“我能回来吗？我能进去吗？”他们让我进去了。我仍然不敢相信他们让我进去了。我在那里待了两三个月。我意识到这不适合我。然后我就退学了。所以从那时起我就一直在写作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: No, I I never really did that. So there's actually two parts to this. I'll give you the second one, which was actually I started writing what became my first published novel. The summer between my junior and senior year of college, I was I was working and I had more time and I was reading and I just started and I wrote I think four chapters over the summer and I said, "I'm going to keep doing this during my senior year." And of course, I didn't keep doing it during my senior year. But then I I kept going once I graduated and I ended up writing this book and I got an agent. We managed to sell it and we we at the same time I was applying to medical school because I thought I was going to become a doctor and I actually got my first book deal the same month I was accepted to medical school. So that was a very exciting month. And then I ended up deferring from medical school because I knew I would never be able to pursue the writing. And so I did that and then I deferred again. And then I had what I call my quarter life crisis where I thought, "Oh my gosh, I'm not qualified for anything. All my friends are going to graduate school. What if I don't want to do this writing thing? What if the writing doesn't work out? And I panicked. And I did what I call the shortest on-ramp onto the longest highway, which was to knock on the door of the medical school. And it's literally August at this point and say, "Can I come back? Can I go in?" And they let me. I still can't believe they let me. And I was there for about 2 or 3 months. And I realized this is not the right thing for me. And I withdrew. And so I've been writing ever since.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在你职业生涯的早期，在你人生的这个阶段，你可以选择这么多不同的方向，是什么让你说“我必须做这个”，而不是去医学院，可能过上不错的生活，余生衣食无忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What was it about the writing at that point at this early part of your career of your life you can embark in all these different direction where you said I have to do this as opposed to go to medical school and probably make a fine living and be set for the rest of my life in a way

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 你必须记住，当我进入然后退出医学院时，我已经出版了三部小说，这也表明我的世界观是多么有限，因为我当时坐在那里说我什么都不合格，然而我已经在纽约一家主要出版社出版了三部小说，这有点像是梦想，对吧？但当我离开时，它不像说“我离开医学院去写小说”那样充满浪漫和戏剧性。我的意思是，我当时已经出版了小说。我已经知道作为一名职业作家是什么感觉了。我赚得不多，但足够养活自己。我的意思是，我没有孩子，也没有房贷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: You have to remember that when I entered and then exited medical school I had already published three novels which also goes to show you how limited my worldview was because I'm sitting saying I'm not qualified for anything and yet I'd published three novels with a major publishing house in New York, which is kind of the dream, right? But when I left, it's not quite the romance and the drama of saying like, I'm leaving medical school to write a novel. I mean, I already had published novels. I already knew what it was like to be a working writer. I wasn't earning a lot, but I was earning enough to support myself. I mean, I had no kids and no mortgage.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 谁是第一个告诉你或给你信心让你继续前进的人？谁说：“这是一个真实的故事。这是一本真正的书。你做到了。继续写吧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Who was the first person that told you or gave you the confidence to to keep going? Who said, "This is a real story. This is a real book. You got it. Keep going."

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 可能是我的父亲。我当时大约13岁，我的父母离婚了，那个夏天我在南加州和父亲一起度过。我当时在读**《甜蜜梦想》**系列浪漫小说，那基本上是青少年女孩的**《哈利·奎恩》**系列浪漫小说。他从不告诉我不能读什么，但他觉得我也应该读其他东西。我当时说：“哦，我不想在夏天读**梅尔维尔**。”他说：“那**约瑟夫·康拉德**呢？”我说：“所以他对我说，听着，你告诉我你从这本书中得到了什么，我就不打扰你了。”当然我说：“嗯，为了乐趣。”他说：“好的，是的，这很好。但除了为了乐趣之外，你从这本书中得到了什么？我不会再为此烦你了。”我说：“词汇。”他说：“太棒了。你能在这本书中找到一个你以前不知道的词吗？”我找不到。这些书有很多值得推荐的地方，但丰富的词汇量不是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Probably my dad. I was about 13 and my parents were divorced and I was spending the summer with my dad down in Southern California and I was reading **Sweet Dreams** romances, which is basically like the **Harley Quinn** romances for teenage girls. He would never tell me you can't read something, but he sort of felt I should also be reading other things. And I was going, "Oh, I don't want to read **Melville** over the summer." He's like, "What about **Joseph Conrad**?" I'm going like, "So he said to me, look, you tell me something you're getting out of this book and I won't bother you." And I and of course I said, "Well, for pleasure." He goes, "Okay, yes, that's good. But something you're getting out of this book other than just reading it for pleasure and I will not bug you about this again." And I said, "Vocular words." And he said, "Great. Can you find me one word in this book that you didn't already know? I could not. There was much to recommend these books, but a robust vocabulary was not one of them.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 所以我必须快速思考，因为我真的不想读**《白鲸记》**。我说：“这是研究，因为我要写一本这样的书。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And so then I had to think really fast cuz I really didn't want to read **Moby Dick**. And I said, "It's research because I'm going to write one of these books."

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 他说：“这太棒了。”他说：“你今晚可以用电脑。”他把我安置在他的电脑前，说：“一会儿见。”他后来告诉我，他以为我会在一小时内出来，伸出手说“我要那本书”，但我却一直在里面打字，到晚上结束时，我已经写了两章这本书，我称之为**《起立鼓掌》**，那是一部青少年浪漫小说，非常符合我希望我的高中生活会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And he said, "That's amazing." He said, "You can use the computer tonight." And he parked me in front of his computer and said, "I'll see you soon." And he told me later he expected me to come out in an hour with my hand open saying I'll take the book but instead I was in there and I was typing and by the end of the night I had written like two chapters of this book I called it standing ovation it was a teenage romance and it was very much what I was hoping my high school life was going to be

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 这不是我的高中生活，在几个夏天里，我写了一整部青少年浪漫小说，然后我把它寄给了**《甜蜜梦想》**，他们拒绝得太快了，我知道他们没读，因为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: It was not what my high school life was and over the course of a couple summers I wrote an entire teenage romance and I sent it off to **Sweet Dreams** they rejected me so fast I know they didn't read because

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我现在对纽约足够了解，知道没有人会在两周内从垃圾堆里被拒绝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I know enough about New York now to know that nobody gets rejected out of the slush pile in 2 weeks.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 这根本不可能发生。我想有人看了看，说：“哦，青少年，她不会知道自己在做什么。”然后我就再也没做过任何事情，因为我不知道该怎么办。但我后来找到了它，你知道，我不得不把它扫描进去，清理干净，我不会出版它，因为这种类型的书现在已经没有市场了。但你绝对能看出那是我写的。这很有趣。我的声音绝对在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: In 2 weeks. It just doesn't happen. And I think somebody looked at it and said, "Oh, teenager, she won't know what she's doing." And I So then I never did anything more with it cuz I I didn't know what to do. But I have since found it, you know, and I had to scan it in and clean it up and and I I'm not going to publish it because there's no market for this type of book anymore. But you can absolutely tell it's me. That's the funny thing. My voice is absolutely there.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 除了你曾经写过它，现在又重新阅读之外，它有什么特点？你早期就有的那种声音，你仍然觉得它在某种程度上定义了你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And what about it, other than the fact that you once wrote it and you're reading it again? What is the voice that was there early on that you still feel like defines you in some way?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我真的不知道该怎么形容，但它听起来就像是我。我有人对我说过，你给我一本浪漫小说，我能分辨出那是你写的。我想这就是某些作家受欢迎和吸引人的部分原因，拥有一个非常独特的“声音”，你知道你会期待什么。不一定是相同的故事，但有相同的基调和声音。我想这就是我喜欢这么多我喜欢的作家的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I don't really know how to describe it, but it just sounds like me. And I I have had people say to me, you could hand me a romance novel and I could tell it was you. And I I think that's part of what makes certain authors popular and appealing is having a very distinctive voice that you know what you're going to expect. You, not necessarily the same story, but the same tone and voice. And I think that's what I love about so many of the authors that I love

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是他们的声音。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Is is is their voice.

### 浪漫文学的演变与多样性

**Gilbert Cruz**: 欢迎回来。这里是书评播客。我是**Gilbert Cruz**，我正在和**《布里奇顿》**系列丛书的作者**Julia Quinn**交谈，热门**Netflix**剧集就是根据她的书改编的。你上大学时，学习的是艺术史，但在你决定是否继续读医学院的时候，你已经出版了三部小说。你对当时浪漫文学界的情况有什么回忆？因为现在它是一个非常具体和不同的东西，我们稍后可以讨论。但当时是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Welcome back. This is the book review podcast. I'm **Gilbert Cruz** and I'm talking to **Julia Quinn**, author of the **Bridgetgerton** series of books on which the hit **Netflix** show is based. You went to school to college. You studied art history, but you also by the time you were deciding whether or not to actually go forward with medical school, you had published three novels. What is your recollection of what the scene, the romance genre, what what was it like at the time? Because it now it's something very specific and different that we can talk about later. But what was it like at the time?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 嗯，当时它是最大的生意。它绝对是出版业最大的摇钱树，但却被其他人非常看不起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Well, it was it was the biggest business. It was absolutely the biggest money maker for publishing and very much looked down upon by everyone else,

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 包括我们可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Including us probably.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。我绝不会在这里。**《纽约时报》**现在确实评论浪漫小说了，这很棒。但如果当时有人建议会发生这种事，我们只会嘲笑。我们是原因，我们现在仍然是出版社能够出版诗歌的原因，因为我们支付了账单。所以有这一点，但当时的书籍都是以大众市场平装本原版的形式出版的。它非常非常白人化，非常异性恋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yeah. I would never have been here. The **New York Times** does review romance novels now, which is amazing. But we would have just laughed if anybody suggested it would ever happen then. We were the reason, we still are the reason why publishers can publish poetry because we are paying the bills. So there was that, but the books were all very much in they would come out as mass market paperback originals. It was very, very white, very heterosexual.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 它现在仍然非常白人化和异性恋，但程度有所降低，大大降低了。我记得有一位作者，她的第一本书，或者至少是她的第一部历史浪漫小说，我想是在我的第一本书之前不久在**雅芳图书**出版的，那也是我的出版商。她的名字叫**贝弗利·詹金斯**。她是历史浪漫小说领域有史以来最伟大的作家之一。这在当时是第一次，我相当确定，你看到历史浪漫小说封面上有两个黑人角色，因为他们当时会有那种拥抱的封面，你会看到两个角色在那里。我从来都不是那种拥抱封面的忠实粉丝，但你会看到两个角色。而书封上出现两个黑人角色，这是一件大事。我想那本书叫**《夜之歌》**，是第一本。所以这个类型在多样性和包容性方面还有很长的路要走。我再次强调，现在仍然如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: It still is very white and heterosexual, but less so, much less so. I I remember there was an author who was published, right? Her first book, or at least her first historical romance, I think, was published just a little bit before my first book at **Avon Books**, which is was my publisher. Her name is **Beverly Jenkins**. And she's one of the all-time greats of historical romance. And this was the first time, I'm pretty sure, that you saw historical romance with two black characters on the front cuz they they would have the clinch covers then where you'd have and and I've never been a huge fan of clinch covers, but you'd have the two characters there. And this was a huge deal to have two black characters on the front of the book. I think I think the book was called **Night Song** was the first one. And so the genre had a long way to go in terms of diversity and inclusion. Again, I want to emphasize it still does.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 但我们在这条路上已经走了很远。所以当时就是那样。我想对于历史浪漫小说来说，你当时肯定可以在比现在更多的背景下写作，现在这个范围肯定缩小了。我主要写的**摄政时期**一直非常非常受欢迎，我一直很感激我喜欢做的事情是受欢迎的，但当我开始的时候，有很多西部小说，有很多中世纪小说，有很多像美国风情的东西，我想那不是真正的西部小说，因为没有牛仔，但……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: But but we have moved along that journey quite a bit. So it was like that. It was I think the for historical romance you definitely could write in more settings than you can now that has definitely shrunk. **Regency** which I do primarily has always been very very popular and I've always been very grateful that what I want to do is the popular one but back when I started there were a lot of westerns there were medievals there were you know like Americana type things which I guess not really western because there weren't cowboys but

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 就像美国小镇主街。是的，这是一个很好的说法。仍然非常北美和欧洲，但更多了。现在几乎所有的历史浪漫小说都设定在1800年到1890年之间的英国。人们就是喜欢这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Like Main Street USA. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Still very North American and European, but there were more. And now almost all historical romances are set in England between 1800 and 1890. It's just that's what people like.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我们必须谈谈这个。为什么人们如此喜欢它？然后你为什么如此喜欢它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: We we have to talk about that. Why why do people like that so much? And then why do you like it so much?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 所以我的理论，我更多的是在谈论**摄政时期**而不是其他任何时期，或者早期部分……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: So my theory and I'm speaking more for the **Regency** than anything else or the early part

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: **摄政时期**指的是19世纪初的英国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And **Regency** is the the early 1800s in England

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 具体来说，我想是1810年到1819年，但它的风味可能从1790年延续到1830年。我的理论是，它之所以受欢迎，我认为这对我作为读者和后来的作家都适用，是因为它足够遥远，我们可以将其浪漫化。我们可以赋予它童话般的特质。我们可以原谅我们现在绝不会接受的行为和态度。我们可以有现在行不通的情节。我的意思是，我肯定写过一本书，如果有人有手机，所有问题都能解决。你可以将现在不一定浪漫的事物浪漫化，但它又足够现代，你可以让你的角色以熟悉的方式思考、渴望和生活。我的意思是，如果你回到中世纪时代，世界会有一种宗教性和神秘主义，我认为这种特质在很大程度上已经消失了。所以，是的，价值观不同。人们更常去教堂。有很多事情不同，但人们不再把这个世界看作一个完全神秘的地方了。所以我可以给我的角色一些东西，比如**本尼迪克特·布里奇顿**在书中的主要性格特征之一，我想在剧中也是如此，就是他觉得自己在这个大家庭中被削弱了，人们称他为“老二”，比如“哦，他是第二个”，我认为这对于现代人来说也非常熟悉，如果你来自一个大家庭，就会有那种“哦，那是某某的小弟弟”的感觉。所以我们可以赋予这些角色特征、希望和梦想，这些在根本上仍然是熟悉的。所以这是一个甜蜜点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Specifically. I think it's 1810 to 1819, but like the flavor of it kind of probably goes from like 1790 to 1830. And my theory about why it's popular, which I think extends to me as a reader and then a writer too, is that it is far enough in the past that we can romanticize it. We can give it fairy tale qualities. We can excuse behavior and attitudes that we would never accept now. We can have plots that wouldn't work now. I mean, I'm sure I've written a book where everything could be solved if somebody had a cell phone. You can romanticize things that wouldn't necessarily be romantic now, but it's modern enough that you can have your characters think and and and and desire and and want to live a life in ways that are familiar. What I mean by that is if you go say all the way back to medieval times or something, there is a religiosity and mysticism to the world that I think was largely gone. So yes, the values are different. People more churchgoing. There are a lot of things different, but people didn't see this world as quite this mystic place anymore. So I can give things to my characters like one of the main parts of **Benedict Bridgetton**'s characterization in the book and I think also in the show is that he really feels kind of reduced by the fact he's in this big family and people call him number two like oh he's the second one and I think that's something that's very familiar to modern people as well if you come from a big family of of just being sort of like oh that's so and so's little brother that's that kind of thing. So we can give these these aspects of characterizations and hopes and dreams which are still fundamentally familiar. So it's it's a sweet spot.

### 《布里奇顿》：文化现象与选角争议

**Gilbert Cruz**: **《布里奇顿》**第一季于2020年12月首播，那是疫情第一年的年末。你和一位医生住在一起。圣诞节到了，这部剧也播出了。带我回到那一天，那一年最后的几周。你当时是什么感觉？有多惊讶？告诉我发生的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: The first season of **Bridgetgerton** debuted in 2020. It's December. It's the end of that first year of the pandemic. You live with a doctor. Christmas Day comes. This show comes out. Take me back to that day. Those last few weeks of the year. What was it like for you? How surprising was it? Tell me everything that happened.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 那是超现实而神奇的，以各种可能的方式。我从未想过我们会失败。我知道有足够多的浪漫小说读者渴望这样的东西。我是否认为它会达到现在的成就？不。我不认为有人会梦想得那么大。很明显，有什么东西正在爆发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: It was surreal and magical in every possible way. I I never thought we were going to have a flop. I knew there were enough romance readers who were just dying for something like this. Did I think it was going to do what it did? No. I don't think anybody dreams that big. It was obvious that something was exploding.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你是这部剧的顾问制片人。这仍然是你在剧中的头衔吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You're a consulting producer on the series. Is that still your your title? Visa v the show.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的。这个头衔听起来比实际要重要得多，但是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yes. The title makes it sound like much more than it actually is, but yes,

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你是顾问制片人。这部剧由**Shonda Rhimes**担任总制作人。创造了这些世界、这些角色，然后说“好吧，大家，照顾好我的孩子们”，这是一种怎样的体验？现在又是一种怎样的体验？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You're a consulting producer. It it is it is showrunned by **Shaolan**. What was it like and what does it continue to be like to have created these world these characters and then be like okay here you go everyone take care of my babies.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我对说“照顾好我的孩子们”没有任何问题。我知道对一些作者来说，这是件大事。我是一个在一天结束时关掉电脑，他们就消失了的人。我不是那种会梦到角色的人。我不会一直想着他们。我非常善于区分。当我写完一本书时，我真的不会去想这些角色会发生什么，除非我因为某种原因需要让他们作为次要角色再次出现。所以，距离最后一本书出版已经11年了。所以我在很多方面都已经向前看了。所以这并不难。真正令人着迷和意想不到的是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I had no trouble with saying take care of my babies. I I know for some authors it's a really big deal. I'm somebody who at the end of the day I shut my computer and they're gone. I'm not somebody who dreams about characters. I'm not thinking about them all the time. I'm very compartmentalized. And when I finish a book, I don't really think about what happens to these characters unless I need to bring them back for some reason as secondary characters. And so it was 11 years after the last book had come out. So I had already moved on in many ways. So that was not hard. What is really fascinating and what was unexpected was to

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 发现自己创作的东西变成了一个文化巨头，真正进入了国际思潮，人们可以说：“哦，那太**《布里奇顿》**了。”你知道他们是什么意思。比如他们在**《辛普森一家》**里恶搞了它。他们在**《辛普森一家》**里有“隧道镇”，这……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Have found myself having authored something that turned into this cultural juggernaut and really entered the international zeitgeist where people can say, "Oh, that's so **Bridgetgerton**." And and you know what they mean. And like they spoofed it on the **Simpsons**. They had Tunnelton on the **Simpsons**, which

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那就是你知道某件事会永垂不朽的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: That's that's when you know something's going to be forever.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我在来这里的车上发现，它在新版**《布偶秀》**里出现了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: What I found out in the car coming over here is that it's on the new reboot of **The Muppet Show**.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 真的吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Really?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 猪和假发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Pigs and wigs.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 好的，这很不错。我相信你看到每一季都有很多人对书到屏幕的改编有很多看法。我好奇的是，作为一名作者，而且你的最后一本书出版和这部剧播出之间有巨大的时间间隔，有没有哪些改变对你这个创作者来说特别有意义？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: All right, that's pretty good. I'm sure you see every season there are lots of people that have so many opinions about changes from books to screen. I'm wondering as an author and again there's been this huge gap between when you published the last book and when the show came out. Have there been any changes that have been particularly meaningful for you as the person who generated this all?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 当然，最有意义的改变是决定采用**有色人种选角**。很多人称之为“色盲选角”，但这不准确。“色盲选角”是你只根据演员的才能来选择角色。如果他们采用“色盲选角”，**布里奇顿**家族的成员可能看起来不像有血缘关系。相反，他们采用了**有色人种选角**，他们希望拥有一个多民族、更具包容性的演员阵容。他们非常深入地思考了在哪里选角。我喜欢它。我写书时不是这样写的。我想我在书中没有明确说明任何人的种族，但我认为他们是白人这一点是相当明确的。我不是一个特别善于描写的作者，也许这有所帮助。**Shonda Rhimes**有一次对我说的一件事，真的触动了我，她说当她读这些书时，她从未感到被排斥。她从未觉得自己在故事中找不到自己的身影，这对我来说意义重大。但再次强调，书本没有剧集那样的多样性。我很高兴他们找到了这种方式，使它成为一部剧集和一个世界，让更多的人能在故事中看到自己。我知道他们会做些什么，因为那是**Shonda Rhimes**。他们不会制作全是白人的剧集。我当时想，好吧，要么他们会采用我之前提到的“色盲选角”，但我对此并不满意。**布里奇顿**家族的整体特点是他们都长得很像。或者我想他们会以某种方式改变情节，引入更多与种族主义或殖民主义的真实创伤和历史相关的焦虑。

**Julia Quinn**: Certainly the most meaningful one was the decision to use **color conscious casting** and a lot of people refer to as colorblind casting but that's not that's not accurate. Colorblind casting would be where you just you approach each role and you just pick somebody based on their talents. If they had done colorblind casting, for example, the **Bridgetgertons** might not look like they could possibly be genetically related. Instead, they did **color conscious casting** where they wanted to have a multi-racial and much more inclusive cast. And they thought very deeply about who they were going to cast where. And I love it. That's not how I wrote the books. I don't think I specified anybody's race in the book, but I think it's fairly well implied that they were white. I'm not a terribly descriptive author, and maybe that helped. One thing that **Shondaanda** said to me once, which really touched me was that she said when she was reading the books, she never felt excluded. She never felt like she couldn't see herself in the story, which meant a lot to me that she said that. But again, the books don't have the same diversity that the show has. And I am thrilled that they found a way to do this to make it a show and a world where more people can see themselves in the story. I knew they were going to do something because it's **Shaolin**. They don't they don't do shows where everybody's all white. And I thought, okay, well, either they're going to go colorblind casting like what I talked about, which I wasn't thrilled about. Part of the whole **Bridgetton** family thing is that they all look alike and that sort of thing. Or I thought they were going to change up the plots in a way to introduce more like angst that has to do with the very real traumas and a history of racism

**Gilbert Cruz**: 或者殖民主义。

**Julia Quinn**: 是的，引入更多这些元素。相反，他们找到了一个完全不同的方法，那就是探讨这个非常真实的**历史问题**：**夏洛特女王**是否是混血儿？我们知道她确实有一些非洲血统，这在她的家谱中是存在的。我们不知道的是，她是否以混血儿的身份出现过，我们永远也无法知道。但我们也知道，如果她确实以混血儿的身份出现过，那也不是他们会大肆宣扬或接受的事情。所以，这部剧的创作者**Chris Van Dusen**和**Shonda Rhimes**以及所有人都说：“好吧，如果她确实以混血儿的身份出现，如果这被接受和认可，那会如何改变历史呢？”于是他们就有了这个想法，将剧集设定在有色人种进入这个上流社会世界之后的一代，以及这可能会如何改变它。所以你一开始看到的世界就和真实世界不同。但没有人说这是一堂历史课。我认为这非常重要，也是我从未需要了解的事情。我认为**特权**的定义之一，就是你从未需要思考的所有事情。我绝不是英国贵族出身。我甚至不是英国血统。但当我观看一部时代剧时，里面的人足够像我，我能在其中看到自己。我很惭愧地说，我从未想过所有那些无法在其中看到自己的人。而有了**《布里奇顿》**，突然间，穿着舞会礼服的女主角来自印度南部的一个邦。我最亲密的朋友之一**Chitra**打电话给我，几乎哭了，说：“我从未在这些作品中看到过自己。”你意识到这有多么重要，因为这是一个关于**幸福结局**的故事，尤其是在一个人们可以看到像他们一样的人被描绘出来的地方，这是一个关于**欢乐**、**幸福**和**爱**的故事，而不仅仅是关于任何创伤的故事。我认为这很棒，我非常感谢**Shonda Rhimes**让它发生。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Yeah bring more of that in. Instead they found something entirely different which was to take this very real historical question which is was **Queen Charlotte** of mixed race and and just to address that we know she definitely had some African ancestry that's just there in her family tree. What we don't know is that if she presented as biracial in any way, and we'll never know that. But we also know that if she did present as biracial in any way, it was not something that they were playing up or accepting. And so **Chris Van Dusen**, the the creator of the show, and and **Shondaa** and everybody, **Shauna Lynn** said, "Okay, well, what if she did definitely present as biracial? And what if that was accepted and recognized and how would might that have changed history?" And so that's how they got the idea to start the show one generation beyond the introduction of of color into this high society world and what how might that have changed it. And so you just open with the world being different than it really was. But nobody said it's a history lesson. And I think it's just so important and it's something that I never had to know about. I think the definition, one of the definitions of **privilege** is really all the things that you never have to think about. I don't come from British aristocratic stock by any sense. I don't even come from British stock. But when I watch a period drama, the people look enough like me that I can see myself in it. And I'm ashamed to say I never thought about all the people who couldn't. And with **Bridgetgerton**, suddenly the heroin in the ball gown comes from a southern Indian state. And one of my closest friends, **Chitra**, calls me up practically crying saying, "I never got to see myself in these things." And you realize how important it is because it's a story about **happy endings**, especially of having a place where people can see somebody like them depicted where it's a story about **joy** and **happiness** and **love** and not just about the trauma of whatever happened. And I think it's wonderful and I'm very grateful to **Shaolin** for making it happen.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 每当一位作者或艺术家，任何类型的创作者，参与到热门作品中时，我总是很好奇他们必须如何与世界互动或接触。我想你有很多只通过书认识你的粉丝。一旦你进入**Netflix**的层面，你就会拥有一个完全不同，可能更强烈的粉丝群体，与**《布里奇顿》**相关联。你觉得驾驭不同类型的反馈和人们的声音是美妙的，还是困难的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Whenever an author or an artist, a creator of any sort is involved in something popular, I'm always very curious about the way that they have to interact or interface with the world. I imagine you had a lot of fans who just knew you from the book. And once you ascend into the **Netflix** plane, you have a whole other possibly more intense level of fandom that is associated with **Bridgetton**. Have you found it wonderful, difficult to navigate the different kinds of feedback and people that people's voices that you have to interact with?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: “美妙”和“困难”都是很好的词来形容。大多数事情都很美妙。有些粉丝群体非常狂热，有些则像人们把自己视为特定情侣的粉丝。所以第二季的粉丝是**安东尼**。第三季是**波林**，然后第四季是**本菲**。你不会看到那么多**西蒙**和**达芙妮**的粉丝。我不知道。我真的不能，但确实是这三对，他们有时会像打仗一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Wonderful and difficult are both good words for that. Most everything is wonderful. Some of the the fandoms are are pretty intense and some of it is just like you people like consider themselves like fans of specific couples. So the season 2 fans are **Anthony**. This season 3 is **Pollen** and then season four is **Benfy**. And you don't see as many **Simon** and and **Daphne** ones. I don't Diamond. I I can't really but it's really these three sets and they like go to war sometimes.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Uhhuh.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 你就得说：“哇。好吧。”然后有些人会对剧集所做的一些事情感到非常愤怒。另一件有趣的事情是，有些人会对书中某些被改变的东西感到非常愤怒。我没想到的是，他们中的一些人会对我进行如此程度的谩骂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And you just they have to be like wow. Okay. And then there are some people they get angry about something the show does. And another thing that's interesting is that there are some who get very angry about certain things that have been changed from the books. And what I didn't expect was the level of vitrial some of them will point toward me.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的，这就是我好奇的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah, that's that's what I'm curious about.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 是的，确实有人说她只是为了钱。她只关心她的薪水。这其中很大一部分是因为其中一个角色从男性改成了女性，这为**女同性恋关系**打开了大门。老实说，你知道，对于所有指责我为了钱出卖粉丝的人，我不知道你什么时候会把电视节目中的异性恋关系变成同性恋关系，而且是为了钱。我不认为你会为了钱这样做。我不认为你会因此赚更多的钱。我认为你这样做是因为你想讲述一个不同的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: And yeah, there is that people saying she's just in it for the money. She only cares about her paycheck. And a lot of this is about one of the characters has been changed from a man to a woman, which is opening the door for a **lesbian relationship**. And honestly, you know, for all the people who are accusing me of of selling out fans and just doing for a paycheck, I don't know when you take a heterosexual relationship in a television show and make it into a homosexual relationship in the television show and do it for money. I don't think you do that for money. I don't think you're making more money off that. I think you do it because you you want to tell a different story.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你从事浪漫小说写作已经有一段时间了。你谈到了你刚开始时的情景。我们现在正处在一个时期，尽管它在十年前、二十年前就已经很成功了，但现在它真的达到了一个惊人的高度。你有很多子类型正在蓬勃发展。无论是浪漫喜剧，它本身就是一个子类型，今年，也就是2026年，我们已经看到了由于**《炽热的竞争》**改编，**酷儿冰球浪漫**子类型开始蓬勃发展。你身边有**艾米丽·亨利**、**泰勒·詹金斯·里德**和**茉莉·吉勒**等热门作家，还有其他很多人。作为在这个类型中摸爬滚打了一段时间并取得成功的人，你现在此刻感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You have been a romance writer for quite a while now. You talked about what it was like when you first started. We are in a moment right now where as successful as it was a decade, a couple decades ago, it really is an amazing place right now. You have all these subg genres that are just really thriving. Whether it's romantic, which is its own subgenre already this year in 2026, we've seen because of the **heated rivalry** adaptation, the queer hockey romance subgenre start to thrive. You have alongside you hit authors like **Emily Henry** and **Taylor Jenkins Reed** and and **Jasmine Giller** and a bunch of other people. As a person who has been in the genre for a while and has succeeded, how does it feel to you right now in this moment?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 这相当了不起。我的意思是，在年初，嗯，我想现在是二月了，但我们有**《布里奇顿》**。我们有**《假期相遇》**和**《炽热的竞争》**。我的意思是，看到这一切真是不可思议，而且还有更多作品即将问世。所以这真的很棒。但让我有点好奇的是，除了我之外，这股热潮并没有真正延伸到历史浪漫小说领域。我不太确定为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: It's it's pretty remarkable. I mean to have the beginning of it's what well we I guess it's February now, but we have **Bridgetgerton**. We had people we meet on vacation and **heated rivalry**. I mean it's incredible to see all that and you and there's more coming. So it's really wonderful. But what what's been kind of curious to me is that except for me, this boom has not really extended toward historical romance that much. And I'm not entirely certain why.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我的一部分想法是，天哪，我希望不是他们拿起一本**《布里奇顿》**小说，然后说：“嗯，我不喜欢这个。我再也不读了。”但我认为不是这样，因为我的数据显示，读**《布里奇顿》**小说的人大多会读完它们，而且我的很多书他们都喜欢。但出于某种原因，他们没有转向其他作者。所以我实际上一直在努力改变这种状况。我创办了一个名为**JQ Editions**的读书俱乐部，它既是读书俱乐部，也是订阅盒，里面的书都是我亲手挑选的。所以你每隔一个月就会收到一份我精选的、我认为是最好的历史浪漫小说。它混合了新书、近期佳作以及我称之为现代类型经典的图书。我们还为它们制作了精美的封面。这是现在出版业的另一件大事，就是每本书都有特别版。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Part of me is thinking like, gosh, I hope it's not that they're picking up a **Bridgetton** novel and saying, well, I don't like this. I'm not doing anything again. But I I don't think that's it because my data seems to show me that people who come to the **Bridgetton** novels read most of them and a lot of my books, they're liking that. And for some reason, they're not moving on to other authors. And so I actually have been trying to do something about that. I started a book club called **JQ Editions** which is well part book club, part subscription box where it's all it's hand selected by me. So you're getting a curated selection every other month of what I consider the best of the best historical romances. And it is a mix of new books, recent gems, and what are my I'm calling classics of the modern genre. And we're doing them up in beautiful covers. That's the other big thing in publishing now is that everything has a special edition.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 封面、喷边、扉页。

**Gilbert Cruz**: The covers, the sprayed edges, the end papers.

**Julia Quinn**: Oh my gosh. Yeah, it's it's been fun. But nobody in historical romance was getting it except for me. So now I'm I'm giving it to other.

### 读书偏好与阅读体验

**Gilbert Cruz**: 随着我们对话接近尾声，我想转向一系列我们为你准备的特别问题。十多年来，**《纽约时报书评》**每周都会向作者提出一系列关于他们的阅读生活的问题，这是我们称之为“按书行事”系列的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: As we approach the end of our conversation, I want to turn to a very particular set of questions that we have for you. For more than a decade, every week, the **New York Times Book Review** has asked authors a recurring set of questions about their reading, about their reading lives, part of a series that we call Buy the Book.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 按书行事。

**Julia Quinn**: 我希望如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I hope so.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 好的，这里有一些“按书行事”的问题给你。**茱莉亚·奎恩**，你的床头柜上有什么书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Okay, here are some by the book questions for you. **Julia Quinn**, what is on your nightstand?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我床头柜上现在放着**凯特·奎恩**的**《星界图书馆》**，她和我没有亲戚关系，但她是一个很棒的人。这本书很难描述。**凯特·奎恩**以历史小说作家著称。这是她第一次尝试**魔幻现实主义**，书中有一个图书馆，它基本上是一个神奇的图书馆，有自己的意识，允许那些需要逃避生活中困境的人，比如一个虐待他们的丈夫或其他糟糕处境的人，进入并生活在他们最喜欢的书页中。而**《星界图书馆》**本身正受到外部力量的围攻，我们勇敢的女主角必须拯救它。我喜欢勇敢的女主角。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: On my nightstand right now is **The Astral Library** by **Kate Quinn**, who is no relation, but a wonderful person. It's a very difficult book to describe. **Kate Quinn** is known as a historical fiction author. This is her first jump into magical realism where you've got this library that's basically it's a magical library that's kind of its own sentient being and allows people who kind of need to escape things in their lives like maybe an abusive husband or some other bad situation to come in and live their lives within the pages of a favorite book. And the **Astral Library** itself is under kind of a siege from outside forces and our plucky heroine has to save at the **Astral Library**. I love a plucky heroin.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yes.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 人们在你的书架上发现哪本书会感到惊讶？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我会选择**《银河系漫游指南》**，我非常喜欢。实际上，不是每个人都会惊讶，因为眼尖的**《浪漫的布里奇顿先生》**读者，也就是**科林**和**佩内洛普**的故事，会在书中发现对**《银河系漫游指南》**的小小致敬，有人问：“生活中有多少伟大的奥秘？”**科林**回答：“我不知道，42个。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I'm going to go with **The Hitcher's Guide to the Galaxy**, which I adore. And actually, not everybody would be surprised because eagle-eyed readers of **Romancing Mr. Bridgetton**, which is Colin and Penelope story, will spot a little homage to the **Hitcher's Guide** in the book, which is somebody says, "How many great mysteries of life are there anyway?" And Cullen says, "I don't know, 42."

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我懂那个梗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I get that reference.

**Julia Quinn**: 我喜欢那个。我喜欢我这个摄政时期历史浪漫小说作家，竟然能把**《银河系漫游指南》**放进我的一本书里。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I love that. And I love that I, the Regency historical romance author, managed to put **Hitchhiker's Guide** into one of my books.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Sneaky, sneaky. Julia, what is your favorite book that no one else has really heard of?

**Julia Quinn**: 我会说那是一本回忆录，叫做**《迷失之地：在郊区荒谬成长》**，作者是**马克·萨尔斯曼**。那本书是作为礼物送给我的，因为开篇段落……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: I would say it is a memoir called **Lost in Place: Growing Up Absurd in Suburbia** by **Mark Salsman**. His name is. And that was given to me as a gift because the opening paragraph

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 谈到他说：“我告诉我的父母，我愿意放弃我在**伊斯特里奇初级中学**的学籍。”我说：“我上过**伊斯特里奇初级中学**。”所以，这本书的背景设定在我的家乡，他实际上和我上的是同一所学校。这就是我得到它的原因。我一直留着它，因为它是一个关于在非常特定的时间和地点成长的精彩故事，这个时间和地点非常接近我的时间和地点。它就是我的地方，非常接近我的时代，而且它写得太美了，又那么有趣和真挚，我实际上送给别人很多次了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Talks about him saying, "I informed my parents I was willing to renounce my spot at **Eastridge Junior High School**." And I said, "I went to **Eastridge Junior High School**." So, this is set in my hometown, and he's actually going to the same schools I went to. And that's why I got it. And I kept it because it is just this amazing story of growing up in a very specific time and place which is very close to my time and place. It is my place, very close to my time and it's just it's so beautifully written and so funny and heartfelt and I have given it as a gift actually many many times.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 茱莉亚，这引出了我的下一个问题，你收到的最好的礼物书是什么？这是一个难题，因为我经常收到别人送的书，但我认为那是**史蒂夫·库格**的**《夏日末日》**，我总是不得不停下来思考是否有“The”，但我没有，我想它就是**《夏日末日》**，那实际上是我的出版商**哈珀柯林斯**的一个人送的礼物。一位编辑，不是我的编辑，另一位编辑，她觉得我一定会喜欢，她就寄给我了，她完全是对的。那也是我送给很多人的一本书。这是一部书信体小说，背景设定在二战期间的布鲁克林，讲述了一个我想是12或13岁的男孩**乔伊·马格尔斯**的故事，所以里面有电报、成人礼节目和信件，它就是那种非常非常有趣，但又会让你心痛的书。

<details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Julia, that segus into my next question which is what is the best book you've ever received as a gift? So, this is a tough one because I get people get me books a lot, but I think it was **Last Days of Summer** by **Steve Kuger** and I'm always having to stop and think if there's a the but I don't I think it's just **Last Days of Summer** and that was a gift actually from somebody at **HarperCollins**, my publishing house. An editor, not my editor, different editor just thought I would love it and she sent it and she was absolutely right. And that is another book I' I have given as a gift to a lot of people too. It's an episttolary novel set during World War II set in Brooklyn about this, I think it's 12 or 13year-old boy named **Joey Margles** who's and and so you've got like telegrams and bar mitzvah programs and letters and and and it's one of those books that is so so so funny and yet will just punch you in the gut.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 太棒了。是的。

**Gilbert Cruz**: Amazing. Yes.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 好的，最后一个“按书行事”的问题。茱莉亚，描述一下你理想的阅读体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Okay, last by the book question. Julia, describe your ideal reading experience.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 我是一个随时随地都能阅读的人。我不需要理想的阅读体验。你会发现我能在任何地方阅读。真的。

**Julia Quinn**: I am somebody who will read anytime, anywhere. I don't need an ideal reading experience. You will find me reading anywhere I can. Truly,

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你有没有一点点怀念，当只有你和你的书，以及你的书的粉丝的时候，而**《布里奇顿》**周围发生的爆炸式增长，让它变得不那么属于你自己的东西了？

<details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Is there any part of you at all that misses when it was just you and your books and the fans of your books and that the explosion that has happened around **Bridgetgerton** has just made it a little less your own thing?

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 不，不，这很棒。这很棒。太棒了。是的。而且我也不像演员那样，我不会被认出来。我能用一只手指数出我被认出来的次数，而且那不是在某种与书相关的场合，比如**ALA大会**，那不算。

**Julia Quinn**: No, no, this is great. This this is great. It's wonderful. Yeah. And and I'm not like the cast like I don't get recognized. I can count on one hand the times I've been recognized where I was not in some sort of bookreated place walking around like the **ALA convention** like that doesn't count.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 所以不像演员那样，他们不得不大大改变自己的日常生活。所以不，这一切都很棒。我可以积极地参与到对我来说意义重大的政治事业和慈善事业中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: So it's not like the cast who have had to change their daily lives in a big way. So no, this is all wonderful. I get to be active and and passionate about political causes and philanthropic causes that

**Julia Quinn**: 这对我意义重大。我非常想指出，我之所以能做到这一点，部分原因是因为这部剧和我的书让我拥有了非常稳定的经济基础。所以即使我疏远了一些读者，我也没关系。我绝不想……

**Julia Quinn**: That mean a lot to me. And I I very much want to point out also that part of the reason I can do that is because the show and and my books have made me very financially secure. So if I do alienate some of my readers, I'm okay. And and I would never want to

</details>

**Julia Quinn**: 做任何贬低那些觉得不能发声的作者的事情，因为他们可能需要尽可能多地卖书来养活孩子。所以不是每个人都有能力或特权对他们认为非常重要的问题发声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Quinn**: Do anything to put down authors who don't feel they can speak out because they may they have they may be needing to sell as many books as they can just to feed their kids. And so not everybody is in the position or has the privilege where they can speak out about issues that are very important to them.
