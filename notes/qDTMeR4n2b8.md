title: "量化美好生活：一位管理咨询师如何用 Excel 追踪并管理人生幸福"
summary: "我们习惯用可穿戴设备监测健康，但很少有人量化生活中其他重要的维度。演讲者分享了他如何利用管理咨询中的核心原则——“凡是可测量的，就能被管理”，构建了一个包含九个维度的生活追踪系统。通过这个简单的 Excel 工具，他不仅克服了认知扭曲和情绪波动，还及时挽救了被忽视的亲密关系，从而真正迈向蓬勃发展的人生。"

### 不仅仅是健康监测

如果你们使用**可穿戴设备**（Wearable: 智能手表或手环等健康监测设备），请举手示意一下好吗？比如 **Fitbit**、**Oura**、**Apple Watch**，用来追踪健康的，来吧。好的，好的，大概有一半人。我很喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Can I get a show of hands if you use a wearable? Fitbit, Oura, Apple Watch, track your health, come on. OK, OK, it's like 50 percent of you. I love this.

</details>

所以我今天想问大家的问题——不仅是针对你们，也针对那些不使用可穿戴设备的人——如果我们不仅测量健康，而是扩展到测量生活中所有重要的部分，会怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So my question for us today, for you, but also the non-wearables, is what if we expanded from not just measuring our health but to measuring all the important parts of our lives?

</details>

这一切真正开始于我刚过 25 岁的时候。我开始相当频繁地在半夜醒来，伴随着恐慌感。很多人醒来时脑子里跳动着“待办事项清单”（to-do lists）。也许你们中有很多人是这样？我也有待办事项清单，但我还有一个重大的“成为清单”（to-be list）。真的就是关于：我会成为一个好男人吗？我会过上美好的生活吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So this really started for me right after I turned 25, and I started to wake up in the middle of the night pretty consistently with these panics. A lot of folks wake up with to-do lists bouncing through their minds. A lot of you maybe, some of you? I had to-do lists, but I also had this major to-be list. Really just will I be a good man, will I live a good life?

</details>

### 从自大到自我审视

通常来说，我是一个相当缺乏安全感的人。但我有这么一点，我有一位极具鼓励性的母亲。也许你们有些人也有这样的妈妈。我的妈妈可能更具鼓励性。所以，伴随着她在我想象中的声音，我基本上会这样回答那个问题：是的，我会过上美好的生活。事实上，也许她是这类，我会改变数百万人的生活。也许我会成为总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And now, I'm a pretty insecure guy generally. But I have this thing, I have one of those extremely encouraging moms. Which maybe some of you have. Mine is very likely more encouraging. And so, with her voice in my mind, I would basically answer the question, yeah, I am going to live a good life. In fact, maybe she's right, I will change millions of lives. Maybe I'll be president.

</details>

所以我从 25 岁到大概 33 岁一直持有这种叙事。然后我到了 33 岁。我并没有改变那么多人的生活。有一天我发现，**Bill Clinton**（比尔·克林顿）在 33 岁时已经是州长了，这对你们大多数人来说可能没什么大不了的。但去问问我的妻子 **Ashley**，这让我崩溃了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So I had this narrative from 25 to about 33, and then I hit 33. And I haven't changed that many lives. And I find out one day that Bill Clinton was already a governor by 33, which to most of you is no big deal. But ask my wife, Ashley, that broke me.

</details>

我觉得发生的事情是，它某种程度上粉碎了我这种由母亲引发的自大狂想，迫使我真正审视我的生活。所以我审视了我的职业生涯，但我的友谊呢？我对社会的贡献呢？我的品格呢？老实说，我看了看，我过得还行，但我并没有在蓬勃发展，我没有在绽放。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I think what happened is it kind of shattered this, sort of, mom-induced megalomania I had, and it made me take an actual look at my life. And so I looked at my professional life, but then what about my friendships? What about my contributions to society, what about my character? And honestly, I looked and I was fine, but I wasn't thriving, I wasn't flourishing.

</details>

然后我突然意识到，你知道吗，Chris，很多人并没有过上美好的生活。你凭什么认为你会自动变得与众不同？如果我在 50 年后醒来，发现我没有成为我想成为的那个人怎么办？我猜你们中的一些人也有类似的想法，因为 **Gallup**（盖洛普：全球知名的民意测验和咨询公司）告诉我们，只有 33% 的人在生活中是蓬勃发展的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so then it struck me, you know, Chris, a lot of people don't live good lives. Why do you think you would automatically be any different? What if I wake up in 50 years and I discover I have not become the man I wanted to be. I'm guessing some of you have similar thoughts, because Gallup tells us that only 33 percent of us are thriving in life.

</details>

### 量化美好生活的九个维度

所以如果你像我一样属于另外那 66%，我们如何进入那 33% 呢？我是一名**管理咨询师**。所以有一件事是我们深爱并深信不疑的。如果你知道的话，跟我一起说：**凡是可测量的，就能被管理**（What gets measured, gets managed）。来吧，伙计们，你们知道这句话的。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So if you're in the other 66 percent, like me, how do we get into the 33 percent? Now I am a management consultant. And so there's one thing that we love and believe deeply. Say it with me if you know it. What gets measured, gets managed. Come on, guys, you know this. (Laughter)

</details>

你看，大概 50% 的人使用可穿戴设备来测量健康，大概是为了管理它，但我找不到任何类似的东西来测量生活中所有重要的维度。所以我创建了这个超级简单、有点笨重的 **Excel** 追踪表供我自己使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, what is it, 50 percent of us use wearables to measure our health, to presumably manage it, but I couldn't find anything like that to measure all the dimensions that mattered in life. So I created this super simple, kind of clunky Excel tracker that I use.

</details>

第一步是确定美好生活的维度。所以我从我的信仰开始，然后我引入了研究这些东西的思想家们的见解。从 **Aristotle**（亚里士多德）到所谓的哈佛幸福研究，到 **Martin Seligman**（马丁·塞利格曼）的积极心理学，到 **Clayton Christensen**（克莱顿·克里斯坦森）的《How Will You Measure Your Life?》（你要如何衡量你的人生），到我的教授 **Arthur Brooks**（阿瑟·布鲁克斯）关于幸福的研究，再到这个全球繁荣研究，以及我的 **BCG**（波士顿咨询公司）同事写的一篇很酷的文章，叫《策略化你的人生》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So the first step was to identify the dimensions of a good life. So I started with my faith, but then I brought in insights from the thinkers who've studied this stuff. So from Aristotle to this thing called the Harvard Happiness Study to Martin Seligman's positive psychology to Clayton Christensen’s “How Will You Measure Your Life?” to my professor Arthur Brooks's research on happiness, to this global flourishing study and this cool article by my colleagues at BCG called "Strategize Your Life."

</details>

最终我确定了对我来说美好生活的这九个维度。你们看到这些可能会觉得，这很显而易见，对吧？这正是重点所在，因为从古至今，这些要素一直惊人地一致。它们是可知的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so I landed on these nine dimensions of the good life for me. You're seeing these and you're like, pretty obvious, right? Which is kind of the point, because from the ancients to the moderns, these ingredients have been remarkably consistent. They're knowable.

</details>

### 每日 90 秒的自我追踪

第二步，测量。我有幸在 **Gallup** 工作了几年，如果你了解他们的话。所以我有一种书呆子气的爱好，就是喜欢设计调查问卷。所以我把这九个维度转化成了一个大约 20 个问题的调查，我几乎每天都回答。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So step two, measure. I had the privilege of working for Gallup for a few years, if you know them. And so I had this nerdy thing where I love building surveys. So I turned these nine dimensions into kind of a 20-ish question survey that I answer pretty much every day.

</details>

就是这些问题。我还有一些每周回答的问题，比如对社会的贡献。这对我来说算是每周一次的事。我妈妈以为是每天，其实不是。（笑声）但这些对我来说基本上构成了美好生活的图景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now, these are the questions. I have a few others I answer weekly, like contribution to society. That's sort of a weekly thing for me. My mom thinks it's daily, it's not. (Laughter) But these to me basically are the picture of the good life to me.

</details>

在过去的 18 个月里，我基本上每天都回答这些问题。我在晚上 9 点坐在沙发上，用手机完成，真的只需要 90 秒。但这对我来说是一个彻底的改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so for the past 18 months, I've essentially answered these questions every day. I do it at 9pm on my couch, on my phone, and it literally takes me 90 seconds. But folks, this has been a total game changer for me.

</details>

### 对抗认知扭曲

我的治疗师们告诉我——我同时有好几个治疗师，听说这不是最佳实践，但他们在一件事上达成了一致，那就是我有很多**认知扭曲**（Cognitive Distortions: 导致负面情绪的非理性思维模式）。你们知道这些东西，你们中有些人也有，你们会想，是的，我也有一些。这些东西包括**非黑即白的思维**（all-or-nothing thinking）、**灾难化思维**（catastrophizing）、过度概括。就像当你打开新闻发现天要塌了一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

My therapists have told me -- I have multiple therapists simultaneously, which I hear is not best practice, but here's what they agree on, which is I have a lot of cognitive distortions. So, you know, these things, some of you have them, you're like, yeah, I've got some of those, too. These are things like all-or-nothing thinking, catastrophizing, overgeneralizing. Like when you pop up the news and you discover the sky is falling.

</details>

对我来说，一个月前我在准备这个 TED 演讲，我觉得我已经准备得挺好了。所以我把自己的录音发给了一些导师，我说，你知道，我想听听反馈。你知道，我其实是在寻求那种正面的反馈。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So for me, I was prepping for this TED talk a month ago, and I was already in pretty good shape, I thought. And so I sent a recording of myself to some mentors, and I said, you know, I'd love some feedback. You know, I was asking for, like, positive feedback. (Laughter)

</details>

但其中两个人很快回复了，他们说：“Chris，呃，谢谢。也许我们应该谈谈。”是的。于是我们谈了，他们两个都告诉我——我没开玩笑，他们并没有互相商量过——演讲还可以，但有点太戏剧化了。同时，不知何故又有点平淡。如果你像我一样，这会让我陷入情绪螺旋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then two of them responded pretty quickly, and they said, "Chris, uh, thanks. Maybe we should talk." Yeah. And so we talked, and both of them told me, I kid you not, without consulting with each other, the talk was fine, but it was a little bit dramatic. And at the same time, somehow a little bit flat. Which, if you're like me, that sent me spiraling.

</details>

所以我做了什么，我不骗你，通话结束后我立刻走进办公室的一个黑房间，拿出手机，在日记里写下了我在生活各个维度上的缺陷。是的，作为公众演讲者显然很糟糕，但在工作中呢？不够好。作为丈夫？不够好。作为朋友？很差。告诉过你我很缺乏安全感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So what I did, I kid you not, I went into a dark room in the office right after my calls, and I pulled out my phone and I journaled about all the ways in which I am defective across dimensions of life. So yeah, public speaker obviously bad, but what about at work? Not good enough. Husband? Not good enough. Friend? Bad. Told you I was insecure.

</details>

### 数据揭示真相

看，这就是我的大脑带我去的地方。但追踪表在这方面真的很有帮助。这是五月的一周。想象一下我的追踪表。这是一个特别艰难的周一。很多低分，没几个高分。所以我填完这个，我的第一反应是，天哪，我的生活正在分崩离析。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But see, this is where my brain takes me. But the tracker really helps with this. So here's one week in May. Picture my tracker. And this is a particularly tough Monday. A lot of low scores, not many high scores. So I fill this one out. And my immediate thought is, oh my gosh, my life is falling apart.

</details>

但随后我退后一步，我注意到我的周日还不错。挺好的。我的周六也不错。然后我继续看。果然，Chris，我只是过了糟糕的一天。治疗师是对的。我就像个戏剧社的孩子一样情绪化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then I take a step back, and I notice that my Sunday was fine. Pretty good. My Saturday was good. And then I keep going. And sure enough, Chris, I just had one bad day. And the therapists are right. I have the emotional stability of a theater kid.

</details>

你知道，几个月来，周一总是让我很难受。有人讨厌周一吗？有两个人讨厌周一。好吧，我讨厌周一。这是我在几个月里几个周一的得分，我在各个维度上的得分都很低。我没有好好爱我的妻子。我对她撅嘴，她有时叫我“爱生闷气的人”（pouty pants）。我在工作中表现不佳，感到压力很大，我处理情绪的方式很差，吃得也不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, for months, Mondays would hit me super hard. Anybody hate Mondays? Two people hate Mondays. Well I hate Mondays. And so these are my scores on several Mondays over a course of a few months, I get lowest scores across dimensions. I don't love my wife well. I pout at her, she calls me pouty pants sometimes. I didn't do well at work, I felt stressed, I handled my emotions poorly, I didn't eat well.

</details>

但事情是这样的，我注意到了这个模式。那就是周一通常很糟糕，但这场“周一风暴”总是会过去，通常在周二或周三之前。这改变了我对周一的看法，因为在“艰难的一天”（当你把它投射到永恒中时，就像我经常做的那样）和“糟糕的一天”（当你已经知道故事的结局时）之间，有着根本的区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then here's the thing, I noticed this pattern. Which is the Mondays were typically bad, but this Monday storm always passes, usually by Tuesday or Wednesday, which shifts how I think about Mondays, because there's a fundamental difference between a tough day, when you project it out into eternity, as I often do, and a bad day, when you already know the end of the story.

</details>

### 避免隧道视野与忽视亲密关系

我也会产生隧道视野，尤其是在工作中。我的妻子是个非常注重后勤安排的人，而我不是，所以她会发短信跟我确认后勤事宜。有一次她连续发了 12.5 个小时。我看到了短信，但我并没有真正“看到”短信，我没有回复。她很了解我，所以她发了一个日历邀请到我的工作邮箱。我 30 秒内就回复了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And I also get tunnel vision, especially at work. My wife is a big logistics gal, and I'm not a big logistics guy, so she'll text me at work for logistics. And this one time she did this for 12.5 hours straight. And I saw the text, but I didn't really see see the text, I didn't answer. And so she knows me, and so she sent me this calendar invitation to my work email. And I responded in 30 seconds.

</details>

这不仅仅是一个坏习惯。这真的是我的默认设置，把自己缩减为一个维度。尤其是在工作中。还有人是这样吗？但追踪表在这方面也有帮助。这是工作上很棒的一周。表现极其出色。但在精神层面，有点脱节。然后我看看其他维度，这周开始时我很强劲，但后来我就有点崩溃了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So that's not just this bad habit. It's really my default to reduce myself to one dimension. Especially at work. Anyone else? But the tracker helps with that too. So here's a great week at work. Crushed it. But then spiritually, kind of off. And then I look at other dimensions, and I started out the week strong, but then I kind of fell apart.

</details>

你看，追踪表在视觉上提醒我，美好的生活不仅仅是一个维度。通过每晚做这件事，它迫使我的大脑在各个维度之间进行优化，平衡权衡，并在需要时调整我的关注点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

See, the tracker visually reminds me that the good life is not just one dimension. In doing this every night, it forces my brain to optimize across dimensions, to balance the trade-offs and to adjust my focus when needed.

</details>

你知道，我可能永远不会忘记，当时我坐在北卡罗来纳州山间的小屋里。那是有一天晚上 9 点，我在度假时填写我的追踪表，那天晚上不知为何我突然意识到，关于我是否爱 **Ashley** 的那个问题已经对我闪烁红灯好几个月了。而其他维度基本上是绿色的。我做得还不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, I'll probably never forget, I was sitting in a cabin in mountains of North Carolina. It was 9pm one day, and I was filling out my tracker on vacation, and it struck me that night for some reason that my loving Ashley question had been flashing red at me for months. And the other dimensions were basically green. I was doing fine.

</details>

不知为何，那天晚上，这深深触动了我。Chris，这不是你在婚礼当天对 **Ashley** 许下的承诺。这不是你对她说的话。这就是你想要回顾自己一生时的样子吗？你拥有一个好的职业生涯，但你忽视了那个你声称对你最重要的关系？那不是美好的生活。那是被浪费的生活。那是失败的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And for some reason, that night, it struck me. Chris, this is not the promise you made Ashley on your wedding day. This is not what you said to her. Is this the way you want to look back on your life? That you had a good career, but you neglected the one relationship that you claim is the most important to you? That is not the good life. That is a wasted life. That is a failed life.

</details>

这对我打击很大。所以我做出了一些改变，果然，几个月内情况开始转变。分数在提高，但我妻子注意到了。我经常想，如果我没有这个追踪表，我要多久才能得到这个警钟？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And that hit me super hard. So I made some changes and sure enough, within a few months things started to shift. The scores were improving, but my wife noticed. And I often wonder, if I hadn't had the tracker, how long would it have taken me to get this wake-up call?

</details>

### 开始量化你的人生

好了，说到这里，你们有些人可能对此很感兴趣，有些人可能会想，“这对你来说很好，但我没那么自律”或者“我不喜欢那么多系统。”我不喜欢 **Excel**。我明白，但事情是这样的。我喜欢填写我的追踪表。我不认为这是因为我是个咨询师所以我喜欢 **Excel**。我确实喜欢 **Excel**。但这是因为我感觉到自己正在成为一个更完整的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

OK, so at this point some of you are into this, some of you are like, "This is fine for you, but I'm not that disciplined" or "I don't like that much system." I don’t like Excel. So I get that, but here’s the thing. I love filling out my tracker. And I don’t think it’s because I’m a consultant and I like Excel. I do like Excel. But it’s because I feel myself becoming a more full human.

</details>

但我确实是个咨询师。所以我为你们制作了三个版本的追踪表。（笑声）轻量版、中量版、重量版。所以你们可以下载这些，并在今晚真正开始测量你们的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But I am a consultant. So I did build you three versions of my tracker. (Laughter) The light, medium, heavy. So you can download these and actually measure your lives tonight.

</details>

你知道，我有时仍然会在凌晨 3 点醒来，但我现在真的不再恐慌了。我知道我在管理我生活的全貌，因为我在测量它。我邀请你们，加入我。因为你所测量的人生，可能恰恰就是美好的生活。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, I still wake up sometimes at 3am, but now I don't really panic anymore. I know I'm managing the full picture of my life because I'm measuring it. And I’d invite you, join me. Because the life you measure just might be the good life. Thank you.

</details>
