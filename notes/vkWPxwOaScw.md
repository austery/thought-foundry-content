### 节目介绍与嘉宾登场

**Christine**: 喜欢咖啡的人都喜欢手冲，因为理论上你可以有很大的控制权。我认为这是一种吸引那些真正想完善咖啡制作艺术的人的方法，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: People who love coffee love pourover because you have a ton of control in theory. I think that this is the method that attracts people who really really want to perfect the art of coffee making. Right.

</details>

**Rosie**: 是的，你可以非常讲究，但你也可以不那么讲究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Yeah. You can be really fussy about it. You don't have to be.

</details>

**Christine**: 我是**Christine Sirette**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I'm Christine Sirette.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我是**Rosie Garin**。您正在收听《**Wirecutter**秀》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I'm Rosie Garin. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.

</details>

**Rosie**: Christine，今天节目的主角是咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Christine, the star of today's episode is coffee.

</details>

**Christine**: 这是你最喜欢的东西之一，生活中最不可或缺的饮品。在咖啡设备方面，有太多可以探索的了。说真的，我认为一套好的咖啡设备可以在很多方面改善你的生活。我坚信这一点。所以，是的，我非常兴奋。今天我们有一位非常棒的嘉宾。**Margarite Preston**是我们的编辑总监，负责我们所有的厨房用品报道。她测试过很多咖啡设备，对此了解非常多。所以，我们将请她来，她将帮助我们了解你可以对咖啡设备进行哪些有意义的升级，以调制出你早晨的完美咖啡。有点俗气，这样说有点俗气，但这是真的。这非常……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: The one of your favorite things most essential drinks of life. There's just so much to explore when it comes to gear and coffee. And truly, I think a great coffee setup can improve your life in a lot of ways. I am a strong believer of this. So, yeah, I'm pumped. And we have a really great guest today. **Margaret Preston** is our editorial director who covers all of our kitchen coverage. She has tested a lot of coffee gear. She just knows a ton about it. And so, we're going to bring her on and she's going to help walk us through the meaningful upgrades you might make in your coffee setup to dial in your morning brew. So cheesy. That was such a cheesy way of saying that, but it's true. It was very

</details>

**Rosie**: 商业化。我喜欢，我非常喜欢。而且我真的很喜欢**Margarite**。她以前也来过节目，谈论过无酒精饮品和冰淇淋三明治。这周我们还有一些额外内容。我们将在周五发布一期特别节目，内容是关于如何选择你真正喜欢的咖啡豆。那是和**Coffee Project New York**的专家们一起制作的。这是本期节目的绝佳补充，本期我们主要关注设备。所以，这周你可以留意那期特别节目。好的，**Margarite Preston**，广告后回来。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: commercial. I like it. I like it very much. And I really like Margarit. She's been on the show before talking non-alcoholic spirits and ice cream sandwiches. We also have something extra this week. We're going to release a bonus episode on Friday all about how to choose coffee beans you actually like. That's with the experts over at **Coffee Project New York**. It's a really great companion to this episode where we're mostly focusing on gear. So you can look out for that bonus episode this week. Okay. **Margarite Preston** after the break.

</details>

**Rosie**: 欢迎回来。今天我们和**Margarite Preston**讨论咖啡设备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Welcome back. Today we're talking about coffee gear with Margarite Preston.

</details>

**Christine**: **Margarite**，欢迎回到节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Margarite, welcome back to the show.

</details>

**Margarite**: 大家好，谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Hello. Thanks for having me.

</details>

**Christine**: 很高兴你能来。那么，今天我们谈论咖啡。我知道你对咖啡了解很多。如果你想改善家里的咖啡设备，首先应该问自己什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Great to have you. So, today we're talking coffee. I know you know a ton about coffee. If you're trying to improve your coffee setup at home, what are the first things you should ask yourself?

</details>

### 咖啡研磨的重要性

**Margarite**: 咖啡专家或咖啡狂人会问你的第一件事是：你是如何研磨咖啡的？你研磨咖啡了吗？你是买预磨好的咖啡吗？普遍的共识是，**新鲜研磨的咖啡**比预磨好的咖啡味道更好。一旦咖啡被研磨，它很快就会变质，失去风味。如果你自己研磨咖啡，你是怎么研磨的？你用的是那种带刀片的香料研磨机吗？我父母用了好多年那种。那种研磨机会让你的咖啡研磨得非常不均匀，导致冲泡也不均匀。你会得到一些较大的颗粒，因为它们较大，所以萃取的风味较少。然后你会得到一些非常细小的粉末，这些粉末会萃取过多的风味，使咖啡变得浑浊。如果你想要真正好的咖啡，你需要一台好的**磨盘式磨豆机**，它能研磨得非常均匀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: The first thing a coffee expert or a coffee nerd will ask you is how are you grinding your coffee? Are you grinding your coffee? Are you buying pregrown coffee? The consensus is that freshly ground coffee is going to taste better than pregrown coffee. Once it's ground, it goes still very quickly loses that flavor. If you are grinding your coffee, how are you grinding it? Are you using a little spice grinder with some blades in it, which is what my parents used for many years, that is going to grind your coffee really unevenly, which is going to cause it to brew unevenly. You're going to get some bigger pieces that you extract less flavor from them because they're bigger. And then you're going to get some really dusty, fine pieces where you get too much flavor. It's going to make it kind of muddy. What you want if you want really good coffee is a good **burr grinder** which is gonna grind really evenly.

</details>

**Christine**: 你能解释一下**磨盘式磨豆机**到底是什么吗？它和那种带刀片的小型香料研磨机有什么区别？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: And can you explain what exactly a burr grinder is? What's the difference between that and the sort of little spice grinder that just has the blades that were around?

</details>

**Margarite**: 当然。这有点难，因为这是音频媒介，但**磨盘式磨豆机**基本上就是有磨盘。通常它们一个是锥形的，另一个是锥形可以嵌入的，它们都有脊状结构。所以锥形部分会旋转，把咖啡豆拉到锥形和嵌入锥形的磨盘之间的缝隙里，然后把咖啡豆磨碎。你可以调整两个部件，也就是两个磨盘之间的空间大小，这会改变咖啡研磨的粗细程度。但它的研磨方式是挤压，而不是随机地切碎成不同大小的碎片。它是挤压成相对特定的大小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Sure. So this is hard because this is an audio medium, but a burr grinder is basically you have these burrs. Often they're kind of one is kind of cone shaped and one is kind of like the cone fits into it and they're they're riged. So the cone kind of spins around, pulls the beans down into the kind of gap between the cone and the burr that fits the cone and kind of crushes the beans. And you can adjust it so there's more or less space between the two pieces, the two burrs, and that changes how finely or coarsely your coffee is ground. But the way it's crushing, it's not kind of like randomly chopping into differentiz pieces. It's crushing into a relatively specific size.

</details>

**Christine**: 好的。那么除了研磨方式，当人们考虑升级时，还应该考虑或问自己哪些其他问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Right. Okay. And so beyond how you're grinding it, what are some other things people should think about or ask themselves when they're thinking about upgrading?

</details>

**Margarite**: 我的意思是，你可以考虑你购买的咖啡豆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I mean, you could just think about the coffee that you're buying,

</details>

**Christine**: 更新鲜的咖啡豆味道会更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: fresher beans are going to taste better.

</details>

**Margarite**: 所以，如果你从杂货店购买的咖啡豆，它们可能已经在货架上放了一段时间，可能已经不新鲜了。而且咖啡豆的品质也不同。便宜的杂货店烘焙咖啡，咖啡豆的品质可能不好，烘焙的品质也可能不好，这会给你带来很多异味，从焦味（过度烘焙）到咖啡专家会用各种词语来形容这种味道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: So, if you're buying beans from a grocery store that are kind of like have been sitting on a grocery store shelf, they might have been sitting there for a while. They might be kind of stale. And there's different qualities of beans, too. A cheap grocery store roast, the quality of the beans might not be great. the quality of the roast might not be great and that can give you kind of a lot of off flavors which are anything from like kind of scorched, you know, it's overroasted to coffee experts will have all kinds of like words to to describe the hot flavor.

</details>

**Christine**: 太专业了，太深入了。在我们谈论大量设备之前，我有一个问题：如果你想冲泡一杯好咖啡，有多少取决于咖啡豆的品质，又有多少取决于设备的品质？比如，如果你有很好的咖啡豆，研磨得很好，但你用的是便宜的咖啡机，你能得到一杯不错的咖啡吗？这很难说，因为它确实两者兼顾。当然，这也取决于你的口味和偏好。比如，你可能有一种你非常喜欢的咖啡，也许它不是特别花哨的咖啡，但总的来说，我认为如果你有不好或低品质的咖啡豆，但你用一台非常好的咖啡机来冲泡，最终结果在品质上可能会比你在便宜咖啡机中冲泡的要好。如果你是一个真正的专家品尝师，你可能会品尝出更广泛的风味，或者更……如果你用一台非常好的磨豆机研磨，你会得到更均匀的风味，但咖啡本身的味道可能仍然不是很好。我买了我们的磨盘式磨豆机，是**Baratza**。是这么叫吗？**Baratza**。我试用了一下。我从工作那里拿了一个，在购买之前试用了一下，我实际上根本不喜欢用它制作的咖啡。我当时以为，也许我就是不喜欢用磨盘式磨豆机研磨的咖啡。但我认为那是因为我当时用的是一台便宜的咖啡机。所以当时我用的是磨盘式磨豆机和一些不错的咖啡豆，但并不喜欢它制作出的咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Super nerdy, super super deep. One question before we we're going to talk a ton about gear, but I do wonder how when you want to make a good cup of coffee, how much of it depends on the quality of the beans and how much of it depends on the quality of the gear? Like if you have great beans that are ground in a nice way and you have a cheap coffee maker, are you going to get a decent cup of coffee? So, it's hard because it really is both. And of course, it depends on your taste, too, and your preference. Like you might have a coffee that you really like and maybe it's not a super fancy coffee, but like on balance, I think if you have bad or lowquality beans and you brew them in a really nice brewer, the end result like might be sort of like qualitatively better than what you would brew in a cheap brewer. Like you might if you were real a real sort of expert taster, you might taste it and like get a wider range of flavors or get a more, you know, and if you grind them on a really nice grinder, you would get sort of like a more even flavor, but the flavor itself might still not be very good. I bought our burger grinder. It's the **Baratza**. Is that what it's called? **Baratza**. I tried it out. I had one from work and I tried it out before I bought it and I actually did not like the coffee that I made with it at all. And I assumed that, you know, maybe I just don't like coffee that's ground in a burr grinder. But I think it was because I had a cheap coffee maker at that time. So I was using a bur grinder with some decent beans, but did not like the coffee it produced.

</details>

**Rosie**: 你不喜欢什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: What didn't you like?

</details>

**Christine**: 有点像……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: It was kind of like

</details>

**Rosie**: 太酸了之类的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: too sour or something.

</details>

**Christine**: 也许我当时还没有进化。我还没有准备好接受那种品质，那种从咖啡豆中萃取出的味道。但我确实认为，如果你要改用**磨盘式磨豆机**，你需要记住这一点。你可能想尝试不同的咖啡豆，或者，你知道，你用什么来冲泡它？是的，当然。而且，你知道，公平地说，有些非常花哨的咖啡并不适合所有人。对有些人来说它们太酸了。它们非常酸，带有花香或果香等等，缺乏很多人喜欢的那种巧克力般的浓郁底蕴。而且，你知道，它们可以非常美妙可爱，但如果那不是你所期望的，或者那不是你想要的，那么不喜欢也没关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: And maybe I just had not evolved yet. I was not ready for that quality of, you know, extracting that level of taste from my beans. But I do think that's something to keep in mind if you are going to make the switch to a bur grinder. you might want to like play around with the beans or you know what are you brewing it in? Yeah, definitely. And you know like to be fair some of these really fancy coffees are not for everyone. They are too sour for people. They're very like acidic and floral or fruity or whatever and they lack the kind of like chocolatey rich undertones that I think a lot of people like from coffee. And you know they can be really beautiful and lovely but like if that's not what you're expecting or that's not what you want like it's fine if that's not what you want.

</details>

### 咖啡冲泡方法与设备

**Christine**: 好的，现在我们暂时不谈意式浓缩咖啡机，只讨论设备。每天早上冲泡一杯真正好喝、稳定的咖啡，最好的选择是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Okay, so putting espresso machines aside for now as we talk about gear, what are the best options to make a really good consistent cup of coffee every morning?

</details>

**Margarite**: 有几种方法可以选择。决策树完全取决于你想花多少钱，以及你想投入多少精力来让你的咖啡味道更好。最基本、最简单的途径是**咖啡机**，一台好的**滴漏咖啡机**。好的咖啡机，那些能冲泡出真正精致美味咖啡的，非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: There's a few ways you can go. And the sort of decision tree is all about how much you want to spend and how much effort you want to put into making your coffee taste good. The baseline, the kind of like easiest route is a coffee brewer, a nice drip coffee brewer. The good ones, the ones that will brew a really kind of like nuanced, delicious pot of coffee are very expensive.

</details>

**Christine**: 我们说的是多贵？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: How expensive are we talking?

</details>

**Margarite**: 我想在我们的指南中，我们的首选产品价格都超过200美元。嗯，**Technivorm Mocha Master**，它是我们的首选之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I think in our guide now, our top picks are over $200. Um, the **Technivorm Mocha Master**, which is one of our top picks.

</details>

**Rosie**: 那是我的最爱。我们都知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: That's my favorite. We all know

</details>

**Christine**: 我从我们推荐的最便宜的咖啡机换到了**Mocha Master**，因为我受够了便宜咖啡机冲出来的咖啡，它真的很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I went from like the cheapest coffee maker we recommended to the mocha master because I was like disgusted by the coffee from the cheap one and it's very nice.

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的，它很棒。但它确实在400美元的价位。是的。所以，有这个。然后，你知道，你在考虑它的成本。另外，如果你真的很认真，想要一台**磨豆机**，那么**磨豆机**也很贵。有几种方法可以节省一点研磨部分的钱，你可以买一台**手动磨豆机**，它就是一个小手摇装置。我们现在推荐的那款非常好。但对于它来说，仍然有点贵。它大约在100美元左右，但插电式的要几百美元。你也可以去一家好的咖啡店，请他们帮你研磨咖啡豆。你从那里买的咖啡豆，不要粗鲁，不要带着你的星巴克咖啡豆去。

<details>
<summary>Margarite**: Yeah, it's great. But it is in the $400 expensive. Yeah. So, there's that. And then, you know, you're you're thinking about the cost of that. Plus, if you're being really serious about it and you want a coffee grinder, like coffee grinders are also expensive. There's a couple ways you can save a little money in the kind of grinding portion of it, which is you could get a manual coffee grinder, which is just a little hand crank thing. The one of those we recommend now is very good. It's still like expensive for I think what it is. It's like in the $100 range, but the plug-in ones are like a couple hundred. You could also go to a good coffee shop and ask them to grind the beans for you. beans you've bought from that beans you've bought store from that don't be rude don't show up with your Starbucks</summary>

</details>

**Rosie**: 别去Acme。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: stop at the acme head in

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的，区别在于，你去杂货店，那里会有大型的**咖啡研磨机**，你可以买一袋咖啡豆在那里研磨。那些机器不是最好的，因为它们的清洁频率值得怀疑，即使前一天清理过，人们也会用那些**咖啡研磨机**研磨各种东西，包括咖啡风味的……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: yeah and the difference there is you'll go into a grocery store and there'll be those big coffee grinder machines where you can kind of buy your bag and grind it there those are not the greatest because how often they get cleaned is questionable at best even if they've cleaned it the day before people are grinding all kinds of things on those coffee grinders including coffee flavored

</details>

**Christine**: 榛子味的。是的，你不想让那些东西混进你的咖啡里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: hazelnut flavored. Yeah, you don't want to get that in your coffee.

</details>

**Margarite**: 我的意思是，在加油站我倒不介意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I mean, I don't mind it at a at a gas station, but

</details>

**Christine**: 当然。是的，那是在特定时间和地点。而且，你知道，另一件事是，想想你喝咖啡的速度。是的，最好在冲泡前新鲜研磨。但实际上，如果你有一小袋咖啡，并且在一周内喝完，那么一次性全部研磨好也没关系。如果你从咖啡店购买咖啡豆，他们通常会帮你研磨。他们通常会问你用什么冲泡方式。如果他们不问，你可以告诉他们。咖啡店的咖啡师通常会根据你的冲泡方式，知道咖啡应该研磨得多细或多粗，他们可以为你量身定制。如果你考虑购买**磨豆机**，还需要记住的另一件事是，你需要维护**磨盘式磨豆机**。你实际上必须清洁它并磨锐磨盘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: sure. Yeah, that's a time and a place. And you know, the other thing is like think about how quickly you're drinking your coffee. Like, yes, it is best to grind it fresh right before you brew it. But in practice, if you have a small bag of coffee and you're going through it in a few days a week, it's fine to grind it all at once. And a coffee shop will usually do it for you if you buy the beans from them. And usually they'll ask, you can tell them if they don't ask, but they'll ask you what you're brewing on. And the baristas at a coffee shop like that will usually know based on what you're brewing on how fine or coarse to grind the coffee, and they can really tailor it for you. The other thing to keep in mind if people are thinking about getting a grinder is that you need to maintain a burr grinder. You actually have to clean it and sharpen those burrs.

</details>

**Rosie**: 而且这不需要经常做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: And that's not something you need to do very often.

</details>

**Margarite**: 清洁是需要定期做的。嗯，油脂会积聚在磨盘上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: The cleaning is something you need to do regularly. Um, oils will build up on the burrs.

</details>

**Christine**: 灰尘和细小颗粒也会积聚在上面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Dust and fine particles will build up on them.

</details>

**Margarite**: 如果你不清洁它，你会发现它可能会开始运行得很慢。研磨任何东西可能需要很长时间。所以，是的，你确实需要清洁它，但你也要清洁咖啡机，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: What you'll notice if you don't clean it is that it might start running really slowly. It might take forever to grind anything. So, yeah, you do need to clean it, but you need to clean a coffee maker, too,

</details>

**Christine**: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: right?

</details>

### 精准称量咖啡豆

**Margarite**: 我会称量我的咖啡粉。嗯，我称量我的咖啡豆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I weigh my grounds. Um, I weigh my beans.

</details>

**Christine**: 你推荐这样做吗？还是说这太讲究了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Do you recommend doing that or is that like overly fussy?

</details>

**Margarite**: 不，我一点也不认为这太讲究了。我认为这是确保你每次都能得到你想要的咖啡的好方法。我发现如果不知道要用多少咖啡，我就会手足无措。我想有些人就是随便倒进去，然后觉得无所谓。当你那样做的时候，最终你会得到要么太浓要么太淡的咖啡。你也可能会遇到咖啡粉放太多，然后整个溢出来，咖啡粉弄得到处都是的情况。称量咖啡豆可能看起来有点讲究，但坦白说，作为一个曾经是面包师的人，我觉得称量所有东西对烹饪都很好。它只是让一切更精确、更一致，而且并不难。你只需要一个小秤。它们不是很贵。市面上有一些专门用于咖啡的秤，可以精确到十分之一克。那些是为咖啡狂热者准备的。对于大多数人来说，我们厨房秤推荐中的任何一款，比如**Escali**，它是一个20到25美元的秤。它能精确到克。它会给你很好的结果。你只需查找你需要用于任何冲泡方法的咖啡与水的比例，然后它就会立即让事情变得好很多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: No, I don't think it's overly fussy at all. I think it's a great way to sort of make sure you're getting the coffee that you want every time. I find myself lost without knowing how much coffee do you I think some people just kind of dump it in and I was like whatever. You'll end up either with coffee that's way too strong or way too weak when you do that. You might also end up in a situation where you put too many grounds in and then the whole thing overflows and you've got coffee grounds all in your pot and everything. Weighing I think seems a little fussy, but like frankly like as someone who was formerly a baker, I'm like weighing everything is good for cooking. Like just makes everything more precise, more consistent and it's not that hard. You just get a little scale. They're not very expensive. There are sort of like coffee specific scales out there that are very precise down to the like, you know, tenth of a gram. Those are for the coffee fanatics. For most people, any one of our kitchen scale picks, like the **Escali**, it's like a 20 $25 scale. It'll weigh to the gram. It'll give you good results. You can just look up the ratio of how much coffee to water you need to use for whatever brewing method and like it'll just immediately make things so much better.

</details>

### 手冲咖啡的魅力

**Christine**: 你有滴漏咖啡机。你可以选择这条路线。你还会推荐人们考虑哪些其他选择？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: You've got your drip coffee maker. You could go that route. What are the other options that you'd recommend people think about?

</details>

**Margarite**: 所以，**手冲**是另一种非常简单的，你知道，**手冲滤杯**。价格范围很广，但你可以花不多的钱买到一个。显然，它非常紧凑，非常模拟化，它只是一个放在杯子顶部的锥形小装置。喜欢咖啡的人喜欢**手冲**，因为理论上你可以有很大的控制权。除了控制咖啡豆研磨的细度以及咖啡豆与水的比例，你还可以非常精确地控制水的温度，这会影响冲泡效果，因为你是在水壶里烧水。你还可以控制将水倒在咖啡豆上的速度以及浸润的模式。所以，你要确保水均匀地浸润咖啡豆。你可以慢一点或快一点，得到不同的结果。我们会说这是最……它给你最大的精确度。它需要最多的注意力。这是制作咖啡最需要维护的方式，也许除了意式浓缩咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: So, **pourover** is the other sort of like really simple, you know, pourover drippers. There's a wide range of price, but you can get one for not that much. Obviously, it's very compact, very analog, like it's just a little cone that you put on top of your cup. And people who love coffee love pourover because you have a ton of control in theory. In addition to controlling like how fine you're grinding the beans and how the ratio of the beans to the water, you can also very precisely control the temperature of the water, which is something that can affect how it brews because you're boiling it in a kettle. You can also control the rate at which you're pouring the water over the beans and the sort of pattern of saturation. So, you're making sure you're saturating them evenly with water. You can do it slower or faster and get different results. Would we say this is the most It gives you the most precision. It requires the most attention. It is the highest maintenance way of making coffee besides espresso maybe.

</details>

**Christine**: 除了意式浓缩咖啡也许。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: besides espresso maybe.

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的。但需要注意的是，你不需要做所有这些。你不需要证明你没有把一大堆水倒在水上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yes. With the caveat that like you don't have to do all that. You don't have to prove that you don't dump a bunch of water on water.

</details>

**Christine**: 我就是那样做的。我也做过同样的事情。但我认为这种方法吸引了那些真正想完善咖啡制作艺术的人。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I do that. I've done the same thing. But I think that this is the method that attracts people who really really want to perfect the art of coffee making. Right.

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的。你可以非常讲究。你也可以不那么讲究。对于我们推荐的一些**手冲滤杯**，比如我们的首选**Kita Wave**，即使你不那么讲究，也能得到不错的效果，对吧？而且**Kita Wave**有各种尺寸可供选择。所以你可以买一个只冲泡一杯咖啡的。你也可以买一个大一点的，也许可以冲泡两杯。但如果有人想为更多人或一次冲泡更多杯咖啡，你会怎么做呢？你会选择像**Chemex**这样的吗？人们可能对这种漂亮的玻璃烧瓶很熟悉，它上面有一个**手冲**装置，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yeah. You can be really fussy about it. You don't have to be. And with some of the poreover drippers that we recommend, like our top pick, the **Kita Wave**, you can get good results without being quite so fussy, right? And the **Kita Wave**, you can buy various sizes. So, you could buy one just to make one cup of coffee. You could buy a bigger one that could maybe make a couple. But if somebody is, say, wanting to make pourover for more people or more, you know, cups at a time, where would you go then? Would you do something like the **Chemex**, which people might be familiar with this like glass beautiful ramkin that there's a pourover setup that fits on the top, right?

</details>

**Christine**: 是的。它有点像一个沙漏形状的咖啡壶。沙漏的顶部是你的**手冲滤杯**，底部是收集咖啡的地方。你可以用它制作比大多数**手冲滤杯**更多的咖啡。实际上，最多你只能冲泡一杯。顺便说一句，这里有一个关于咖啡的有趣之处，咖啡行业有一个有点模糊的标准，一杯咖啡被定义为4到5盎司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yeah. It's kind of like an hourglass shaped car thing. And so the top of the hourglass is your pourover dripper and the bottom is what catches all the coffee. And you can make more coffee in that than most pourover drippers. Like realistically at most you're going to make a cup. As a side note, a funny thing about coffee here is that there is a sort of like slightly squishy standard in the coffee industry where a cup is defined as four to 5 oz.

</details>

**Rosie**: 那不是量杯的大小。那不是马克杯的大小。量杯是。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: That is not the size of a measuring cup. It is not the size of a mug measuring cup is. Yeah.

</details>

**Christine**: 就像我正在和女士们一起喝咖啡的小杯子。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: It is like I'm having coffee with the ladies little cup. Yeah.

</details>

**Rosie**: 所以，如果你买一个“一杯”的**手冲滤杯**，它实际上可能只冲泡半个马克杯的量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: So, if you're buying a pore dripper that's like a one cup dripper, it's actually probably making like half a mug.

</details>

**Margarite**: 嗯，我想我们推荐更大尺寸的**Kita**，因为它能冲泡出更接近一个完整马克杯的量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Um, and I think we recommend the bigger size of the Kita because it'll make more like a full mug.

</details>

### 摩卡壶与法压壶

**Christine**: 那么**摩卡壶**呢？它适合什么？适合谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: How about the mocha pot? What is that good for? Who is that good for?

</details>

**Margarite**: 所以，**摩卡壶**，它非常意大利。经典的品牌是**Bialetti**。是的。我们推荐的就是这款。它是一个小小的，传统上是铝制的，也有点像沙漏形状的小水壶。你在炉灶上使用它。它应该能制作出一种类似意式浓缩咖啡的咖啡。所以同样是一种非常小份的浓缩咖啡。你把研磨得相当细的咖啡粉装入顶部。底部装满水。你在炉灶上加热它，随着加热，水会射入咖啡粉中，然后渗透回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: So, the mocha pot is it's very Italian. The classic is the **Bialetti**. Yeah. Which is the one that we recommend. It's this little traditionally like aluminum also kind of hourglass shaped small kettle. You use it on the stove top. It is supposed to make a sort of espresso like coffee. So again a very small concentrated dose of coffee. You pack fairly finely ground coffee into the top. You fill the bottom with water. You heat it on the stove and as it heats the water shoots up into the coffee and then percolates back down.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我总觉得它们很浪漫。我丈夫喜欢用他的**摩卡壶**。我想是因为他住在德国，他在那里用过它，而且对我来说，它的味道总是比滴漏咖啡机或手冲咖啡更浑浊一些。它仍然很好喝，但对我来说，它的味道确实比其他方法冲泡出来的更浓郁、更醇厚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I always feel like they're very romantic. My husband loves using his mocha pot. I think because he lived in Germany, it's something he used there and it always tastes a little like muddier to me than what you get from a drip coffee maker or a pourover. It's still good, but it it definitely is like a thicker toastier flavor to me than what you get in other methods.

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的。那是因为，你知道，如果你想想，比如**手冲**，咖啡会研磨得粗一些。所以你不会有那种细小的、浑浊的粉末进入咖啡中。如果你在做**手冲**，你还会通过滤纸过滤咖啡。如果你用滴漏咖啡机，你也是通过滤纸。而**摩卡壶**，它只是一个穿孔的小圆盘，咖啡粉就放在里面。所以那些细小的粉末，他们称之为“细粉”，有更多的空间通过。而且你一开始就研磨得更细。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yeah. And that's because, you know, if you think about it like with a pourover, a the coffee is going to be ground a little bit coarser. So you don't have that kind of like dusty, muddy stuff that gets into the brew. You're also filtering your coffee through a paper filter. If you're making pourover, you're dripping a brewer. The mocha pot, it's just like a perforated little disc that the the coffee sits in. So there's more space for the those little fines is what they call them, the dusty particles to kind of get through. and you're grinding it finer in the first place.

</details>

**Christine**: **摩卡壶**曾经是我每天的祈祷时刻，我当时想，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: The mocha pot used to be like my moment of prayer every day where I was like,

</details>

**Rosie**: 我能理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I can see that.

</details>

**Christine**: 我当时想，如果我今天剩下的时间没有任何安静的时刻，我至少会有制作咖啡的这些时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I was like, if I don't have any moments of quiet in the rest of this day, I will have the moments I am making my coffee.

</details>

**Rosie**: 是的，它真的很小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Yeah, it was really little.

</details>

### 升级咖啡设备的建议

**Rosie**: 那么，如果你想升级家里的咖啡体验，首先考虑你的**磨豆机**。如果你想尝试那些**磨盘式磨豆机**，请准备好进行一些投资。你也可以考虑称量咖啡豆，以获得恰到好处的比例。至于冲泡，升级的主要选择有几种，可能是咖啡机本身，或者**手冲**设备。好的，我们休息一下，但回来后，我们将更深入地探讨这些不同的冲泡方法可能最适合谁，我们还将讨论**冷萃咖啡**。我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: So, if you're looking for an upgrade to your at home coffee experience, consider looking at your grinder first. And if you want to try those berg grinders, be ready for a little bit of an investment. You could also think about weighing your beans to get that ratio just right. And for brewing, few main options for upgrades, maybe the coffee machine itself or a pourover setup. Okay, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, we're going to go deeper on who these different brewing methods might be best for, and we'll talk cold brew. We'll be right back.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我们回来了，和**Wirecutter**的编辑总监**Margarite Preston**在一起。到目前为止，在这次对话中，我们讨论了一些你可以投资的设备，以提升你的咖啡水平，但有很多选择。所以，现在我们将讨论如何决定哪种咖啡制作方法可能适合你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: We are back with Wire Cutters editorial director Margarite Preston. So far in this conversation, we've talked about a few of the pieces of gear you can invest in to level up your coffee game, but there are a lot of options. So, now we're going to talk about how to decide which method of making coffee might be right for you.

### 滴漏咖啡机：便捷与大容量

**Christine**: 让我们先关注**滴漏咖啡机**。它适合谁？谁应该购买**滴漏咖啡机**，为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Let's focus on the the drip coffee makers first. Who is this for? Who should be getting a drip coffee maker and why?

</details>

**Margarite**: **滴漏咖啡机**适合很多人。也许只是因为你早上想冲泡很多咖啡。你住在一个多人的家庭里。即使是两个人，你也很容易喝完一壶**滴漏咖啡**。它也很简单方便，不像大多数其他方法。你确实需要等待咖啡机冲泡，理论上你需要设置它。理论上你可以在前一晚设置好，我丈夫每晚都这样做，这就像一个“你爱我，谢谢你”的时刻，早上我只需按一下按钮。但是的，我的意思是，我们从**手冲**设备换成了**滴漏咖啡机**，因为我的孩子们开始喝……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: The drip coffee maker is for lots of people. Maybe it's just because you want to make a lot of coffee in the morning. You live in a multi-person household. even like frankly a twoerson household you might easily go through a pot of drip coffee. It's also just easy and convenient unlike the most of those other methods. You do have to wait for the coffee brewer to brew and in theory you have to set it up. In theory you could set it up the night before which is my my husband does that every night and it's like a moment of like you love me thank you very much and I can just push the button in the morning you know. But yeah, I mean we switched to a drip coffee maker from a pourover setup because my kids started drinking

</details>

**Rosie**: 咖啡馆的咖啡。我们说清楚点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: the cafe coffee. Let's just be cleared.

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的，我的意思是，那是因为我们冲泡了更多的咖啡，我们早上只需要放手不管，专注于其他事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yeah, I mean it was because we were making a lot more coffee and we just needed to be kind of hands off and focus on other stuff in the morning.

</details>

**Christine**: 是的，完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yeah, totally.

</details>

**Margarite**: 我要说的是，咖啡机的一个缺点是它会占用你台面很大的空间。所以，如果你厨房很小，或者你真的很讨厌视觉上的杂乱，这可能会让你不想在厨房里放这种东西。但我有一个小厨房，我优先考虑把咖啡机放在台面上。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I will say the downside of a coffee machine is that it takes up a lot of space on your countertop. So, if you are somebody with a kitchen that is just a tiny kitchen or you really hate visual clutter, it could drive you to not want to have this type of thing in your kitchen, but I have a small kitchen and I I prioritize having the coffee maker out on the on the counter. Totally.

</details>

**Christine**: 对于**滴漏咖啡机**，好的和普通的有什么区别？为什么要多花一点钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: With a drip machine, what is going to distinguish a good one from a mediocre one and why would you want to spend a little bit more?

</details>

**Margarite**: 好的咖啡机在控制所有那些你希望在**手冲**时控制的因素方面做得更好。比如水的温度，水倒在咖啡上并流过的速度，以及水倒在咖啡上的均匀程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: The good ones are better at sort of controlling all those factors that you would want to control if you were making a pourover. So the temperature of the water, the rate at which the water is kind of being poured over the coffee and flowing through it, the evenness of how it's being poured over the coffee,

</details>

**Christine**: 所有影响风味的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: all the things that impact flavor.

</details>

**Margarite**: 完全正确。是的。我们关注的一点，尽管它并非万能，就是有些机器获得了**Specialty Coffee Association**（**精品咖啡协会**）认证。它们会经过一个大型测试过程，以确保水温在首选范围内，确保在一定时间内浸润咖啡粉，确保在一定时间内完成冲泡。你知道，如果它们冲泡时间过长，除了烦人之外，可能还会过度萃取。需要注意的是，公司确实需要付费才能获得该认证。这是一个合法的认证。它是一个非常有信誉的组织，他们进行真实的测试，但仅仅因为一台咖啡机没有该认证，并不一定意味着它不具备这些功能。嗯，一些便宜的咖啡机，你事后打开它，如果你看咖啡粉，它们要么中间有一个大坑，就像所有的水都直接从中心流下去了。嗯，或者它们的边缘可能有点干，这取决于……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Exactly. Yeah. One thing that we look for, although it's not the be all end all, like there are certain machines that are **Specialty Coffee Association** certified, they go through this big testing process to make sure that they're within the preferred temperature range for water to make sure they're saturating the grounds within a certain time span to make sure they're brewing within a certain time span. You know, if they take too long to brew, they're probably over brewing in addition to just being annoying. You know, the caveat with that is that companies do pay to get that certification. It's a legit certification. Like it is a very reputable organization and they do real testing, but just because a coffee maker doesn't have that certification doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't have those features. Um, some of the cheaper coffee makers, it's you'll open it up afterwards and you'll see if you look at the grounds, they'll either look like kind of a big pit in the middle, like all the water is just gone straight down the center. Um or they might even be a little dry around the edges like depending on

</details>

**Christine**: 那么咖啡壶呢？我的**Mocha Master**有一个**保温壶**，所以咖啡直接流入其中。下面没有加热装置。它只是在壶内保持温暖，而其他咖啡机则有一个放在加热装置上的玻璃壶。你对这两种方法有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: What about the carffe? Um my mocha master has a thermal carff so the coffee just goes into it. There's no heating device underneath of it. Um and it just stays warm inside the craft versus other coffee makers they have like a glass craft that is sitting on something that's heated. What's your thought on those two methods?

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的。所以，从历史上看，我们**Wirecutter**一直偏爱并只推荐**保温壶**。这有几个原因。一个就是耐用性。那些玻璃壶可能会破裂。通常，你知道，你可以更换它们。你应该能够更换，但这是一件令人烦恼且需要花钱的事情。更重要的是，如果一个好的**保温壶**，它能让你的咖啡保温几个小时，最长可达四个小时，但它不会像加热板那样持续加热。如果你的咖啡放在加热板上，你就会得到那种加油站的效果，咖啡在那里放了很长时间，开始焦化。它真的会改变咖啡的风味。我们目前没有完全否定玻璃壶。我们确实推荐带有玻璃壶的**Mocha Master**。我们发现它的温度控制实际上相当稳定和良好，而且不会焦化咖啡。而且这也是一个使用场景的问题，你可以考虑一下，**保温壶**更难清洗。你不能把它放进洗碗机。你必须手洗，否则你会破坏保温密封。玻璃壶你可以放进洗碗机。如果你冲泡完一整壶咖啡后立即喝完，那也没关系。它不会焦化。不用担心。显然，我们想要耐用性。我们推荐的更昂贵的机器至少有两年保修期。**Mocha Master**有五年保修期。你花了很多钱购买它们，并且经常使用它们。所以它们应该能够经久耐用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yeah. So, historically we at Wire Cutter have preferred and recommended only thermal crafts. That's for a couple reasons. One is just kind of the durability factor. Like those glass crafts can break. And usually, you know, you can replace them. You should be able to, but it's an annoying thing to have to drop money on. The bigger thing is that a thermal car, if it's good, will keep your coffee hot for several hours, up to four hours, but it won't continue to heat it up the way a hot plate will. If your coffee is sitting on a hot plate, you're going to get that kind of gas station effect where the coffee has been sitting there for a long time and it starts to scorch. It really changes the flavor of the coffee. We don't fully dismiss glass crafts at this point. We do recommend the mocha master that has the glass pot. We found that the temperature control is actually pretty regulated and good and it doesn't scorch the coffee. And it's also kind of a use case thing that you can think about where the thermal craft is harder to clean. You can't do it in the dishwasher. you have to do it by hand otherwise you'll kind of break the thermal seal. Glass one you can throw in the dishwasher. If you are drinking your whole pot immediately like it doesn't matter. It's not going to scorch. Like don't worry about it. Like obviously we want durability. Like the more expensive machines we recommend come with at least a 2-year warranty. The Mocha Master comes with a 5year warranty. You're spending a lot of money on them and using them a lot. So they should be able to like hold up.

### 手冲咖啡：控制与乐趣

**Rosie**: **手冲**适合谁？你稍微谈到了控制的概念，也许你可以选择一个更小的设备，而滴漏咖啡机你很可能会得到几杯咖啡。但你对手冲有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Who is pourover good for? you you spoke a little bit about the idea of control that maybe you can get a smaller setup versus with drip you're getting more than likely a handful of cups of of coffee. But what what what's your thought about pourover?

</details>

**Margarite**: 是的。嗯，我认为这有两个方面。它适合那些想要最大控制权的人。如果你喜欢尝试不同的咖啡豆，并尝试调整参数，看看如何让它味道更好，或者如何调整以突出更多的巧克力风味或浆果风味等等。**手冲**真的很有趣。它可以成为一种爱好，你可以摸索如何捕捉你尝试的各种咖啡豆的细微差别，或者只是，你知道，摸索如何每天都冲泡出你想要的那杯咖啡。但它也不必如此。它不必那么讲究。如果你稍微随意一点，仍然可以冲泡出相当不错的咖啡。再说一次，只要你研磨得好，并且称量咖啡豆和水，它就可以冲泡出一杯好咖啡。在这种情况下，它肯定比**滴漏咖啡机**便宜得多。占用空间也少得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Yeah. Well, I think it goes two ways. It is for the person who wants like the maximum control. If you're someone who likes to try out different beans and kind of like experiment with parameters and see kind of like how do I make this taste better or how do I sort of adjust to like bring out more of the chocolate notes or bring out more of the berry notes or whatever. Forever can be really fun. Like it can become kind of a hobby where you're sort of figuring out how to capture the nuance of all these different beans that you're trying or just, you know, figuring out how to get exactly the cup of coffee you want every day. But it also doesn't have to be that. It doesn't have to be that fussy. You can still get a pretty good coffee if you're like a little bit blise about it. Again, as long as you're like grinding it well and measuring your beans and your water, it can just be like make a good cup of coffee. And in that case, then it's like certainly a lot less expensive than a drip brewer. Takes up a ton less space

</details>

**Christine**: 而且它看起来很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: and it looks cool.

</details>

**Margarite**: 而且它看起来很漂亮。是的。而且你可以随身携带。你知道，也许你不想在行李里带一个陶瓷**手冲滤杯**上飞机，但你可以买金属的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: And it looks nice. Yeah. And you can bring it with you. You know, maybe you don't want to bring like a ceramic pourover dripper on a plane in your luggage, but like there are metal ones you can buy that

</details>

**Christine**: 我正在长期测试一个金属**Kita Wave**，我露营时会带着它，因为你可以把它扔进装备里，一切都很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I'm long-term testing with a metal Kita Wave and I take it camping because it's just you can throw it into the gear and it's all good.

</details>

**Rosie**: 所以，这些**手冲**设备有很多不同的形状，你叫它们什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: So, there are a lot of different shapes of these pourover what do you call them? Like

</details>

**Margarite**: 滤杯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: drippers.

</details>

**Rosie**: 滤杯。是的，滤杯。有平底的。有更多锥形的。你认为一个好的**手冲滤杯**应该具备什么特点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Drippers. Yes, the drippers. There's ones that have flat bottom. There's ones that have are more of a cone. M what do you think makes a good pourover?

</details>

**Margarite**: 所以，我们实际上在我们所有的**手冲滤杯**推荐中，总共推荐了各种款式，各种不同的形状。我认为主要有三种形状。一种是锥形，你知道，倒置的锥形，但它有一个平底而不是尖底。一种是只有尖底的倒置锥形。然后还有一种是侧面是圆形的，但它基本上是一个三角棱柱。它有点像**滴漏咖啡机**滤纸的形状，不是锥形的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: So, we actually recommend in total across all of our pourover dripper picks, we recommend kind of all the styles, like all the different shapes. I think there's really kind of like three primary shapes. There's one that's like it's a cone, you know, an inverted cone, but it has a flat bottom instead of a pointed bottom. There's one that's just an inverted cone that has a pointy bottom. And then there's one that's shaped rounded around the sides, but it's basically like a triangular prism. Like it's the shape of a sort of drip brewer coffee filter, which is not conicle.

</details>

**Christine**: 这种的优点是你可以直接在杂货店买到滤纸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: And the advantage to that one is that you can just buy filters at the grocery store.

</details>

**Margarite**: 完全正确。是的。而其他几种都使用专有的滤纸，你需要单独购买，这可能有点麻烦。这是你需要记住的一点。如果你不愿意去亚马逊或专业咖啡店购买滤纸，你可能想买那种形状的，也就是最后一类。是的。这就是我们推荐其中一款的原因。我想在我们的测试中，它制作的咖啡并没有那么精致、丰富和美妙，但它制作出了一杯好咖啡，而且更方便。而且，你知道，你可以花很少的钱买到像**Melitta**那样的**手冲滤杯**。至于另外两种形状。所以，**Kita Wave**是平底的。它之所以是我们的首选，是因为平底能让水在滤杯中停留更长时间。它不会直接通过那个孔漏出去。它有助于水均匀地分布在咖啡豆中，即使你的倒水方式不完美。所以它更稳定。更容易控制。对初学者更友好，而且它能制作出非常美味的咖啡。锥形形状的，比如我们推荐的**Hario V60**，就更高级一些。水会流得很快。你需要更注意倒水的方式。一般的建议是采用螺旋形倒水，它会制作出非常美味的咖啡。而且，你知道，即使你做得不完美，你可能也会对咖啡感到满意，但它掌握起来可能有点棘手。我说得对吗，将水倒在咖啡粉上的方法是你可以通过**手冲**控制味道的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Exactly. Right. And the other ones are all using proprietary, you know, filters that you have to buy separately, which can be kind of a pain. That's something to keep in mind. If you're not willing to go to Amazon or like a specialty coffee shop to buy your filters, you might want to get one that is that shape, that last category. Yes. And that is why we recommend one of those. I think in our testing, the coffee that it produced wasn't quite as, you know, nuanced and wide ranging and kind of beautiful, but it made a good cup of coffee and it much more convenient. And the, you know, you can get a sort of Molita porover dripper like that for really very little money of the other two shapes. So, the **Kita Wave** is one that has a flat bottom. And the reason that's our top pick is that the flat bottom, it holds the water in the dripper a little longer. It's not just like funneling directly through and out that hole. It helps sort of the water distribute evenly through the beans, even if you're not perfect about your pouring. So, it's much more consistent. It's much easier to control. It's a little more beginner friendly, and it makes a really lovely cup of coffee. The conicle shape like the **Hario V60**, which is what we recommend, is just a little more advanced. Like the water will flow through it pretty quickly. You have to pay more attention to how you're pouring. The sort of advice generally is to do like kind of a spiral shape and it'll make a really beautiful cup of coffee. And you know, even if you don't do it perfectly, you'll probably be happy with the coffee, but it can be a little trickier to master. Am I right in saying the method of pouring water over the coffee grounds is one way you can control the taste with pour over.

</details>

**Christine**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yes.

</details>

**Rosie**: 另一种方式是称量咖啡豆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: And another way is measuring the beans.

</details>

**Christine**: 是的。另一种方式是水的温度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yes. And another way is the temperature of the water.

</details>

**Rosie**: 水的温度是第三种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: And the temperature of the water being third.

</details>

**Christine**: 另一种方式是咖啡研磨的粗细。所以对于水温，我们**Wirecutter**推荐你可以精确控制温度的水壶。那么咖啡的正确温度是多少？是212华氏度吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: And another way is the size of the grind of the coffee. So for the temperature of the water, we recommend kettles at wire cutter that you know you can precisely control the temperature. So what is the temperature, the right temperature for coffee? Is it 212?

</details>

**Margarite**: 212华氏度是上限。212华氏度是沸点。通常对于咖啡，你希望它略低于此，我大概会说在200华氏度左右。你不想完全达到沸点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: 212 is at the high end. 212 is boiling. Typically for coffee you want it to be a little under I would say like in the 200 range. Like you don't want to quite go to boiling.

</details>

**Christine**: 好的。很多人使用**鹅颈壶**，对于不熟悉的人来说，它有一个非常细小的壶嘴，看起来非常优雅漂亮。你认为要冲泡出最好的**手冲咖啡**，真的需要一个**鹅颈壶**吗？还是说用普通的茶壶也可以？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Okay. A lot of people use a goose neck kettle which is if for people who aren't familiar it has this like very thin little neck and it's very elegant and pretty looking. Do you think to get the best pourover you really need to have one of those gooseeneck kettles or can you get by just using like a regular tea kettle?

</details>

**Margarite**: 要冲泡出最好的**手冲咖啡**，我认为**鹅颈壶**真的很有帮助。它在控制水流方向和水量方面提供了更多的控制。我认为那些壶嘴更大、更宽的水壶，很难不把水直接倒在咖啡上。**鹅颈壶**也往往更小。它们通常能装一升水，而且很容易操作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: To get the best pourover, I think it's really helpful to have the gooseeneck. It just offers a lot more control both of sort of the direction of the water and also how much water. I think with those kettles that have a bigger kind of wider spout, it's very hard not to just kind of dump the water on the coffee. The gooseeneck kettles also tend to be smaller. They tend to hold like a liter of water and they're pretty easy to manipulate.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我们推荐电动款。我们现在的主要推荐是哪款？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: We recommend uh electric ones. What is the main pick that we have right now?

</details>

**Margarite**: 主要推荐是**Cuisinart鹅颈壶**。我们也喜欢**OXO的鹅颈壶**。我们喜欢它们的原因是它们有一个数字拨盘，可以让你控制温度，而且我们发现它们非常准确。所以，你可以把温度设定为200华氏度，它会一直加热到200华氏度，而且它们还会在这个温度下保持一段时间。所以，如果你走开去做早餐或其他事情，回来时它仍然是200华氏度。如果你有一个炉灶用的水壶，我实际上有一个而且我很喜欢，如果你想控制温度，你需要一个温度计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Main pick is the **Cuisinart gooseeneck kettle**. We also like **OXO's gooseeneck kettle**. The reason we like those is because they just have a digital dial that allows you to control the temperature and we found them to be very accurate. So, you can just set the temperature for 200° and it'll heat it up until it gets to be 200° and they'll also kind of hold it at that temperature for a while. So, if you walk away and make your breakfast or whatever, like you can come back and it'll still be 200°. If you have a stove top kettle, which I actually do and I love, um, and you're wanting to be controlled about the the temperature, you're going to need a thermometer.

</details>

### 法压壶：浓郁风味与便捷

**Margarite**: 我们要讨论的最后一类是**法压壶**。很多人都知道那是什么。我想知道好的和普通的有什么区别。

**Margarite**: The last category we want to cover is French press. So many people know what those are. I want to know what makes a good one versus a mediocre one.

**Christine**: 所以关于**法压壶**，它是一种能冲泡出更浓郁、有些人认为更浑浊的咖啡的冲泡方法。再说一次，那是因为它不使用滤纸。你只有一个小滤网。**法压壶**基本上是一个壶。你把研磨好的咖啡豆浸泡在水中，然后用一个小的压杆将咖啡粉与咖啡液分离。有些人真的很喜欢那种浓郁醇厚的风味。有些人觉得它有点浑浊。所以这是你需要了解**法压壶**的一点。我们推荐的**法压壶**来自一家叫做**Espro**的公司。**Espro**开发了一种特殊的滤网，它能更好地将所有咖啡粉与水分离，并停止冲泡过程。这是关于传统**Bodum法压壶**的另一件事，我们也推荐它作为一款经典、功能良好、优秀的**法压壶**。它只是一个小的滤网盘，将咖啡压到底部，但你的水仍然停留在咖啡粉上方。所以，如果你让它坐在桌子上，它就会在你让它静置的时候继续冲泡一点。**Espro**滤网很难描述。它有点像杯状。我真的无法在不实际展示的情况下更好地描述它是如何工作的，但本质上，当你压下它时，它能更好地将水与咖啡粉分离，从而停止冲泡。所以你能得到一杯更清澈的咖啡。它还有一个更细的滤网，而且是两层滤网。它能更好地过滤掉那些让咖啡味道浑浊的细小咖啡粉。

**Christine**: So the thing about French press is that it's another brewing method that'll make a thicker some think muddier cup of coffee. Again, that's because it's is not using a paper filter. You just have this kind of little mesh. French press is basically a car. You soak the ground beans in the water and then you use this little plunger to kind of separate the grounds from the coffee. Some people really like that rich full flavor. Some people find it kind of muddy. So that's the thing to kind of know about the French press. The French presses that we recommend are from a company called **Espro**. **Espro** has developed this special filter that does a little bit of a better job of separating all of the coffee from the water and kind of stopping the brewing process. That's the other thing about sort of your traditional like **Bodum French press**, which we do also recommend as like a classic very functional good French press. It's just this little mesh disc that plunges the coffee to the bottom, but your your water is just still resting on top of the coffee. So, if you're letting it sit on the table, it's just continuing to brew a little bit as you're letting it rest. The **Espro** filter is hard to describe. It's a little more kind of like cupshaped. I can't really describe like how it works better without like actually showing you, but essentially it does a better job of separating the water from the grounds when you've plunged it so that it stops brewing. So, you get a little bit of a cleaner cup. It also has a finer mesh and it's two layers of mesh. does a little bit of a better job of kind of filtering out those fine grounds that are making it taste muddy.

**Rosie**: 如果有人想尝试新东西，而且他们没有**法压壶**，你会建议他们在什么情况下购买**法压壶**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: If someone is in the market to like try something new and they don't have a French press, in what case would you say, yeah, get a French press?

</details>

**Christine**: 我的意思是，我认为**法压壶**也可以说是模拟冲泡方法中最不讲究的一种。所以，与**手冲**相比，使用**法压壶**，你可以直接把水倒在咖啡粉上。你不需要担心倒水的方式。你只需要担心你用了多少咖啡粉，水的温度以及冲泡时间。而且你可以制作更多的咖啡。**法压壶**有各种尺寸，但你可以买一个能轻松装满大约三个马克杯的。有点像**Chemex**，但没那么讲究。而且它是一个漂亮的小**Bodum**或**Espro**，或者说，老实说，你买的大多数**法压壶**都是一个非常漂亮的小咖啡壶，上面有一个带旋钮的盖子。它们看起来很可爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I mean, I think French press is also arguably the sort of least fussy of the kind of analog brewing methods. So, compared to a pourover, with French press, you can just actually dump the water in on top of the grounds. You don't have to worry about how you're pouring it. You just worry about how much coffee you're using and the temperature of the water and how long you're brewing it for. And you can make more coffee. French presses come in all different sizes, but you can get one that'll easily fill kind of maybe three mugs. Kind of equivalent to a Chemex, but a little bit less fuzzy. And it's a nice looking little a Bodum or an Espro or honestly most French presses that you buy are like a very pretty little carffe with a little knobed you know lid on top. They look cute.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我也有一个金属**法压壶**，我露营时会带着它，那是在露营时为一大群人煮咖啡的好方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I also have a metal French press that I take camping and that's a great way to make coffee for a crowd on a camping trip.

</details>

**Christine**: 我喜欢这种“随时随地喝咖啡”的类别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: I like that there's this category of like coffee on the go.

</details>

### 便携式咖啡与冷萃

**Rosie**: 是的。**Margarite**，我很好奇，如果你有旅行的人，外出冲泡咖啡的最佳方法是什么？你推荐带什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Yeah. I am curious, Margarite, if you've got somebody who's traveling, what are the best methods for brewing on the go? What do you recommend bringing?

</details>

**Margarite**: 好的。嗯，首先，我能感觉到会有一个非常令人震惊的答案。这可能不适用于最讲究的人。现在有非常好的**速溶咖啡**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Okay. Well, first of all, I can sense there's going to be a very shocking answer. This may not apply to the most fussy people. There is very good instant coffee right now.

</details>

**Christine**: **速溶咖啡**正当红。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Instant coffee is having a moment.

</details>

**Margarite**: **速溶咖啡**在我的生活中正当红。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Instant coffee is having a moment in my life.

</details>

**Christine**: 它不像那种国际咖啡粉，对吧？我们说的是高端咖啡公司制作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: It's not like the international coffee like powder, right? We're talking like high-end coffee coffee companies making

</details>

**Margarite**: 现在有一些公司正在制作这种不错的**速溶咖啡**。其中最大的一个叫做**Swift**。**Swift**会与很多高端咖啡烘焙商合作，制作他们咖啡的速溶版本。我们尝试了很多。它们都，你知道，还没有达到新鲜冲泡咖啡的水平，但它们相当不错。而且我认为其中很多，如果你盲测给别人喝，他们会喝下去，并且不知道那是**速溶咖啡**。需要注意的是，它们很贵。每份可能要3美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: there's a handful of companies kind of making the sort of nice instant coffee. Now, the big one is called **Swift** and **Swift** will partner with a lot of sort of high-end coffee roasters to make instant versions of their coffee. We've tried a lot of them. They are all, you know, they're not quite at the level of a fresh brewed cup of coffee, but they are quite good. And I think a lot of them, if you kind of gave it to someone blind, they would drink it and not know that it was instant. The caveat is that they're expensive. Can be like $3 a serving.

</details>

**Rosie**: **Margarite**，我们为什么要为**速溶咖啡**每份支付3美元？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Why are we paying $3 a serving for instant coffee, Margarite?

</details>

**Margarite**: 为什么我们……就像你没有好咖啡，或者你，我不知道，我经常听到的一个使用场景是，也许你在岳父母家，他们不以同样的方式欣赏咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: Why are we like stuck with no good coffee or you're I don't know, a use case I've commonly heard is that maybe you're at your in-laws and they don't appreciate coffee in the same way.

</details>

**Christine**: 你不总是在一个有好的咖啡店的地方旅行。另外，我之所以喜欢上好的**速溶咖啡**，是因为我当时过着忙碌的生活，带着一个小孩，每天早上都要送他去学校。我真的厌倦了用任何设备制作咖啡，只想立即喝到咖啡，而且我没有滴漏咖啡机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: You're not always traveling to a place that has nice coffee shops around. Also, the way that I got into good instant coffee was that I was living a busy life with a small child, trying to get him to school in the morning every morning. Got really sick of doing putting any effort into making coffee with any of the devices that I had and just wanted my coffee immediately and didn't have a drip brewer.

</details>

**Christine**: 不想出门。所以我用了**速溶咖啡**。它很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Didn't want to have to leave the house. So, I used Instant. It was great.

</details>

**Rosie**: 好的，最后一个问题。告诉我关于**冷萃咖啡**。这能让你感到快乐吗？**冷萃咖啡**是怎么回事？它不只是夏天喝的。我知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: All right, final question. Tell me about cold brew. Does this spark joy for you? What's the deal with cold brew? It's not just for summer. I know that.

</details>

**Margarite**: 我是**冷萃咖啡**的忠实拥护者。而且有……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: I am a big cold brew proponent. And there's

</details>

**Rosie**: 那是一个引导性问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: that was a leading question.

</details>

**Margarite**: 你知道，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: You know,

</details>

**Rosie**: 我知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I know.

</details>

**Margarite**: 而且除了它味道好，而且是我夏天唯一想喝的咖啡之外，还有其他原因。但**在家制作冷萃咖啡**的好处是，它真的解决了“哦，我每天早上都得煮咖啡”的问题。你制作一批**冷萃浓缩液**，而且这些我们推荐的冲泡器，**OXO**是首选。还有**Filtron**，我家里用的就是这个。它们制作出非常非常浓缩的咖啡。当你早上制作**冷萃咖啡**时，你需要用水和冰稀释它。所以你会得到一小壶，它可以持续一周，两周，这取决于你喝多少咖啡。我喜欢夏天，因为我不需要考虑制作咖啡。我只需把它倒进杯子里。**冷萃咖啡**另一个很酷的地方是，它非常划算，原因有二。第一，**冷萃**的工作原理是，你把冷水倒在咖啡上，让它静置一段时间。这种方法倾向于萃取较少的苦味。它能制作出更甜、更醇厚的咖啡。但正因为如此，你真的可以使用品质较低的咖啡豆，或者你热饮时不喜欢的那种烘焙咖啡，它实际上会很好喝。所以这是一点。你还可以**二次冷萃**你的咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Margarite**: And there there are reasons beyond just that like it tastes good and it's the only kind of coffee I want to drink in the summer. But the great things about making cold brew at home, a it really solves that problem of like, oh, I have to make coffee every morning. You make a batch of cold brew concentrate and it's concentrate that, you know, these brewers that we recommend. **Oxo** is the top pick. There's also **Filtron**, which is what I use at home. They make this really, really concentrated brew where when you make your cold brew in the morning, you want to dilute it with water and ice. So you'll get like a little carff of it and it'll last you a week, two weeks, depending on how much coffee you're drinking. I love summer because I don't have to think about making my coffee. I just pour it into the cup. The other cool thing about cold brew, it is very cost effective for two reasons. One, the way cold brewing works, you're you're pouring cold water over the coffee, letting it sit for a while. That method tends to extract less of the kind of bitter flavors that you get from coffee. It yields a much kind of like sweeter, mellower flavored coffee. But because of that, you can really use lower quality beans or maybe that a roast that you wouldn't enjoy hot and it'll actually taste pretty good. So that's one thing. You can also double brew your cold brew.

</details>

**Rosie**: 等等，那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Wait, what does that mean?

</details>

**Christine**: 所以，我做的是，你制作你的咖啡，按照他们推荐的水与咖啡的比例，让它静置12小时或 whatever，然后你把它滤掉，然后你再重新装满。第二次最好少放一点水，但你用同样的咖啡豆再重复整个过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: So, what I do, you make your brew, you do the the ratio of water to coffee that they recommend, you let it sit for 12 hours or whatever it is, you drain it, then you refill it. And it's better to do a little bit less water the second time around, but you just do the whole process over again with the same beans.

</details>

**Rosie**: 第二次冲泡的咖啡和第一次一样浓吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Is the second brew just as strong as the first one?

</details>

**Christine**: 不。所以，它会稍微淡一些。我们喜欢做的是把它们混合在一起，这样就能得到一个整体上稍微不那么浓缩的浓缩液。但这些**冷萃咖啡机**制作出的浓缩液非常浓。那种“火箭燃料”的比喻就是这样。所以，你把它们混合在一起，味道仍然很好。再说一次，你不会得到那么多苦味或异味。它稍微不那么浓缩，但仍然足够浓缩，你需要加一些水或牛奶或 whatever。而且它能持续几乎两倍长的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: No. So, it'll be a little weaker. What we like to do is just mix it all together and it makes like an overall slightly less concentrated concentrate. But these these cold brew makers make like such a concentrated concentrate. The whole kind of like rocket fuel trope is like that's what it is. So like you mix it all together, it still tastes good. Again, you're kind of like not getting as much of those kind of like bitter off flavors. It's a little less concentrated, but still concentrated enough that you want to add some water or milk or whatever. And it lasts almost twice as long.

</details>

**Rosie**: **Margaret**，非常感谢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: What are you taking away from this one?

</details>

**Christine**: 好的，我的天哪，你可以用咖啡粉**二次冷萃**，这让我大开眼界。我原以为那是不行的，但显然不是。所以，这很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Well, okay. My mind is blown that you can brew coffee grounds twice for cold brew. I would have thought that that was a no no, but apparently not. So, that's pretty cool.

</details>

**Rosie**: 在**Margarite Preston**家里可不是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: Not in the Margarit Preston household.

</details>

**Christine**: 是的，今年夏天我要试试这个。然后，你知道，我没有**鹅颈壶**，我一直想要一个，我想是时候了。我想是时候买一个了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yeah, I'm going to try that this summer. And then, you know, I don't have a gooseeneck cuddle and I've always kind of wanted one and I think it's time I think it's time to get one.

</details>

**Rosie**: 我不骗你，它手感很好。我喜欢那种可控的倒水方式。它会让你感觉很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: I won't lie, it feels good in the hand. I like the controlled pore. It just makes you feel kind of nice.

**Christine**: Yeah. And it's also really pretty. So,

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie**: that's true. My takeaway from Margarite, and she's told me this offline, she's told me this on this show. Don't forget to clean your stuff. Your grinder, your machine, all of it.

</details>

**Christine**: 是的，是真的。大家，你们必须这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine**: Yeah, it's true. You got to do it, people.
