title: 痛苦帝国：奥施康定如何引爆美国阿片危机
---
### 萨克勒家族的表象与奥施康定的阴影

在纽约大都会艺术博物馆的萨克勒翼，阳光透过巨大的玻璃幕墙，洒落在丹泽神庙上。这里是人类文明的结晶，是艺术、历史和美的殿堂。在哈佛、耶鲁、牛津和卢浮宫，**萨克勒家族**（Sackler family: 普渡制药的拥有者家族）的名字被镌刻在人类最顶级的学术和艺术机构的墙壁上。这是一个曾代表着慷慨、博爱和高尚品味的家族。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look at this place, the Sackler Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Sunlight streams through the massive glass curtain wall, illuminating the Temple of Dendur. This is the crystallization of human civilization, a sanctuary of art, history, and beauty. At Harvard, Yale, Oxford, and the Louvre, the Sackler name is inscribed on the walls of humanity's most prestigious academic and artistic institutions. This is a family that represented generosity, philanthropy, and refined taste.</p>
</details>

然而，在同一个国家，佛吉尼亚州的李县，却是另一个世界。在这里，萨克勒这个名字等同于瘟疫。高中啦啦队队长会在毕业晚会前偷偷溜进洗手间吸毒；婴儿一出生就在戒断症状中痛苦挣扎；一位乡村医生绝望地发现，他亲手接生的孩子长大后一个个死于药物过量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yet, in the same country, in Lee County, Virginia, it's another world. Here, the Sackler name is synonymous with plague. High school cheerleaders sneak into bathrooms to do drugs before prom. Babies are born struggling with withdrawal symptoms. A rural doctor despairingly discovers that the children he delivered are dying one by one from drug overdoses as adults.</p>
</details>

连接这两个极端世界的，就是那颗小小的药丸——**奥施康定**（OxyContin: 一种强效阿片类止痛药）。一边是价值数十亿美元的艺术捐赠，另一边是美国历史上最严重的药物滥用危机，已造成数十万人死亡。这听起来像一个魔鬼的交易。今天，我们要回答的问题是：一个被视作美国贵族家庭的家族，是如何、又为什么要向自己的国家发动一场长达20年、利润丰厚的化学战争？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Connecting these two extreme worlds is the tiny pill, OxyContin. On one side, billions of dollars in art donations; on the other, the worst drug abuse crisis in American history, having caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. This sounds like a devil's bargain, doesn't it? Today, the question we want to answer is: how and why did a family considered American aristocracy wage a 20-year, lucrative chemical war against its own country?</p>
</details>

这是一个关于欺骗、贪婪，以及一个家族如何系统性地将谎言打包成“奇迹疗法”的故事。这是一个关于痛苦帝国的故事。

<p class="english-text">This is a story of deception, greed, and how one family systematically packaged lies into a "miracle cure." This is the story of an empire of pain.</p>

### 亚瑟·萨克勒：现代医药营销的教父

要理解**普渡制药**（Purdue Pharma: 生产奥施康定的美国制药公司）和奥施康定，你必须先了解一个人——他不是雷蒙德，也不是莫蒂默，那两个后来靠奥施康定发财的兄弟。我们要谈的是他们的大哥亚瑟·萨克勒。亚瑟是萨克勒家族的教父，是现代医药营销的爱迪生。他是个天才，一个真正的文艺复兴人，同时是医生、精神病学家、艺术收藏家，以及一个广告狂人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To understand Purdue Pharma and OxyContin, you must first understand one person—not Raymond or Mortimer, the two brothers who later profited from OxyContin. We need to talk about their elder brother, Arthur Sackler. Arthur was the godfather of the Sackler family, the Edison of modern pharmaceutical marketing. He was a genius, a true Renaissance man, simultaneously a doctor, psychiatrist, art collector, and an advertising madman.</p>
</details>

早在1940年代，亚瑟就彻底改变了制药行业。在他之前，药品广告非常克制。而亚瑟，他把卖药变成了卖生活方式。他最经典的手笔是罗氏制药的**安定**（Valium: 一种镇静剂）。在亚瑟的营销下，安定不再是简简单单的镇定剂，它变成了“母亲的小帮手”。他甚至还帮助发明了一个新的医学概念，叫做“神经性紧张”，然后把安定包装成这个新疾病的完美解药。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As early as the 1940s, Arthur revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry. Before him, drug advertising was very restrained. Arthur, however, transformed selling medicine into selling a lifestyle. His most classic move was with Roche's Valium. Under Arthur's marketing, Valium was no longer just a simple tranquilizer; it became "mother's little helper." He even helped invent a new medical concept called "nervous tension," then packaged Valium as the perfect antidote for this new ailment.</p>
</details>

但是亚瑟·萨克勒的核心是他对于控制和秘密的迷恋。根据调查记者的挖掘，亚瑟构建了一个庞大且隐秘的商业网络。他运营着最大的医药广告公司，同时他还控制着一系列看似独立的医学期刊和通讯，比如说《医学论坛报》。这份报纸免费发放给全国16万名医生。大家可以猜一猜，这些“独立的”医学报纸上会登什么？当然是吹捧他客户药品的研究文章。他甚至会把客户药品，比如说辉瑞的抗生素的广告，伪装成医生的名片和推荐信。而后来调查记者发现，这些所谓的医生根本就不存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But central to Arthur Sackler was his obsession with control and secrecy. According to investigative journalists, Arthur built a vast and clandestine business network. He operated the largest pharmaceutical advertising agency, and simultaneously controlled a series of seemingly independent medical journals and newsletters, such as the Medical Tribune. This publication was distributed free to 160,000 doctors nationwide. One can guess what these "independent" medical newspapers would publish: research articles, of course, extolling his clients' drugs. He even disguised advertisements for client drugs, such as Pfizer's antibiotics, as doctors' business cards and letters of recommendation. Later, investigative journalists discovered that these so-called doctors didn't even exist.</p>
</details>

更深的秘密是，1950年代**FDA**（Food and Drug Administration: 美国食品药品监督管理局）爆发了一场巨大的腐败丑闻。抗生素部门的主管亨利·韦尔奇被发现在为“独立医学期刊”工作，并从中收取了巨额的版税。而调查发现，这期刊背后正是亚瑟·萨克勒的隐蔽公司。所以你看，早在奥施康定出现的几十年前，萨克勒家族的DNA就已经被写好了：第一，药品不再是药，而是可以创造需求的商品；第二，控制叙事，通过资助医生、控制期刊，让营销看起来像科学；第三，绝对保密，建立复杂的公司网络，把家族的名字和肮脏的商业操作隔离开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A deeper secret is that in the 1950s, the FDA experienced a huge corruption scandal. Henry Welch, head of the antibiotic division, was found to be working for "independent medical journals" and collecting enormous royalties from them. Investigations revealed that behind these journals were Arthur Sackler's hidden companies. So you see, decades before OxyContin appeared, the Sackler family's DNA was already set: first, drugs were no longer medicine but commodities for which demand could be created; second, control the narrative by funding doctors and controlling journals to make marketing appear scientific; third, absolute secrecy, establishing complex corporate networks to separate the family name from dirty business practices.</p>
</details>

亚瑟在1987年去世了，但留给他两个弟弟的，不仅是一家毫不起眼的小公司普渡弗雷德里克，更留下了这套完整的、被验证极其成功的帝国方法论。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Arthur died in 1987, but he left his two brothers not just the inconspicuous small company Purdue Frederick, but also this complete and proven highly successful imperial methodology.</p>

### 疼痛革命：从善意到滥用的转折

在奥施康定出现之前，美国医学界被一种恐惧所笼罩，这种恐惧被称为**阿片类药物恐惧症**（Opioid-phobia: 医生因担心患者成瘾而不敢开具阿片类止痛药的现象）。这类恐惧是有历史渊源的：美国内战催生了第一代吗啡成瘾者，被称为“士兵的病”；到了20世纪初，哈里森法案的出台，让医生们因为开具麻醉剂而面临牢狱之灾。结果是什么呢？结果就是医生们宁愿让病人痛着，也不敢开止疼片，尤其是在癌症晚期的病房里，上演了一幕幕的人间惨剧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before OxyContin emerged, the American medical community was shrouded in a fear known as opioid-phobia. This fear had historical roots: the American Civil War spawned the first generation of morphine addicts, known as "soldier's disease"; by the early 20th century, the Harrison Act led to doctors facing imprisonment for prescribing narcotics. What was the result? Doctors preferred to let patients suffer in pain rather than prescribe painkillers, especially in late-stage cancer wards, where human tragedies unfolded repeatedly.</p>
</details>

当时医学界的常规叫做**PRN**（Pro re nata: 拉丁语“按需给药”的缩写）。听起来很合理，对吧？但在实际操作中，它意味着病人必须等到痛苦已经无法忍受、开始尖叫的时候，才能够申请一针吗啡。而护士和医生由于害怕病人成瘾，还会刻意拖延给药的时间。这导致一种可怕的“过山车效应”：病人在极度痛苦和短暂麻木之间往复循环。更糟糕的是，当痛苦达到顶峰时，你需要更大剂量的吗啡才能够把它压下去，而这反而更容易导致患者陷入精神恍惚和昏迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The medical standard at the time was called PRN (Pro re nata: Latin for "as needed"). Sounds reasonable, right? But in practice, it meant patients had to wait until their pain was unbearable and they started screaming before they could request a morphine injection. And nurses and doctors, fearing addiction, would deliberately delay administering the medication. This led to a terrible "rollercoaster effect": patients cycled between extreme pain and brief numbness. Worse still, when pain peaked, larger doses of morphine were needed to suppress it, which ironically made patients more prone to mental confusion and coma.</p>
</details>

这就是**临终关怀运动**（Hospice movement: 旨在为临终病人提供尊严和无痛照护的运动）的起点。像西西里·桑德斯这样的先驱者开始倡导生命的终点应该是有尊严的、是无痛的。纽约的纪念斯隆凯特琳癌症中心成为了这场运动的先锋。他们发现，如果按时给药，让吗啡在血液中保持一个稳定的水平，病人就不会经历那种过山车的痛苦，他们可以时刻保持清醒，甚至在生命的最后阶段与家人正常交流。这是一个巨大的医学进步，它证明了在特定情况下，大剂量的阿片类药物是可以安全使用的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was the starting point of the hospice movement. Pioneers like Cecily Saunders began advocating that the end of life should be dignified and pain-free. New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center became the vanguard of this movement. They discovered that if morphine was administered on a schedule, maintaining a stable level in the blood, patients would not experience that rollercoaster of pain. They could remain lucid at all times, even communicating normally with family in their final stages of life. This was a huge medical advance, proving that in specific circumstances, large doses of opioids could be safely used.</p>
</details>

在斯隆凯特琳癌症中心，有一位年轻的明星医生叫做拉塞尔·波特诺伊。他充满了激情，富有同情心，他觉得自己是一个“白帽子”，是一个拯救病人于水火的好人。很快，波特诺伊有一个革命性的想法：既然这套方法对于癌症疼痛有效且安全，为什么不能用在非癌症疼痛上呢？你想想，那些年因为工伤、车祸、关节炎、纤维肌痛症而需要常年忍受慢性但非癌症疼痛的人，他们的疼痛难道活该被忽视吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, there was a young star doctor named Russell Portenoy. He was passionate, compassionate, and saw himself as a "white hat," a good person saving patients from suffering. Soon, Portenoy had a revolutionary idea: since this method was effective and safe for cancer pain, why couldn't it be used for non-cancer pain? Think about it, during those years, people suffering from chronic but non-cancer pain due to work injuries, car accidents, arthritis, or fibromyalgia—did their pain deserve to be ignored?</p>
</details>

1986年，波特诺伊和他导师凯瑟琳·福利发表了一篇影响深远的论文。他们追踪了38名非癌症患者，结论是长期使用阿片类药物对他们来说是安全有效的。38人这个样本量小的可怜，但是在那个渴望解放思想的年代，这篇文章就像一个信号弹。波特诺伊成为了疼痛革命的旗手，他开始在全国巡回演讲，痛斥医学界的阿片类药物恐惧症是一种过时的、不人道的偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1986, Portenoy and his mentor, Catherine Foley, published a far-reaching paper. They tracked 38 non-cancer patients and concluded that long-term opioid use was safe and effective for them. A sample size of 38 is pitifully small, but in an era eager for liberation of thought, this article was like a signal flare. Portenoy became the standard-bearer of the pain revolution, embarking on national speaking tours, denouncing the medical community's opioid-phobia as an outdated, inhumane prejudice.</p>
</details>

为了支持他这项革命，波特诺伊和他追随者反复使用了三项关键证据，这三个证据被称为是疼痛运动的“圣三一”（Holy Trinity）：
1.  **波士顿大学的研究**：被引用为11,882名住院患者中仅有4例成瘾。这个低于1%的数字成为日后所有营销的核心。
2.  **钻石诊所的研究**：针对2,369名头痛患者的研究，据说只发现了3例成瘾问题。
3.  **烧伤中心的研究**：同样显示了极低的成瘾率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To support his revolution, Portenoy and his followers repeatedly used three key pieces of evidence, known as the "Holy Trinity" of the pain movement:
1.  **Boston University study**: Cited as only 4 cases of addiction among 11,882 hospitalized patients. This less-than-1% figure became the core of all subsequent marketing.
2.  **Diamond Clinic study**: A study of 2,369 headache patients, reportedly found only 3 cases of addiction.
3.  **Burn center study**: Also showed extremely low addiction rates.</p>
</details>

在这些“铁证”面前，旧的防线崩溃了。一个全新的医疗共识开始形成，这共识由制药公司慷慨资助：疼痛不再仅仅是一种症状，它本身就是一种需要被消灭的疾病。医生的道德标准被重塑了：让病人疼痛是不道德的，而那些不敢开药的医生是落伍的、冷酷的。一场人道主义的“十字军东征”已经万事俱备，它现在只缺一样东西——一件完美的武器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the face of this "ironclad evidence," the old defenses collapsed. A new medical consensus began to form, generously funded by pharmaceutical companies: pain was no longer merely a symptom; it was a disease in itself that needed to be eradicated. Doctors' ethical standards were reshaped: it was immoral to let patients suffer pain, and doctors who dared not prescribe medication were outdated and callous. A humanitarian "crusade" was fully prepared; it now lacked only one thing—a perfect weapon.</p>
</details>

### 奥施康定：完美的“圣杯”与官方背书

在这时，亚瑟·萨克勒的两个弟弟雷蒙德和莫迪默，带着他们的普渡制药公司登场了。他们不是新手，在80年代，他们就已经靠着一款用于癌症止痛的**缓释吗啡**（MS Contin: 普渡制药早期的缓释吗啡止痛药）赚得盆满钵满。现在，他们看到了波特诺伊掀起的这场非癌症疼痛革命——这是一个比癌症市场大几百倍的蓝海。他们需要一款更好的武器。吗啡这个词名声太差，让人联想到死亡和战争。他们需要一种看起来更温和、更现代的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this point, Arthur Sackler's two brothers, Raymond and Mortimer, entered the scene with their Purdue Pharma company. They were not newcomers; in the 1980s, they had already made a fortune with MS Contin, a sustained-release morphine for cancer pain. Now, they saw the non-cancer pain revolution ignited by Portenoy—a blue ocean hundreds of times larger than the cancer market. They needed a better weapon. The word "morphine" had too bad a reputation, evoking death and war. They needed something that seemed gentler and more modern.</p>
</details>

他们选中了奥施康定。这是泰洛和朴西通里的有效成分，但是普渡把它提纯了。真正的天才之处在于**Contin**（Controlled-release system: 普渡制药专利的药物持续释放技术），普渡的专利持续释放系统。理论是这样的：普通的止疼药药效快速上冲，带来快感和“high”，但是快速下降导致痛苦和渴望，这是成瘾的根源。而奥施康定，它会在12个小时内平稳地释放药力，没有波峰，没有波谷。因此，它只提供纯粹的镇痛，而理论上消除了成瘾的快感。这简直是完美的“圣杯”——一种既能够强力止痛又不会让人成瘾的阿片类药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They chose OxyContin. This was the active ingredient in Tylenol and Percocet, but Purdue purified it. The true genius lay in Contin, Purdue's patented controlled-release system. The theory was this: ordinary painkillers have a rapid onset, bringing pleasure and a "high," but a quick decline leads to pain and craving, which is the root of addiction. OxyContin, however, would steadily release its potency over 12 hours, with no peaks and no valleys. Therefore, it provided pure pain relief, theoretically eliminating the pleasure of addiction. This was nothing short of the perfect "Holy Grail"—an opioid that could powerfully relieve pain without causing addiction.</p>
</details>

时间到了1995年，普渡制药向FDA提交了上市申请。他们成功说服了FDA，FDA不仅批准了它，还批准了一项史无前例的、具有决定性意义的标签声明：在奥施康定的说明书上，FDA允许普渡印了这样一句话：“延迟吸收，正如奥施康定片所提供的，被认为可以降低该药物的滥用倾向。”就是这句话，成为了普渡制药的尚方宝剑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By 1995, Purdue Pharma submitted its application for market approval to the FDA. They successfully persuaded the FDA, which not only approved it but also granted an unprecedented and decisive label claim: on OxyContin's package insert, the FDA allowed Purdue to print the sentence, "Delayed absorption, as provided by OxyContin tablets, is believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug." This single sentence became Purdue Pharma's ultimate weapon.</p>
</details>

调查记者在书中透露，当时FDA内部有一位名叫戴安的官员，在审查这份文件时，曾经批注道“这听起来像BS（狗屎）”，但他的反对无效。负责批准这个标签的FDA审查官名叫柯蒂斯·赖特四世。批准奥施康定后不久，赖特博士就从FDA辞职了。1998年，他加入了普渡制药，第一年的薪酬待遇高达379,000美金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Investigative journalists revealed in their book that an FDA official named Diane, while reviewing the document, had annotated it with "This sounds like BS," but her objection was overruled. The FDA reviewer responsible for approving this label was named Curtis Wright IV. Shortly after approving OxyContin, Dr. Wright resigned from the FDA. In 1998, he joined Purdue Pharma, with a first-year compensation package of up to $379,000.</p>
</details>

现在剧本齐了：一场人道主义的医疗革命，一个低于1%的科学神话，一件不会成瘾的完美武器，以及来自于美国政府最高监管机构的官方背书。亚瑟·萨克勒的幽灵一定在微笑，他的弟弟们即将启动他那台精密的营销机器，把这个故事卖给全美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the script was complete: a humanitarian medical revolution, a scientific myth of less than 1% addiction, a perfect non-addictive weapon, and official endorsement from the highest regulatory body of the U.S. government. Arthur Sackler's ghost must have been smiling; his brothers were about to unleash his sophisticated marketing machine to sell this story to all of America.</p>
</details>

### 普渡制药的营销闪电战与灾难性后果

1996年奥施康定上市，普渡制药发动了一场美国历史上针对单一药物的最大规模营销闪电战。他们的目标不是癌症专家或疼痛专家，而是那些最没有防备、对疼痛管理最缺乏训练的群体——全科医生、家庭医生和乡村医生。亚瑟·萨克勒的营销剧本被完美复制，并且放大了100倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When OxyContin launched in 1996, Purdue Pharma unleashed the largest marketing blitz for a single drug in American history. Their target was not cancer specialists or pain experts, but the most unprepared and least trained group in pain management—general practitioners, family doctors, and rural doctors. Arthur Sackler's marketing playbook was perfectly replicated and amplified a hundredfold.</p>
</details>

**第一招：人海战术和金钱刺激。** 普渡的销售团队从300人翻倍到600多人。他们有一套史上最慷慨的奖金体系。根据调查记者披露，销售代表的奖金不是看他们卖了多少处方，而是看他们卖的药的总价值。这意味着他们有强烈的动机去说服医生开出剂量最大、价格最贵的药片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**First tactic: Human wave tactics and financial incentives.** Purdue's sales team doubled from over 300 to over 600 people. They had the most generous bonus system in history. According to investigative journalists, sales representatives' bonuses were not based on how many prescriptions they sold, but on the total value of the drugs they sold. This meant they had a strong incentive to persuade doctors to prescribe the highest-dose, most expensive pills.</p>
</details>

**第二招：精准的数据黑客。** 普渡公司从IMS Health公司购买了海量的医生处方数据。他们建立起了一个庞大的数据库，可以精准识别哪些医生最爱开止痛片——他们称之为“组合机会报告”，哪些医生是“高分贝的处方大户”。然后销售代表就带着这些数据，像巡航导弹一样精准地拜访这些医生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Second tactic: Precise data hacking.** Purdue purchased massive amounts of doctor prescription data from IMS Health. They built a huge database that could precisely identify which doctors most frequently prescribed painkillers—they called this the "Combined Opportunity Report," identifying which doctors were "high-volume prescribers." Sales representatives then used this data to visit these doctors with cruise missile-like precision.</p>
</details>

**第三招：伪装成教育的洗脑。** 普渡赞助了数千场疼痛管理研讨会。他们把2,000多名医生用飞机接到亚利桑那、佛罗里达和加州的豪华度假村，享受全包的奢华周末。在这些“教育会议”上，普渡招募的意见领袖——那些被收买的医生，比如说苏珊·贝特朗医生（每场演讲的收费高达3,000美金），会一遍又一遍地灌输那个官方叙事：疼痛是第五生命体征，阿片类药物恐惧症是不道德的，奥施康定的成瘾性低于1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Third tactic: Brainwashing disguised as education.** Purdue sponsored thousands of pain management seminars. They flew over 2,000 doctors to luxury resorts in Arizona, Florida, and California for all-inclusive lavish weekends. At these "educational conferences," opinion leaders recruited by Purdue—doctors who had been bought, such as Dr. Susan Bertrand (who charged up to $3,000 per lecture)—would repeatedly instill the official narrative: pain is the fifth vital sign, opioid-phobia is immoral, and OxyContin's addiction rate is less than 1%.</p>
</details>

最绝的是，普渡推出了一大堆品牌周边，你看：渔夫帽、泰迪熊，甚至是摇摆舞CD。这就是亚瑟·萨克勒的精髓：常态化。他们把一种效力堪比海洛因的强麻醉剂，包装得像抗生素或者降压药一样安全、日常甚至时髦。他们让医生在潜意识里放松了警惕——这不再是锁在保险柜里的魔鬼，而是你可以送给病人的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most astonishingly, Purdue launched a plethora of branded merchandise: bucket hats, teddy bears, even swing dance CDs. This was the essence of Arthur Sackler: normalization. They packaged a powerful narcotic, comparable in potency to heroin, to appear as safe, commonplace, and even fashionable as an antibiotic or blood pressure medication. They subconsciously disarmed doctors—this was no longer a devil locked in a safe, but a gift you could give to your patients.</p>
</details>

这场营销闪电战在阿巴拉契亚山区这样的地方取得了灾难性的成功。这是弗吉尼亚州的李县，一个以煤矿为生、工伤遍地的贫困地区。这里是奥施康定危机的“地面零点”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This marketing blitz achieved catastrophic success in places like the Appalachian Mountains. This is Lee County, Virginia, a poverty-stricken area sustained by coal mining and rife with work injuries. This was "ground zero" for the OxyContin crisis.</p>
</details>

### 乡村医生的呐喊与普渡的公关危机

我们要认识一下故事的另一位主角——阿尔特·范泽医生。范泽医生是那种理想主义者，他本可以在大城市过上优渥的生活，但他选择在阿巴拉契亚最穷的圣查尔斯镇开了25年诊所。他给这里几代人看病，从接生到临终，他对这个社区的责任感是刻在骨子里的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We need to meet another protagonist in this story—Dr. Art Van Zee. Dr. Van Zee was an idealist; he could have lived a comfortable life in a big city, but he chose to run a clinic for 25 years in St. Charles, one of the poorest towns in Appalachia. He treated generations of people here, from birth to death; his sense of responsibility to this community was ingrained.</p>
</details>

1999年开始，范泽医生发现事情有点不对劲了。2000年1月的一个深夜，范泽医生接到急诊电话，一位年轻女孩服药过量，正在上呼吸机。当他赶到医院翻开病历卡时，他愣住了——这个女孩他认识，21年前他亲手给她打了免疫针，他看着她长大，现在她因为奥施康定濒临死亡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting in 1999, Dr. Van Zee noticed something was amiss. Late one night in January 2000, Dr. Van Zee received an emergency call: a young girl had overdosed and was on a ventilator. When he arrived at the hospital and opened her medical chart, he was stunned—he knew this girl. 21 years ago, he had personally given her immunizations; he had watched her grow up. Now, she was on the brink of death because of OxyContin.</p>
</details>

这不是个例。范泽身边的世界开始坍塌。他从当地的药剂师格雷格·斯图尔特那里听说，这种药在街上泛滥成灾。他对所在高中做了一项匿名调查，结果让他毛骨悚然：28%的十一年级学生承认自己曾经尝试过奥施康定。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This was not an isolated case. The world around Van Zee began to collapse. He heard from local pharmacist Greg Stewart that the drug was rampant on the streets. He conducted an anonymous survey at his local high school, and the results horrified him: 28% of eleventh-grade students admitted to having tried OxyContin.</p>
</details>

这个女孩林赛·麦尔斯，是李县高中的啦啦队长。她家境优渥，开着崭新的吉普车，是镇上的天之骄女。16岁时，她和朋友在车里第一次尝试了奥施康定。她看着朋友把药片含在嘴里湿润，用T恤擦干，夹在钞票里，咬碎然后吸食。她很快就上瘾了。她开始只是腿疼，那是戒断症状开始。她的母亲简还以为是女儿累了，在半夜给她按摩。很快林赛开始从家里偷钱，她发现父母藏在卧室保险柜里伪装成剃须膏罐的现金。她每天要花300美元买药。

<p class="english-text">The girl, Lindsey Myers, was a cheerleader at Lee County High School. She came from a well-off family, drove a brand-new Jeep, and was the town's golden girl. At sixteen, she and a friend first tried OxyContin in a car. She watched her friend moisten the pill in her mouth, dry it with a T-shirt, crush it between banknotes, and then snort it. She quickly became addicted. At first, she only had leg pain, which was the onset of withdrawal symptoms. Her mother, Jane, thought her daughter was just tired and massaged her in the middle of the night. Soon, Lindsey began stealing money from home; she found cash hidden by her parents in a bedroom safe, disguised as shaving cream cans. She spent $300 a day on drugs.</p>
</details>

在她高中毕业之夜，一个本该是她人生中最荣耀的时刻，她正经历着痛苦的戒断反应。当中场休息即将上场接受父母的鲜花时，她溜进了体育场下面的隧道，和她的毒贩男友碰头。她吸食了刚刚到手的40毫克奥施康定，擦掉鼻血，跑回球场，脸上挤出了一个啦啦队长的标志微笑。范泽医生意识到，他面对的不是几个坏孩子堕落，而是一场席卷整个社区的瘟疫。

<p class="english-text">On her high school graduation night, a moment that should have been one of the most glorious in her life, she was experiencing painful withdrawal. When halftime approached and it was time to go on stage to receive flowers from her parents, she slipped into the tunnel beneath the stadium to meet her drug dealer boyfriend. She snorted the 40mg OxyContin she had just acquired, wiped away the nosebleed, and ran back onto the field, forcing a cheerleader's signature smile onto her face. Dr. Van Zee realized he was facing not the downfall of a few bad kids, but a plague sweeping through the entire community.</p>
</details>

当灾难爆发时，你才能真正看清一个人的真实底色。现在我们要对比两个第一反应。首先是乡村医生范泽的反应：他是一位医生，也是一位学者，他开始收集数据。他发现奥施康定以一种奇怪的方式传播，不是从大城市到乡村，而是像病毒一样，在缅因州、弗吉尼亚、俄亥俄州和宾夕法尼亚州的偏远农村热点地区同时爆发。他以为这一定是哪里搞错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is only when disaster strikes that you truly see a person's true colors. Now we will compare two initial reactions. First, Dr. Van Zee's reaction: he was a doctor and a scholar, and he began collecting data. He discovered that OxyContin was spreading in a strange way, not from big cities to rural areas, but like a virus, simultaneously erupting in remote rural hotspots in Maine, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. He thought there must be a mistake somewhere.</p>
</details>

2000年，他给普渡制药的医学总监大卫·哈多克斯写了一封信。信的语气非常谦逊，像一个医生同行一样分享了他的担忧：“我们的社区正在面临着巨大的问题，我期待与您进一步对话。”他天真地认为，普渡的高管们——那些受过良好教育的医生和科学家——只是被蒙在鼓里，如果他们知道了真相，他们一定会震惊并且立即采取行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 2000, he wrote a letter to David Haddox, Purdue Pharma's medical director. The tone of the letter was very humble, sharing his concerns like a fellow doctor: "Our community is facing huge problems, and I look forward to further dialogue with you." He naively believed that Purdue's executives—those well-educated doctors and scientists—were simply unaware, and that if they knew the truth, they would be shocked and take immediate action.</p>
</details>

现在我们来看看普渡制药的第一反应。早在2000年初，缅因州的联邦检察官杰伊·麦克罗斯基就注意到了奥施康定滥用和犯罪率飙升。他向全州的医生发起了警告，这是全国的第一个官方警告。普渡内部反应是什么呢？根据调查记者披露的内部备忘录，公关主管罗宾·霍根潦草地写道：“我们需要一个策略来控制这个局面。”他们的第一反应不是“我们要如何解决这个健康危机”，而是“我们要如何控制这个公关危机”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now let's look at Purdue Pharma's initial reaction. As early as early 2000, Jay McCloskey, the U.S. Attorney for Maine, noticed a surge in OxyContin abuse and crime rates. He issued a warning to doctors across the state, the first official warning nationwide. What was Purdue's internal response? According to an internal memo disclosed by investigative journalists, public relations director Robin Hogan scribbled, "We need a strategy to control this situation." Their first reaction was not "how do we solve this health crisis," but "how do we control this public relations crisis."</p>
</details>

普渡的公关机器立刻开动了。他们聘请了顶级的危机管理公司，比如尼克尔斯·德森哈尔，这家公司以替陷入困境的乳房假体和含铅涂料行业辩护而闻名。他们的策略就是亚瑟·萨克勒的经典剧本：
1.  **甩锅给受害者**：他们把奥施康定危机描绘成阿巴拉契亚地区的特殊问题。他们说那里人本来就穷，受教育程度低，有药物滥用的传统。这是罪犯的问题，不是药的问题。
2.  **发明新词**：他们把奥施康定称为是“今日之药”，意思是媒体总喜欢炒作一种新药，过一阵就没事了。
3.  **转移焦点**：他们制作了误导性的图表，显示含有氢可酮的药物导致的急诊更多，但这完全是因为那些药的处方量是奥施康定的3倍。
4.  **扮演受害者**：他们宣称真正的受害者是那些沉默的、合法的疼痛患者，而媒体歇斯底里地正在剥夺他们获得“神奇药物”的权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Purdue's PR machine immediately sprang into action. They hired top crisis management firms, such as Nichols Dezenhall, a company known for defending the embattled breast implant and lead paint industries. Their strategy was Arthur Sackler's classic playbook:
1.  **Blame the victims**: They portrayed the OxyContin crisis as a unique problem of the Appalachian region. They claimed the people there were inherently poor, poorly educated, and had a tradition of drug abuse. This was a problem of criminals, not the drug.
2.  **Invent new terms**: They called OxyContin "the drug of the day," implying that the media always sensationalizes a new drug, and it would blow over soon.
3.  **Shift focus**: They created misleading charts showing more emergency room visits caused by hydrocodone-containing drugs, but this was solely because those drugs were prescribed three times more often than OxyContin.
4.  **Play the victim**: They claimed that the true victims were the silent, legitimate pain patients, and that the media's hysteria was depriving them of access to a "miracle drug."</p>

### 普渡的傲慢与范泽医生的坚持

时间来到2000年10月，范泽医生终于等来了和普渡高管的对话。大卫·哈多克斯飞到弗吉尼亚州。哈多克斯本人就是普渡官方叙事的完美化身，他是一位受过专业训练的疼痛和成瘾专家。事实上，他就是那个发明了**假性成瘾**（Pseudoaddiction: 一种理论，认为患者表现出成瘾迹象是因为疼痛未得到充分控制，而非真正成瘾）一词的人。这个词是什么意思呢？根据哈多克斯在1989年基于一个病人的案例发表的论文，如果一个病人表现出成瘾的所有迹象，比如说对药物的渴求、欺骗医生去多家医院开药，这并不意味着他上瘾了。不，那恰恰说明你给他的药还不够多，他是因为疼痛还没有被满足，所以才表现得像个瘾君子。你明白这个理论的魔鬼之处了吧？它把所有的红灯——成瘾的明确信号——全部重新定义成了绿灯——加大剂量的要求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By October 2000, Dr. Van Zee finally got his meeting with Purdue executives. David Haddox flew to Virginia. Haddox himself was the perfect embodiment of Purdue's official narrative; he was a professionally trained pain and addiction expert. In fact, he was the one who coined the term "pseudoaddiction." What did this term mean? According to Haddox's 1989 paper, based on a single patient case, if a patient exhibited all the signs of addiction—such as drug craving, deceiving doctors to obtain prescriptions from multiple hospitals—it didn't mean they were addicted. No, it simply meant you weren't giving them enough medication; they were acting like an addict because their pain wasn't adequately managed. Do you understand the diabolical nature of this theory? It redefined all red flags—clear signals of addiction—as green lights—demands for increased dosage.</p>
</details>

在里奇兰兹的一次会议上，范泽医生当面质问哈多克斯：“你们为什么要给医生送那些印着奥施康定logo的摇摆舞CD和毛绒玩具？这合适吗？”哈多克斯傲慢地回答：“这和其他制药公司有什么不同吗？”范泽医生回答了那句经典的话：“先生，人们不会为了降压药而去抢劫他们的邻居。”哈多克斯无言以对，借口说还有很长的路要走，转身走了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At a meeting in Richlands, Dr. Van Zee directly challenged Haddox: "Why are you sending doctors swing dance CDs and plush toys with the OxyContin logo? Is this appropriate?" Haddox arrogantly replied, "How is this any different from other pharmaceutical companies?" Dr. Van Zee responded with the classic line: "Sir, people don't rob their neighbors for blood pressure medication." Haddox was speechless, made an excuse about having a long way to go, and turned to leave.</p>
</details>

范泽医生没有放弃。2000年11月，他再次与哈多克斯会面。这次他带来了一份详细的清单，提了8点建议。这是一份极其理智、充满建设性的清单。他没要求立即下架药物，他要求的是：
1.  **发出红色警报信**：立刻警告全国的所有医生，奥施康定已经被发现有严重的滥用问题，被碾碎和注射。
2.  **停止营销**：立刻停止将奥施康定用于慢性非癌症疼痛的广告。
3.  **调查数据**：普渡应该调查一下，为什么在阿巴拉契亚这些滥用热点地区，他们的销售和营销力度会不成比例地高。
4.  **立即用奥施康定加纳洛酮的配方来取代原有的奥施康定**：这一点至关重要。**纳洛酮**（Naloxone: 一种阿片受体拮抗剂，可阻断阿片类药物的快感效应）是阿片拮抗剂，如果口服，它不会有任何反应。但是如果瘾君子试图把药片碾碎、注射或者吸食，纳洛酮就会被激活，从而阻断所有快感。这种技术并不新鲜，早在80年代，另一种止疼药就因为被滥用，被强制加入了纳洛酮，改名为Talwin NX，滥用的问题瞬间就消失了。范泽医生的意思是：你们有办法阻止这一切，立刻去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Van Zee did not give up. In November 2000, he met with Haddox again. This time, he brought a detailed list with eight suggestions. It was an extremely rational, constructive list. He did not demand immediate removal of the drug from the market; he requested:
1.  **Issue a red alert letter**: Immediately warn all doctors nationwide that OxyContin had been found to have serious abuse problems, being crushed and injected.
2.  **Stop marketing**: Immediately cease advertising OxyContin for chronic non-cancer pain.
3.  **Investigate data**: Purdue should investigate why their sales and marketing efforts were disproportionately high in abuse hotspots like Appalachia.
4.  **Immediately replace the original OxyContin with a formula containing naloxone**: This point was crucial. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist; if taken orally, it has no effect. But if an addict tried to crush, inject, or snort the pill, naloxone would be activated, blocking all euphoria. This technology was not new; as early as the 1980s, another painkiller, due to abuse, was mandated to include naloxone and renamed Talwin NX, and the abuse problem instantly disappeared. Dr. Van Zee's message was: you have a way to stop all this; do it immediately.</p>
</details>

哈多克斯礼貌地收下这份清单，说他会转达。然后呢，范泽医生就再也没有收到任何实质性的回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Haddox politely accepted the list, saying he would pass it on. After that, Dr. Van Zee never received any substantial reply.</p>
</details>

### 普渡的系统性欺骗与内部警报

普渡制药对于范泽医生的建议置若罔闻。他们公开的立场始终是：“我们对2000年缅因州的警报感到震惊和意外，我们是无辜的，我们也是受害者。”这是一个彻头彻尾的谎言。多年后，当联邦检察官最终撬开了普渡的保险箱，拿到了数千份内部电子邮件和备忘录时，真相才被还原。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Purdue Pharma ignored Dr. Van Zee's suggestions. Their public stance consistently was: "We were shocked and surprised by the 2000 Maine alert; we are innocent, and we are also victims." This was an outright lie. Years later, when federal prosecutors finally pried open Purdue's safe and obtained thousands of internal emails and memos, the truth was revealed.</p>
</details>

事实是，普渡的高管们从第一天开始就知道奥施康定会被滥用，并且一直在积极地掩盖这个事实。在奥施康定上市之前，普渡的明星产品缓释吗啡就已经在澳大利亚和美国被滥用了。瘾君子们称之为“紫色削片”，他们早就掌握了碾碎并且注射缓释片的方法。普渡内部很清楚，他们的缓释系统是可以被破解的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The truth was, Purdue executives knew from day one that OxyContin would be abused, and they had been actively covering up this fact. Before OxyContin's launch, Purdue's flagship product, MS Contin, was already being abused in Australia and the United States. Addicts called them "purple crush," and they had long mastered the method of crushing and injecting extended-release pills. Purdue internally knew well that their controlled-release system could be circumvented.</p>
</details>

奥施康定上市仅一年，根据调查记者获得的法庭文件，1997年华盛顿州的一位销售代表在内部报告中提到，当地的诺顿医生抱怨说他们的病人正在咀嚼奥施康定以获得快感。1998年，加拿大医学会的《加拿大医学会杂志》发表了一篇研究，发现缓释吗啡在温哥华街头备受追捧。而且更重要的是，该杂志配发的社论明确点明了刚刚在加拿大上市的奥施康定，警告说“我们可以预料，奥施康定也将流入黑市”。这篇社论被直接发到了普渡总部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just one year after OxyContin's launch, according to court documents obtained by investigative journalists, a sales representative in Washington State reported internally in 1997 that a local Dr. Norton complained his patients were chewing OxyContin for euphoria. In 1998, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published a study finding that sustained-release morphine was highly sought after on Vancouver streets. More importantly, the accompanying editorial explicitly named OxyContin, which had just launched in Canada, warning that "we can expect OxyContin to also flow into the black market." This editorial was sent directly to Purdue headquarters.</p>
</details>

1998年3月，在看到这些报告后，普渡的首席律师霍华德·乌德尔向萨克勒家族成员发送了一份题为《MS Contin滥用的法律备忘录》。他们讨论了，但是他们什么也没做。相反，在1998年，普渡制药的销售额猛增。他们非但没有警告医生，反而变本加厉地推动销售代表去分发1993年那份早已过时的丹尼尔·布鲁克夫的研究报告，那篇报告声称瘾君子们不喜欢缓释片。他们明知山有虎，却告诉所有人老虎不存在。

<details>
<summary>View/ 被 Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In March 1998, after seeing these reports, Purdue's chief counsel, Howard Udell, sent a legal memo titled "MS Contin Abuse" to Sackler family members. They discussed it, but they did nothing. Instead, in 1998, Purdue Pharma's sales surged. Far from warning doctors, they intensified efforts, pushing sales representatives to distribute the outdated 1993 Daniel Brookoff study, which claimed addicts disliked extended-release pills. They knew there was a tiger in the mountains but told everyone the tiger didn't exist.</p>
</details>

如果说1998年是警示，那么到了1999年，就是普渡内部警报拉响的一年。这一年，距他们声称首次得知滥用问题还有整整一年。首席律师霍华德·乌德尔在内部邮件中承认：“我们确实在互联网上发现了关于我们阿片类药物产品滥用的信息。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If 1998 was a warning, then 1999 was the year Purdue's internal alarms went off. This was a full year before they claimed to have first learned of the abuse problem. Chief Counsel Howard Udell admitted in an internal email: "We have indeed found information on the internet regarding the abuse of our opioid products."</p>
</details>

1999年1月，俄亥俄州的一位销售代表在电话报告中说：“今天，医生只想讨论奥施康定的新街头价值。”1999年2月，加利福尼亚州雷丁市弗兰克·费舍尔医生的制药工厂被警方突袭，这是全国首批因为滥开奥施康定而被端掉的诊所之一。普渡内部收到了警报。同年4月，西弗吉尼亚州威尔顿《每日时报》报道，海洛因和奥施康定正涌入街头。普渡两名销售代表立刻赶到报社，索要了这篇文章的副本。同年8月，宾夕法尼亚州的官员向医生发出警告，称瘾君子已经找到规避口服给药的方法。普渡的销售代表将这份警报传回了总部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In January 1999, an Ohio sales representative reported by phone: "Today, doctors only want to discuss the new street value of OxyContin." In February 1999, Dr. Frank Fisher's pharmaceutical facility in Redding, California, was raided by police; it was one of the first clinics nationwide shut down for over-prescribing OxyContin. Purdue internally received the alert. In April of the same year, the Weirton Daily Times in West Virginia reported that heroin and OxyContin were flooding the streets. Two Purdue sales representatives immediately rushed to the newspaper office to obtain a copy of the article. In August of the same year, Pennsylvania officials warned doctors that addicts had found ways to circumvent oral administration. Purdue's sales representatives relayed this alert back to headquarters.</p>
</details>

是的所有这些警报换来的不是收缩，而是更无耻的营销策略。1999年，普渡的营销经理马克·阿方索向他的团队发送了一份培训备忘录，指导他们如何应对医生的担忧。这份备忘录里写着：如果医生说他们正在碾碎和注射它，你作为销售代表应该这样回答：“那有多少您的病人是带针眼来的呢？”医生会回答“没有”，那么你就说“那还有什么问题呢？”如果医生说警察正在逮捕那些吸食奥施康定的人，你应该回答“太好了，说明警察正在做他们应该做的事情。如果病人和滥用者在走出您的办公室后重新配置了药物，那不是您的责任。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, all these warnings resulted not in a retraction, but in even more shameless marketing strategies. In 1999, Purdue's marketing manager, Mark Alfonso, sent a training memo to his team, instructing them on how to address doctors' concerns. The memo stated: if a doctor says they are crushing and injecting it, as a sales representative, you should respond: "How many of your patients come in with needle marks?" The doctor will reply "None," then you say "So what's the problem?" If a doctor says the police are arresting people for using OxyContin, you should reply "Great, that means the police are doing what they should be doing. If patients and abusers reconfigure the drug after leaving your office, that is not your responsibility."</p>
</details>

这就是真相：他们早就知道。他们知道药物被碾碎，他们知道药物被注射，他们知道药物在街头泛滥，他们知道医生在担心。他们的对策不是警告医生，而是教会那些销售代表如何打消医生的担忧，如何让医生觉得“那不是我的责任”，从而继续开出处方。这是一个系统性的、从上至下的主动的欺骗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the truth: they knew all along. They knew the drug was being crushed, they knew it was being injected, they knew it was rampant on the streets, and they knew doctors were concerned. Their strategy was not to warn doctors, but to teach sales representatives how to alleviate doctors' concerns, how to make doctors feel "that's not my responsibility," and thus continue to prescribe. This was a systematic, top-down, active deception.</p>
</details>

### 联邦调查与政治干预

当范泽医生在阿巴拉契亚的群山中孤军奋战时，他并不知道，他的努力已经点燃了另一条战线。在弗吉尼亚州西区，两位联邦助理检察官兰迪·拉姆塞耶和里克·蒙卡斯尔开始注意这些巧合。拉姆塞耶是一位沉稳的前海军陆战队员，他发现自己起诉的几乎所有银行劫案、所有暴力犯罪，最后都指向同一个东西——奥施康定。他们决定不再只是抓捕那些瘾君子，他们要顺着这条线一路往上，直到源头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While Dr. Van Zee was fighting alone in the Appalachian mountains, he didn't know that his efforts had ignited another front. In the Western District of Virginia, two Assistant U.S. Attorneys, Randy Ramseyer and Rick Mountcastle, began to notice these coincidences. Ramseyer, a steady former Marine, found that almost all bank robberies and violent crimes he prosecuted eventually pointed to the same thing—OxyContin. They decided not to just arrest addicts; they would follow the trail all the way up to the source.</p>
</details>

与此同时，在华盛顿，**DEA**（Drug Enforcement Administration: 美国缉毒局）转移控制办公室的新主任劳拉·内格尔也被激怒了。内格尔是一位强硬的探员，她厌倦了普渡的公关辞令。她和她的团队开始公开挑战普渡的官方叙事。2001年，内格尔和普渡的高管们进行了一次摊牌。内格尔直接说“这已经失控了”，她建议普渡限制处方权或者是限制药房。普渡的首席律师乌德尔只是轻描淡写地说：“我们会考虑这个建议。”几天后，内格尔收到了一封来自于CEO弗里德曼的五页长信。这是一封堪称傲慢的信。弗里德曼在信中逐条批驳了媒体报道的死亡人数，称肯塔基州的59例死亡无法证实，缅因州的35例死亡其实只有12例。内格尔看完信，对她同事说：“这是一封去你妈的信。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, in Washington, Laura Nagel, the new director of the DEA's Diversion Control Office, was also enraged. Nagel was a tough agent, tired of Purdue's PR rhetoric. She and her team began openly challenging Purdue's official narrative. In 2001, Nagel had a showdown with Purdue executives. Nagel stated directly, "This is out of control," and suggested Purdue restrict prescribing privileges or pharmacies. Purdue's chief counsel, Udell, merely understated, "We'll consider that suggestion." Days later, Nagel received a five-page letter from CEO Friedman. It was an arrogant letter. In it, Friedman refuted media reports of death tolls point by point, claiming that 59 deaths in Kentucky could not be confirmed, and that 35 deaths in Maine were actually only 12. After reading the letter, Nagel told her colleague, "This is a 'fuck you' letter."</p>
</details>

普渡甚至动用了他们的政治武器。他们聘请了911后的美国市长鲁迪·朱利安尼。朱利安尼利用他的关系绕过了内格尔，直接与DEA的最高长官阿萨·哈钦森会面。很快，DEA内部对于普渡制造工厂的调查就神秘地慢了下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Purdue even deployed their political weapons. They hired Rudy Giuliani, the post-9/11 mayor of New York. Giuliani used his connections to bypass Nagel and met directly with Asa Hutchinson, the highest official at the DEA. Soon, the internal DEA investigation into Purdue's manufacturing facilities mysteriously slowed down.</p>
</details>

但是普渡低估了阿宾登那两位联邦检察官的决心。拉姆塞耶和蒙卡斯尔没有退缩，他们召集了大陪审团，开始了长达4年的秘密调查。他们传唤了普渡的前销售代表、经理、医生、药剂师，甚至包括曾经被乌德尔封口的女员工莫琳·萨拉。他们拿到了那些1999年培训备忘录和互联网滥用的内部邮件。2006年调查结束，检察官撰写了一份长达120页的起诉备忘录。他们的结论是普渡制药犯有重罪。他们建议以“共谋欺诈美国”等重罪起诉CEO弗里德曼、律师乌德尔和首席医疗官戈登·海姆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Purdue underestimated the determination of the two federal prosecutors in Abingdon. Ramseyer and Mountcastle did not back down; they convened a grand jury and began a four-year secret investigation. They subpoenaed former Purdue sales representatives, managers, doctors, pharmacists, and even Maureen Sara, a female employee previously silenced by Udell. They obtained the 1999 training memos and internal emails regarding internet abuse. The investigation concluded in 2006, and prosecutors drafted a 120-page indictment memo. Their conclusion was that Purdue Pharma had committed felonies. They recommended indicting CEO Friedman, lawyer Udell, and Chief Medical Officer Gordon Heim on felony charges such as "conspiracy to defraud the United States."</p>
</details>

这次利剑已经悬在帝国的头顶，这是本该将萨克勒家族的代理人送进监狱的时刻。但是在最后一刻，政治再次介入了。普渡聘请了华盛顿最顶尖的律师团队。他们开始向华盛顿司法部的大人物施压。他们论点是：起诉高管会开创一个危险的先例，会让所有制药公司的高管都面临风险，而且这将是一场漫长、昂贵且不一定能赢的审判。华盛顿的司法部高层退缩了。他们否决了拉姆塞耶和蒙卡斯尔的重罪起诉建议，他们迫使弗吉尼亚团队接受一个妥协的方案——一个认罪协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This time, the sword hung over the empire's head; this was the moment when the Sackler family's proxies should have been sent to prison. But at the last minute, politics intervened again. Purdue hired Washington's top legal team. They began to pressure high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice in Washington. Their argument was that prosecuting executives would set a dangerous precedent, putting all pharmaceutical company executives at risk, and that it would be a long, expensive, and not necessarily winnable trial. High-ranking officials at the Department of Justice in Washington backed down. They rejected Ramseyer and Mountcastle's felony indictment recommendations and forced the Virginia team to accept a compromise—a plea agreement.</p>
</details>

### 2007年的“法律表演”与真相的流产

这就是2007年5月10日发生的事情。这本该是真相大白的一天，却成为一场精心编排的法律表演。这就是那笔交易：
1.  **普渡公司承认了一项轻罪**：“虚假标签”，承认其意图欺诈或者误导公众。
2.  **三名高管**：弗里德曼、乌德尔和戈登·海姆，不承认任何个人的不当行为，但是承认一项“严格责任下的轻罪”，意思是作为公司的负责高管，他们对于公司的违法行为负有责任，即使他们不知情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what happened on May 10, 2007. What should have been a day of truth became a carefully orchestrated legal performance. This was the deal:
1.  **Purdue Pharma admitted to a misdemeanor**: "Misbranding," acknowledging its intent to defraud or mislead the public.
2.  **Three executives**: Friedman, Udell, and Gordon Heim, admitted no individual wrongdoing but pleaded guilty to a "misdemeanor under strict liability," meaning that as responsible executives of the company, they were liable for the company's illegal actions, even if they were unaware.</p>
</details>

你看，这就是语言的艺术。他们花了四年时间证明这三个人知情并且参与了欺骗，但最后的法律文件却允许他们声称自己不知情。结果呢？公司被罚款6.345亿美元。三位高管没有一天入狱，他们被判处社区服务。对于一家当时年销售额数十亿、累计利润上百亿美元的公司来说，这笔罚款连阵痛都算不上，这只是一笔开展业务的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You see, this is the art of language. They spent four years proving that these three individuals knew about and participated in the deception, but the final legal documents allowed them to claim ignorance. What was the outcome? The company was fined $634.5 million. The three executives did not spend a single day in prison; they were sentenced to community service. For a company with billions in annual sales and tens of billions in cumulative profits at the time, this fine was not even a minor setback; it was merely a cost of doing business.</p>
</details>

但那天法庭上，发生了比法律条文更重要的事情。法官允许受害者家属发言。来自全国各地的父母们站了起来，他们举着自己孩子（大多数是青少年）的照片，直视那3位面无表情的高管。一位母亲说：“我希望你们被我儿子的面庞所困扰，直到你们死去的那一天。”一位父亲说：“你们和那些在街头兜售毒品的毒贩唯一的区别，就是你们穿着西装和领带。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But something more important than legal statutes happened in court that day. The judge allowed victims' families to speak. Parents from across the country stood up, holding photos of their children (mostly teenagers), looking directly at the three expressionless executives. One mother said, "I hope you are haunted by my son's face until the day you die." One father said, "The only difference between you and the drug dealers peddling drugs on the street is that you wear suits and ties."</p>
</details>

轮到检察官兰迪·拉姆塞耶发言时，他放弃了外交辞令。他知道正义已经流产，他决定在法庭记录中留下真相。他对着法官说：“如果公司的律师能够走上台，说普渡为他所犯的罪行感到抱歉，然后坐下，那该多好。如果这些高管的律师能够走上台，说他们很抱歉，他们辜负了公众的信任，然后坐下，那该多好。但我们都知道这不会发生。”

<p class="english-text">When it was prosecutor Randy Ramseyer's turn to speak, he abandoned diplomatic language. He knew justice had miscarried, and he decided to leave the truth on the court record. He said to the judge, "How wonderful it would be if the company's lawyers could step up and say Purdue is sorry for the crimes it committed, and then sit down. How wonderful it would be if these executives' lawyers could step up and say they are sorry, they betrayed the public's trust, and then sit down. But we all know that won't happen."</p>

拉姆塞耶预言到：“当我坐下后，普渡制药的下一场公关战役就会立即开始，他们会试图将他们所犯的罪行最小化。”拉姆塞耶一语成谶。乌德尔的律师立刻站了起来，发表了一场堪称无耻的演讲。他完全无视了检察官的愤怒，开始了一场公关表演。他没有道歉，反而开始吹嘘普渡在疼痛管理领域是多么的领先，吹嘘他们如何“自愿”地采取行动，以及他们如何致力于平衡病人的需求和滥用的风险。

<p class="english-text">Ramseyer predicted: "When I sit down, Purdue Pharma's next PR campaign will immediately begin; they will try to minimize the crimes they committed." Ramseyer's prophecy came true. Udell's lawyer immediately stood up and delivered a speech that could only be described as shameless. He completely ignored the prosecutor's anger and began a PR performance. He did not apologize; instead, he began to boast about how leading Purdue was in pain management, how they "voluntarily" took action, and how they were committed to balancing patient needs with abuse risks.</p>

在法庭的后排，坐着来自李县的乡村医生阿尔特·范泽和那位顽强的修女贝斯·戴维斯。他们开车几个小时来到这里，就是为了看到这一幕。戴维斯修女回来说：“我们没有得到我们想要的，但至少他们也没有完全逍遥法外。”

2007年，这场审判结束了。普渡支付了罚款，高管们回到他们位于康涅狄格州的豪宅。萨克勒家族的任何一个成员甚至都没有在法庭上出现过。对他们来说，这似乎只是一个小小挫折。但他们不知道的是，拉姆塞耶和蒙卡斯尔收集的那些证据——那些被司法部封存长达120页的起诉备忘录和数千封内部邮件——总有一天会重见天日。而那就是调查记者巴里·迈耶写《痛苦杀手》这本书的意义。

<p class="english-text">In 2007, the trial ended. Purdue paid the fine, and the executives returned to their mansions in Connecticut. Not a single member of the Sackler family even appeared in court. For them, it seemed like merely a minor setback. But what they didn't know was that the evidence collected by Ramseyer and Mountcastle—the 120-page indictment memo and thousands of internal emails sealed by the Department of Justice—would one day see the light of day. And that was the significance of investigative journalist Barry Meier writing his book, "Pain Killer."</p>

### 痛苦帝国的支柱与遗留的瘟疫

好啦，故事讲到这里，我们需要退后一步，深度剖析一下奥施康定的痛苦帝国是如何建成的。它不仅仅是一家公司的贪婪，它是一个系统性的多方合谋的产物。这个帝国建立在三根看似坚不可摧的支柱上：

<details>

<p class="english-text">Alright, with the story told, we need to step back and deeply analyze how the OxyContin empire of pain was built. It wasn't just the greed of one company; it was the product of a systemic, multi-party conspiracy. This empire was built on three seemingly indestructible pillars:</p>
</details>

**第一根支柱：萨克勒的营销原罪。** 我们必须明白，普渡制药的罪行不是疏忽，而是故意。亚瑟·萨克勒的哲学就是：医学是可以被营销的，需求是可以被创造的。他们精确地执行了这套战术：
*   **语言的腐败**：“假性成瘾”，把危险信号变成了购买信号；“低于1%”，把谎言变成了科学。
*   **情感的操纵**：他们利用了医生不想让病人痛苦的善意，把这种善意武器化，变成了他们推销强效麻醉剂的道德绑架。
*   **利益的捆绑**：通过豪华旅行、演讲费和研究资助，他们收编了整个疼痛管理领域的学术界，让最有权势的医生替他们站台。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**The first pillar: Sackler's original sin of marketing.** We must understand that Purdue Pharma's crime was not negligence, but intentional. Arthur Sackler's philosophy was: medicine can be marketed, and demand can be created. They precisely executed this tactic:
*   **Corruption of language**: "Pseudoaddiction" turned danger signals into buying signals; "less than 1%" turned lies into science.
*   **Manipulation of emotion**: They exploited doctors' good intentions of not wanting patients to suffer, weaponizing this goodwill into moral blackmail to push their powerful narcotics.
*   **Binding of interests**: Through luxury travel, speaking fees, and research grants, they co-opted the entire academic community in pain management, getting the most influential doctors to endorse them.</p>
</details>

**第二根支柱：监管的旋转门。** FDA本应该是人民的看门狗，但这个故事里头，它却变成了帮凶。那个批准了“降低滥用倾向”神奇标签的官员柯蒂斯·赖特，转头就加入了普渡，拿着将近40万美元的年薪。这扇旋转门传递了一个清晰的信号：如果你配合企业，你就会得到奖赏。当劳拉·内格尔的DEA试图发出警告时，FDA的第一反应不是合作，而是维稳，是反驳DEA的数据不科学，是安抚公众无需恐慌。他们要保护的是自己批准过的药物，而不是公众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**The second pillar: The regulatory revolving door.** The FDA should have been the people's watchdog, but in this story, it became an accomplice. Curtis Wright, the official who approved the miraculous "reduced abuse potential" label, turned around and joined Purdue, earning nearly $400,000 a year. This revolving door sent a clear signal: if you cooperate with corporations, you will be rewarded. When Laura Nagel's DEA tried to issue a warning, the FDA's first reaction was not cooperation, but maintaining stability, refuting DEA's data as unscientific, and reassuring the public not to panic. They were protecting the drugs they had approved, not the public.</p>
</details>

**第三根支柱：被收买的科学。** 这是最令人不寒而栗的。我们相信医生，因为我们相信他们背后的科学精神。但是奥施康定的故事告诉我们，科学是可以被定制的。还记得那个“低于1%”的神话吗？它来自1980年一封只有5句话的读者来信，它根本不是什么严谨的研究。而那些真正的专家，像拉塞尔·波特诺伊，他们在这场由制药公司资助的革命中迷失了方向。他们是善意的福音派，为了传播止痛的福音，他们不惜夸大疗效，无视风险。当科学和营销之间的界限被金钱模糊时，受害者一定是公众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**The third pillar: Bought science.** This is the most chilling. We trust doctors because we believe in the scientific spirit behind them. But the story of OxyContin tells us that science can be customized. Remember the "less than 1%" myth? It came from a five-sentence letter to the editor in 1980; it was not rigorous research at all. And true experts, like Russell Portenoy, lost their way in this pharmaceutical-funded revolution. They were well-intentioned evangelists, and to spread the gospel of pain relief, they exaggerated efficacy and ignored risks. When the line between science and marketing is blurred by money, the public is always the victim.</p>
</details>

这三根支柱合在一起，形成了一个完美的闭环：一家公司用它创造的“科学”，收买了一批专家，说服了懈怠的监管者，最终把一个谎言变成了全美国医生的标准操作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">These three pillars combined to form a perfect closed loop: a company used its self-created "science," bought off a group of experts, convinced lax regulators, and ultimately turned a lie into standard practice for doctors across America.</p>
</details>

2007年那笔罚款根本没有动摇这个帝国的根基。2007年的审判并不是这个故事的结局，恰恰相反，它是另一个地狱的开始。普渡制药为了应对诉讼和监管，终于在2010年推出了那个无法被碾碎的新配方奥施康定——这正是范泽医生在10年前就恳求他们做的事情。太晚了。到了2010年，普渡已经在美国培养出数百万名阿片类药物的成瘾者。当这些人突然发现他们无法再从奥施康定中获得快感时，他们会怎么做？他们戒掉了吗？不，他们转向了更便宜、更容易获得的替代品——海洛因。而当毒贩们发现海洛因不够劲时，他们开始混入更强效的合成阿片——**芬太尼**（Fentanyl: 一种比海洛因强效得多的合成阿片类药物）。普渡制药点燃了这场火灾，而芬太尼则是泼在火上的汽油。这场人造的瘟疫至今仍在肆虐。

<p class="english-text">The 2007 fine did not shake the empire's foundations at all. The 2007 trial was not the end of the story; on the contrary, it was the beginning of another hell. To cope with lawsuits and regulations, Purdue Pharma finally launched the new crush-resistant OxyContin formula in 2010—exactly what Dr. Van Zee had pleaded with them to do 10 years earlier. It was too late. By 2010, Purdue had cultivated millions of opioid addicts in the United States. When these people suddenly found they could no longer get a high from OxyContin, what would they do? Did they quit? No, they turned to cheaper, more readily available alternatives—heroin. And when drug dealers found heroin wasn't strong enough, they started mixing in even more potent synthetic opioids—fentanyl. Purdue Pharma ignited this fire, and fentanyl was the gasoline poured on it. This man-made plague continues to rage today.</p>

这个故事给我们留下了什么呢？它告诉我们，善意可以被利用。为病人止痛这个崇高的目标，被扭曲成了无差别开药的商业行为。它告诉我们监管是脆弱的，面对强大的政治游说和旋转门的诱惑，监管机构多么容易失手。它还告诉我们真相是需要捍卫的。如果没有像阿尔特·范泽、贝斯·戴维斯、劳拉·内格尔，以及那两位偏执的检察官兰迪·拉姆塞耶和里克·蒙卡斯尔，如果没有他们坚持对抗这个价值数十亿的帝国，我们甚至永远不会知道1999年那些关于吸食和街头价值的内部备忘录。

<p class="english-text">What does this story leave us with? It tells us that good intentions can be exploited. The noble goal of relieving patients' pain was twisted into indiscriminate prescribing for commercial gain. It tells us that regulation is fragile, how easily regulatory bodies can fail in the face of powerful political lobbying and the allure of the revolving door. It also tells us that truth needs to be defended. Without people like Art Van Zee, Beth Davies, Laura Nagel, and those two tenacious prosecutors, Randy Ramseyer and Rick Mountcastle—without their persistence in fighting this billion-dollar empire—we would never even know about those 1999 internal memos regarding snorting and street value.</p>
