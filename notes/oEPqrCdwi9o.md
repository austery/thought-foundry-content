### AI泡沫疑云：华尔街的担忧与硅谷的豪赌

**Natalie:** 大家好，我是《纽约时报》的娜塔莉·基特罗夫，这里是《The Daily》节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitroof. This is The Daily.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 经过多年对**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）热潮的乐观情绪高涨和巨额投资，最近几周，华尔街开始认真质疑这种乐观情绪是否被夸大了，以及我们是否正处于一个可能很快破裂的泡沫中。然而，尽管有这些担忧，硅谷却加倍投入，对其投入数百亿美元的技术表现出十足的信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After years of soaring optimism and massive investment in the AI boom, in recent weeks, Wall Street has begun to seriously question whether that optimism was overblown and whether we're actually in a bubble that may soon pop. And yet, despite all that hand ringing, Silicon Valley has only doubled down, projecting total confidence about the hundreds of billions of dollars it's pouring into the technology.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 今天，我的同事凯德·梅茨将解释原因：为什么科技公司如此狂热地相信AI，为什么他们愿意冒巨大风险来实现其承诺，以及这场豪赌是否可能适得其反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, my colleague Cade Mets explains why. Why tech companies believe so fervently in AI, why they're willing to take huge risks to deliver on its promise, and whether that bet could backfire.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 今天是11月20日星期四。凯德，华尔街、投资者、硅谷甚至华盛顿的讨论似乎已经从“我们是否处于AI泡沫中”转变为普遍认为“我们可能确实处于某种泡沫中”。然而，你从硅谷观察到的那些公司仍在继续投入巨额资金。那么，请你解释一下，他们花这么多钱的理由是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's Thursday, November 20th. Kade, it seems like the conversation on Wall Street, among investors, in Silicon Valley, even in Washington these days, has gone from whether we're in an AI bubble to the general sense that yes, we probably are in some sort of a bubble. And yet the companies that you cover from your perch in Silicon Valley, they're continuing to spend huge amounts of cash on this. So explain to us what is their justification for spending all this money.</p>
</details>

### AI繁荣的驱动力与高昂成本

**Cade:** 嗯，在**ChatGPT**（OpenAI推出的一款基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人）问世三年后，这款真正开启了AI热潮的OpenAI聊天机器人，显然是一项强大且在某些方面具有变革性的技术。它不仅能以新的方式搜索互联网，还能帮助人们更快、更高效地完成特定任务。你看到企业正在采用能够转录会议的服务，在医疗保健领域也有其他应用。这项技术已经改变了我们的生活和工作方式，而这些公司——这很符合硅谷的经典风格——则看到了更宏大的变革即将到来。这些高管、这些行业巨头，他们不仅着眼于今天可能实现什么，更着眼于他们认为这项技术未来将能做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, 3 years after the arrival of chat GPT, the open AI chatbot that really started this AI boom, this is clearly a powerful and in some ways transformative technology. It's used not only to search the internet in new ways. It can help people do specific tasks in a faster and more efficient way than they did in the past. You see businesses adopting services that can transcribe meetings. You see other applications in healthcare. There are ways that this technology is already changing the way we live and the way we work and these companies and this is classic Silicon Valley see much bigger transformations on the horizon. These are people, executives, these titans of industry are looking not just at what is possible today, but what they think this technology will do in the future.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 你的意思是，要实现那个未来，建设成本会非常高昂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the idea is that that future it's going to be really expensive to build.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 嗯，从根本上说，这项技术的建设成本是惊人的，即使对于在科技行业摸爬滚打了几十年的人来说，这笔钱也令人难以置信。仅OpenAI一家公司就表示，它将在美国投入5000亿美元建设数据中心来驱动这些技术。让我们停下来思考一下这意味着什么。今天的5000亿美元可以资助大约15个曼哈顿计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, fundamentally, this technology is expensive to build. It's a mindbogling amount of money even for people who have spent decades in the tech industry. Open AI alone has said it's going to spend $500 billion dollar on data centers in the United States alone to drive these technologies. Let's stop for a second and think about what that means. $500 billion in today's money could fund about 15 Manhattan projects.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 它可以资助两次阿波罗计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It could fund the Apollo program two times over.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 那个把人类送上太空的计划。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The program that sent humans to space. Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 没错。那还只是OpenAI一家初创公司用于驱动AI的资金。总而言之，如果你看看全球范围内的支出，而不仅仅是美国，我们谈论的是近3万亿美元。对于一项具有变革性但很多方面仍处于**投机阶段**（speculative: 指投资或商业活动具有高度不确定性和风险，收益依赖于未来事件的发生）的技术来说，这是一笔巨额资金。这意味着他们所预见的未来是如此宏大。在许多情况下，他们相信自己正在构建硅谷所称的**通用人工智能**（Artificial General Intelligence: 简称AGI，指能够执行人类大脑所能完成的任何智力任务的机器）。一台能够完成人类大脑所能做的一切的机器。我们能暂停一下吗？我想请你为我定义一下这个术语。通用人工智能。我们经常听到它，也在节目中谈论过。它似乎有点难以理解。凯德，它到底意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exactly. And that's just the money to drive AI for a single startup, Open AI. All told, if you look at what is being spent across the globe, not just the US, we're talking about nearly $3 trillion. That's an awful lot of money for a technology that is transformative but is in many ways still speculative. Meaning what they see in the future is so big. They in many cases believe they're building what is called in the valley artificial general intelligence. A machine that can do anything the human brain can do. Can we just pause? I I want you to just define this term for me. Artificial general intelligence. We hear it a lot. We've talked about it on the show. It seems kind of hard to get your head around. Like what does it mean actually, Kate?</p>
</details>

### AGI的愿景与风险

**Cade:** 它是指一台能够完成你我日常所做的所有具有经济价值工作的机器的简称。他们本质上是想取代所有人类工人。他们想给世界一种可以胜任任何工作的技术。理论上，这值得所有这些开销。但值得一提的是，我们不知道如何实现这样的目标。这是一个崇高的目标。但许多硅谷高管仍然坚定不移。Meta的首席执行官马克·扎克伯格说：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's shorthand for a machine that can do all of the economically valuable work that people like you and I do on a daily basis. They want to essentially replace all human workers. They want to give the world a technology that can do any job. That in theory is worth all this spending. But it's worth saying that we don't know how to get to such a goal. That is a lofty thing to reach for. But so many Silicon Valley executives remain undeterred. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</p>
</details>

**Mark Zuckerberg:** 我猜，在未来12到18个月的某个时候，我们将达到这样一个点，即这些努力的大部分代码将由AI编写。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would guess that like sometime in the next 12 to 18 months, we'll reach the point where like most of the code that's going towards these efforts is written by AI.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 英伟达的首席执行官黄仁勋说：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen Wang, the CEO of Nvidia.</p>
</details>

**Jensen Huang:** 如果有一件事我鼓励大家去做，那就是立刻找一个AI导师。我们将成为超人，因为我们拥有超级AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If there's one thing that I would encourage everybody to do is to go get yourself an AI tutor right away. We're going to become superhumans because we have super AIs.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 他们都在论证这种支出是合理的。这种态度的典型代表是OpenAI的首席执行官萨姆·奥特曼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are all making the case that this spending makes sense. The poster child of this attitude is Sam Alman, CEO of Open AAI.</p>
</details>

**Sam Altman:** 我不常想成为一家上市公司，但少数几次吸引我的情况是，当那些人写出这些荒谬的言论，说OpenAI即将倒闭，或者诸如此类的时候。我很想告诉他们，他们可以直接做空股票，我很乐意看到他们因此蒙受损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous OpenAI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 他告诉世界其他地方，做空他的公司风险自负，并且他继续炫耀公司的支出。他与整个行业都孤注一掷，但他们承诺的东西尚未在承诺的时间表内兑现。那么，再次解释一下，如果事情还没有成功，为什么他们还要在这件事上投入更多精力？显然，他们不是想把钱扔进垃圾桶，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He has told the rest of the world to bet against his company at their own risk and he continues to flaunt the company's spending. He and the rest of the industry are all in, but what they promised hasn't been delivered on the timeline that they promised. So again, just explain why they're still going even harder at this thing if it isn't panning out yet. Obviously, they aren't trying to throw money in the trash, right?</p>
</details>

### “错失恐惧症”与历史教训

**Cade:** 你知道**错失恐惧症**（FOMO: Fear of Missing Out，指害怕错过机会的心理）这个概念吗？这在很大程度上是驱动这一切的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you know about the concept of FOMO, fear of missing out? That's a lot of what is driving this.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 我当然知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do I ever?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 没有人想错过这可能是有史以来最具变革性的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No one wants to miss out on what could be the most transformative technology the world has ever seen.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 如果你不想错过，你就必须现在下注。这些数据中心不仅昂贵，而且建造需要很长时间。因此，几乎从定义上讲，你必须对几年后的事情下注。但现在投入的资金与几年后可能实现的目标之间可能存在脱节。你的意思是，这些公司对实现通用人工智能这种**登月计划**（moonshot: 指一项极具野心、风险高但若成功将带来巨大突破的项目）进行大规模豪赌的潜在好处是，你可能会成为那个成功登月的公司。但缺点是，如果这些公司错了怎么办？如果根本没有登月成功怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you don't want to miss out on that, you have to make your bet now. these data centers, not only are they expensive, they take a long time to build. And so almost by definition, you have to make a bet on something that's years down the road. But there may be a disconnect between the money that's being spent now and what is possible just a few years down the road. What you're saying is that the upside for these companies of taking this massive gamble on what is essentially, as you've described it, a moonshot of reaching artificial general intelligence is that you might be the company that lands on the moon. The downside though is what if these companies are wrong? What if there is no moon landing?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 如果没有登月成功怎么办？或者如果只有一家公司登月成功怎么办？或者只有两家公司成功，而其他公司都被淘汰了怎么办？在这种情况下，即使有人赢了，很多人也会输。OpenAI的首席执行官萨姆·奥特曼在今年夏天我在旧金山参加的一次晚宴上就说过类似的话。他反问：“我们是否正处于一个投资者整体上对AI过于兴奋的阶段？”他认为答案是肯定的。他承认，这些支出在某种程度上是不理性的。他还说，在这种情况下会有输家。这次晚宴的消息传遍了全国乃至全世界，很多人开始使用“泡沫”这个词。当我与硅谷的人、金融分析师和科技历史学家谈论我们正在经历的这个时刻时，他们经常会回溯到90年代末和2000年代初的**互联网泡沫**（dot-com bubble），当时早期的互联网技术展现出巨大的前景，硅谷开始投入巨额资金。好的，让我们谈谈互联网泡沫，特别是它与我们现在所处的AI时代有什么不同和相似之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What if there's no moon landing? Or what if only one company lands on the moon? or what if only two uh land there and the rest are left hanging. This is a situation where even if somebody wins, a lot of people are going to lose. Uh Sam Alman, the chief executive of OpenAI, said as much during a dinner I attended here in San Francisco this summer. He said rhetorically, "Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over excited about AI?" In my opinion, he said yes. He acknowledged that a lot of this spending was at least in some ways irrational. And he said that there would be losers in this scenario. After this dinner which made headlines across the country and across the world, a lot of people started using the word bubble. And when I talk to people here in Silicon Valley and financial analysts and tech historians about this moment we're living through, what they often point back to is the dot bubble of the late 90s and 2000s when early internet technologies showed enormous promise and the valley started to invest enormous amounts of money in it. Okay, let's talk about the.com bubble and and specifically what's different and what's similar to the moment that we're in now with AI.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 嗯，对于经历过那个泡沫的人来说，他们通常会想到大量初创公司被创建并上市，即使它们几乎没有商业模式，更不用说收入了，却拥有巨大的估值。然后当市场崩溃时，当人们认为支出超出了可能实现的范围时，许多公司倒闭了。像Cosmo这样直接送货上门的公司，Pets.com这样送宠物食品的公司。这些都是著名的例子，人们通常会想到这些。但在这些表象之下，这正是与今天真正相似的地方，当这些初创公司建立起来时，还有其他公司正在建设驱动互联网所需的基础设施，它们投入巨额资金铺设光纤电缆，将所有信息通过互联网传输到我们的机器上。当泡沫破裂时，许多这些公司破产了。这通常是人们回顾互联网泡沫时所想到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, for people who live through the bubble, what they often think of is an enormous number of startups that were created and that went public and had huge valuations even though they had little or no business model, certainly no revenues. And then when the market crashed, when people decided that the spending was getting ahead of what was possible, a lot of those companies went out of business. Companies like Cosmo that delivered goods straight to your door, Pets.com, which sent you pet food. There are famous examples of this, and that's often what people think of. But underneath that, and this is where the analogy really holds up to today, as those startups were being built, there were other companies that were building the infrastructure needed to drive the internet, that were spending enormous amounts of money to lay the fiber optic cable that would carry all that information across the internet to our machines. when the bubble burst, a lot of those companies went bankrupt. And that's often what people are thinking about uh as they look back at the dotcom bubble.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 你的意思是，人们担心那些正在为AI革命铺设光纤的公司，也就是那些容纳所有这些芯片的数据中心，这些公司可能会倒闭。这就是人们的担忧。就像那时一样，公司投入巨额资金建设驱动这一切所需的基础设施。不同之处在于，他们今天投入的资金比25年前多得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meaning there's a fear that the companies that are laying the fiber optics of the AI revolution, which is, you know, the analogy would say these data centers that are housing all of these chips, that those companies could go under. That's the fear. Just like then you have companies spending enormous amounts of money on the infrastructure needed to drive on this. The difference is they are spending a lot more today than they did 25 years ago.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 但凯德，我惊讶于这样一个事实：显然互联网泡沫破裂了，但有很多赢家，对吧？我的意思是，正如你所说，我们仍然有很多诞生于那个时代的公司。那么，这给我们带来了什么启示呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I'm struck by the fact Kate that obviously the dot bubble it burst but there were many many winners right. I mean, we still have, as you said, a lot of these companies that were born in that era. So, what's the takeaway there?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 这是一个很好的观点。许多那些倒闭的初创公司所承诺的应用，今天已成为我们日常生活的一部分。亚马逊为我们送宠物食品。其他公司为我们提供实时互联网视频。许多当时承诺的东西我们今天都拥有了，而且我们正在使用当时铺设的光纤电缆，它在那里休眠了多年，我们现在正在 reaping the benefits。只是它没有像许多人想象的那么快发生。所以对于硅谷来说，那个泡沫的教训似乎很容易就是：当然，在这种情况下有些人会输，但从广义上讲，对互联网的押注是值得的。它得到了回报，所以就下注吧。我采访的很多人都这么说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a great point. So many of the applications that were promised by all those startups that went out of business are part of our daily lives today. Amazon delivers our pet food. Other companies deliver our real time internet video. So many of the things that were promised then we have today and we're actually using that fiber optic cable that was laid and it sat there dormant for many years and we are now reaping the benefits. It's just that it didn't happen as quickly as a lot of people thought. So for Silicon Valley, it sounds like the lesson of that bubble could very easily be, sure, some people lose in a situation like that, but broadly the bet on the internet was worth it. It paid off, so take the bet. So many people I talked to say that very thing.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 他们指出，最终，尽管泡沫破裂，但一切最终都如承诺般实现。他们以此类比，这就是他们今天进行巨额押注的原因。他们承认可能会有输家，就像萨姆·奥特曼在晚宴上所说的那样，但他们认为最终会成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They point out that in the end, despite the bubble bursting, eventually everything turned out as promised. They make that analogy and that's why they're making these enormous bets today. They acknowledge there might be losers, as Sam Alman did during that dinner, but they think it's going to work out in the end.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 然而，硅谷的一些人以及纽约的金融分析师们担心的是，一些公司承担的风险远超过去。如果真是这样，并且泡沫再次破裂，其后果可能会严重得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The concern however among some in the valley and some in New York where the financial analysts are is that the risk being taken on by some companies is far larger than in the past. And if that's the case and the bubble bursts again, the fallout could be far more significant.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 稍后回来。好的，凯德，让我们谈谈你在休息前提到的可怕事情，即这里的风险可能要大得多。跟我说说这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll be right back. Okay, Cade, let's get into the scary thing that you brought up before the break, that the risks here could be much more significant. Talk to me about that.</p>
</details>

### 债务风险与系统性影响

**Cade:** 嗯，当我与各种人讨论这个问题时，包括技术专家和金融分析师，另一个经常被提及的是2000年代后期的**房地产泡沫**（housing bubble），那是一个更严重的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, as I discuss this with all sorts of people, including technologists, but also financial analysts, the other thing that often comes up is the housing bubble of the late 2000s, which was a much more serious thing.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 人们普遍认为我们目前没有经历那种情况。我们不要走那么远。话虽如此，他们确实指出，我们现在看到的一些因素在当时也存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People generally agree that this is not what we're going through at the moment. Let's not go that far. That said, they do point out that there are elements that we're seeing now that were also present then.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 那些因素是什么？是什么让他们担忧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are those elements? What what's worrying them?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 基本上，这与为建设这些数据中心而承担的巨额债务有关，即为建设它们而借入的巨额资金。当你审视这些债务时，很难知道到底有多少，以及谁持有这些债务。如果这些债务分散在许多公司之间，那么你就会面临更大的**系统性风险**（systemic risk: 指一个机构的失败可能引发整个金融系统或经济体系崩溃的风险）。你面临着可能损害经济其他部分的更大风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basically, this is about the enormous amount of debt that is being taken on to build these data centers, the enormous amount of money that's being borrowed to build them. And as you look at that debt, it's hard to know how much there is and who is holding the debt. If that debt is spread across a lot of companies, then you have more systemic risk. You have greater risk that could damage the rest of the economy.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 对吧？这就是导致2008年金融危机如此糟糕的原因。房地产市场下积累的巨额债务。但这些科技公司是世界上最富有的公司之一。那么，他们为什么用债务来资助AI热潮呢？为什么会这样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? That was the thing that made the 2008 crash so bad. the amount of debt that had piled up under the housing market. But these tech companies, they're some of the richest corporations in the world. So why are they financing the AI boom with debt? Why is that happening?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 嗯，有些公司没有为此承担债务。像Google、Microsoft和Meta这样的公司每年都有数十亿美元的收入。他们有能力为这些巨型数据中心支付现金。但对AI的兴趣如此之大。对这些数据中心产生的计算能力的需求如此之大，以至于我们看到各种其他公司在没有足够资金的情况下建造这些巨型设施。即使是像云计算巨头Oracle这样相对较大的公司，也不得不举债建设数据中心。然后还有许多大多数人从未听说过的小公司，比如Cororeweave、Lambda和Nebus。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, some companies are not taking on debt to do this. Some companies like Google and Microsoft and Meta pull in billions of dollars in revenue every year. They can afford to essentially pay cash for these giant data centers. But there's so much interest in AI. There's so much demand for the computing power that comes out of these data centers that we're seeing all sorts of other companies build these giant facilities when they don't have the money to do it. Even relatively big companies like Oracle, the cloud computing giant, is having to take on debt to build data centers. And then you have all these smaller companies that most people on Earth have never heard of with names like Cororeweave, Lambda, and Nebus.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 确实从未听说过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Definitely never heard of them.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 他们肯定在为此承担债务。总部位于纽约-新泽西地区的Cororeweave公司告诉金融分析师，他们每建设50亿美元的数据中心基础设施，就必须承担近30亿美元的债务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are certainly taking on debt to do this. Cororeweave, a company based in the New York, New Jersey area, has told financial analysts that for every $5 billion in data center infrastructure they build, they have to take on almost $3 billion in debt.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whoa.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 最终，他们认为他们将获得足够的收入来偿还这些债务。但归根结底，如果AI技术无法带来足够的资金，那么你就无法偿还这些债务，那时问题就来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">In the end, they think that they will pull in the revenues needed to pay back those debts. But ultimately, if the AI technology does not pull in the money, then you can't repay those debts, and that's when you have a problem.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 明白了。凯德，你说的另一件事也让我很震惊，那就是当我们审视这里的债务时，实际上很难知道到底有多少。这是怎么回事？为什么我们不知道呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got it. And I was struck by something else that you said, Kade, which is that when you look at the debt here, it's actually hard to know how much of it there is. What's that about? Why Why don't we know that?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 嗯，有些债务是以你可能想象的方式承担的。这些公司去找银行借钱，你清楚地知道谁借出了钱，谁借了钱，金额是多少。但越来越多地，我们看到其他交易，很难看到债务在哪里以及有多少。很多资金是由所谓的**私人信贷机构**（private credit institutions: 指非银行金融机构向企业提供贷款，通常不公开披露）借出的。从法律上讲，你无法看到这些公司的内部情况。另一件正在发生的事情是，你看到这些证券的兴起。他们称之为**资产支持证券**（asset-backed securities: 简称ABS，指将缺乏流动性但有未来现金流的资产打包，通过证券化方式出售给投资者）。这在房地产泡沫期间出现过，人们可能对此很熟悉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, some of the debt is taken on in the way you might think. These companies go to a bank and they borrow the money and you know exactly who lent it, who borrowed it, how much it is. But increasingly, we're seeing other deals where it's hard to see where the debt is and how much of it there is. A lot of the money is being lent by what are called private credit institutions. legally you can't see inside these companies. The other thing that's happening is you're seeing the rise of these securities. They call them assetbacked securities. Something that came up during the housing bubble that people may be familiar with.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 以一种不太好的方式让人回想起过去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reminiscent in a not great way.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 这些证券可以买卖和交易。这意味着你最终不知道谁持有这些债务。你的意思是，存在这样一种想法，即所有这些债务中可能存在真正的系统性风险，系统中的杠杆很难确定。因此，我们目前无法真正知道我们所有人可能面临的风险有多大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">These securities can be bought and sold and traded. And that means you don't know in the end who is holding the debt. You're saying there's this idea, right, that there could be real systemic risk baked into all this debt, that the leverage in the system is just hard to pin down. And so, we really can't actually know at this point how exposed we all might be to it.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 没错。关键词是“可能”。可能存在问题。很难知道。

<p class="english-text">That's right. The key word there is could. There could be a problem. It's hard to know,</p>

**Natalie:** 对吧？这显然是一个非常模糊的问题，但我们是否能明确知道系统中债务的规模有多大？我们谈论的是多大的规模？

<details>

<p class="english-text">right? It's obviously a really murky thing, but is there anything that we know definitively about the magnitude of the debt in the system? About how big we're talking?</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 正如我之前所说，预计全球公司将在这类数据中心上花费近3万亿美元。摩根士丹利的分析师预计，其中约三分之一将是债务。也就是1万亿美元。

<p class="english-text">As I said earlier, it's projected that companies across the world will spend nearly $3 trillion on these data centers. Analysts at Morgan Stanley project that about a third of that will be debt. $1 trillion.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 哇。从你所说的来看，听起来现在很难知道我们可能正处于什么样的泡沫中，以及它可能有多糟糕或不糟糕。我的意思是，有互联网泡沫的例子，对吧，它造成了影响，但听起来相对可控，并产生了所有这些赢家。然后还有更危险的版本，更接近我们在房地产危机期间看到的一些因素，这可能会产生更广泛的影响。由于所有这些未知因素，我们无法真正判断。是这样吗？

<p class="english-text">Wow. Just pulling back from what you're saying, it sounds like it's actually quite hard to know what kind of bubble we may be in right now and how bad or not bad it may be. I mean, there's the dot example, right, which had fallout, but it sounds like was relatively contained and produced all these winners. And then there's the much riskier version of things closer to elements of things that we saw during the housing crisis that could have a much broader effect. And because of all that's unknowable in all this, we can't really tell. Is that right?</p>

### 未来的不确定性与人类的考量

**Cade:** 我们不能。如果事情真的破裂，甚至很难知道何时会发生。像萨姆·奥特曼和Google母公司Alphabet的首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊这样的人都承认这种不确定性。你知道，我一直在思考这一切中的讽刺之处，那就是在某些方面，对投资AI热潮的公司来说，最坏的情况是他们从未真正达到AGI，即计算机大规模取代人类工人，AI变得像人脑一样智能，或者那真的需要很长时间才能实现。但我认为我们很多人类工人可能会将硅谷的这种最坏情况视为一种解脱。比如，人们普遍会很高兴听到我们不会在明天就被大规模取代。我想知道你如何看待这种紧张关系，即他们正在构建的未来可能并不是很多人真正想要的未来。

<p class="english-text">We can't. If things do burst, it's hard to even know when that might happen. And people like Sam Alman and Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Alphabet, the Google parent company, have acknowledged this uncertainty. You know, there's this irony that I've been thinking about in all this, which is that in some ways, the worst case scenario for the companies that are invested in the AI boom, right, is that they never actually reach AGI, that point where computers replace human workers on mass, where AI becomes as smart as the human brain, or that that really takes a very long time. But I think there's a lot of us human workers who might actually view that worst case scenario for Silicon Valley as a relief. Like people might be happy generally to hear that we aren't going to be replaced on mass tomorrow. And I wonder what you make of that tension, the fact that the future that they're building toward here may not actually be a future that all that many people actually want.</p>

**Cade:** 这是一个很好的观点。当我们思考这个时刻时，我们需要认识到这项技术的现实。它在许多方面都非常强大。医疗保健可能是最重要的例子，药物发现，我们正朝着一些令人惊叹的事情迈进。与此同时，我们也正朝着一些令人担忧的事情迈进。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's a great point. As we think about this moment, we need to realize the realities of this technology. It is very powerful in many ways. healthc care being perhaps the prime example, drug discovery, we are on the path towards some amazing things. At the same time, we're on the path towards some things that are concerning.</p>
</details>

**Cade:** 如果事情没有按照硅谷所说的速度发展，这可能会给整个经济带来问题，正如我们所讨论的。但它可能会给我们所需的时间，继续思考悬在这项技术和我们未来之上的所有重大问题。它可能会给我们时间为那个未来做准备。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If things don't progress at the pace that Silicon Valley says, this could cause problems across the larger economy. as we talked about, but it might give us the time we need to continue to think about all the big questions that hang over this technology and that hang over our future. It might give us time to prepare for that future.</p>

### Nvidia最新财报与市场情绪

**Natalie:** 周三下午，Nvidia宣布，在最近一个季度，其利润达到319亿美元，同比增长65%，并报告了创纪录的销售额。这一消息提振了其在盘后交易中的股价，并被视为华尔街对AI的紧张情绪至少暂时得到缓解的迹象。

<p class="english-text">On Wednesday afternoon, Nvidia announced that in the most recent quarter, its profit was $ 31.9 billion, up 65% from a year ago. And it reported record sales. The news buoyed its shares in aftermarket trading and was seen as a sign the jitters on Wall Street over AI had been calmed, at least for now.</p>

### 其他新闻简报

**Natalie:** 稍后回来。以下是您今天还应该知道的其他消息。周三，唐纳德·特朗普总统在社交媒体上宣布，他已签署立法，要求司法部在30天内公布其关于杰弗里·爱泼斯坦的档案。但特朗普的签名并不能保证所有档案都会被公布。该法案包含重要的例外条款，其中包括一项规定，如果记录危及正在进行的联邦调查，则可以予以保留。

<p class="english-text">We'll be right back. Here's what else you should know today. On Wednesday, President Trump announced on social media that he'd signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. But Trump's signature doesn't guarantee the release of all the files. The bill contains significant exceptions, including a provision that allows records to be withheld if they jeopardize an active federal investigation.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 上周，特朗普要求司法部对档案中提到的民主党人展开调查，司法部长帕姆·邦迪表示她已经启动了调查。这可能会给政府提供另一个扣留文件的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last week, Trump demanded that the Justice Department launch an investigation into Democrats mentioned in some of the files, and Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd started one. That could give the administration another reason to withhold documents.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 在周三一场引人注目的听证会上，一名联邦法官严厉质问了起诉前联邦调查局局长詹姆斯·科米案的政府检察官，揭示了他们案件中的严重漏洞。在法官的质问下，由特朗普亲自挑选负责此案的美国检察官林赛·哈利根承认，在四名陪审员签署起诉书之前，她从未将科米起诉书的第二个也是最终版本提交给全体大陪审团。科米的律师立即抓住了这一不规范之处，称其足以完全驳回此案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in a remarkable hearing on Wednesday, a federal judge grilled government prosecutors pursuing charges against former FBI director James Comey, revealing serious vulnerabilities in their case. In response to the judge's questioning, Lindseay Halligan, the US attorney handpicked by Trump to bring the case, admitted she'd never shown the second and final version of the Comey indictment to the full grand jury before the four person signed the charging document.</p>
</details>

**Natalie:** 法官没有立即就科米关于此案是特朗普报复行为的说法作出裁决，但他似乎倾向于这个方向，并倾向于完全驳回指控。这次驳回将是特朗普司法部在一次从一开始就显得草率的起诉中的一次羞辱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Comey's lawyers immediately seized on that irregularity, saying it justified dismissing the case entirely. The judge didn't immediately rule on Comey's claim that the case had been filed as an act of retribution by Trump, but he seemed to be leaning in that direction and in favor of throwing out the charges altogether. The dismissal would be a humiliation for Trump's Justice Department in a prosecution that's appeared to be slap dash from its very inception.</p>
