### 美联储降息决策背后的地方洞察

美联储（Federal Reserve）的降息问题并非“是否”，而是“降多少”。答案是，如预期般降息了四分之一个百分点，但美联储官员也预计今年10月和12月还会再降息两次。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The question is not if they'll cut interest rates. The question is by how much. The answer to your question, John, is a quarter percentage point cut as expected, but Fed officials also see two more cuts this year in October and December.</p>
</details>

9月17日星期三，联邦公开市场委员会（**Federal Open Market Committee**, FOMC: 美联储内部负责制定货币政策的机构）刚刚结束了在华盛顿特区举行的最新会议。经过两天的分析、辩论和预测，委员会投票决定降息25个基点（**basis points**, bps: 利率和债券收益率的计量单位，1个基点等于0.01%）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's Wednesday, September 17th. The Federal Open Market Committee has just wrapped up their most recent meeting in Washington DC. And after two days of analyzing and debating and forecasting, the committee voted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>
</details>

美联储主席表示，她仍坚定不移地致力于实现美联储的双重使命（**dual mandate**: 美联储的两大政策目标，即最大化就业和稳定物价），以造福美国人民。尽管失业率保持在低位，但已略有上升，就业增长也已放缓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up. Job gains have slowed and</p>
</details>

这是美联储一年多来的首次降息，此举是在数月辩论之后做出的。一方面，劳动力市场正在放缓；但另一方面，我们仍在努力弄清关税对物价的影响，而且消费者支出依然强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's the first time the Fed has cut in over a year. move coming after months of debate. And on the one hand, the labor market is slowing, but on the other hand, we're still trying to figure out what the impact of the tariffs is on prices and consumer spending is still going strong,</p>
</details>

你可以为更大幅度的降息提出令人信服的理由，但你也可以为此时甚至提高基准利率提出理由。我们很少遇到这种结果如此具有争议性的美联储会议。所以，我们必须问，中央银行究竟是如何做出降息决定的？为了回答这个问题，让我们回到六周前，即八月初，然后向北行进。事实上，我们将向北行进3000英里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? You could make a convincing case for deeper cuts, but you could also make a case for even raising benchmark rates at this point. And we don't tend to get a lot of these types of Fed meetings where the outcome is, you know, so debatable. So, we have to ask, how did the central bank actually make the decision to cut? To do that, let's back up six weeks to the beginning of August and head north. In fact, we are going 3,000 m north.</p>

### 玛丽·戴利的阿拉斯加之行

旧金山联邦储备银行（**Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**: 美国联邦储备系统下辖的12家地区性联邦储备银行之一）行长玛丽·戴利（Mary Daly）表示，她昨天又添置了一些用于飞蝇钓的鱼饵。她喜欢钓鱼，而这些鱼饵对她来说有特殊意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I added to my collection of flies for fly fishing yesterday. Oh, I I am slightly obsessed with fishing lures. I don't even fish. I I don't know why. I just I like to fish. That's Mary Dailyaly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. So, here's why I get these flies. I go to places all over that have fly fishing, and then I buy a fly that's specific to their area to remind you. It's sort of uh geeky, but it reminds me that everybody fishes, but that you have to have a local knowledge to fish. Well,</p>
</details>

戴利解释说，她去各地有飞蝇钓的地方，然后购买当地特有的鱼饵作为纪念。这有点“极客”，但它提醒她，虽然每个人都可以钓鱼，但你需要有当地知识才能钓好。这就像了解经济一样，你可以理解它，但除非你了解当地情况，否则你无法真正掌握它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah. You have to have like the fly that's in season for that particular location. And it kind of is why you go to the places to visit to learn more about the economy. You sort of have to you can understand it but you don't know it until you have the locality. So you don't do it well.</p>
</details>

戴利负责美联储的第12区，这是最大的一个区，包括美国最西部的九个州，以及最北部的“最后的边疆”、“伟大的土地”、“淘金州”——阿拉斯加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Daily oversees the 12th district of the Fed. It's the largest of the districts and includes the nine most western US states plus the most northern the last frontier, the great land, the sourdough state. I am talking about Alaska. Obviously,</p>
</details>

八月初，玛丽·戴利访问了阿拉斯加最大的城市和港口安克雷奇（Anchorage）。这实际上是她今年第三次访问该州，她此行肩负着一项特殊的使命。她正在进行一次“北方探险”，试图寻找答案，解答所有美联储官员和所有其他人目前都在努力解决的问题：美国经济到底发生了什么？它将走向何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in early August, Mary Daly visited Anchorage, the largest city and biggest port in Alaska. It was actually her third visit to the state this year. And she's on a mission of sorts. An expedition? Sure. She's on a northern expedition to try to find answers to the questions that everyone, all Fed officials, everyone else are trying to constantly puzzle out right now. What is going on with the US economy? Where is it headed? I've heard that everywhere we've gone that the city's under so much pressure and it's hard to What is your diagnosis about how this happened?</p>
</details>

那么，她看到了什么？这些观察在一个月后是如何影响美联储的降息决定的？在本期《Odd Lots》特别播客节目中，我们将跟随戴利巡视她的辖区，与当地商界领袖交谈，例如一家为石油工业生产零部件的工厂、机场以及港口本身，以更近距离地了解安克雷奇这个巨大的物流枢纽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what was she seeing and how did it actually inform the Fed's decision to cut rates a month later? On this special edition of the OddLotss podcast, we are going to follow along as Daily tours her district, speaking to local business leaders like a factory that makes parts for the oil industry and the airport and the port itself to try to get a closer look at the giant logistics hub that is the city of Anchorage.</p>
</details>

世界上每个城镇可能都喜欢将自己的居民描述为“坚韧不拔”，但这真的是我所去过的第一个地方，我觉得这可能真的如此。阿拉斯加人确实显得非常坚韧。他们必须如此才能在这里生存。我们确实生活在这片广阔荒野的边缘。事实上，我们了解到的一件事是，这里的人们喜欢将自己州的面积与能容纳多少个德克萨斯州进行比较。答案是2.5个德克萨斯州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, every town in the world, I think, probably likes to describe its residents as quote scrappy unquote. But this really is like the first place I've been where I think that might actually be true. People in Alaska really do seem scrappy. They have to be to get along up here. Uh we really are on the edge of this vast wilderness. In fact, one thing we learned is that people up here love to compare the size of their state to how many Texases it would fit in, which to be fair, Texans love to do that stuff as well. Yeah. Um, the answer is two and a half. By the way, Alaska is the size of two and a half Texases. Okay.</p>
</details>

每个人都知道阿拉斯加很大，但除非你亲自去过，否则很难真正体会它到底有多大。从最大的城市安克雷奇到首府朱诺（Juno），唯一的交通方式是两小时的飞机。如果你想从内陆的费尔班克斯（Fairbanks）运送物资到北坡的油田，那是一段10小时的车程，大部分是土路，路上只有一个加油站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, everyone knows Alaska is big, but until you visit, it's hard to really appreciate just how big. The only way to get from Anchorage, which is the largest city, to Juno, which is the capital, is a 2hour plane ride. And if you want to haul supplies from a place like Fairbanks, which is in the interior, to the oil fields on the North Slope, that is a 10-hour drive on what is mostly a dirt road with one gas station on the way.</p>
</details>

这里非常偏远，甚至没有铁路通往美国本土48州或加拿大。山脉基本上将该州的大片区域相互隔绝。但正如我们在访问期间了解到的，阿拉斯加仍在应对美国其他地区面临的所有相同问题，例如通货膨胀、失业、关税、住房短缺和物流堵塞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really isolated. Uh there's not even a railroad that takes you to the lower 48 or even to Canada. And there are mountains that basically cut off huge sections of the state from each other. But as we learned during our visit, Alaska is still dealing with all the same issues that the rest of the US faces. So things like inflation, unemployment, tariffs, housing shortages, logistical snarls.</p>
</details>

这就是玛丽来这里的原因。她试图通过观察这个至少目前是许多这些趋势“零点”的地方，来掌握更广泛的美国经济。她的目的是收集信息。所以，我们不仅收集各种可用的数据，还有历史和模型。我们拥有所有这些东西，然后我们进行对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's why Mary is here. I mean, to try to get a handle on the broader US economy by looking at a place that at least right now is sort of ground zero for a lot of these trends is to collect information. So we collect information not only on the wide array of data that are available and then we have history and models. We have all of those things and then we have conversations.</p>
</details>

今天，玛丽是安克雷奇经济发展公司（**Anchorage Economic Development Corporation**: 致力于促进安克雷奇地区经济增长和发展的组织）年度聚会的贵宾。市中心的德尼纳会议中心（Denina Convention Center）挤满了1500多名当地企业主、政治家和社区领袖。他们来这里交流、拓展人脉、谈论业务，并听取玛丽对经济现状的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today Mary is the guest of honor at the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation's annual gathering. The Denina Convention Center downtown is overflowing with more than 1500 local business owners, politicians, civic leaders. They're here to mingle, network, talk shop, and hear Mary's thoughts on where she thinks the economy stands.</p>
</details>

戴利强调，计算起重机数量作为前瞻性变量非常重要。她感谢所有曾回答过《褐皮书》（**Beige Book**: 美联储定期发布的经济状况报告，通过收集各地区商业联系人的信息来评估经济活动）问题或与他们会面的人。她提到《褐皮书》以前是米色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as well as counting the cranes as a future-looking variable is so important. So, I just want to thank everybody who's ever answered the beige book, who's ever met with us. If you like the beige book, we'll send you another one. It used to be beige, by the way.</p>
</details>

所以，这是这次考察的事实调查部分，因为玛丽在发表演讲，谈论她对经济的看法，但她也在向听她演讲的当地企业学习。她一直在听到的是，“不确定性”是当今的关键词。不确定性使得企业和家庭更难知道下一步该做什么，这使得我们作为政策制定者，作为联邦储备政策制定者，更难确切知道经济将如何演变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is the factf finding portion of the expedition because yes, Mary is giving a speech about what she's seeing in the economy, but she's also learning from the local businesses who are listening to her. And what I've been hearing is that the uncertainty is the word of the day. I guess it was on the bingo card. And uncertainty makes it harder for firms and households to know what they're doing next, which makes it harder for us as policy makers, Federal Reserve policy makers, to know exactly how the economy will evolve.</p>
</details>

玛丽今年不是委员会的投票成员，但作为储备银行行长，她仍然参加所有的联邦公开市场委员会会议，并在会上根据她目前在第12区经济中看到的情况，提出自己的评估和意见。因此，她的观点仍然有助于影响委员会的决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary isn't a voting member of the committee this year, but as a reserve bank president, she still participates in all the FOMC meetings where she offers her own assessments and opinions based on what she's seeing in the economy of the 12th district right now. And so her views still do help shape the committee's decision</p>
</details>

她和她的团队定期访问她辖区内的所有州。这样做的原因是，他们能够亲身了解人们特别在思考什么，他们看到的机会是什么，他们看到的挑战是什么，以及他们如何看待今天的经济。有一个有趣的统计数据，我们刚刚听到，人们对自己的处境感觉相当不错，但对经济却持悲观态度。我们需要了解原因。当企业展望未来时，他们看到了什么？企业正在就他们将在年底做什么做出决定。我们需要知道这些决定是什么。我们需要知道家庭的感受。他们是否感到手头拮据？他们是否觉得有足够的**可支配收入**（disposable income: 个人收入中扣除税收和强制性支出后可用于消费或储蓄的部分）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in all the states in my district on a regular basis as are my teams. And the reason for that is so that we can understand firsthand what you are in particularly thinking about, what you see as your opportunities, what you see as your challenges, but also how do you see the economy today? You know, there's an interesting statistic we just heard that people feel decently pretty good about their own situation, but pessimistic about the economy. Well, we we need to understand why. What are you seeing as you look out? Businesses are making decisions today about what they're going to do at the end of the year. We need to know what those are. We need to know what how households are feeling. Are they feeling strapped? Are they feeling like they have enough disposable income?</p>
</details>

仅凭数据，查看已发布的数据，而不是所有微观数据，你可以查看一百个系列，但你永远无法获得完整的图景。我们都听说过“数据依赖”这个词，美联储在做出决策时严重依赖每月发布的经济统计数据。但有时，你可以用实地观察到的情况来补充这些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the data alone, looking at the published data, not you know, all the micro data, you could look at a hundred series and you would never have the complete picture. I'm sure we've all heard the phrase data dependent and the Fed leans heavily on the volumes and volumes of economic statistics that get released every month when making its decisions. But sometimes you can augment that data with things you observe on the ground.</p>
</details>

就在阿拉斯加之行前几天，我们收到了一份就业报告，其中大幅下调了前几个月的就业数据。这是一个巨大的惊喜，对市场来说是一个重要的时刻，但这并没有真正让玛丽感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? So just a few days before the Alaska trip, we got a jobs report that heavily revised down the employment numbers from the earlier months. It was a big surprise, huge moment for the markets, but it didn't really surprise Mary.</p>
</details>

玛丽表示，周五的就业报告有趣之处在于，它更好地匹配了她一直听到的变化方向，而不是变化幅度。所以，对于你不知道是否真正准确的数据，一个校准工具就是你从人们那里听到的信息，因为人们不会告诉你，“我找工作感觉非常非常舒服”，结果却发现就业市场报告很糟糕。他们会告诉你，“天哪，外面看起来真令人担忧。”然后你得到一份就业报告，它看起来不像快速的就业增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what was interesting about the jobs report on Friday is it better matched in the direction of change, not in the magnitude. It better match what I've been hearing. And so a disciplining device for data that you don't know if they're really accurate, is what you hear from people because people do not tell you, I feel really, really comfortable getting a job only to find out that the job market report is bad. What they will tell you is, "Boy, it looks really worrisome out there." And then you get a jobs report that doesn't look like the rapid job growth.</p>
</details>

之前一个月的快速就业增长是她所说的“嗯，真的吗？我听到的不是这样。差距在哪里？”他们花了很多时间深入挖掘和剖析这个问题。但当就业市场报告被修正后，她觉得“好吧，这更有道理了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was the thing that was out of whack. The rapid job growth from the month before is what I said, "Well, really, that's not what I'm hearing. What's the gap?" And we spent a lot of time digging in and unpacking that. But then when the jobs market report got revised, I was like, "Okay, that makes more sense." Even</p>
</details>

### 关税、供应链与阿拉斯加的高生活成本

当然，就业并不是美联储唯一关心的事情。它的使命是低失业率和稳定的通货膨胀。而这些事情目前似乎正在逆向运行。通货膨胀率已经高于美联储2%的目标一段时间了。人们担心，随着特朗普政府实施的关税政策，物价将进一步上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course, jobs aren't the only thing the Fed cares about. Its mandate is low unemployment and stable inflation. And these things seem to be operating at cross currents right now. Inflation has been above the Fed's 2% target for a while. And the concern is that with tariffs coming in from the Trump administration, prices are just going to go up further.</p>
</details>

为了了解这里的风险，我们跟随玛丽来到了北方解决方案公司（Northern Solutions）的办公室。这是一家阿拉斯加公司，为石油工业生产零部件，这显然是该州的一项大业务，包括管道、套管、线轴和阀门等。正如你所能想象的，钢铁是许多这些产品的关键投入。自6月以来，从国外进口的钢铁和铝征收了高达50%的关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to understand the risk here, we're following Mary to the offices of Northern Solutions. It's an Alaskan company which makes components and parts for the oil industry which is obviously big business in the state. Yeah. All the pipes and casings and spools and valves and things like that. And as you can imagine, steel is a pretty key input for a lot of these products. Since June, there's been a whopping 50% tariff on steel and aluminum coming from abroad.</p>
</details>

北方解决方案公司这样的公司正在努力寻找应对这些新贸易限制的方法。这并不像简单地转向美国供应商那么容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if we compare 21 to today, it's cheaper. I see. If we compare today to 23 24, yeah, it's small. And companies like Northern Solutions are trying to figure out just how to navigate all these new trade restrictions. It's not as easy as just say switching to a US supplier.</p>
</details>

如果这样做，并且无法获得连续性，那么这就会带来成本。所以，当我们试图思考关税的影响，或者任何政府变化对你们行业的影响时，这真的很有帮助。关税平衡了市场，所以现在我可以选择美国钢厂或外国钢厂，支付相同的价格。但问题在于钢厂所服务的行业以及钢材的交货时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you do that and you can't get the continuity, well then that's a cost to you that not being back there. So it's a it's really helpful for us to think about when we try to think about the effects of tariffs or the effects of changes on any uh administration on your industry. Absolutely. I mean the the tariffs so the tariffs balanced it. So I can go to a US mill. I can go to a foreign mill and I'm going to pay the same price now with that tariff. But it's the industry that mill's geared to and the lead time of that steel that's the problem. Yeah.</p>
</details>

美国有很多小型钢厂，它们非常专注于某个特定行业。换句话说，并非所有钢材都是平等的。世界各地都有钢厂，但并非所有钢厂都能使用，因为它们的**材料测试报告**（MTRs: Material Test Reports，记录材料成分、物理性能等信息的文件）不符合要求，这与原产国无关，只与它们生产的质量有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And honestly, we we have a lot of small steel mills here in this country. A lot of small ones. They're very very specific to a certain industry. In other words, all steel isn't equal mills. So, there's mills all around the world. Steel mills all around the world. I can't use them all because of that, because of their MTRS. Not country of origin, just how well they do it.</p>
</details>

很多进入美国的钢管都是以“生管”的形式运入，然后在美国进行热处理。所以，材料测试报告是由美国的**热处理设施**（heat treat facility: 对金属材料进行加热和冷却处理以改变其物理和机械性能的工厂）生成的，现在它有51%是美国制造的，然后你再进行后续加工。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So we have a lot of steel that comes into the US tubing that that comes brought in as green tube that we heat treated in the US. So that MTR is generated from a US uh heat treat facility and now it's 51% American and then you go all the stuff on it. I see. So when we we talk about metals that I can use, they're all over the place, but I can't use them all.</p>
</details>

这是一个很好的例子，说明了玛丽的访问为何如此重要。这种信息是无法从经济数据发布中获得的。玛丽表示，她会利用这些信息。她举例说明了这些信息如何被利用：如果你思考我们有多大可能将所有生产从美国转移出去，或者如果今天我们把所有生产都放回去，全球钢铁市场有多大可能重新调整。你已经教会了我两件事：不是每个人都适合你的行业，你必须有特定的热处理策略才能使用这些材料，而且它们必须达到一定的质量。这意味着你没有许多人想象的开放市场。他们只会看制造商的数量，然后说：“哦，看，你可以做所有这些。”但你不能，存在障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is actually a really good example of the kind of information that makes Mary's visit so important. It's the kind of thing that you can't really learn from an economic data release. I'm going to use that. One of the things that I I just to show you how tell you how we use things I've learned is that if you think about how likely are we to shift all of our production from the United States or how likely is a global market on steel to be able to re if we put it all back today. I mean, you've taught me two things already that not everybody is geared to your industry and you have to have a specific, you know, heat strategy in order to even use the materials and they have to be a certain quality. So, it just means that you don't have the open marketplace that I think many people would think you have. So, they would just look at the number of manufacturers and they'd say, "Oh, look, you could do all of this." But you can't. There's barriers there. There are barriers.</p>
</details>

另一个正在应对关税的阿拉斯加大型企业是港口。下一站是阿拉斯加港（Port of Alaska）。阿拉斯加港以前被称为安克雷奇港。这是一个**深水港**（deep-water port: 能够停靠吃水深度较大的大型船舶的港口），这里的潮汐非常剧烈。港口代理主任吉姆·贾格尔（Jim Jagger）解释了他们必须应对的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very helpful. You know, there's another big Alaskan business that's grappling with tariffs, and that is the port. Next stop, the Port of Alaska. Not many people have a demand for those ships anymore. So they'll decommission them as they Yeah. Although I I'll say in Natson in particular. So they have three ships that they rotate between and u they have the port of Alaska used to be called the port of Anchorage by the way. Very cool. It's a deep water port. The tides here are crazy. Here's uh Jim Jagger, the port's acting director, explaining what they're having to deal with.</p>
</details>

吉姆·贾格尔表示，阿拉斯加港面临各种问题，这些问题并非独一无二，但我们所面临问题的组合却是独一无二的。例如，我们有相当快的洋流，潮汐落差（**tide flux**: 高潮与低潮之间的水位变化）达30英尺。季节最低潮与最高潮之间的最大潮汐落差为40英尺。据称这是世界上第二大的潮汐落差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Port of Alaska has a variety of issues that we're not unique, except that we're unique in the combination of issues we have. So, what are our challenges? For instance, we have um a pretty fast current. We have a 30-ft tide flux. Uh so, between low tide and high tide, 30 foot. Then our maximum tide flux between the lowest tide of the season and the highest tide is 40 ft. I heard it is the second biggest tide flux in the world. Yeah, it's actually depending on it. It's it's probably fifth or sixth, but in places where people actually do commerce, we're number two.</p>
</details>

由于阿拉斯加恶劣的生长条件和短暂的夏季，该州几乎所有新鲜食物都必须进口。其中绝大部分食物通过船只从西海岸的港口运来，主要是西雅图（Seattle）和塔科马（Tacoma）。每周只有四艘船抵达，阿拉斯加的供应链非常紧张。玛丽此前曾亲身经历过这种紧张供应链的负面影响。她与吉姆谈论了此事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So because of the harsh growing conditions and the short summer season in Alaska, almost all of the state's fresh food has to be imported. And the vast majority of that food arrives by boat from west coast peers, mostly Seattle and Tacoma. And with only four ships coming in per week, Alaska's supply lines are stretched very tight. And Mary has actually experienced the downside of those stretched supply lines before. Here she is talking with Jim about it.</p>
</details>

玛丽回忆说，她5月份来这里时，酒店咖啡用完了，因为供应商没有送货，而且要等很久才能送到。吉姆解释说，5月份他们有一艘船因为机械故障而停运了。所以，如果玛丽的时机不巧，她的咖啡可能正好在船上。玛丽表示，她去喝咖啡时，工作人员说没有咖啡了。这实际上说明了他们的供应链有多么脆弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Running out of things. We ran out of this. When I was here in May, the hotel ran out of coffee because they said the supplier hadn't gotten it in and they wouldn't get it until in in May. We had we lost a ship because of a mechanical. So, if your timing was correct, you may have your coffee may have been coming up. Yeah, I went down for coffee and she said, "We are we don't have any coffee for that actually demonstrates how skinny our supply line." Yeah. No, that's that that's why I wanted to talk about it. Um I'm still I'm not traumatized by my lack of coffee, but I just was surprised at how I was surprised at how fragile or vulnerable.</p>
</details>

吉姆指出，阿拉斯加的食物储备只有6到10天。根据不同的数据来源，阿拉斯加消费的食物中有94%到96%是进口的。他们处理了其中四分之三的进口食物。每周有四艘定期集装箱船，周日两艘，周二两艘。如果他们失去一艘船，那就意味着下一周的食物减少了25%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We we have 6 to 10 days worth of food in the States. So we import depending on whose numbers you believe between 94 and 96% of the food consumed in Alaska is is imported. Figure we're handling 3/4 of that. Um so you know if that's coming in we we have four scheduled container ships a week. Two on Sundays, two on Tuesdays. Um if we lose a ship, you know that's 25% of the food for the next week.</p>

如果走进弗雷德·迈耶（Fred Meyer）超市，发现没有沙拉，那就是这个原因。这很有趣。如果你去美国本土48州，比如去家得宝（Home Depot），家得宝的本土48州门店可以在32小时内重新补货整个商店。所以，如果你在墨西哥湾沿岸，遇到飓风，商店完全售罄，他们可以在32小时后完全补货。现在将这个模式应用到阿拉斯加，我们没有仓储。32小时意味着，如果这里发生地震或什么事情，商店被清空，他们下单，需要32小时才能运到塔科马的码头。然后需要66.5小时才能漂浮到安克雷奇，这还是假设你在正确的周期，不需要等待几天才能等到下一艘船离开。所以，它需要66.5小时才能到达这里，然后还需要从安克雷奇运到最终目的地。所以，如果你在安克雷奇市中心，今天下午就能到。但如果是在费尔班克斯，那还需要一天。所以，你32小时的补货时间，可能会变成六七天。

<p class="english-text">Uh and it is very realistic that if you walk into the Fred Meyer grocery store and you go, "Huh, why is there no salad? you know, uh, that's why, and you know, it's an interesting take. If you go down to the lower 48 and say go to Home Depot, Home Depot's lower 48 stores have a restock where they can restock an entire store in 32 hours. So, if you're on the G Coast and they have a hurricane, they completely sell the store out. They're set up so that they can come in 32 hours later, they're totally restocked. Okay? Now apply that model to Alaska where we have no warehousing. 32 hours means if the if we have an earthquake or something happens here and they empty out the store, they place the order. 32 hours to get it to Tacoma on the dock. There's then a 66 1/2 hour float up to Anchorage and that's assuming you're on the right cycle and you don't have to wait a couple of days till the next ship leaves. So, it gets up here in 66 and a half hours and then it's got to make it from Anchorage to wherever the final destination is. So, if you're in Midtown Anchorage, well, you'll be it'll be there this afternoon. Uh if it's in Fairbanks, well, that's another day. So, suddenly your 32-hour restock, you know, could be six, seven days.</p>

有人问了一个问题：“为什么不建造一些仓储设施？”吉姆·贾格尔回答说，他们的基本问题是人口非常少，却分布在巨大的区域。整个州只有75万人，基本上就是一个城市的人口，而他们的州是德克萨斯州面积的2.5倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask a dumb question? But why don't you build some warehousing capacity? That was my question. Well, I don't think it's dumb. I was going to ask. So our basic problem is that we have a very small population spread out over a huge area. You know 3/4 of a million people in the entire state. So basically a city, right? And our state is two and a half times the size of Texas.</p>
</details>

港口现代化项目工程师约翰·戴利（John Daly）补充说，如果你真的想了解情况，去阿拉斯加的布什（Bush）地区。去那些偏远社区，你就会真正看到这种影响。有些社区一年只收到三四艘驳船。牛奶非常昂贵，任何新鲜的东西都非常昂贵。如果你去过科迪亚克（Kodiak）或圣保罗岛（St. Paul Island）或贝瑟尔（Bethel）等偏远地区，你就会真正看到供应链的末端，这些地方的供应链非常敏感。所以，这里可能很脆弱，但那里却很脆弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you really want to see it, go to Bush, Alaska. That's John Daly, an engineer who is leading a big modernization effort at the port. So go to these remote communities and then you'll really see the effect of what what you're talking about. But it's uh it's pronounced if they if they get some of these communities only get three or four barges a year basically. Milk is hugely expensive. Anything fresh is very expensive. If you go to you know I've worked living here I've worked in a lot of remote places. We're talking Kodiak or St. Paul Island or Bethl or something. Then you really see the the end of the supply chain and it's super sensitive in those locations. So, it's very it can be vulnerable here, but it's sort of fragile over there.</p>
</details>

玛丽·戴利表示，这些地方更加脆弱，而安克雷奇是一个**枢纽**（hub: 物流网络中货物集中和分发的中心）。这是一个**枢纽辐射系统**（hub-and-spoke system: 一种网络结构，中央枢纽连接多个辐射点），他们是一个帮助供应这些地区的枢纽。如果他们敏感，那么这些地区就会敏感十倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More vulnerable. And we're kind of a hub. It's a hub and spoke system. So, we're a hub that helps supply those areas. And if we're sensitive, they are 10 times. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.</p>
</details>

现在，为了让事情变得更加复杂，港口还必须应对关税。作为整个州的主要进口枢纽，你可以想象港口对这个问题考虑得很多。关税不仅可能影响贸易，影响所有进出港口的船只停靠加油等，而且他们还可以率先了解公司如何应对任何成本增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now, just to make things even more complicated, the port also has tariffs to contend with. As the primary import hub from the entire state, you can imagine that the port thinks about this issue quite a bit. Not only could tariffs impact trade, all those ships going in and out of the harbor, stopping to refuel, so forth, but they could get the first look at how companies choose to respond to any increase in costs.</p>
</details>

关税也同样可能推高商品价格。所以，他们将面临商品关税，但他们也将面临商品港口费用。所以，这只会让商品变得更贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It also just as likely to push up the price of goods. Oh, yeah. So, they're going to face tariffs on goods, but they're also going to face port fees on goods. And so, then it's just be more expensive.</p>
</details>

情况变得更糟，因为我们陷入了“死亡螺旋”。我们提高了关税，而目前大部分货物都是由深水船只运入的。但如果我们每吨关税提高到足够高，在某个时候，一些运输非时间敏感物品（例如新车）的人会说，为了避免关税，我宁愿用驳船运到惠蒂尔（Whittier）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It gets worse, though, because we have we have the the death spiral. So, we raise our tariffs and then right now most of the cargo coming in are deep water vessels. But if we raise our tariffs per ton enough, uh, at some point some folks who are shipping things that are not timesensitive, new cars, you know, we'll go, you know, for the tariff, I'm just going to bring it up on a on a barge into Whittier and I'll save the tariff.</p>
</details>

然后，这会减少我们的总吨位。我们仍然必须支付债务。所以，我们现在必须进一步提高关税。所以，我们正在进入这个螺旋。食品价格进一步上涨。而且，也许你没有为你的卡车支付关税，但你将比预期晚10天收到货物。所以，你也会得到更差的货运服务。因此，对阿拉斯加人的影响是，他们为某些东西（比如食物）支付更多费用，而其他一切的货运服务都变差了。通常，任何额外的税费都会导致你等待更长时间或支付更多费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then what happens is that then reduces our overall tonnage. We still have to make our debt payment. So, we now have to increase our tariffs more. So, we're getting into this spiral. Food prices just went up even more. And oh, by the way, you know, maybe you're not paying the tariff on your truck, but you are going to get it 10 days later than you thought you were. You know, so you're getting worse cargo service also. So, the impact on Alaskans is they're paying more for certain things like food, uh, and everything else is the cargo service is less good. Well, the the normal way that all this any kind of extra tax ships out is you either wait longer or you pay more.</p>
</details>

玛丽·戴利表示，这就是它的运作方式。她试图在演讲中加入乐观的结尾，因为最终，你们对正在做的事情充满热情，但另一方面，它也很容易让人士气低落，对吧？当你考虑到这里的成本结构时，这似乎是一个无法克服的问题。但我们别无选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's that's just how it works. I mean, in any of the things that's why I tried to put a optimistic uh end point on the speech is because you can I think ultimately it's you guys are very enthusiastic about what you're trying to do, but there's the other side of it which can easily demoralize people, right? It just seems like an insurmountable problem when you think of the cost structure here. But we have no option.</p>
</details>

没错，所以你只能把自己逼到绝境，别无选择，或者你可以说，好吧，然后变得悲伤，对吧？或者你可以带着目标前进，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Exactly. So you can either back yourself into a corner with no option or you can just say well and be sad, right? Or you can just go forward with purpose, right? So yeah,</p>

阿拉斯加的生活成本很高是常识。在这里获得商品和服务需要更多的费用。居民们明白这是生活的一部分。但阿拉斯加人愿意为住在这里支付多少溢价，以及企业在定价方面能有多大的回旋余地，都是有限制的。阿拉斯加港财务总监谢丽尔·贝克汉姆（Cheryl Beckham）与玛丽讨论了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's sort of common knowledge that it's expensive to live in Alaska. It just costs more to get goods and services up here. And residents understand that's part of the deal. But there are limits to just how much of a premium Alaskans are willing to pay to live here and just how much businesses can get away with when it comes to pricing. Cheryl Beckham, director of finance at the Port of Alaska, talks about this point with Mary. I mean,</p>
</details>

玛丽·戴利说，这揭示了她的经济学家背景，但在这里价格更高是合理的，因为有所有这些额外的成本。但小社区认为应该像美国本土48州一样。所以，你必须折中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm revealing my economist background, but it just makes sense that the price would be higher here because you have all these additional costs, but you're saying the small communities think it should be like it is in the lower 48. So, you have to split this difference.</p>
</details>

谢丽尔·贝克汉姆表示，他们理解存在运输成本，但他们愿意接受的市场价格是多少？所以，随着成本上升，燃料价格上涨，运送燃料的油轮成本也更高。所以，这里的利润空间可能总是小一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's a similar So, they understand that there's a transportation cost, but what is that market that they're willing to accept, right? So as costs go up and fuel goes up and the you know the fuel bars the tankers that bring it they cost more for So you're probably always having a little less margin up here. Right. Yes.</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个非常大的问题：关税带来的额外成本，有多少将由公司本身吸收，无论是进口商、运输企业还是港口这样的中间商？又有多少成本将转嫁给消费者，这基本上会再次引发通货膨胀的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So you do this is the really big question. How much of the extra cost coming from the tariffs is going to be absorbed by the companies themselves whether it's importers or the transportation businesses or middlemen like the port. and how much of the cost is going to be passed on to consumers which would basically risk fanning inflation again.</p>
</details>

对于一个生活成本已经很高的州来说，这是一个大问题，正是因为所有这些东西都需要进口，而且经常被运往州内非常偏远的地方。即使你不一定进口外国商品，关税仍然可以推高国内制造商品的价格。我们制定货币政策时正在努力解决的问题是，有税收、移民、放松管制、关税等，这些事情可能有不同的影响。所以，我一直在问人们的一个问题是，这些事情中是否有任何一个会立即影响你们这里的业务？你们对它们是否会产生影响有任何感觉吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is a big deal for a state which already has a very high cost of living precisely because all this stuff needs to be imported and often sent on to really remote locations within the state. And even if you're not necessarily importing foreign goods, tariffs can still push up the price of what's made domestically. question that we're grappling with making monetary policy is there's taxes, immigration, deregulation, tariffs and those things have different likely effects etc. So one of the questions I've been asking people when we meet is do any of those things can you see any of those effects immediately affecting your business here and do you have any sense of if they will? up immediately. Uh</p>
</details>

谢丽尔·贝克汉姆表示，关税问题在他们的建筑项目中已经出现。他们有很多大型建筑项目即将启动，价值数十亿美元的基础设施建设。这是否是港口特有的？是的，那是他们的码头更换项目。大部分项目都符合“购买美国货”（Buy America）政策，因为他们正在争取联邦资金，而这是附带条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well, the tariff thing has come up in our construction. So, we have a lot of big construction coming up like a couple billion dollars worth of infrastructure. Sorry. Is that port specific? Yeah, that's our dock replacement. Okay. Right. And and most of that is by America uh because we're trying to get federal funding and that comes with the territory.</p>
</details>

所以，关税并没有直接影响到这一点，因为理论上那是针对外国商品的。然而，它推高了整个港口的价格。所以，美国制造的钢铁、美国制造的这个、美国制造的那个，所有价格都上涨了。所以，它对这方面有很大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the tariffs are not directly affecting that because theoretically that's on foreign goods. However, it floats the whole pushes the whole district the whole harbor up. So the price of steel, buy America steel, buy America this, buy America that all goes up. So it has a a large effect on on that.</p>
</details>

玛丽·戴利问，价格上涨了多少？谢丽尔·贝克汉姆表示，她不想透露这个数字，但这是一个很大的数字。他们十年前开始时，项目预算是4亿美元，现在已经达到25亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How how much have you seen prices rise maybe from when you originally planning it? I mean something rough. No, I want to admit that number, but it's a large number. Um, right. We started off 10 years ago with uh something that was $400 million and we're at two and a half billion now.</p>
</details>

阿拉斯加港正在进行一项25亿美元的现代化改造计划。所以，现在材料成本上涨，而且还有融资成本，如果利率因通货膨胀上升而上涨，那也会增加成本，甚至可能呈指数级增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. The Port of Alaska is in the middle of a $2.5 billion modernization program. So it's a pretty bad time for the cost of materials to be going up and there's also the financing costs right if interest rates go up because inflation is rising that also adds to the cost possibly exponentially.</p>
</details>

玛丽·戴利问，如果你们思考在这里所做的工作以及阿拉斯加所面临的所有问题，包括经济、政策变化、利率等，现在最让你们担心的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So can I ask a question about from all three of you is like if you think about the work you do here and the things that are facing Alaska with all the you know just the economy the changes in policy interest rates etc. What what's worrying you right now?</p>
</details>

谢丽尔·贝克汉姆表示，最让她担心的是他们25亿美元项目的融资问题。他们有一些州和联邦资金，其余部分计划通过地方收入债券（**local revenue bonds**: 由地方政府发行，以特定项目产生的收入偿还的债券）来筹集。他们已经获得了发行这些债券的授权，但问题是他们能向市场推出多少。这会使他们的债务负担从现在的5000万美元增加到数十亿美元。他们有权发行11亿美元的债券。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What worries me is financing our our project our $2.5 billion dollar project trying and we have some state and federal funds. The rest of it is slated for uh local revenue bonds. Okay. And that's Do you think those will pass? They've given us authority to issue those. But the question is how how much can you push into the market um once and it puts our debt load from whatever it is 50 million we have now up to billions. 1.1 we have authority for 1.1 billion.</p>
</details>

这大大增加了他们的债务负担，所以这是最大的问题。他们的目标是联邦资金、州资金和地方资金各占三分之一。但对于他们的下一个码头项目，预计耗资约9亿美元，目前90%将来自地方，5%来自州，5%来自联邦。如果他们继续为90%的地方份额融资，40年后他们将为9亿美元偿还22.8亿美元。所以，融资成本将是巨大的，这将对整体货运费率产生什么影响？他们正在努力维持一个具有成本效益的货运系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It greatly increases our debt load. So that's the biggest. So our our goal is one third one third one third one third federal money one/3 state money 1/3 local money for our ne our next doc it's going to be roughly $900 million right at this point we have 90% is going to be local 5% state 5% federal. If we go forward to finance the 90% that's the local share uh after 40 years 2.2 uh 2.28 uh billion dollars is what we're going to pay back for 900 billion. So you know with that the cost of financing is going to be huge and what is that going to do to overall cargo rates? Remember, one of our things is we're trying to maintain a cost-effective cargo system. Uh, and boy, when do we get crushed?</p>

### 安克雷奇国际机场：全球货运与地方通勤

谈到高效的货运系统，阿拉斯加的大部分进口货物都通过港口运输，但它并不是镇上唯一的物流枢纽。为了获得完整的图景，我们必须去机场看看，这正是玛丽的下一站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of effective cargo systems, a huge chunk of Alaska's imports go through the port, as we've been discussing. But it is not the only logistics hub in town. Right. To get a complete picture, we've got to check out the airport, which is exactly where Mary is heading next.</p>
</details>

阿拉斯加国际机场系统（**Alaska International Airport System**, AAS）的系统控制员苏珊·奥尔特（Susan Alt）介绍说，AAS由泰德·史蒂文斯安克雷奇国际机场（Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport）组成，这是阿拉斯加州最大的客运机场，也是世界第四繁忙、美国第二繁忙的货运机场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much would a plane like that cost? 3 million. Yeah, that's you lightly used. 3.8. We have We have a We have a handful of those. Yeah. What are the planes that go out completely? Um, I'm Susan Alt. from the Alaska International Airport's system controller and we're all glad to have you here today to show off our system. Uh so I'll go ahead and get going. So what is the Alaska International Airport System, also known as AS? It is made up of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, which is the largest passenger airport in the state of Alaska. It's also the fourth busiest cargo airport in the world and the second busiest in the United States.</p>
</details>

安克雷奇机场是阿拉斯加最大的机场。2025财年客运量达到540万人次。2025年航空货运量为370万吨。该机场支持安克雷奇地区七分之一的就业岗位，每年为该州带来18亿美元的经济影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anchorage's impact is the largest airport in Alaska. Passenger activity for fiscal year 25 ended at 4, excuse me, 5.4 million passengers served. Air cargo for 2025. We had 3.7 million tons um for 2025. And again, as I said, we're number two in the USA and number four in the world with regards to cargo. Um, we support one in seven jobs in the Anchorage area and provide 1.8 billion in annual economic impact to the state. And you can see on the screen about the direct jobs and wages impact versus the indirect and induced uh jobs and wages. So, we're pretty significant economic boom for the state of Alaska.</p>
</details>

航空运输对阿拉斯加至关重要，安克雷奇机场基本上充当了整个州乃至全球贸易的“卡车停靠站”。满载货物的货机从亚洲、中东、欧洲部分地区运送货物，会在前往北美其他地区途中在此停靠加油。对于阿拉斯加人来说，这里是他们从其他地方订购的大部分商品的主要集散地，这些商品在巨大的联邦快递（FedEx）和联合包裹（UPS）机库中分类后，再分发到全州各地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Air transport is huge for Alaska and the Anchorage airport basically acts like a truck stop for the whole state and really global trade. Fully loaded cargo planes moving stuff from Asia, the Middle East, parts of Europe will stop here to refuel on their way to the rest of North America. And for Alaskans, it's the main depot for most of the goods they order from elsewhere, which are sorted in the huge FedEx and UPS hangers before being distributed throughout the state.</p>
</details>

它也是一个通勤枢纽。北坡的许多石油工人实行两周上班、两周休息的轮班制。他们乘坐小型飞机前往油田，在工作期间住在公司宿舍，然后返回家人和家乡度过剩下的一个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also a commuter hub. Many of the oil workers on the North Slope work in two week on, two week off shifts. They catch a small plane up to the fields where they live in company housing while on the job and then they return to their families and hometown for the rest of the month.</p>
</details>

就像全国其他地方一样，住房是一个主要问题，即使在一个拥有德克萨斯州两倍土地面积的州也是如此。正如我们反复看到的，阿拉斯加面临着美国其他地区面临的所有问题，只是至少目前来说，问题更加严重。如果你的基础设施已经有点脆弱，那么你可以想象，美国发生的任何冲击都会在这里被放大。

### 地方洞察如何影响美联储决策

玛丽正直接从机场前往机场，她将飞往美国本土48州。这次旅行显然有很多可能的收获。阿拉斯加的成本结构是他们今天学到最多的一点。为什么价格如此之高，以及如何才能缓解这种情况？当然，通货膨胀、商品运输方式的变化或供应链挑战等正在发生的事情，在阿拉斯加都被放大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mary is going straight from the airport to the airport I guess she's flying to the lower 48 and there's obviously a lot of possible takeaways from the trip. You this cost structure of Alaska was something I think we learned the most about today. Just why are the prices so much higher and where would you ever try to mitigate that? And of course the things that are going on like inflation or just changes in how goods are shipped or supply chain challenges, they're just magnified in Alaska.</p>
</details>

玛丽还了解到，这些问题首先在这里发生。阿拉斯加就像一个“煤矿里的金丝雀”，当你在这里看到问题时，你就知道它会在其他地方出现。很可能在其他地方影响会较小，因为有其他方式可以保障自己，但你一定会看到它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think we also learned, you know, I learned that they happen here first. It's it really is sort of this canary in the coal mine almost that when you see it here, you know it's coming elsewhere. It's going to be lower in all likelihood because there's other ways to ensure yourselves, but you're going to see it.</p>
</details>

我们不确切知道美联储9月会议上讨论了什么，或者至少要等到2030年左右会议记录公布后才知道。但你可以很好地理解，像这样的旅行实际上为美联储理事们围坐一桌，试图找出下一步行动时，带来了什么新的对话内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't know exactly what was discussed at the Fed's September meeting, or at least we don't know until the transcript is published in like 2030, but I think you can get a good sense of what a trip like this actually adds to the conversation when Fed governors are all sitting around the table trying to figure out what to do next.</p>
</details>

所以，现在面临的一个挑战是，在过去我们努力对抗高通胀时，它是一个挑战，而今天，当你试图弄清关税对经济增长和通胀的真正影响时，它也绝对是一个挑战。仅仅是剖析阿拉斯加正在发生的事情，并了解在任何时候这需要多长时间，因为钢铁的**不可替代性**（non-fungibility: 指资产或物品具有独特性，不能被其他同类物品完全替换），以及某些供应链网络的**互操作性**（interoperability: 不同系统、组织或组件之间相互协作的能力），所有这些都给了我洞察力，我可以将这些洞察力带回会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the things that is challenging right now, it was challenging back in the days when we were trying to fight high inflation and it's definitely challenging today when you're trying to figure out the real impact of tariffs not not only on growth but on the on inflation as just one example unpacking what's happening in Alaska and knowing at whatever point how long this is going to take because of the you know the nonf fungeability of steel the interoperability of some of the supply chain networks all of those things give me insights that I can then take back to the meeting.</p>
</details>

这样一来，就不仅仅是我们交换预测了。它提供了证据，是你在统计数据中找不到的潜在证据，因为我们只是在预测。但现在，我们的预测得到了数据和信息的充实。当你试图制定好的政策时，这会产生巨大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then it's not just us exchanging forecast. I think they're going to be like this long. I think they're going to take this long. It provides evidence, underlying evidence that you can't find in your statistics because the statistics we the statistics we just don't know. All we're doing is projecting. But now we have our projections filled out by data and information. And that makes a huge difference when you're trying to make good policy.</p>
</details>

主持人乔·魏森塔尔（Joe Weisenthal）表示，这次旅行给他留下了深刻印象。在阿拉斯加，真的感觉像是世界的尽头，就像帝国的边缘。特雷西·阿洛韦（Tracy Alloway）也认为，确实感觉像边疆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it for our special Alaska episode. We hope you enjoyed tagging along with us and Mary on the Anchorage Expedition. Joe, what stuck out to you? So many things stuck out to me from that trip. You know, like being in Alaska, it really did feel like the end of the world, didn't it? like that that the edge of the empire here. Yeah, it definitely felt frontier- like for sure.</p>
</details>

乔·魏森塔尔说，他以前去过农村地区，甚至比安克雷奇这样的城市地区更偏远，但他从未像在阿拉斯加那样感到遥远。所以，很容易理解为什么这个州长期处于一种供应链紧张的状态。当你去安克雷奇这样的地方时，你会看到很多与美国其他地方相同的餐馆和连锁店，不同之处在于所有这些东西都必须经过数千英里的运输才能到达那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been in rural areas before, even more rural obviously than uh an urban area like Anchorage, but I've never just felt distant like I did in Alaska. And so, it's very easy to understand why it's a state permanently in a state of sort of supply chain stress. Yeah, that's what really stood out to me as well because when you go to a place like Anchorage, I mean there are a lot of the same restaurants and chain stores that you would see in any other place in America, the difference is all that stuff has to be transported thousands and thousands of miles to get there.</p>

这是一种持续的压力，非常不寻常。他知道这些关于一切都如此遥远的事情，但去机场看到小型飞机如何服务于工人通勤系统，真是令人大开眼界。或者仅仅是拥有自己飞机的人数之多，例如那些水上浮筒飞机，在其他州，人们会在码头停放船只，但在阿拉斯加，那是飞机。这里的一切都处于永久的紧张状态。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, it's a constant strain. Uh just extraordinary. You know, I knew these things about how far-flung everything was, but then say going to the airport and seeing how small planes served the just sort of worker commuter system was really eye opening. Or just the sheer number of people who own planes themselves, you know, like they have uh these uh uh pontoon planes in the water that in another state would be how people would have their boats in the marina except Alaska. It's planned. Like it's just it's permanently it's permanently stretched. Do you uh think we could go to Hawaii next? That's in the 12th district, right?</p>
