### 欢迎与Figma的使命

**Nicolola Tangen**: 大家好，欢迎来到“In Good Company”。我是**挪威主权财富基金**的CEO **Nicolola Tangen**。今天我们邀请到了**Figma**的创始人兼CEO **Dylan Field**。令人难以置信的是，**Dylan**在19岁时创立了**Figma**，14年后，**Figma**在2025年完成了最大规模的**IPO**之一。热烈欢迎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Hi everybody. Uh, welcome to In Good Company. I'm Nicolola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund. And today we have the founder and CEO of Figma visiting us, Dylan Field. Now, quite incredibly, uh, Dylan founded Figma when he was 19 years old. And now 14 years later, Figma had one of the biggest IPO uh, IPOs of 2025. So, warm welcome.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 谢谢您的邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Thank you for having me.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，**Dylan**，我们必须从头开始。**Figma**是做什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So, um, Dylan, we have to start. What does Figma do? Yes.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: **Figma**是一个平台，可以帮助你将头脑中的想法转化为软件领域的生产级应用程序。而且，一旦你发布了软件，你还会想对其进行市场推广，我们在这方面也能提供帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, Figma is a platform that helps you go from an idea in your head to a production application uh in the software space, but also once you ship something uh once you ship some software, you want to then market it. And we also help with that too.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们帮助你推广品牌，让你能够围绕品牌创造更多宣传材料。最终，这不仅仅是一个线性的过程，你有一个想法，然后得到最终产品就完成了。也许在工业设计领域，我们之前开始前谈论过，那更像是它的样子。但在软件领域，它总是一个循环，你总是在迭代，总是在学习，总是在努力弄清楚如何发展你和团队创造的东西。我们努力使其高度协作，以便设计师可以把整个团队带进来完成这项工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: We help you get your brand out there uh and make it so you can create more collateral around it. And ultimately, it's not just some linear process where you have an idea and you get to finish product and you're done. uh perhaps in the industrial design world, we were talking about that before we started, that's more of what it is, but in software, it's always a loop and you're always iterating and you're learning and you're trying to figure out how do I evolve this thing that I've created with my team and uh we try to make it very collaborative so designers can bring their entire team in to do that. Uh

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的，我现在经营一家杯子工厂。我要设计一个新杯子。我们有四个人，想设计一个杯子。我们如何使用你的软件？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so listen now I'm I'm uh I run a cup factory. Okay, so now I'm going to design a new cup. Uh here we go. We are like four people. they want to design a cup. How do we use your software?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们确实有人会在**Figma**上画杯子，或者在**Figma**上推广他们的杯子，但我们不是用于3D或CAD设计的软件。所以这通常不是人们用它来做什么。但我总是很惊讶，人们会在**Figma**中画出3D资产，比如一个带有惊人阴影和不可思议光线的漂亮杯子。这不是它被设计出来的目的，但人们确实会这样做。话虽如此，CAD是一个完全不同的领域，我们真的只专注于数字设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh we have people that will maybe draw cups or maybe they will market their cups on Figma, but we're not a piece of software for uh 3D or you know CAD design. And so that's typically not what people use for. But I'm always amazed when people will draw 3D assets like a beautiful cup with a amazing shadow and incredible lighting in Figma. Not what it's made for, but people do it. M that said uh yeah CAD is an entirely different area and we really stick to digital design.

</details>

### 设计为何成为关键差异化因素

**Nicolola Tangen**: 为什么设计会成为如此重要的差异化因素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Why is um why is design such an important differentiator?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为，回顾一下数字产品设计的历史，我认为在数字领域，设计史很有趣，因为长期以来，设计师非常非常少，几乎没有人有传统的艺术学校背景，或者说很少有人有。他们中的许多人都是偶然进入设计领域的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So I think going back a bit uh and speaking about digital product design the history of design I think is interesting in the digital realm because for a long time there were very very few designers. Almost none of them had a traditional art school background or very few did. And many of them randomly found their way into design.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 有时他们来自工程领域，有时他们在一个乐队里制作海报。它可能来自任何不同的地方。但在2000年左右的互联网泡沫时代，口号是“建好它，他们就会来”。那时，如果你有一个设计师（这很罕见），设计的作用被认为是——在美国我们有时称之为“给猪涂口红”。就是说，你有一头猪，但我们要给它涂上口红，让它看起来漂亮。这真的只是为了让它在美学上令人愉悦，而不是考虑功能、形式或它如何运作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Sometimes from engineering, sometimes they were in a band and made a poster. Uh it could come from any different place. But there's a period of time in uh for example 2000 uh the dot era where the mantra was build it and they will come. And at that point, if you had a designer, which was rare, the sort of role of design was conceived to be what uh sometimes in America we call lipstick on a pig. The uh you know, you got a pig, but we're going to put some lipstick on it to make it pretty. And it was really about making it uh aesthetically pleasing, but not thinking about the function, the form, how it works. M

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 在过去的25年里，这种情况发生了巨大变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and that has changed dramatically over the past 25 years.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 首先，我们进入了2010年代，那时不仅有**苹果**公司宣扬设计，强调其运作方式的重要性，**史蒂夫·乔布斯**也倡导设计，告诉你为什么应该购买这款**iPhone**。同时，像**Facebook**或**Gmail**这样的消费级应用程序也应运而生，人们的期望值随之提高。与此同时，像**AWS**云服务这样的技术也开始兴起，我们从管理服务器的世界转向了云端，从盒装软件转向了应用商店，而且构建软件也变得前所未有的容易，因为开发者工具正在不断改进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: First we got to the 2010 era where you not only have Apple evangelizing design and saying how it works matters. this is why you should buy this iPhone with Steve Jobs championing design. But also you have the advent of consumer applications like Facebook or Gmail and suddenly the expectations rise and at the same time you know things like AWS cloud computing are starting to pick up and we've moved from a world of managed servers to cloud from box software to app stores and it's easier than ever uh to build software as well. Because developer tools are improving.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 当所有这些都在发生时，分发情况又如何呢？我们不再处于“建好它，他们就会来”的世界了。我们开始从那个世界过渡到一个新世界，在这个世界里，如果你建好了它，并且拥有真正出色的设计和真正出色的营销，那么你可能才有机会。因为软件越来越多，你所构建的东西不再是世界上唯一的存在。竞争日益激烈，价值正在向上层堆栈移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And as all this is happening, what's happening to the distribution? Well, no longer are we in the world of build and they will come. Uh we're starting to transition out of that into a world where well, if you build it and you have really great design and really great marketing, then you might have a chance uh because there's more software and it's not the case anymore that you're building something. It's the only thing like that that exists in the world. competition is increasing and the value is moving up the stack.

</details>

### Figma的愿景与设计严谨性

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们最初的目标是，我想你说过，消除想象与现实之间的鸿沟。那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Now your initial goal was to I think you say eliminate the gap between imagination and reality. What does that mean?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，所以当我们开始时，我描绘了一个相当宏大的愿景，部分原因是我不确定我们具体会走向何方。我们当时有一个“锤子”，那就是**WebGL**。我认为对于伟大的公司来说，总会有一个“为什么是现在”的问题。世界发生了一些变化。而“为什么是现在”是你回过头来看时，可以指出一两个或三四个原因，然后说这就是为什么这家公司在那个特定时间出现的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. So when we started uh I painted a pretty broad vision for where we could go partially because I didn't know exactly where we were going to go. Uh you know we had a hammer that was WebGL. And I think that there's always this uh why now for great companies. Something's changed in the world. And the why now is uh something you can look back on and you can point at one or two or three of them and say this is why this company came to exist at this particular time.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 对我们来说，我们当时想，好吧，让我们看看正在改变的技术。我们是计算机科学家。我的联合创始人**Evan**，他非常聪明。他是我在**布朗大学**的助教，他对**WebGL**进行了大量的探索。**Evan**不仅比我优秀10倍的工程师，他简直是比我优秀100倍的工程师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And for us we thought okay let's look at technology that's changing. We're computer scientists. Uh my co-founder Evan he is beyond brilliant. He was my TA at Brown and he had done quite a lot of exploration into WebGL. Uh Evan is not just a 10x better engineer than I am. He's like a 100x better better engineer than I am. M uh

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你叫他“耶稣”之类的，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: you called him Jesus or something, right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我没有叫他“耶稣”。但那是他中学时的绰号，叫“计算机耶稣”，简称**CJ**。我后来才知道。我叫他**Evan**。但他是一个非常聪明的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh well, I did not call him Jesus. Uh but that was his nickname in middle school was computer Jesus or CJ for short. Uh I later learned um I called him Evan. Uh but uh he is a brilliant man

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我非常非常幸运能和他一起工作。设计是需要右脑思维的，但你的背景也在数学和物理方面。那么，为什么严谨性在这里如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and I was very very lucky to get to work with him and uh I mean design is some right brain stuff right but you have your background also in like in math and physics. Uh so why is rigor so important here?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我希望我能学更多的物理。我不能声称我学过很多。我学过一些数学，但不够。我认为在设计中，你既需要抽象思维的能力，也需要情商（EQ）和与最终用户情感连接的能力。当然，还有审美、判断力、时间上的思考、框架上的思考。但确实，许多技能汇聚在一起，才能理解所有这些背景，并将其整合到一个地方，创造出色的用户体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah, I wish I had done more physics. Um, I can't claim that. I've done some math, but not enough. And I think that you both want the ability to think in abstraction in design as well as the ability to have the EQ and emotionally connect with the end user. And so, uh, of course there's also aesthetic, there's judgment, there's thinking about, uh, things temporally, there's thinking about frameworks. Uh but there yeah there's many skills that come together in order to understand all that context and to bring into one place and to create a great user experience.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们甚至还没有达到马斯洛设计需求层次金字塔的顶端，在那里你开始思考愉悦和乐趣，以及如何创造人们喜爱的东西。我认为那更多是艺术的范畴。不是很多人能做到，但当你能做到，当你能运用那份技艺时，它是如此特别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And we're not even getting to sort of the top of the pyramid of the mass hierarchy of needs for design where you start to think about delight and joy and what does it mean to make something that people love. Uh and that's I think more of the art of it. Uh not many people can do that but when you can when you can apply that craft it's so special and those out.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，如果你要提炼出**Figma**的设计原则，你会有哪些？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So if you were to kind of distill down the design principles of Figma, do you do you have such we have many I mean would they be if

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们有很多。其中一个我认为很多人都会认同的是：保持简单的事情简单，但让复杂的事情成为可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: we have many I mean some of the ones that I think that a lot uh one is keep the simple things simple but make the complex things possible.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以在**Figma**中，就像任何工具一样，尤其是在你不断更新和添加更多功能以响应市场的软件中，我们谈论的不是像锤子那样的东西。我们谈论的是一个复杂的操作和功能生态系统，你希望它像一个楼梯，你可以非常轻松地迈出第一步或第二步，但如果你继续前进，你就能真正达到精通。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So in Figma as with any tool especially software where you're constantly updating and you're adding more things to respond to the market we're not talking about like a hammer. We're talking about something that is a complex uh ecosystem of operations and functionality and you want it to be a staircase where you can take that first step or the second step very easily but then if you keep going you can actually achieve mastery

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这种精通非常重要。所以我们希望始终在能力和简洁之间取得平衡。这种平衡极难实现。因此，我们必须不断提醒自己、用户和团队，我们需要做出正确的权衡，因为可亲近性是它的另一面。当你进入**Figma**时，它是否感觉像一个友好的环境？你是否受到欢迎，还是会惊呼“天哪，这就像走进飞机驾驶舱，我不知道怎么开”？我们当然希望你受到欢迎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and that mastery is so important. So we want to make it so that there's a balance between power and simplicity at all times. That balance is extremely hard to achieve. So we have to constantly remind ourselves and our users and our team of this that we need to make those right trade-offs because approachability is I think a flip side of it which is you come into Figma. Does it feel like an inviting environment? Are you welcomed or do you go oh my gosh this is like stepping into an airplane cockpit. I don't know how to fly. We want it to be that you're welcomed of course.

</details>

### 社区与产品开发

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们欢迎很多人，对吧？你们有一个庞大的社区。你们有很多插件解决方案。你们如何看待整个生态系统？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So you but you and you welcome a lot of people right? You got like a huge community. Um you got a lot of kind of plug-in solutions. Just how do you think about that whole ecosystem?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 从一开始，社区对**Figma**就至关重要。我们非常幸运能拥有一个出色的设计社区，他们给了我们反馈和关注，坦白说，当时我们并没有理由让他们这样做。我会在**Figma**刚起步时给那些我心中的英雄设计师发邮件，请他们看看我做的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So from the start, the community has been critical for Figma. We are so lucky to have an amazing design community around us and they gave us feedback and attention when frankly we had no reason for them to. Uh you know I would cold email designers that were my heroes at the start of Figma and just ask them to check out this thing I built

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 他们会和我坐下来。我会给他们一杯咖啡，他们会给我一个长达一小时的大师班，不仅是关于设计，还有关于如何构建他们想要的工具的建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and they would sit down with me. and I'd get them a coffee and they would give me like an hour-ong master class on not just design but advice on how to go build the tool that they wanted.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，他们现在如何帮助你们开发产品？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So, how do they help you develop products now?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 方式有很多。我们努力与社区保持紧密联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, so many ways. Uh we try to be very tapped into our community. So,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 这些社区成员都是什么样的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: and who are these community people? What what type of people are they?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 就像我说的，设计师来自各种背景，但我们每周活跃用户中超过80%来自美国以外。所以它不只是美国，而是世界各地。我们还有**Figma之友**（Friends of Figma）分会，以及遍布各地的用户群，这些都是社区主导的。我们每年也会将人们聚集在一起，举办年度用户大会**Config**。我们对教育免费，所以学生社区对我们来说极其重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh well, designers, like I said, come from all backgrounds, but uh we've got um over 80% of our weekly active users outside the United States. And so it's not necessarily like just United States, it's everywhere in the world. Uh and we have friends of Figma chapters, user groups all over the place too that are community-led. We also try to gather people together in one place every year for our annual user conference Config. We're free for education. So student communities are extremely important to us

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 因为他们是未来，他们总是告诉我们为了满足他们的需求需要做什么，因为他们总是比其他人领先一点点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: because they're the future and they are always teaching us about what we need to go do in order to meet their needs because they're always a little bit ahead of everybody else. Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们也有在线论坛。我们一直努力监控、回应和参与社交媒体。我们还进行大量的定性和定量研究。所有这些，加上标准的销售流程，创造了对话和交流，让我们能够深入了解客户的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Um but yeah, we also have online forums. We've got uh we're always trying to monitor and uh respond and engage on social media and uh we also do a lot of qualitative and quantitative research and so all that along with just the standard sales process uh creates dialogue and creates conversation lets us tap into the headsp space of our customers.

</details>

### AI如何改变设计

**Nicolola Tangen**: **AI**将如何改变这一切？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How will AI change all this?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为**AI**是一种当然会改变一切的力量，而且，它会改变多少，这正是我们一直在努力弄清楚的。但我相信**AI**既会降低门槛，让更多人能够参与到设计过程中，也会提高上限，让创意专业人士和设计师能够比以往做更多的事情，真正专注于他们的技艺。因为我认为**AI**的作用是让你能够探索整个选项空间，关于你能构建什么，你能设计什么。然后从那个选项空间中，你可以进行采样。你可以看到什么引起共鸣，你认为什么很棒，你认为什么实际上不应该深入。你可以用它来确定一个方向，然后你可以沿着那个方向进一步推进。而如果你没有**AI**，你只能从那个选项空间中采样几个点。**AI**让你采样更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, I think AI is a ch force that will change everything, of course, and um you know exactly how much. That's what we're both trying to figure out all the time. But I believe that AI will both lower the floor, make it so that more people can come into the design process, but also raise the ceiling, make it so that creative professionals, designers will be able to do so much more uh than they ever could before and truly uh be able to lean into their craft because I think what AI does is it makes it so that you can explore an entire option space uh of what you can build, what you can design, And then from that option space, you can sample. You can see what resonates, what you think is great, what you think actually you shouldn't go into. You can use that to figure out a direction and then you can push further in that direction. Whereas if you were going to do it without AI, you could only sample a few points from that option space. AI lets you sample more.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这样你就可以对你选择的路径有更多的意图性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So that way you can have more intentionality about the path you choose.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 在这个新世界里，“品味”有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How important is taste in this new world?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为它极其重要。回到之前的问题，设计作为一种差异化因素，我相信我们正处于这样的世界中，而人们尚未完全领会这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I think it's incredibly important. Going back to the uh question earlier, um design as a differentiator, I believe that is like the world we are in and people don't fully appreciate yet.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这是我过去十年的论点。这不仅仅是**AI**的事情，但**AI**加速了它，因为我们现在正处于世界软件数量呈指数级增长的曲线上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: This has been my thesis for the past decade. It's not just an AI thing, but AI accelerates it because we're on an exponential curve of the amount of software in the world right now.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 什么是品味？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What is taste?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这本身就可以做一整期播客了。我认为品味是一个循环，你总是在努力培养对什么能引起你共鸣、什么不能引起你共鸣的理解。在此基础上，你试图创建框架来弄清楚你重视什么，它如何与你的审美价值观以及你的个人内在价值观联系起来。然后在此基础上，努力以他人可以接受的形式表达出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh this is a whole podcast in itself. Um, I think that uh taste is a loop that you're in where you are always trying to develop an understanding of what resonates with you and what doesn't. And based on that, you're trying to create frameworks to figure out what it is that you value, how it connects to your uh not just aesthetic values, but your personal inner values. and based on that working to express that in a form that others can consume.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为这不仅仅是区分“我喜欢这个，我不喜欢那个”，品味也是构建惊人事物的推动者，它是最难培养的技能，拥有好品味，但它也给你的生活带来了丰富性，我认为并不是每个人都欣赏这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh and I think it's not just discriminating in terms of I like this, I don't like that, but also taste is uh an enabler of building amazing things and it is the hardest skill to develop uh to have good taste, but also it is I think it just brings richness to your life in a way that uh I don't think everyone appreciates yet. And the other thing is taste

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: **Dylan Field**的品味是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: what what is Dylan Field's taste

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 在什么方面？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: on what?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 开放式问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Open-ended question.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，我非常关心复杂性以及理解世界的能力。所以我认为在构建框架和心智模型方面我有很多品味。这也适用于设计。如果你能以视觉形式清晰地向用户传达一个心智模型，我认为那是一件很棒的事情。并不是每个人都能正确做到这一点，因为如果你想想看，如果我为你设计了一把合适的椅子，那可能不适合我。我们有不同的身体。也许我们可以为我们俩定制一些东西。然而，我们为每个人创造相同的软件是有原因的。而且，除了大规模生产之外，我们倾向于思考如何以更大的规模生产相同的椅子，这也是有原因的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, um I care a lot about complexity and being able to understand the world. So I think I've got a lot of taste when it comes to framework building mental models. Uh that applies to design as well. If you can clearly communicate a mental model to a user in a visual form, uh I think that's a great thing. And not everyone's able to do that properly because if you think about it, if I design the right chair for you, for example, that might not be the right chair for me. You know, we've got different bodies. Uh and perhaps, you know, we could create something custom for both of us. And yet there's a reason why we create the same software for everyone. Uh and there's a reason why beyond mass production we lean into how to create uh you know the same chair in a bigger run.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为这是一个机会，可以真正运用技艺，弄清楚你能做什么，作为你自己的表达，将一些东西放入数字或物理世界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It's I think uh this opportunity to actually apply craft and figure out what is it that you can do to as an expression of yourself put something into the digital or physical world.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: **AI**有品味吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Does AI have taste?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为**AI**仍然是一个模式匹配机器。人类有品味，它是在数据中训练出来的。所以，如果你能对**AI**的正确部分进行RHF（强化学习），你就能模拟品味。但这只有通过高级的提示才能实现。所以，也许提示工程师有品味，可以通过复杂的模型从这个模式匹配机器中提取出来。但我认为这并不是旅程的终点。我通常认为人们做的第一个提示只是起点，你需要不断前进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I think AI is still a pattern matching machine. Uh, and humans have taste and it's been trained in the data. And so if you can RHF the right parts of AI, you can emulate taste. But that's only with advanced prompting that you can access it. And so perhaps prompters have taste and can pull it out of this pattern matching machine with a sophisticated large model. Uh, but I think that's not the end of the journey. I I generally think the first prompt that people do is only the starting point and instead you need to keep going and that could be you know we have a product called Figma make prompt to working application and one thing we do with Figma make is make it so that you can go from the code output and copy it into Figma design which is a free form design tool not attached to code. The reason we do that is so that way you can explore in this more open way across a digital canvas that's infinite

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 你可以在一个无限的数字画布上，以非线性的方式进行即兴创作和探索各种变化，从而真正地视觉化地找出并视觉化地推断出什么能引起你的共鸣，什么感觉对，什么感觉不对，什么能解决你的问题，以及如何为不同的结果进行约束解决。你做得越多，就越会意识到，好吧，这条路径有这种权衡，那条路径有那种权衡。直到你看到这些分支路径，你才真正理解它们可能走向何方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and you can riff and you can explore in a nonlinear way all sorts of variations to really figure out visually and reason visually about what it is that resonates with you what feels right what doesn't feel right uh what solves your problems how do you constraint solve for the different outcomes and the more that you do that the more you realize okay I have this path but it has this trade-off, I have this path, it has this other trade-off. You don't actually understand that until you see those branching paths of where things can go.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 这个过程中，**AI**无法复制的部分是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What what what part of this process is it that AI can't replicate?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为设计师所拥有的背景知识，极其难以，甚至可能无法复制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I think that the context that designers have uh is extremely hard, perhaps impossible to replicate.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 想想你自己。你有一个生活过的背景。你有你的身份，还有你所有的经历。你一生中与物理世界中的各种事物互动过。你是你所接触和互动的各种文化的一部分。你带着通过所学语言形成的心智模型。然后，你进入一种体验，习惯了其他体验。设计师的任务是为你创造一些也适用于他人的东西。这是一个当下之事。它与当下的文化相关。它还需要实现商业目标。它需要是可测试的。并且基于这些测试，你可以进行迭代。但你不想达到局部最优，你想要达到全局最优。我认为**AI**离完成这项任务还很远。它肯定还没有达到能够让**AI**进行深入用户研究并理解最终客户的问题和需求的程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, think about yourself. You have a lived context. You have your identity, but also all of your experiences. You have all sorts of things you've interacted with in the physical world across your life. You're part of various cultures that you intersect with and interact with. Uh and you come with mental models informed by the languages that you've learned. Uh and from there you're coming into an experience being used to other experiences. Uh and then the designer's task is to create something for you that also applies to others. And it's a thing of the moment. It is related to the culture of the moment. And it also needs to achieve business goals. It needs to be something that's testable. And that based on those tests, you can iterate on it. But you don't want to get to a local max. You want to get to the global max. And uh I I just don't think that AI is very close to doing that task yet. uh it's definitely not close to the point of getting to where you can actually have AI do deep user research and understand the problems and the needs of the end customer.

### 全球品味与设计未来

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你认为世界各地的品味会趋同还是分化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Do you think taste around the world will diverge or come together?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我在2016年去过中国，只去过一次。那里的文化令人惊叹，我从未见过如此热情好客的人们。我遇到的人都非常棒。你在那里乘坐地铁，看看人们使用手机应用程序的方式，以及它们的设计方式，它们与美国的设计完全不同。排版的密度、对超级应用的偏好，以及人们普遍与技术互动的方式。是的，它就是完全不同的。所以，我认为分化首先已经存在了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, I went to China in 2016. I've only been there once. Uh and amazing culture, the most uh hospitality I've ever found in the world. And uh the people I met were just incredible. You ride the subway there and you look at uh the way that people use mobile applications and the way they're designed and they're just completely different in the United States. The density of the typography, the bias towards a super app uh and the way that people are are in general interacting with technology there. Yeah, it's it's just completely different. So I think the divergence already exists first of all.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为反例是好莱坞，不知何故，我们有了这种美国的媒体输出，它已成为一种全球现象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh I think the counter example would be Hollywood where somehow uh we've got this American export of media that has become a global phenomenon. M

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 即使在今天这个世界上，更多内容是从底层自发创造出来的，好莱坞和美国媒体综合体仍然拥有令人难以置信的巨大影响力，能够影响文化。所以，我认为，也许对于品味的最低公分母来说，它是一种普遍且更统一的东西。但我想，当你开始进入任何特定的细分市场时，我认为未来我们会看到更多这样的细分市场，我们现在已经看到了，那么我认为这些亚文化会创造出自己的审美、自己的观点，以及自己的语言，有时围绕着它们所重视的东西以及它们看待世界的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and even in today's age where more content is being created bottoms up across the world, Hollywood and the uh sort of American media complex has incredible enormous reach and ability to influence culture. And so I think that perhaps uh for the lowest common denominator of taste that's something that is pervasive and more uniform. But I think as you start to go into any given niche, which I think we'll see a lot more of those niches going forward, we already are, then I think that those subcultures create their own aesthetic, their own point of view uh and sort of their own language and sometimes around uh what they are valuing and how they see the world.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 十年后设计会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What is design going to look like in 10 years time?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 十年是很长的时间，尤其是在**AI**作为一种混沌力量，可能呈指数级增长的世界里，现在要做出预测很难。但如果你真的画出那种指数曲线，地球的每一寸都将被数据中心覆盖，所以有些东西可能最终无法跟上指数增长，或者我们可能在太空中建造数据中心，我不知道。无论如何，我相信设计的角色将继续提升。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: 10 years is a long time to make predictions about right now in a world where AI is a chaotic force that uh could be exponential but then if you really draw that exponential the earth is covered every square inch of data centers uh so something might not eventually keep up with the exponential or perhaps we have data centers in space I don't know in any case I believe that the role of design will continue to uh elevate And

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那么软件真正的护城河是什么？现在我认为，数据流动性、市场流动性、社交互动流动性，这些都是护城河。有些企业，个人以某种方式互动，或者存在监管限制，这可能成为护城河。但我们可以举出更多例子。但总的来说，我认为现在的软件比过去拥有更少的护城河。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: what are the real moes in software? Now I think that uh liquidity liquidity of data liquidity in a marketplace uh liquidity of social interaction um those are modes. There are businesses where you have these individuals interacting in a certain way uh or there's regulatory constraints that could be a moat. But we can name many more. But in general, I think that a lot less software has modes than in the past.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且软件也更容易创建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And also software is so much easier to create.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 现在，我并不认为你可以通过“氛围编程”的方式就能达到**Salesforce**或**Workday**的水平。我认为现在说这种话的人可能有点过度推断了。但我认为总的来说，我们将看到更多的竞争，而设计将是你成败的关键因素，技艺和观点也将如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Now, I'm not of the mind that you're going to go and uh vibe code your way to Salesforce or Workday. I think the people that are saying that right now are maybe extrapolating a bit too much. But I think in general we're going to uh see so much more competition and design will be a huge part of why you win or lose as will craft as will point of view

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但“氛围编程”似乎有点式微，而你们并没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: but it seems like vibe coding is tailing off a bit but you are not tailing off.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我们看到它持续增长。对于**Figma**来说，我认为在B2B领域，帮助设计师、产品经理以及与设计师相关的所有人，能够以更简单的方式进行原型设计，并将产品投入生产，或者制作内部应用程序，这是一个刚刚开始的用例。所以我认为它是分叉的。也有消费者方面，我们当然也很关心。我的意思是，让人们能够接触设计，让他们能够创造和表达，这对我们来说非常非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah we have seen it continue to grow. Um, and for Figma, I think that the opportunity to help in the B2B context, designers, product managers, anyone adjacent to designer be able to prototype in an easier way as well as get things into production or make an internal app. Uh, that is a use case that's just starting. So, I think it's bifurcated. There's a consumer aspect too and we care about that of course. I mean getting people the access to design, their ability to create and express that's so so important to us.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且，我相信我们现在的重点，以及我们真正努力确保做到世界一流的事情，更多地是在B2B方面，因为我认为它最终会转移到消费者方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And also uh I believe that um you know our focus right now and the thing that we are really trying to make sure that we are world class at is more of that B2B side because I think it transfers over the consumer side later on.

</details>

### AI与公司领导

**Nicolola Tangen**: 与**ChatGPT**的整合有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How important is the integration with the chatb?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 对我们来说，聊天仍然是一个学习的时刻。所以我们正在**FigJam**的背景下探索它，**FigJam**是我们的白板、图表、头脑风暴产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Chat is a learning moment for us still. So we are exploring that in the context of Fig Jim, our whiteboarding, diagramming, brainstorming product.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 看到人们如何利用他们在这些**ChatGPT**会话中创建的上下文，然后通过我们在**ChatGPT**上的**Figma**应用程序将其带入**FigJam**，这真的非常酷，我们正在学习很多。现在给出答案还为时过早。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And uh it's been really cool to see how people are using the context they create in these chatbt sessions in order to then bring into Fig Jam uh with our Figma app on Chat GBT and we're learning a lot. It's it's too early to to really give an answer there.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: **AI**如何改变你领导公司的方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How is um AI changing the way you lead the company?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为非常重要的是，不仅是我们的研发团队，而且整个公司都具备**AI**素养。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So I think that it's really important that not just our R&D team but the company in general have AI fluency and

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这不仅仅意味着削减成本，因为我认为人们在谈到**AI**时，有两种思维框架。我总是回想起大约九、十个月前，我和邻居共进晚餐的情景。他们有两个青少年，一男一女，都在上高中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: this doesn't just mean like cost cutting because I think there's sort of two frameworks people come from when it comes to AI. Uh, and I I always think back to uh this dinner I was at maybe nine months ago, 10 months ago with a neighbor. And uh they have two teenagers, uh, a boy and a girl, both in high school. And

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 饭桌上的问题是：“你们如何使用**AI**？”儿子说：“嗯，我能和朋友们多玩一会儿，多锻炼身体。我爱**AI**。它帮我做了很多作业。太棒了。”女儿说：“是的，它真的很有帮助。我用它生成了三倍的问题集，这样我就可以为即将到来的考试好好学习了。而且，它作为我的学习助手真是太棒了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: the question at the dinner table was, "How do you use AI?" And the son says, "Well, I I get to hang out with my friends more. I get to work out more. Uh, love an AI. It's doing a lot of my homework for me. It's great." The daughter goes, "Yeah, it's been really, really helpful. I have used it to generate 3x the problem sets so I can really study for the tests ahead. Uh, and it's been amazing as a learning assistant for me."

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我猜你属于后者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I suspect you are in the letter camp.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我更倾向于“我想从一切事物中尽可能多地学习”这一类，但我认为这也适用于公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah, I'm much more in the like I want to learn as much as possible from everything, but I think it's applicable to companies, too. Yeah.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我不是说非此即彼。你可以两者兼顾。但你是会只专注于削减成本，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I'm not saying it's an either or. You can do both. But are you going to be exclusively focused on cost cutting

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 还是会寻找**AI**带来的新机遇？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: or are you going to look for the new opportunities that AI enables?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，我认为如果你过早地专注于削减成本，只会减缓整个过程，因为人们不想被裁员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, so I think if you focus in on cost cutting too early, you're just going to slow down the whole process because people don't want to be uh you know cut.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，这也是一方面。但我还认为，有机会让人们更高效地工作，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, that too. Uh but I also think that there's an opportunity to make it that people are more productive

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且以更好的方式完成工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: but also doing their job in a better way.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。它有影响吗？回到提高上限的问题，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah. Does it have implications? Going back to raising the ceiling,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 它对你招聘人才有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: does it have implications for what implications does it have for who you hire?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们有多少人？你们是1千，多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So you know how many people? You are 1, how many00?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 大约1800人左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: About 1,800ish

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 现在1800人。那么这对你招聘人才意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 1,800 now. So what does it mean for who you hire?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为这是软件行业目前正在经历的关键辩论之一：**AI**是否意味着你应该招聘资深人士、中层人士、初级人士，或者所有工作都会消失，因为**AI**会取代它们？我听过最后一种说法很多次，但它还没有实现。所有说过这种话的人都在继续招聘。所以我的偏见实际上更倾向于初级人员。我认为年轻人以一种年长者必须学习的方式，是**AI**原住民。这并不意味着我们不招聘混合型人才。我们会的。在**Figma**，我们一直都有不同资历水平的混合型人才。但我认为重要的是，人们首先要明白我们正在全力以赴地进入**AI**时代。所以如果你对**AI**有偏见，那只是我们之间很棒的餐桌谈话，但我们非常专注于为这个**AI**时代而建设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: You know, I think this is uh one of the critical debates that the software industry is going through right now is does AI mean that you should hire senior people or middle level or junior or or all the jobs going to go away because AI will replace them all. Uh I've heard that one the last one a bunch of times and then it hasn't come true yet. All the people have said that they continue to hire. So I my bias actually is a lot more towards the junior folks. And I think that people that are younger are AI native in a way that folks that are older uh have to learn. And that doesn't mean that we don't hire a mix. We do. Uh we've always had a mix of you know seniority levels at Figma. But I think that it is important that people come in first of all knowing that we're pushing full steam ahead into the AI era. So if you have a bias against AI, that's a great dinner table conversation between us, but we're very focused on making sure that we build for this AI age.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们员工的平均年龄是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What's the average age of your people?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我手头没有那个数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh I don't have that number off hand.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你觉得呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What do you think?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我猜大概35、36岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I would guess about uh 35 36.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的。这对你们招聘人才的来源有影响吗？是比以前更窄了还是更广了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Okay. Does it have any implications for um the pool you hire from? Is it narrower or wider than before?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们招聘的范围只会随着时间变得越来越广。看到这种增长真是不可思议，因为我回想起**Figma**最早的日子，招聘是如此困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: The pool we're hiring from has only grown wider over time. Uh been kind of incredible to see that growth because I think back to the earliest days of Figma and recruiting was so hard.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 不，我的意思是，我相信你们有成千上万的人申请，但人才的类型，他们所受的教育背景，是否有所改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: No, but I mean you I'm sure you've got thousands of people applying but the type of people, the type of educational background that they have, has that changed at all?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 不，我们没有。我确保我们在招聘过程中不看学位。所以，也许有些偏见会悄悄溜进来，但我的观点是，你是否大学毕业不应该重要，因为从我自己的角度来看，我没有大学毕业。而且我认为不幸的是，大学学位的价值在外部认知上会急剧下降，这不一定是指大学教育本身的价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: No, we don't. um I made sure that we don't look at degrees uh as part of the hiring process. So, uh perhaps there's bias that slips in somewhere, but my point of view is that it shouldn't matter whether you've graduated college or not because coming from my own perspective, I didn't graduate from college. uh and I think that unfortunately the value of a college degree will be uh plummeting in terms of external perception not necessarily the value of the college education.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为如果你能负担得起，大学会是一个很棒的地方。但话虽如此，我认为，回到餐桌上的谈话，你怎么知道某人真的从他们的文凭上学到了他们所说的一切？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh I think that college will be a amazing place if you can afford it. But uh that said I think that you know going back to that dinner table conversation how do you know that someone actually learned all the things they said they did from their diploma?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你认为如果你大学毕业，你的人生会更好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Do you think do you think you would have done better in life if you had graduated from college?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这取决于你谈论的是哪个维度。反事实总是很难的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh just depends on the dimension you're talking about. Uh you know the counterfactual joke sorry the counterfactual is always hard right? Uh but um

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 抱歉。但当你招聘时，你不在乎他们有什么样的学位，无论是医生、科学家还是经济学家，我的意思是，你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: but I'm sorry. But so when you hire you you don't care about what kind of degree they have whether they are like a doctor or scientist or you know economist or I mean how do you

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我的意思是，我们曾经招聘过一位数据科学家，他就是化学博士毕业的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I mean look we've had uh one of our first data science hires for example he came out of a chem chemistry PhD.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么你寻找的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So what do you look for then? So

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们寻找的是技能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: we look for the skill

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 对吧？而这种技能的一个指标可以是正规教育，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: right? And uh one indicator of that skill can be formal education,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但也可以是你做过的项目、你的工作经验，以及你如何度过时间。这些都是可以作为指标的。我认为最重要的是，也是我一直在**Figma**努力推动的，是如何找到那些展现出巨大“坡度”（tremendous slope）的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: but also projects you've done, job experiences you've had, uh the way that you spend your time. These are all things that also indicate. And I think what's most important and something that I'm always pushing for at Figma is how do we find the people that are showing tremendous slope?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 他们正在快速进步。如果你进行外推，是的，这有高风险，存在一些风险。你不知道他们会是A++，还是实际上他们真的很初级，这已经是他们的上限了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: They're improving at a rapid rate. And if you extrapolate out, uh yes, it's high beta. There's some risk involved. you don't know if they're going to be A++ or actually they are really junior and this is this is the ceiling.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你如何评估“坡度”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How do you assess how do you assess slope?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我只是和人们谈论他们的背景、他们的历史、他们如何处理生活中的不同决定，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I just talk to people about their backgrounds, their history, how they've approached different decisions in life

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 并了解他们重视什么，以及他们如何推动自己成长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and understand what it is that they value and how they've pushed themselves to grow.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且我认为，人们在历史上的决策以及这些决策的一致性，能告诉你很多关于他们的成长型思维以及他们喜欢如何提升自己的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh, and I think that the decisions people make historically and the consistency of that tells you a lot about uh, their growth mindset and the way that they like to level up

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 以及他们如何挑战自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and how they challenge themselves.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，我总是希望团队里有成长型思维的人，因为在**Figma**我们总是在成长，总会遇到新问题。我们需要适应性强的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, I always want people with a growth mindset because we're always growing at Figma. We're always encountering new problems. We need people that are adaptable.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且，我认为，是的，不幸的是，人类存在一种偏见，即把一个人看作是某个时间点上的状态，这并不是一个非常有用的框架。相反，你应该思考，好吧，他们过去在哪里，他们将走向何方？而且，如果你在第一次见到某人两年后再次见到他们，另一种偏见是回想并认为，好吧，我的第一印象就是他们在我心中的样子，他们永远都会是那样。你真的需要能够更新你的看法。我当然也曾犯过这样的错误，错失了与我本想合作的人一起工作的机会，因为我更新得不够快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And, uh, I think that, yeah, it's it's unfortunately such a bias on the human side. This is for all humans to really look at somebody as a point in time and it's just not a very helpful framework. Instead, you want to think about, okay, where have they been and where are they going? And also, if you meet someone two years after you met them the first time, it's another bias to think back and go, okay, my first impression, that is who they are in my mind, and they're always going to be that way. You really need to be able to update. I've certainly been guilty of that uh and missed the opportunity to work with people that I would have loved to work with uh because I didn't update fast enough.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，我认为这也是我高度关注的一点，就是确保你真的更新你的先验判断。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, I think that's something I'm hyper aware of too is just making sure that you really do update your priors there.

</details>

### 辍学与Thiel奖学金

**Nicolola Tangen**: 让我们回到你从**布朗大学**辍学的那一刻。你申请了这个奖学金，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Let's um if we just move back to uh to the moment when you dropped out of uh Brown. So, you you applied for this um the fellowship, right?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我想你在申请中写道你讨厌巧克力。所以你很有名，因为你是

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I think you wrote in your application that you hated chocolate. So you're quite famous for

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 美国最著名的巧克力厌恶者之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: one of the most famous chocolate haters uh in the United States.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们有好几个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: There are several of us

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，你当时20岁，是如何下定决心辍学的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: now. Um how did you have the conviction of dropping out of college at age 20?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 其实我没有。我当时坚信我需要去探索设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: You know I didn't. Um I had conviction that I needed to go explore design

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以我第二次签约去**Flipboard**工作。第一次我是软件工程实习生，做一些数据科学工作和推荐引擎、机器学习——非常基础的机器学习，让我澄清一下。然后他们愿意让我回去，让我加入设计团队。我当时真的没有任何正式的设计背景，所以我不太清楚他们为什么会接受，但我当时不想说不，那是一个机会，能和他们一起工作六个月，我想这会为我的学业提供信息，也许我会在**RISD**（罗德岛设计学院）多上一些课，它就在**布朗大学**对面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and so I had signed up to go work at Flipboard a second time. first time I was a software engineering intern and doing some data science work and recommendation engines machine learning very basic machine learning let me be clear uh and then they were willing to have me back and have me on the design team I had really no formal design background so I didn't really know why they were open to it but I was uh I didn't want to you know say no it was a gift and the chance to work with them for six months I thought this will inform my studies maybe I'll take more classes at Risy which is across the street from Brown

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 也许这会帮助我确定在剩下的一年半时间里我想去哪里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and uh perhaps this will help me inform where I want to go with the year and a half left.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以那所大学是美国顶尖的设计学院，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So is the college the premier design school in America, right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这是一个不可思议的

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It's an incredible

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 一个不可思议的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: incredible place.

**Dylan Field**: 我只是想确保我的学业方向正确。所以我决定从**布朗大学**休学一个学期。我会在2013年而不是2013年下半年毕业。与此同时，就在我即将离开**布朗大学**之前，我开始和**Evan**交谈，他后来成了我的联合创始人。他是我遇到过的最聪明的人。我在实习期间和一些非常了不起的人一起工作过。那些人后来创办了上市公司，他们当时是工程师，会在凌晨2点冲进办公室，比如**Jarraps**（我当时想到的是他，在**LinkedIn**）。我还遇到过创造了**Java**编程语言的人。而**Evan**，在22、23岁时，就已经达到了那个水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And I wanted to just make sure I was informing my studies right. And so I decided I'll take a semester off from Brown. I'll graduate, you know, instead of 2013 2013.5. And uh at the same time, right before I was about to leave Brown, I started talking with Evan, who later became my co-founder. and he was the smartest person I'd ever encountered. And I had worked with some incredible people in my internships. People that have gone on to start, you know, publicly traded companies that were then engineers who had run in the office, run into the office at 2 am jarraps, for example. That's who I'm thinking of there, uh, LinkedIn. And I met, you know, people that had, uh, done things like created Java, the programming language. And, uh, at, you know, 22, 23 years of age, Evan was up there. Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 他拥有天才般的才能和洞察力。我想，好吧，如果能有机会和**Evan**一起工作，我将比我一生中做的任何其他事情学到更多。这将是我能拥有的最独特的机会。所以我问他，你有没有想过创业？我很惊讶他对此感兴趣。从那时起，我们开始探索。我不知道它是否会成功，但我还是申请了**Thiel奖学金**，以防万一。然后，我们开始每个周末讨论想法，制作原型，很快我就觉得，“好吧，无论我们是否获得**Thiel奖学金**，我们都要去做这件事。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh he has genius level talent and insight. And I thought, okay, if there's a chance to work with Evan, I will learn more from that than from anything else I can do in my life. This would be the most unique opportunity I could ever have. And so I asked him, would you ever want to think about starting a company? And I was very surprised that he was interested. And from there, uh we started to explore. And I didn't know if it would converge, but I applied for the tail fellowship just in case. And then as we started to, you know, every weekend talk about ideas, prototype things, pretty quickly I was like, "Okay, well, whether or not we get the Teal Fellowship, let's go do this.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我有点积蓄。也许我们会靠吃拉面，住在糟糕的公寓里，但我们会让它实现。然后有了**Thiel奖学金**以及获得支持的能力，两年内10万美元，这让我们住进了不错的公寓，还有**全食超市**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I have a little bit of savings. You know, maybe we're going to live on ramen and live in a bad apartment, but like we'll make it happen." And then with the Teal Fellowship and the ability to actually have that support, 100K over two years, that made it a nice apartment with uh Whole Foods.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，对于不了解的人，这个奖学金是由风险投资家**Peter Thiel**创立的。告诉我这个奖学金是关于什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So just uh to fill in here for people who don't know the the partnership is it's made by Peter the right who's the venture capitalist. Tell me what's the fellowship about?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，**Thiel奖学金**，我认为它是一种赋能年轻人的方式，让他们能够去探索想法，摆脱许多人在生命早期所经历的传统轨道。我真的开始在心里把它看作是一种“生命加速器”，而不是其他任何东西。我没有做过相关的研究，但我确实认为**Thiel奖学金**获得者平均来说结婚更快，生孩子更快。他们最终会到达他们无论如何都会去的地方，但速度要快得多。所以有一些**Thiel奖学金**获得者，他们辍学后，自己工作了两年，然后实际上回到了学术界，但直接进入了博士项目。他们只是没有经历本科阶段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah so the teal fellowship uh I think of it as a way to uh empower young people to make it so they can go explore ideas and get off of sort of the traditional tracked existence that many folks have earlier in life. And I've really started to frame it in my mind as more of a life accelerant than anything else. Uh I haven't done like a study of it, but I actually think that tail fells on average have uh they get married faster, they have kids faster. Uh you know, they end up in the place that they're going to go anyway, but just on a much quicker pace. So there are te fellows who they dropped out of undergrad, they worked on their own for two years and they actually went back to academia but like in a PhD program. They just never did the undergrad thing.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 现在还有多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Uh there how many other now?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 每年有20人。从2011年开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, there's 20 per year. It's been going since 2011. Uh the I think

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们会一起出去玩吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: do you hang out together?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，那实际上是奖学金的关键部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah, that was actually a critical part of the fellowship. Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我离开**布朗大学**后的社交经历很奇怪。我在家乡的朋友都很棒。我在索诺玛县长大，离我当时居住的帕洛阿尔托不远，只有几个小时的路程，但他们都在非常不同的轨道上，努力弄清楚自己的生活，他们的生活都走向了不同的方向。我在**布朗大学**的朋友，主要是计算机科学的朋友，也有一些是文科和理科的，他们都在努力弄清楚大学毕业后的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: The social experience I had after uh leaving Brown was weird. Like I had my friends back home who were amazing. I grew up in Sonoma County, so it wasn't that far away from Palto where I was living a few hours away, but they were all on very different tracks trying to figure out their lives and they're all all their lives were going divergent directions. And I had my friends back at Brown, uh, mostly computer science friends, uh, some that were in the liberal arts as well and, uh, sciences, and they were all trying to figure out what's my job after college.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我还有**Flipboard**的朋友。他们都比我大十岁或更多。他们的生活和我的非常不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I had my friends from Flipboard. They were all a decade older than me or more. Uh, and they had very different lives than I did.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 而你当时正在经营一家公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And you were running a company.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我当时正在经营一家公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah, I was running a company. And

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 20岁，10个人。他们是怎么做的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 20 years old, 10 people. So, how did they

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那时甚至不到10人。我的意思是，一开始只有我和**Evan**。你知道，在那个时候，这是一种生存危机。我们花了九个月的时间，有点像存在主义地凝视虚空，你知道，真的有点荒诞地思考我们到底在做什么。我们试图弄清楚我们该走向哪个方向。我们有**WebGL**这把“锤子”，那“钉子”是什么？我们只是不断尝试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Not even 10 then. I mean, it was uh, it was just me and Evan at the start. And you know it's it's existential at that point in time. It took us nine months of sort of existential looking into the void uh and you know really kind of absurdist thought to figure out what we were doing. We were trying to figure out you know which direction we go. We've got this hammer of WebGL. What's the nail? And we just kept trying things. And

</details>

### 产品发布与招聘策略

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以你花了，回顾起来你说你花了四年时间才发布产品，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so you spent you spent quite in retrospect you've said that you you spent four years building the product before you launched right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我们于2012年8月开始，2015年12月发布了封闭测试版，2016年10月正式发布。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It was uh August 2012 we started we launched our closed beta December 2015 and the GA released in October 2016.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 直到2017年夏天才开始收费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Didn't start charging till summer 2017.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但在那整个过程中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh but yeah throughout that all

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你应该早点发布吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: should have should you have launched earlier?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 哦，是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Oh yeah of course.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你当时有什么可以发布的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And how well did you have anything to launch?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，我们总是有东西。问题是它是否足够好？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh well we always had something uh the question was was it good enough?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 然后你问，好吧，我们怎么才能更快？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And then you ask okay well how could we have moved faster and

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你是不是一个完美主义者？不愿发布直到

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: and were you just a perfectionist? didn't want to launch until

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我绝对是一个完美主义者，过去是，现在也是。我必须不断审视这种偏见。但我也认为，我们真正能更快行动的方法是，我们应该更快地招聘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I'm definitely a perfectionist was an am I have to constantly check that bias. Uh but also I think that the uh the real thing we could to move faster is we should have hired faster

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 为了更快地招聘，我应该更关注公司文化，我应该更快地学会如何管理人员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and to hire faster I should have been more on top of the culture and I should have figured out how to manage people faster.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我当时是一个糟糕的管理者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I was a bad manager.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的。但你当时有资金招聘吗？你能招聘吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Okay. But did you have the capital to hire? Could you have hired?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们确实有资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: We did have the capital.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 有一种叫做“闪电式扩张”（blit scaling）的东西，对吧？你希望非常快速地扩张。那么，告诉我，你当时是如何考虑速度的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: There's this thing called blit scaling, right? You you want to scale very fast. So just tell me how how were you thinking about speed at that stage?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我当时想的是我们必须把所有事情都做对。我们必须做出完美的轮胎。我们必须做出完美的产品。我当时太沉浸在“事情只有一个解决方案”的模式中。其实不是。事情往往有很多很多解决方案。只有一个解决方案的情况很少见。我想我当时没有完全理解这一点。而且我认为，在公司成立之初，我缺乏每天多次审视招聘漏斗的严谨性和纪律性，去思考“谁在流程中？他们在流程的哪个阶段？我如何让他们进入下一个阶段？”我认为那应该是我痴迷的事情，但我却痴迷于产品。我并不是说那是一件坏事，显然我仍然痴迷于产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I was thinking about we got to get everything right. We got to make the perfect tires. We got to make the perfect product. I was too much in the mode of there's one solution to things. There's not. There's often many many solutions to things. It's rare that there's one solution. And I think I didn't fully appreciate it then. And also I think I lacked at the start of the company the rigor and discipline to every day many times a day be looking at that recruiting funnel and going okay who's in process where are they in process how am I going to get them to the next stage and I think that should have been my obsession instead I was obsessed with the product and I'm not saying that was a bad thing uh obviously I'm still obsessed with the product but

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但你当时应该痴迷于增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: you were trying to be obsessed about growth

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以你当时应该花时间招聘，而不是编写软件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so you should have been spending time hiring rather than writing software

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为我应该两者兼顾。我认为最优秀的创始人会想办法把所有事情都做好，而我当时把所有时间都投入到了产品上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh I think I should have been doing both. I think the best founders figure out how to do it all and I think I allocated my time entirely towards the product.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你当时招聘的是什么样的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What type of people were you hiring at the stage?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 工程师、设计师，还有运营职位。没有什么特别的。但回顾起来，我认为我们当时招聘了一些非常优秀的人才。但总的来说，如果我们招聘得更快，如果我当时拥有现在的思维模式，我们本可以更快地构建它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Engineers, designers, uh, you know, ops roles. Uh, nothing that was too out there. But yeah, I think that um, in retrospect, we made some great hires during that time. But overall, if we had hired faster and if I had had the mindset I have now back then, we could have built it a lot quicker.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 如果你招聘得那么快，你能招聘到超级人才吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Can you can you hire a super people if you hire that super fast?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 哦，是的。但这需要一种招聘能力，公司里的每个人都必须接受。每个人都必须真正地保持一致，明白我们必须去寻找、吸引并留住世界上最优秀的人才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Oh, yes. Uh but I think it requires uh a recruiting muscle that everyone in the company has to embrace. Everyone has to really be aligned and on the same page that we have to go find and ret get, you know, we have to go find and we have to go attract and then retain the best folks in the world.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这其中有一种动量。如果你没有这种动量，如果你没有能力真正推动并让事情运转起来，它就永远不会真正启动。相反，当你找到一个人时，它会以小规模冲刺的方式进行，而你真的需要并行推进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And there's a momentum to it. If you don't have the momentum, if you don't have the ability to uh really push and get that ball rolling, it just never quite starts. and it goes in instead in little sprints when you find one person and you really have to parallel path it.

</details>

### 微软的建议与产品创新

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们开始收费是因为**微软**告诉你们，如果不收费他们就无法购买，因为你们无法生存，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And is it right that you started to charge because Microsoft told you that if you don't charge we can't buy because you're not going to survive. Is that right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，故事就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yes, it is the story.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 当时很惊讶，我的意思是他们态度很好。告诉我那件事的人实际上还在**微软**，他是一个很棒的人。但他们确实来到了我们的办公室，说：“嘿，很多人都在用你们的软件。它对我们来说开始变得有点重要了。你们的商业模式是什么？”我当时说：“哦，我们会想办法的。”他说：“是的，这很合理。你们为什么还在等？”我说：“嗯，我知道产品还不够好。”这又回到了完美主义的问题。而且我只是觉得如果免费传播会更快。他们说：“嗯，如果免费，你们可能会倒闭，所以我们想确保你们不会。我们不能依赖一个随时可能倒闭的软件来处理关键业务，所以请收费。”那时我才意识到：“哦，我想我们真的落后了。”我回到团队，说我们必须收费。我们必须把定价搞定。每个人都说：“呃，是的，当然。我们一直在告诉你们。”所以，你知道，有时我有点慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It was a surprise uh when I mean they're so nice about it. Uh the person that told me that is actually still at Microsoft and he's just a wonderful guy. Um, but yeah, they came to our office and they're like, "Hey, got a lot of people using your software. It's starting to be kind of important for us. What's your business model?" And I'm like, "Oh, well, we're going to figure it out." He said, "Yeah, uh, that makes sense. Why are you waiting?" Said, "Well, I, you know, I know the product's not good enough yet." Going back to perfectionism, uh, and I I just think it'll be spread faster if it's free. and they said, "Well, uh, if it's free, you could go out of business, and so we want to make sure you don't we cannot rely on software for critical operations is gonna could go out of business, so please charge money." And, uh, that was the point where I'm like, "Oh, I think we're really behind here." Came back to the team, we got to charge. We got to get pricing in order. And everyone's like, "Uh, yes, duh. We've been telling you this." So, you know, sometimes a little slow.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你如何看待产品创新和发布？我的意思是，你们现在发布了很多产品，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How do you think about product innovation and and launches? I mean, now you're launching loads of products, right? Yeah.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你如何思考要解决哪些问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How do you think about which problems to solve?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: **Figma**有趣的地方在于，其核心是**Figma Design**工具。它是为设计师，为创建数字软件的人而设计的。尽管如此，我们看到人们用它做了更多的事情。我们看到人们创建复杂的插图。我们看到人们用它来白板、画图、头脑风暴幻灯片，用它来制作生产图形、网站，制作非常复杂的原型等等。每次我们看到、注意到并观察到这些用例在**Figma**内部增长时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So the interesting thing about Figma is the Figma design tool at the core of it all. Uh made for designers, made for people creating digital software. And despite that, we see people doing so much more with it. We see people creating complex illustrations. We see people, you know, using it for whiteboarding, diagramming, brainstorming slides, uh, using it for production graphics, making websites, making really complex prototypes and more. And each time we start to see and notice and watch these use cases grow inside of Figma,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们都会尝试将它们提取到自己的产品界面中。我们这样做的原因是因为，否则，如果你针对一个用例进行优化，比如幻灯片，并且你围绕它进行构建。好吧，那么**Figma Design**就需要演示者备注和所有其他幻灯片功能，或者如果你尝试进行图表和白板，你需要打包一堆功能进去，这会使数字设计产品**Figma Design**变得更复杂，更难以亲近。但如果你将其提取到自己的空间中，那么你就可以真正帮助它找到自己的生命和自己的观点。例如，**FigJam**是一个我们真正专注于乐趣的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: we try to pull them out into their own product surfaces. The reason we do that is because otherwise if you're optimizing for a use case like slides for example and you make it so that you really build around it. Okay, well now Figma design needs presenter notes and it needs all this other slides functionality or if you're trying to do diagramming and whiteboarding there's a bunch of features you're going to need to pack in there and that makes the digital design product Figma design more complex. It makes it less approachable. But if you pull it out into its own space, then you can actually help it find its own life and its own point of view. So for example, Fig Jam is a product that we really lean into fun on.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: **FigJam**是一个产品，我们探索了所有这些我们想要创造的想法，以给人们带来快乐。比如表情符号反应、光标聊天、图章、贴纸，以及，你知道，如何在头脑风暴期间设置计时器并播放一些音乐，所有这些小细节，如果我们在**Figma Design**中开始做这些，人们会说：“你挡了我的路，停下来。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Fig Jam is a product that uh we explored all these ideas that we wanted to create to bring joy to folks. things like uh emoji reactions, cursor chat, stamps, stickers, uh as well as, you know, how can I set a timer during a brainstorm and have some music play, you know, all these little details that if we had started in Figma design for those, people would have said, you're getting in my way, stop.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但在**FigJam**中，你可以挥动光标，如果你与其他人相交，它会给你一个击掌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: But instead in Fig Jam, you can wave your cursor around and it gives you a high five if you intersect with someone else,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 你知道，其中一些东西我们后来也带到了**Figma Design**中，但拥有自己的空间来发展、成长并找到自己的声音，这对**FigJam**来说至关重要。这对许多产品来说都至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: you know, and and it's just uh some of those things we later bring into Figma design, but having its own space to develop and to grow and find its own voice, that was really critical for Fig Jam. It's critical for many of the product.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 告诉我你们是如何在产品中融入乐趣的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Tell me how you're building kind of fun into the products.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. Well,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 因为这是一种深思熟虑的策略，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: because that's been a deliberate strategy, right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 对于**FigJam**来说，这确实是。我不认为所有产品都需要通过乐趣来差异化，但对于**FigJam**来说，这是我们一直以来的观点。它真的始于一次为期一天的设计冲刺。有点疯狂，竟然只有一天，但当时我们在疫情期间，所有人都远程工作。感觉为了让人们敞开心扉并进行头脑风暴，你该怎么做呢？嗯，乐趣、安全、心理安全，这些都很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: For Fig Jam, it's definitely been I don't think all of the products uh need to differentiate through fun, but for Fig Jam, that was our point of view and continues to be. And it really started with a one-day design sprint. Uh it's kind of wild that it was one day, but yeah, we're in COVID, everyone was remote. And it just felt like in order to get people to open up and to brainstorm, how do you do that? Well, fun, safety, psychological safety, that's important.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，我们真的努力融入了这方面的元素。结果非常棒。我的意思是，我认为在一天之内，我们一个小团队的设计师就产生了20到30个想法，其中大约有5个最终发布了。其中几个最终获得了专利。所有这些都来自一天的头脑风暴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And so, we really tried to lean into that aspect of it. And it was amazing. I mean, I think in one day we had a small team of designers generate 20 30 ideas, maybe five of them shipped. Uh several of them ended up, you know, being patented. Uh and all out of one day of brainstorming.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为有时，如果你能给团队明确的方向和指令，只要不碍事，他们就能做出最令人惊叹的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Just what I think it's sometimes it's like if you can give clear direction and directive to a team, they can just do the most amazing things if you get out of their way.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们现在也进行“狗食”（dogfooding），对吧？你们用自己的工具来

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And now you do dog fooding, right? You use your own tools to

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 一直如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: always have.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。用自己的工具来创造新产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah. use your own tools to create new products

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 一直如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: always.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 这如何加速创新？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How does that accelerate innovation?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。嗯，除非产品足够好，否则它不会加速创新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. Well, it doesn't until you get to the point where the product's good.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但我给你举一个**Figma**早期的一个例子。我现在再给你举一个例子。所以，在**Figma**的早期，我们对**Figma Design**进行了“狗食”。在达到某个点之后，我们唯一用来设计的东西就是**Figma Design**，这个点出现得相当早。有些日子我们破坏了构建，我们可怜的设计师说：“好吧，我要早点回家，因为你们没有修复。”所以，那很艰难，很快就形成了一种文化：“好吧，我们必须保证质量。我们不能让应用程序崩溃。我们不能在搞砸事情时让设计师如此生气。”所以，这立刻就建立了一个与客户的循环。客户恰好就在我们的团队中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: But, uh, I'll give an example from the earliest days of Figma. I'll give you an example now. So, in the early days of Figma, uh, we dog fooded Figma design. And the only thing we did design with after we got to a certain point, which was quite early, was Figma design. And there were days where we broke the build and our poor designer said, "Okay, I'm going to go home early because y'all don't have a fix." And so, uh, that was rough and it very quickly became a culture of, "Okay, we have to have quality. We can't just have the app crash. We can't make our designer so angry, uh, when we, you know, mess things up." And so, that really instilled right away a loop with the customer. The customer just happened to be on our team.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 展望今天。我的意思是，例如**Figma Make**或我们的**Dev Mode** MCP。这些工具确实帮助我们加速了工作、原型设计和我们能做什么的探索。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: moving forward today. I mean, Figma make for example or our dev modem MCP. Uh these are tools that really help us accelerate uh our work and our prototyping, our exploration of what we can do

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 更不用说我们正在开发中的一些东西了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and that's not even to mention some of the stuff that we've got in the pipeline.

</details>

### 疫情、文化与Adobe收购

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你提到其中一些是在疫情期间，那么疫情在某种程度上是如何帮助你们设计产品的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Now you mentioned that some of these was during COVID and so how did in a way how did co help you uh in designing products

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 因为你们身处各种不同的地方，而整个概念就是把人们联系在一起，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: because you were situated in all different types of places and in a way the whole concept is to tie people together, right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，这很有趣。你知道，在疫情之前，我们是完全面对面工作的。我的意思是，团队中有一两个人需要去其他地方，他们有足够的背景，所以我们说：“好吧，没问题。”但我的意思是，这只是人口中非常小的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah, it's interesting. you know, we were fully in person before COVID. I mean, I think there's one or two people that needed to go somewhere else in the team and they had had such context that we said, "Okay, fine." But, I mean, it was this very small part of the population.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 然后一夜之间，就像其他人一样，我们发现自己成了一个远程团队。我们很久以前就听说**Figma**非常适合远程工作，但我们从未体验过。然后突然我们发现，哦，是的，确实如此。但从商业角度来看，我认为疫情既没有减缓也没有加速我们，相反，我认为我们当时已经处于一个非常强劲的轨道上，那个轨道持续着。但当然，还有许多其他挑战，其他人也面临着，但如何在疫情期间为新员工创造文化呢？当我们开始时，我会为新员工举办早餐会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And then overnight, like everybody else, we found ourselves a remote team. We had heard for ages that Figma was great for remote work, but we never experienced it. And then suddenly we found out, oh yeah, it is. uh but yeah I don't think that from a business standpoint co either decelerated or accelerated us instead it was I think a we were already on a very strong trajectory at that point and uh that trajectory continued but certainly there were many other challenges uh that everyone else faced too but how do you create culture especially for new folks during co when we started uh I would do these breakfasts for new hires

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们会一起吃一个小时的早餐，然后讨论人们心中的各种问题。但后来我们增长得更快了，我突然意识到，如果我要以我认为合适的团队规模来举办所有必要的早餐会，我将不得不每周五天都吃早餐，持续很长一段时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: where we'd all have breakfast for an hour and we would just talk about different questions that were on people's minds. But then we started growing faster and suddenly I realized that if I were to uh do all the breakfast I needed to do with a group size I thought was right, I would be doing breakfast 5 days a week for the next, you know, whatever amount of time.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那时我不得不停止了那个活动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And that's when unfortunately I had to stop that one.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以不是所有事情都能经受住规模化的考验，但这并不是不做事情的理由。即使它们不是长期的解决方案，你也应该去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh so not everything survived scale, but that's not the reason to not do things. You should still do things even if they're not going to be the long-term solution.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以我们一起做了很多有趣的事情。例如，我们在疫情期间远程制作了一部音乐剧。我们在**Figma**有一个叫做“创客周”（maker week）的活动，整个公司会有一周的时间来制作任何对公司有益的东西，这不仅包括工程师、产品设计师，还包括研发部门的人员，任何想参与的人。是的，我们当时有一位新员工，他不仅拥有无可挑剔的工程背景，还能创作乐谱和制作音乐剧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So uh we did lots of fun things together. For example, we made a musical during co remotely. Uh we have a thing called maker week at Figma where the entire company gets a week to make anything that can be beneficial to the company and this includes not just engineers, product designers, uh you know people in the you know sort of R&D function it's anyone that wants to participate and uh yeah we had a new hire who had come from a background of not just impeccable engineering but also uh you know being able to create musical scores and making musicals.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这是他们的爱好之一。而且，我们团队里也恰好有一位百老汇明星。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: That's one of their passions. And uh we also happen to have a Broadway star on the team.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，你年轻时也演过戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, you were acting too when you were young.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 哦，是的。但我不是百老汇明星。我们有一位真正的、非常棒的百老汇明星，他拥有最美妙的嗓音。不，不，无法相比。而且还有很多其他人，他们都非常兴奋地表达自己，并一起享受乐趣。所以他们就做了这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Oh, yeah. But I wasn't a Broadway star. We had a legitimately like amazing Broadway star who had the most amazing voice. Uh no, not not comparable. Um and uh and also a lot of other people that were just very excited about expressing and having fun together. And so that was what they did.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 它在线上。你可以决定它是很棒还是令人尴尬。我认为它很棒，就我个人而言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And it's online. Uh you can decide whether it's awesome or cringe. Uh I think it's awesome for what it's worth.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。酷。然后**Adobe**出现，出价200亿美元收购你们公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah. Cool. And then out comes Adobe and offers you $20 billion for the company.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: That's true.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我的意思是，这相当惊人。但后来交易失败了。这对公司组织产生了什么影响？你以为会有一大笔钱到账，结果却没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I mean that's quite amazing. But then that it fell through. So how did it do to what did that do to the organization? You think there's a big check coming and then it ain't coming.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，是的，我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh yeah I mean

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那时你拥有公司多少股份？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: how much did you own with the company by then?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我忘了当时确切的持股比例了。大概10%左右吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh I forget the exact ownership at that time. It's probably uh 10ish% or so.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我认为首先，他们不是第一次来。这都是公开披露的。他们是一家很棒的公司，我认为**Figma**的几乎每个人不仅尊重他们，而且从小就使用他们的工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. I think that uh first of all, I mean it wasn't the first time they had come. It's all publicly disclosed. They are an amazing company and I think almost everyone at Figma has not just respect for them but also grew up using their tools.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，是的，我们是他们的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So yeah, we've we're big fans,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但在**Figma**成立之初，我们确实把他们看作竞争对手。我们认为我们将成为创意工具公司，专注于设计。根据我们看到的所有数据，软件设计市场非常小。我的意思是，劳工统计局说美国有25万设计师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: but um yeah, they at the start of Figma, we really thought about them as a competitor. Uh we thought we were going to go be the creative tools company and design. It was such a small market for software design according to all the data we saw. I mean the Bureau of Labor Stics said there was 250,000 designers in the United States

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 基于此，我们认为这会是一个开始，然后我们会扩展。碰巧市场以巨大的方式增长，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and based on that we thought okay this will be a start and then we'll expand out just so happened that market grew in a huge way

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们直觉认为它会像我们谈论的软件指数级增长和设计价值在堆栈中向上移动一样增长，设计会成为一个差异化因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: that we had intuition it would grow like we talked about with the exponential rise of software and the value of design moving up the stack and uh the design being a differentiator but

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我不认为我们真正理解它能增长多少，增长多快。所以我们突然发现自己处于一个世界，我们正在真正构建一个产品设计和开发平台。这再次符合我们的框架，消除想象与现实之间的鸿沟。其中一部分是让你能够从想法到发布数字产品。但它不再与**Adobe**竞争。有一段时间他们尝试过，但没有成功。他们将其弃用并置于维护模式。所以对我来说，这就像，好吧，我们现在足够大了，可以被吸收。这是一个经过深思熟虑的估值，我认为这个提案很好，关于我们能在**Adobe**的背景下做什么。坦率地说，我也看到了**AI**的趋势，那是在**ChatGPT**之前，但你可以看到那个趋势以及它可能走向何方。我不知道它会使我们的业务缩小十分之一还是扩大十倍，或者缩小百分之一还是扩大一百倍。我真的无法判断。它太混乱了。所以我想，好吧，加强数字。出于我提到的所有原因，以及其他一些原因，让我们去做吧。是的，我当时肯定认为它会通过。但它没有。团队真的，我为他们和我一起度过那个时期感到非常自豪。你知道，那是一个我们需要继续加速的时刻，无论我们是在**Adobe**旗下还是独立运营。我们必须保持全速前进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I don't think we truly appreciate how much and how fast it could grow and so we suddenly found ourselves elves in a world where we're really building out a platform for product design and development. Again, fit into our framework, eliminate the gap between imagination, reality. Well, part of that is making it so you can go from idea to a shipped digital product. But it wasn't competitive anymore with Adobe. There's a period of time where they tried, didn't work. They deprecated it uh and put on maintenance mode. So, to me, it was like, okay, we're big enough now where we could be absorbed. uh this is a very like wellthoughtout valuation and I think that the pitch uh I thought it was good about what we could do in the cont context of Adobe and also frankly you know I was looking around the corner at AI it was before chatbt but you could see that trend and where it might go and I uh I didn't know if it would onetenth or 10x our business or 100th or 100x our business I mean I I really couldn't tell. It was just so chaotic. And so I thought, okay, strengthen the numbers. And uh for all the reasons I mentioned and then some, let's do it. And uh yeah, the definitely thought that it would go through. It did not. Uh the team really I'm so proud of how they worked through that with with me. And you know it was a moment where we needed to continue accelerating whether we're going to be at Adobe or we're going to be independent. We had to keep our foot on the gas.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 团队做到了。团队表现出色，走出困境后，我们能够发布**Dev Mode**。然后第二年又发布了四个额外产品，我认为我们的创新速度和势头只增不减。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And the team did that. The team operated excellently and coming out of it we were able to launch dev mode. Uh and then the next year four additional products and I think our pace of innovation our momentum has only increased from there.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 然后你们就**IPO**了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And then you IPOed instead.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: That's correct.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你对**IPO**感到高兴吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Are you happy that you IPL?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 奇怪的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Odd, odd question. Um,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 不，这不奇怪，因为现在很多公司都选择保持私有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: no, because it's not odd because a lot of companies these days choose to be private.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，你看，我认为世界上有一些公司，比如**SpaceX**，他们完全有权想私有多久就私有多久。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, look, I mean, I think that there are some companies in the world like SpaceX where they have every right to be private as long as they want to.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: **AI**、**Dropics**，我的意思是，很多这样的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: AI, Dropics, I mean, lots of them.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为**Stripe**和**SpaceX**可能属于他们自己的一类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh, I think Stripe and SpaceX are maybe a class of their own there. M

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且，特别是**SpaceX**，他们没有理由需要上市，或者如果他们想保持私有，他们应该能够做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and uh SpaceX in particular, yeah, they have no reason why they need to go public or uh if they want to stay private, they should be able to do that.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 不是每家公司都是**SpaceX**，我认为我们是一家了不起的公司，但我们最终会上市。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Um not every company is a SpaceX and I think that we are an incredible company, but we're one that will eventually go public

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 问题是，如果你有一天要上市，为什么不是现在？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and the question is if you're going to go public one day, why not now?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我们准备好了。我很高兴我们做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: We were ready. Uh and I'm glad we did it.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 它当然会强制执行一定程度的纪律，但这种纪律我认为我们无论如何都应该具备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It forces a level of discipline of course but that's a discipline that I think we should have had anyway.

</details>

### 投资理念与领导力

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你现在正利用你的才华、思想和愿景投资于其他初创公司，比如无人机、加密货币等等。你认为哪些事情很有趣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Now you are using your talent and your thinking um and your visions to invest in other in other uh kind of startups like drones, crypto uh and so on. What are the kind of things that you are um that you think is interesting?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这更多是一个我发现不感兴趣的问题。我想不出任何东西。是的，我对世界总体上很好奇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It's more a question of I don't find interesting. I can't think of anything. uh the um yeah I'm pretty curious about the world in general and uh

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 无论是软件市场的某些部分，还是硬件，还是生命科学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh whether it be anything from you know certain uh parts of the software market to uh hardware to uh the life sciences. Um

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但你不可能投资所有东西。那么你选择投资哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: but I mean you can't invest in everything. So where do you choose to invest?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我的时间非常有限。所以我的重心在**Figma**上，我基本上把所有清醒的时间都花在**Figma**上。所以，我投资的东西必须非常令人兴奋，或者对世界非常有帮助，并且在经济上可行，因为我认为这两者是相辅相成的。如果你在经济上可行并且有帮助，那么你就能提供更多帮助，并且能够规模化。它必须让我夜不能寐，因为我真的会牺牲睡眠去评估和深入一项投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well look my time is very limited. So my focus is on Figma and I spend sort of uh I don't know basically all my waking hours on Figma. And so then something that I invest in has to be so exciting or be so helpful for the world and economically viable that because I think those two go together. If you are economically viable and helpful then you can be more helpful. and scales uh that it has to keep me up at night uh because I'm literally going to trade off sleep in order to go evaluate and dive into an investment.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且，如果真是这样，我的好奇心被极大地激发了，那么我就会投入时间和精力去了解这家公司，然后我还有一个额外的考验：我是否想继续投入这些时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh and if that is true, then my curiosity is so peaked, then yeah, I'll dive in and spend time and understand the company and then I have the additional test of do I want to keep spending that time?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 如果和那位创始人合作如此令人兴奋，因为他们太不可思议了，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And if it's so exciting to work with that founder because they're so incredible,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那时我才会进行投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: that's when I make an investment.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 让我们谈谈文化。你认为你的领导风格从一开始到现在有什么变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Let's um talk a bit about culture. So, how do you think your leadership style has changed from when you started until now?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我不确定我的领导风格变化了多少。我认为我领导的方式肯定有所演变。我认为我现在正在学习的教训与我过去学到的教训是相同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I'm not sure my leadership style has changed so much. I think the way that I lead has certainly evolved. Uh I think that the same lessons I'm learning now are the same lessons I've learned in the past.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 例如，我总是在学习，我需要阐明我的背景，更多地表达我的想法，更清晰地阐述我的想法，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh for example, I'm always learning that I need to unpack my context and give more of my thinking and articulate more of my thinking

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 来解释为什么。是的，这就像，你知道，你在做数学作业，你给出了答案。老师希望你展示你的解题过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: to explain why. Yeah, it's like the um you know, you're doing math homework and you show the answer. Well, the teacher wants you to show your work. And uh

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 为什么这很重要？为什么这很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: why is that important? Why is that important?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，我认为公司里的人拥有框架并理解你做事情的理由非常重要，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, I think it's really important that people in the company have frameworks and they understand your reasoning for things

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 因为如果他们不理解，那么当你不在场时，他们就无法复制你的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: because if they don't, then they cannot replicate your point of view when you're out of the room.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 如果你不把它提升到那个层面，他们也无法正确地辩论它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And if you don't elevate it to that level, they also cannot debate it properly.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 需要更多时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Takes more time.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。但你也能获得更好的思考。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yes. But also you get to better thinking.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 即使是写下一些东西也能帮助你思考。无论是写下来，还是进行深入辩论并将其记录下来，我认为这对于将你的思维和思考过程扩展到团队来说都非常有帮助。所以这是我一直在学习的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh even writing down something helps you think through it. And whether it's writing it down or it's a in-depth debate that then gets memorialized somewhere, I think it's really helpful in terms of scaling your thinking and your thought processes to the team. So that's something I've continued to learn.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为我也一直在学习，赋能非常重要。你招聘了这些了不起的人。你既想让他们走上正确的道路，确保他们有正确的约束（回到之前的话题），但同时，让他们放手去做也超级重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh I think I've also continued to learn uh that it's so important to empower and you hire these incredible people. Well, you both want to put them on the right path and make sure they have the right constraints going back to the previous topic, but also it's super important that you get out of their way.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但对于完美主义者来说，赋能和放手是很难的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, it's it's but it's difficult for perfectionists to empower and get out of the way, right?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那是注意力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: That's attention,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 对吧？你如何做到这一点？我尽力给出好的反馈，并识别出何时是真正的“单向门决策”（one-way door decision），即不可逆转或至少代价高昂的决策。然后，如果我认为这是一个我们将来会真正后悔的决定，我就会坚决反对，必要时会非常强硬。但总的来说，我更倾向于给出好的反馈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: right? And how do you do that? Well, I try my best to give good feedback uh and identify when something is truly a one-way door decision where it's irreversible or it will at least be very costly. And then if it's going to be a decision that uh I think we will really regret living with then I will push back and I'll push back hard if needed. But in general uh I more try to give good feedback.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 如果我认为它没有被听到或没有被采取行动，那就不一样了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh if I think that it's not being heard or actioned on that's different.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 如果我们都同意某件事，但我们没有去做，而且我们没有提高某件事的质量，那么这就是一个不同的流程问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh you know uh if we all agree on something and we don't do it you know and we're not improving the quality of something then that's a different problem on process.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以当你说“单向门”时，是指一个已经做出且无法逆转的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So when you say oneway door that's a decision that's been made and which you can't reverse.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这是一个可能尚未做出的决定。也许它已经做出了，但决定状态并不重要，重要的是它可能以某种方式不可逆转地改变组织或业务或产品，以至于你无法轻易回头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh it's a decision that maybe is not made. Maybe it's maybe it's made it doesn't matter about the state of the decision but rather the potential for it is that it irrevocably changes the organization or business in such a way or product that you cannot uh go back easily from it.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 你无法在不花费大量时间、精力或成本的情况下“取消发布”它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: You can't un ship it without you know a lot of time effort or cost.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。还有一些决定并不重要，因为你可以推翻它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah. And then there are other decisions which it doesn't really matter because you can overest them.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我的意思是，有很多事情你可以进行A/B测试，看看它们是否有效。这些事情你不应该浪费时间。所以，关键在于，好吧，我的团队里有没有那些正在运用并展现出出色判断力的人？如果你有出色的判断力，那么大多数时候你的击球率都很高。每个人都会犯错。如果你没有犯任何错误，你可能就没有足够的创造力或探索。所以，我认为让人们犯错并从中学习是好事。但如果你犯的都是错误，那当然也很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. I mean, there's plenty of things you can AB test, see if they work or not. And those are things that um, you know, you shouldn't waste your time on. And so, then it's about, okay, well, do I have folks on the team who are exercising and showing great judgment? And if you've got great judgment, then most time your batting average is pretty high. Everyone makes mistakes. Uh, if you're not making any mistakes, you're probably not being creative or exploring enough. So, I think that it's good to let people make mistakes and learn. Uh but if you're making like all mistakes, that's also bad,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 当然。从你们两个人发展到1800人，你一直坚持的不可协商的文化要素是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: of course. What are what are the non-negotiable cultural elements that you have kept as you've scaled from the two of you to 1,800 people?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我认为我们非常幸运，因为

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I I think that um a lot of it we're very lucky because

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 凭借**Figma**的本质，我们就像在天空中竖起了一个信号，表明我们代表什么：创意表达、精湛技艺、第一性原理思维、系统导向。那些与此产生共鸣的人，他们会被**Figma**吸引。所以来我们这里寻找职位的群体，他们确实拥有很多这些特质。但我想指出的另一个是谦逊。另一个在筛选时甚至更难的是自我意识。因为如果你没有自我意识，而我给你反馈，你是否会接受就不清楚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: by virtue of being Figma, we kind of put this bat signal in the sky of what we stand for. uh creative expression, craft, uh first principles thinking, systems orientation, and the people that resonate with that, they are attracted to Figma. And so our population that comes to us looking for a role, uh they really do share a lot of those traits. But another one that I would call out is humility. Another one that is even harder uh in terms of screening sometimes is self-awareness. Because if you're not self-aware and I give you feedback, uh it's not clear that you'll take it.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以这使得反馈对话变得非常困难，在这种对话中你需要有人稍微改变一下方向。我认为如果你能建立一个由谦逊、有自我意识、关心技艺、有成长型思维、关心社区的人组成的团队，那将是一个了不起的团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And so that makes sort of feedback conversations where you need someone to, you know, change course a little bit very difficult. And I think if you are able to build a team of humble, self-aware people who care about craft, who have a growth mindset, who care about community, uh that is an incredible team.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 当人们谈论你时，反复出现的一个词是“善良”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: One word that come up again and again when people talk about you is that you are kind a kind leader.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我努力做到。为什么？好吧，我最好的蠢问题。为什么成为一个善良的领导者很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I try to be uh why is it why okay my best stupid question. Why why is it important to be a kind leader?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 看，我是犹太人，但“黄金法则”我认为是一个非常好的原则。以你希望被对待的方式对待他人。所以这只是一个道德问题。你向世界释放的能量，就是你将收回的能量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Look I mean I'm I'm Jewish but the sort of golden rule uh I think is a very good one. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Uh so that's just like a moral thing. The energy you put out into the world is the energy you'll receive back.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 无论是由于你的感知、你构建世界的方式，还是你对他人动机的视角，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh whether that be because of your perception, your uh way that you frame the world and sort of your viewport into the motivations of others,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但人们会与你匹配。如果你想创造一个培养创造力的环境，那么是的，我认为你真的需要创造一个支持性的环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: but people match you. And if you want to create an environment that fosters creativity, then yes, I think you really need to create an environment that's supportive.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 善良是其中很重要的一部分。但我也要明确指出，善良并不总是说那些听起来好听或不具对抗性的话。如果我相信你有一些需要知道的事情，即使是严厉的反馈，我也有责任告诉你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And kindness is a big part of that. But it's also, I'll be clear, that kindness is not always saying the thing that feels nice or non-confrontational. Um, if I believe that uh you have something that you need to know, even if it's hard feedback, uh it's my duty to tell you.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 如果我不说，那就不善良，因为它以后会出现，并给你、给我、给我们俩都带来问题，而且这实际上可能会升级。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And if I don't, that's not kind because it's going to come up later and it's going to create an issue for you, for me, for both of us, and that could actually escalate.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，在我看来，最善良的做法是极其直接和坦率，确保人们进行沟通。这也是我一直在推动的一点，即如何让人们彼此之间更直接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, the kindest thing is to be extremely direct in my opinion and upfront make sure that people are communicating. And that's something I'm always pushing on is how to get people to be more direct with each other.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我觉得这很有趣，因为当你年轻的时候，“善良”是“酷”的反义词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I think it's quite interesting because when you're young, kind is the opposite of cool.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 哦，确实如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Oh, it is.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，有点不是。我的意思是，如果你在

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, kind of isn't. I mean, if you're in

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我从来没有，我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I was never I don't know, but

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我的意思是，我也从来不酷，但我的意思是，那些酷的家伙，他们不太善良，但当你变老了，善良是唯一重要的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So, I mean, I was never cool either, but I mean, it's like the cool guys, they were not very kind, but when you get older, kind is the only thing that matters.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的，我的意思是，看，我认为我有很多方法可以更善良。我有时确实会很紧张。我的团队中的任何人都可能会告诉你这一点，但我的目标始终是带着善意进行对话、反馈和内容传递，并且以同理心对待他人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. I I mean, look, like I think that there's uh all sorts of ways I can be more kind. And I certainly get intense sometimes. Uh, anyone on my team would probably tell you that, but that's always my goal is to deliver, you know, conversation, feedback, uh, and content with kindness and, um, to treat other with others with empathy

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 并理解他们来自哪里。因为如果你对别人和他们生活中发生的事情没有同理心，那么你如何才能有效地与他们建立联系，真正理解他们来自哪里并向他们学习呢？我认为你可以向每个人学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and to understand where they're coming from. Because also if you don't actually have empathy for someone else and what they're what's happening in their life, then how can you effectively connect with them and actually understand where they're coming from and learn from them? Uh and I think that you can learn from everyone. So

</details>

### 好奇心与人生建议

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你刚才提到了好奇心。我想你父亲说过你对一切都充满好奇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: you mentioned curiosity um a bit earlier. Um I think your father said somewhere that you are you were curious about everything.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 听起来没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: That sounds right. Uh I I uh

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我想他甚至说过你小时候有点怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: I think he even said that you were a bit weird when you were a child.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 哦，是的，他确实说过。我小时候是个怪孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Oh yeah, that that's definitely something he said. Uh I was a weird kid.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但怪是好事。不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: But weird is good. No,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我是这么认为的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I think so.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 这很有趣。我父亲去世了，我非常想念他。但是，是的，当我获得**Thiel奖学金**时，他的评论是：“这很酷。我原以为这整个事情都很奇怪，但现在我看到了所有决赛选手都在一起，我明白了。他们和你一样奇怪。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It was interesting actually. My dad uh he's passed and and I miss him dearly. But uh yeah, when I got the Teal Fellowship, his comment was, uh this is pretty cool. I thought this this whole thing was very uh very off, but now that I've actually seen all the finalists in one place, I I I get it. They're just as weird as you are.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我当时想：“谢谢，谢谢爸爸。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: I'm like, "Thanks. Thanks, Dad." So,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 他是你想要展示的人吗？是你想要打动的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: is he the one you wanna kind of show? Is he the one you want to impress?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，你知道，我父亲是如此慈爱，在我还是个孩子、青少年时，他经常告诉我他为我感到骄傲，即使我没有理由让他这么说，成年后也是如此。所以我感到，是的，我一直都感到他深深的爱。我非常幸运拥有一个很棒的家庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh, you know, my dad was so loving and let me know so often as a kid, as a teen, when I had no reason for him to say this and as an adult that uh that he was proud. So I feel uh yeah I feel very very loved always have by him. Uh I'm very lucky to have a great family

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 而且是一个非常支持我的家庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: and uh very supportive family.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah. No

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我也努力在我的生活中为我爱的人做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: try to do the same in my life for the people I love as well.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 哦，那太棒了。我们谈过你小时候是个童星。你认为这很重要吗？你知道，我认为我从童年演戏中汲取最多的是，顺便说一下，我一直演到青少年时期，然后我就变得非常笨拙了。所以我在那里很快就达到了上限。但你知道，作为一个演员，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Oh that's that's great. You were a child actor as we talked about. Uh do you think it's been important? You know, the the thing that I think I've drawn the most from the acting as a kid, and by the way, I acted until I was a teen, and then I got super awkward. So, that's where I capped out real fast. Uh, but you know, as an actor,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 你会去争取所有这些角色，我当时在演话剧，在做商业演出，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh, you go out for all these roles and I was doing theater, I was doing uh, you know, commercial work,

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我在为电影试镜。这涵盖了所有方面。我当时也唱歌。当时舞跳得很糟糕。所以只有三项中的两项，但你争取所有这些角色，你不断被拒绝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh, I was auditioning for movies. It's kind of the whole gamut. And I was singing, too. Terrible dancer there at the time. Uh, so only had two of the three, but you go out for all these roles and you're constantly rejected.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 那是很正常的。我一点也不受影响。从来不是我的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And that was just normal. Like it didn't get to me at all. It was never like a me thing. It was a

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你认为你的耐力是从那里来的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Do you think that's you get your stamina from?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 也许吧。我想这有帮助。我的意思是，我只是

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Maybe. Uh, I think it helps. I mean, I just

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 真的不怕在人前露面。我真的不怕被拒绝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: don't really have a fear of going up in front of people. I don't really have a fear of getting rejected.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以我确实害怕不去尝试。对我来说，这更像是一种框架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And so I I do have a fear of not trying. Uh, to me, that's more the framework. M

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 我不想回首往事，后悔没有尝试某件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: like I don't want to look back and regret not trying something.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以我认为我的大脑可能在这方面与众不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So I think that maybe my brain is just a little bit different from others that way.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你读什么书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What do you read?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 现在读很多机器学习论文。过去读文学、非虚构类、设计书籍、我喜欢的博客，但现在主要是论文。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh right now a lot of machine learning papers uh in the past uh literature, non-fiction, uh design books, blogs that I like but but right now papers.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你的一天是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What does your day what is your day look like?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 变化非常大。我希望它

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: It is incredibly variable. Uh I wish it

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你什么时候醒来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: when you wake up when do you wake up?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 早上4点到8点之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh, somewhere between 4 and 8 am,

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: right? I see.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以，只是为了向你展示这种多变性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: So, just to show you the variability. That's a

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 很大的范围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: big range.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。或者我昨晚实际上是凌晨4点才上床睡觉，因为我正在为今天的**Gemini**发布制作视频。所以如果我有点累，我很抱歉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. Or I think I actually went to bed at last night at 4 a.m. because uh I was working on our ourh video for today's Gemini release. Uh, so if I'm a little tired, I'm sorry.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，那一点也看不出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, that that does not come through at all.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 试图向你展示这种极端的多变性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Trying to show you the variability is is extreme.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你如何放松？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How do you relax?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 只是和妻子聊天就很放松。我们刚买了一个桑拿房。那很好。那很好。所以，那确实是。那太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Uh, just talking to my wife is very relaxing. We just got a sauna. Uh, all right. That's good. That's good. So, that has honestly been the That's great.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我提到它不是因为它来自北欧。我提到它是因为它是我一生中做过的最改变生活的事情或购买。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, I'm not mentioning because it's Nordic. I'm mentioning it because it has been the most life-changing thing or purchase I've ever made in my life. And it's

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 桑拿很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: sas are wonderful.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 是的。我的意思是，你只是坐在那里，你的整个身体都放松了。之后你感觉如此神清气爽。所以，那件事，然后我认为，你知道，这很奇怪，但我发现这些天，对大型语言模型（LLM）进行非常奇怪的提示（prompting）很放松。所以我深入研究如何获得奇怪的边缘行为、越狱等等，这让我放松了。不过我很久没有看电视节目了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Yeah. I mean, just like you sit there and your entire body relaxes. You feel so refreshed afterwards. So that uh and then I think also you know it's weird but um I find uh very odd prompting of LMS relaxing these days. So I uh dive really deep into like how do I get weird edge behavior jailbreaks and whatnot for LMS and uh that has been something that has relaxed me. I haven't been into a TV show for a long time though.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 最后一个问题。我们有很多年轻听众。你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Last question. We got a lot of young listeners. What is your advice to young people?

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 嗯，我认为，如果你现在还年轻，你可能会看到世界上有很多问题，很多可以改进的地方。我认为重要的是要感受到采取设计思维、从系统角度思考、尽可能多地学习、保持好奇心、识别你的热情，然后识别这种热情如何与实际以某种方式帮助改善世界联系起来的能动性。我认为这需要乐观主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: Well, I think that uh if you're young right now, you probably see a lot of problems in the world, a lot of things that could be improved. And I think that it's really important to feel the agency to take a design mindset to think from a system standpoint, learn as much as you can, be curious, identify your passion, and then identify how that passion can connect to actually helping improve the world in some way. And I think that requires optimism.

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 乐观主义是一种选择。你可以选择乐观，也可以选择不乐观。但如果你选择乐观，那么你就能真正去尝试，去调整，或者为你的社会、你的社区、全球世界做出改变。这并不意味着你不能愤世嫉俗或怀疑。两者可以共存。因为我认为，一些持有乐观观点的人，也在同时运行一个子进程，思考“好吧，所有可能出错的地方是什么，这样我就可以修复它们”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: And uh optimism is a choice. You can choose to be optimistic. You can also choose not to be. But if you choose to be optimistic, then you actually can go and try and uh adjust or make a difference uh for your society, for your local community, for the global world. And that doesn't mean that you don't have to be cynical or skeptical. The two can coexist. because I think that uh some folks that have a optimistic point of view are also running a subprocess of okay what are all the ways they can go wrong so I can fix them

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 但你仍然必须拥有乐观的元素，那是一种选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: uh but you still have to have that element of optimism and that's a choice

</details>

**Dylan Field**: 所以选择乐观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dylan Field**: so choose optimism

</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 这是一个好计划。你肯定拥有成长型思维、好奇心和热情的结合。与你交谈真是太棒了。非常感谢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: that's a good plan well you for sure have the combination of a growth mindset and uh curiosity and passion it's been tremendous uh speaking with you thank you so much you thank you for having

</details>
