title: 伯克希尔建仓谷歌震动市场，英伟达财报周来临
---

### 开盘直击：市场由绿转红

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是11月17日，星期一。我们正在直播，市场刚刚转为下跌。期货市场之前还是上涨的，昨晚也是上涨的，但就在大约30分钟前，市场突然转跌。我认为有几个原因导致了今天市场的下跌，我们稍后会讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Monday, November 17th. We are live and we just went red. We were green in the futures. We were green last night and we kind of just went red literally 30 minutes ago. Uh I think there's a couple of reasons for why we're red that we'll talk about.</p>
</details>

纵观全局，唯一真正上涨的是谷歌，这是因为伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司在周末买入了谷歌的股票，给不知道的朋友们提一下。但市场确实在下跌，我认为有几条新闻可以解释这种情况。谷歌股价上涨了3.2%，昨晚一度逼近300美元，达到了296美元。不幸的是，除非大盘配合，否则谷歌很难创下历史新高。这就是为什么你看到谷歌从昨天的价位回落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and you know just across the board. I mean the only thing that's really green is Google and that is because Bergkshire bought Google over the weekend for those that don't know. But we are indeed red and I think there's a couple of headlines that we'll talk about for why that's happening. Google right there up 3.2%. Google was pushing 300 last night. It was at 296. Unfortunately, it's going to be hard for Google to make those new all-time highs. Uh unless the broader markets are cooperating, and that's why you got Google going red or Google at least going down from where it was yesterday.</p>
</details>

英伟达正式转跌，股价为186.99美元。我想，这是因为英伟达财报发布前的一些紧张情绪。所以你看到英伟达股价出现了一些小幅跳水，下跌了约2%。而昨天盘后它还上涨了2%。所以，这与我们昨晚看到的情况完全是180度大转弯。苹果下跌约1.2%，甲骨文下跌1%，Rocket Lab下跌0.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia officially going red. 186.99. You're getting some pre- Nvidia earnings uh jitters, I would imagine. And so that's why you're seeing Nvidia kind of take a little bit of a nose dive right there. Down about 2%. It was up 2% yesterday after hours. So again, a complete 180 from what we saw last night. Apple right here down about 1.2%. Oracle down 1%. Rocket Lab down half a percent.</p>
</details>

比特币回落到93,000美元。看看那根K线，25分钟前还在95,000美元，现在是93,800美元。这是在迈克尔·塞勒披露他在过去一周内以约8.23亿美元的价格又购买了8000个比特币之后发生的事情。但这仍然不足以支撑比特币的价格，比特币在93,800美元处承受了一些压力。显然，以太坊可能也会受到冲击。是的，以太坊在3100美元，周末曾达到3000美元，而比特币则达到了92,000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin back to 93. Look at that candle right there. It was at 95 like 25 minutes ago. Now it's at 938. This is after Michael Bur, not Michael Bur, Michael Sailor just disclosed that uh he bought another 8,000 Bitcoin for about a billion bucks, $823 million um over the past week. still not enough to hold up Bitcoin. Bitcoin getting a bit of pain right there at 9380. Then obviously Ethereum is probably going to be a hit as well. Ethereum, yeah, 3100 with that green candle. Ethereum got to 3,000 over the weekend. Bitcoin got to 92,000.</p>
</details>

因此，随着我们展望本周这些股票的走势，这些关键价位无疑值得关注。特斯拉股价跌破400美元，下跌约1.4%。股市的波动性再次持续。我知道现在只是盘前交易一个小时，离市场开盘还有大约30到40分钟，而且这周才第一天，但即便如此，你仍然能看到一些波动，甚至从昨晚的期货市场就开始了。昨晚期货市场一片光明，纳斯达克指数上涨了0.5%，势头相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So definitely going to be key levels to watch as we look towards the week to what happens with these stocks. And then Tesla right here falling below 400 down about 1.4%. The choppiness once again of the equity markets continue. I know it's only uh an hour into pre-markets and you know we've got about 30 to 40 minutes left until the market opens and this is the first day of the week but nonetheless you are still seeing some of that choppiness even from the futures last night. Futures were bright green. I mean we were up half a percent on the NASDAQ. I mean it was a pretty nice kind of momentum swing.</p>
</details>

老实说，昨晚的势头转变并没有什么道理。我认为没有任何重大的头条新闻。但话又说回来，过去三周的这些波动在新闻背景下都显得毫无道理，它们就这么发生了，这是我们所有人都必须应对的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It it and qu and honestly it didn't make sense why we had that momentum swing last night. I didn't think there was any major major headlines. But then again, none of these moves have made sense in the context of headlines. They've all just kind of happened throughout the past 3 weeks, and it's something that we all are going to have to navigate.</p>
</details>

### 宏观焦点：日本万亿刺激计划与美联储降息预期

我们有很多要谈论和深入探讨的话题。我认为，日本也是今天一个值得讨论的重要故事，对于那些还没听说的人来说。日本基本上正在向经济注入约17万亿日元（即1100亿美元）的刺激资金。这其中有好有坏。它对**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 一种外汇交易策略，指借入利率较低的日元，然后投资于收益率较高的其他货币资产，以赚取利差）有影响，也对加密货币有影响。所以，我们将讨论日本的这次刺激计划以及该国为何首先要这么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. Uh, Japan, I think, is also a big story that is important to discuss today for those that haven't heard about it. Uh, Japan is basically unleashing about 17 trillion yen or 110 billion dollars of stimulus into the economy. There's good things about this. There's bad things about this. They have implications on the Japanese yen carry trade. they also have implications on um Bitcoin and crypto. So, we'll talk about kind of this Japanese stimulus and why the country is doing it in the first place.</p>
</details>

在宏观数据方面，我们今天早上收到了一系列加拿大数据，这很重要。但现在美国政府已经恢复运作，我们本周应该会得到更多数据。我不认为本周会公布就业报告，那应该会在下周公布。因此，对那份就业报告的预期对市场来说也将非常重要，以判断他们认为降息的概率会走向何方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you've got macro updates in the context of data. So, we got a bunch of Canadian data this morning, which is important, but now that the US government is open, we should be getting more data this week. I do not believe we're going to be getting the jobs report this week. That should be coming next week. And so the anticipation of that jobs report is also going to be really important for the markets to kind of figure out exactly where they think the probabilities of rate cuts are going to go.</p>
</details>

降息的概率再次低于昨晚的水平。昨晚是45%，现在是42.9%。所以，除非我们得到显示劳动力市场正在挣扎的数据——不幸的是，这是美联储需要的数据，因为出于某种原因，美联储不明白劳动力市场正在挣扎——但他们需要看到这些数据，我们才有可能在加息方面获得有意义的机会。所以我们有很多要谈论的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rate cut probabilities once again are below even where they were last night. Last night they were at 45%. Right now they're at 42.9. So until we get data that shows the labor market is struggling, which unfortunately is the data that the Fed's going to need because for some reason the Fed doesn't understand that the labor market is struggling. Uh, but you know, they're going to need to see that data for us to get like a meaningful chance in terms of getting that rake up. So, we got a lot to talk about there.</p>
</details>

然后是本周的英伟达。我们将对英伟达进行一次预览，因为这也将非常重要。我的意思是，归根结底，英伟达必须表现出色。我认为英伟达会表现出色。华尔街对英伟达的评级普遍上调。我认为很多人并不担心英伟达无法取得好成绩。问题在于，这是否足以让市场稳定下来并迈向下一个新高。也许可以，也许不行。但本周三，我们将得到财报结果，并对英伟达的未来走向有更清晰的了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we got Nvidia this week. We'll do a preview on Nvidia because that's also going to be really important. I mean, at the end of the day, Nvidia's got to crush it. I think Nvidia will crush it. You got a bunch of street upgrades across the board on Nvidia. There's there's really not a fear I think that a lot of people have of Nvidia crushing it. It's just a question if that's enough to get the market to stabilize and take that next leg higher. And maybe it is, maybe it's not. But this Wednesday, we're going to have those results and have a much better understanding of what's going to happen to Nvidia.</p>
</details>

是的，迈克尔·塞勒今天早上确实购买了比特币。他以8.35亿美元的价格购买了8178个比特币，单价为102,000美元。他可能认为这个价格相对较低，但不幸的是，现在价格已经跌至92,000美元。但他仍在继续购买。所以他们现在总共持有649,870个比特币，平均每个币的价格为74,000美元，总收购成本约为483.7亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, Michael Sailor did buy Bitcoin this morning. Uh 8,178 Bitcoin for 835 million, 102,000 a coin, which look at 102,000. He probably thought that was relatively low and now unfortunately we're at 92,000, but uh you know, he continues to buy. So they now have 649,870 Bitcoin at $74,000 on average per coin. and they've acquired them for about $48.37 billion on uh their average for Bitcoin.</p>
</details>

这就是我们今天的情况。日元套利交易让我有创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）。是的，我们得谈谈这个。日本正在做的一些事情与我们之前，至少是八月份时的情况有一些关联。日本一个关键的政府小组表示，政府必须制定一个规模约为23万亿日元的刺激方案，用于支出和减税。我之前报道的是17万亿，但显然规模会更大。昨天的头条确实说17万亿是最低限度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is what we've got today. Yen carry trade gives me PTSD. Yeah, we got to talk about it. I mean there are some there are some correlations between what Japan is doing to potentially uh increase what we've had before at least or what we did have before back in August. Japan key government panel member government must compile stimulus package sized around 23 trillion yen for spending tax cuts. See I reported 17 trillion apparently it's going to be much lar the headline yesterday did say 17 trillion was the bare minimum.</p>
</details>

所以，如果刺激规模超过17万亿日元，那显然是日本决定是时候刺激经济了。坦白说，这很大程度上与人口危机有关，即经济体中老年人太多。最终，他们将不得不向系统中注入资金，以使经济重新运转起来。所以我们将讨论日本，并看看这对本周美国市场会产生什么影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean if it is going to be more than 17 trillion the Japan is obviously deciding that it's time to stimulate their economy and and quite frankly a lot of this has to do with the um population crisis and the fact there's a lot of older people in their economy and ultimately they're going to have to pump money into the system to get the economy working again. So we'll talk about Japan and we'll see what it looks like going into what happens in the United States markets this week.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态：亚马逊发债与贝索斯的新AI征程

好了，话虽如此，我想让我们开始吧。让我们从今天早上的一些头条新闻开始，我认为这些是导致我们市场下跌的原因。这些都只是我的假设，我可能错了，但让我们来看看。这是第一条，我大概30分钟前看到的，我认为这是我们下跌的部分原因。亚马逊启动了一项分六部分发行的美元高评级债券。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, having said that, I think let's um let's get started. So, let's start off with some of the headlines this morning for why I think we're going red. These are just all my assumptions. I could be wrong about this, but let's go get off with it. I mean, here's the first one. I saw this like 30 minutes ago, and I think this is why we're I mean, this might not be the only reason, but I think this is part of the reason. Amazon Amazon kicks off a six-part US dollar high-grade bond sale.</p>
</details>

看到这类事情很烦人，但你也不能责怪这些公司这么做。但无论如何，事实就是如此。当你看到公司开始出售债券并进入信贷市场时，我们看到甲骨文也这么做了，结果股价从350美元大幅下跌到220美元。谷歌也做了，Meta也做了，现在亚马逊也这么做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, seeing this type of stuff, it's annoying, but you also can't blame these companies for doing it. But nonetheless, it is what it is. I mean, when you see companies start selling bonds and tapping the credit markets, we saw Oracle do this, Oracle got handsomely cut from 350 to 220 for this. Uh Google did this, Meta did this, and now Amazon's doing this.</p>
</details>

我认为这之所以会触动很多人的神经，是因为互联网泡沫破裂的方式之一，不仅是存在大量的供应商和循环融资——我们现在已经看到了这种情况的例子——而且很多是通过信贷市场完成的，而不是通过企业的自由现金流。结果，这最终带来了痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the reason I think this is triggering a lot of people is because one of the ways that the dotcom bubble collapsed was that there was so much not only vendor and circular financing which we're already seeing examples of happening right now. But a lot of it was done through the credit markets not through the free cash flows of the business and as a result that you know ended up being painful.</p>
</details>

这里的细微差别在于，这是亚马逊。亚马逊有能力筹集债务，并且能够以许多其他公司无法做到的方式有意义地执行这些债务。亚马逊在盘前交易中上涨了0.25%，仍然是绿色的，但可能会转红。它在周五下跌了1%。所以，像亚马逊、谷歌、Meta这样的公司在出售债务方面应该没有任何问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the the the sort of nuance here is that it's freaking Amazon. Amazon can afford to raise debt and Amazon can meaningfully uh execute on that debt in a way that you know a lot of other companies can't. Amazon, right? They're up 0.25% in the pre-market. It's still green, but potentially will go red here. It was down 1% on Friday. And so, like, Amazon, Google, Meta should not have any problem selling debt.</p>
</details>

他们的大部分债务将在50年后到期，而且其债务收益率高于10年期美国国债。所以，他们的债务有充足的需求。问题在于更广泛的看法和叙事，即这些债务不会带来有意义的投资回报（ROI）。但如果你认为基于债务的数据中心建设不会带来投资回报，那么你当初就应该认为用他们的自由现金流来建设数据中心也不会带来投资回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, a lot of their debt is going to be due in 50 years, and their debt is yielding higher than 10-year Treasury. So, they have plenty of demand for their debt. It's just the broader perception and narrative that this debt is not going to meaningfully lead to an ROI. But if you believe the debt based data center buildout is not going to lead to an ROI, well then you would have thought that using their free cash flows to build data centers was not going to lead to an ROI.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，如果你从一开始就对数据中心的**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，即公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）建设持怀疑态度，那么无论是否通过债务融资，你仍然会持怀疑态度。只是债务增加了一层本不应有的担忧，因为像亚马逊、谷歌这样的公司是不会违约的。但这确实给市场增加了担忧，我认为正是由于这种担忧，才导致了一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think if you were skeptical about the data center capex buildout in the first place, then you know whether it's debt or not, you're still skeptical. It's just the debt adds another level of concern when there shouldn't be because Amazon, Google, like these are companies that are not going to default on their debt, but it does add that concern to the market and I think as a result of that concern, you know, that's why you have some pain right there.</p>
</details>

所以亚马逊下跌了。关于Meta还有一个有趣的数据。Meta今年的资本支出超过了过去12个月的净收入。这有点疯狂，对吧？所以确实有很多投资者也有些害怕，担心在资本支出上花费太多，而忽略了实际的业务盈利能力，这也是为什么Meta在过去几周也受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Amazon that is down and you know interesting stat on Meta. Meta did more capex this year than net income on a trailing 12-month basis. It's kind of crazy, right? So you do have a lot of investors also a bit scared that uh there's way too much being spent on capex versus the actual, you know, business profitability and that's why Meta has obviously been getting hit as well over the past couple weeks.</p>
</details>

关于亚马逊的另一条新闻，我认为这条新闻有点利好。杰夫·贝索斯创办了一家人工智能初创公司。他筹集了62亿美元，公司名为“普罗米修斯计划”（Project Prometheus）。该公司专注于为计算机、汽车和航天器的工程与制造提供人工智能技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another piece of news on Amazon right here and this news is I think is kind of bullish. Uh Jeff Bezos launched an AI startup. He raised 6.2 billion uh and it is called project prometheus. The company is focusing on artificial intelligence for the engineering and manufacturing of computers, automobiles and spacecraft.</p>
</details>

我觉得这有点看涨，因为归根结底，贝索斯要回来了。他将担任联合首席执行官，所以他将重返运营岗位。他将成为这家公司的CEO。从核心来看，他们似乎在努力寻找人才。他们已经从OpenAI和Meta吸引了100名不同的研究人员加入公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I thought this was kind of bullish because you know at the end of the day Bezos is coming back. He's going to be the co-chief executive. So he's getting back to an operating role. So he will be the CEO of this company. And at its core it looks like they're going to be trying to find talent. They've already got a hundred different researchers from um OpenAI and Meta to come join the company.</p>
</details>

看起来他们将致力于开发专门针对航天器、汽车等非常高级别任务的人工智能。显然，贝索斯拥有蓝色起源（Blue Origin），所以他可能在寻找如何利用人工智能使那家公司变得更好、更高效。但是，看到贝索斯回归还是很酷的。而且，他为创办这家新公司筹集的资金中，很多都是他自己的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it looks like they're going to be building AI that is uniquely geared towards very high level tasks around spacecraft, automobiles. Obviously, Bezos has Blue Origin, so he's probably looking for how AI can make that company even better and more efficient. But, uh, it is cool to see Bezos come back. And, you know, a lot of this is his own money that he's raised to be able to start this new company.</p>
</details>

问题在于，当涉及到人工智能竞赛时，市场对新创公司进入这个领域的想法有多大的好感。我认为这将是市场需要回答的一个更广泛的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">question simply becomes how much does the market like, you know, the idea of new startups into the ether when it comes to the AI race. And I think that's going to be a broader question that the market's going to have to answer.</p>
</details>

### 13F报告解读：伯克希尔建仓谷歌，泰尔清仓英伟达

好了，**13F报告**（13F Filing: 美国证券交易委员会规定，管理资产超过1亿美元的机构投资者每个季度必须提交的持仓报告）。周末发生了什么？嗯，我们周五看到了这个消息。这实际上发生在第三季度，但在周五被披露。坦白说，这可能是周末最大的新闻。伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司购买了1780万股谷歌股票。这是一件非常、非常、非常大的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, 13F. So what happened over the weekend? Well, we saw this on Friday. This actually happened in Q3, but it was disclosed on Friday. It was I think the biggest news of the weekend quite frankly. Birkshshire bought 17.8 million shares of Google. This was a very very very big deal.</p>
</details>

很难解释这件事有多重大。当伯克希尔建仓一只股票时，他们会建仓并让所有人都知道他们建仓了。全世界有数百万，甚至可能数千万人关注伯克希尔的动向。这个决定可能不是巴菲特做的，因为他即将退休。可能是公司的其他领导层，比如格雷格·阿贝尔（Greg Abel）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's hard to explain how big of a deal this is. Birkshshire when they take a position in a name they take a position and they let everybody know they take a position. You have millions of people honestly probably tens of millions of people across the world that follow what Birkshshire does. Buffett probably didn't make the decision because he's retiring. It was probably other leadership at the firm like Greg Gable.</p>
</details>

但事实是，伯克希尔的领导层齐聚一堂，表示：“我们认为，在过去十年里，除了苹果（他们甚至不认为苹果是科技公司）之外，我们几乎没有任何科技股投资，现在我们需要在投资组合中加入科技股。”这相当令人难以置信。对我来说，这在某种程度上验证了人工智能领域的投资逻辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the fact that you have Birkshar leadership coming together and saying, you know, we believe that we need a technology play in the portfolio after really not having any technology over the past decade outside of Apple, which they didn't even consider was technology is quite incredible. And to me, it's kind of validating some of the AI trade.</p>
</details>

之所以说它验证了AI投资，是因为谷歌明年将在资本支出上投入巨资。谷歌的增长显然得益于Gemini、Waymo以及其所有围绕AI的押注，谷歌搜索通过AI模式得到增强等等。云业务的增长也得益于谷歌签约的AI工作负载。所以，押注谷歌就是押注AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason it's validating the AI trade is because Google's going to spend a ton of money on capex next year. Google's obviously growing because of Gemini and Whimo and all their bets around AI, Google search being uh enhanced through AI, AI mode, etc. Like there's cloud that's really growing because of the AI workloads that Google's contracting for. So I mean a betting on Google is a bet on AI.</p>
</details>

如果AI消失了，谷歌明天会消失吗？不会。但是，如果另一家公司更专注于AI，而谷歌放慢了脚步，桑达尔会让这种机会出现吗？我认为不会。谷歌在2023年曾面临生存危机，当时ChatGPT发展迅猛，很多人开始想，也许我再也不会用谷歌了。显然，这种说法已经逆转，谷歌现在处于赢得竞争的有利位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now if AI went away, would Google go away tomorrow? No. But is there a world in which Sundar would even let the opportunity present itself that another company could take its lunch if they focused on AI more and Google kind of took their foot off the pedal? I don't think so. I mean, and you had that existential crisis for Google back in 2023 when Chachi BT was growing as fast as it was and a lot of people started thinking, hey, maybe I'm never going to use Google again. Obviously, that narrative has flipped and Google is now in a prime position to win.</p>
</details>

但我认为，一笔50亿美元的投资，尽管只占投资组合的2%，却承认了我们需要在人工智能领域有所布局。这承认了资本支出不会停止。这也坦率地承认，谷歌可能是最好、最多元化的人工智能公司之一，因为最终谷歌将停止在资本支出上的投入，所有这些资金将回归到股票回购和自由现金流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think a $5 billion stake, although it's only 2% of the portfolio, is admitting that we need exposure to something in the world of AI. It's admitting that this capex spend is not going anywhere. And it's also admitting that quite frankly, Google is probably one of the best and most diversified AI companies because eventually Google will stop spending on capex and all that money will go back to share buybacks and free cash flows.</p>
</details>

作为全球最大的搜索广告收费站，谷歌的业务在人工智能时代很可能会保持韧性，甚至得到增强。所以，看到伯克希尔投资一家人工智能公司，我真的很高兴。我认为我们可能会看到更多其他基金进行类似的投资。在我看来，会有很多人虔诚地追随伯克希尔，他们会直接购买谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Google's business is likely going to be resilient in the face of AI, if not enhanced, in the face of AI as being the world's largest toll booth for searchbased advertising. So, I think it's really nice to see Bergkshire uh invest in an AI company. I think we'll probably going to get more of these investments from other different funds. You're going to have a lot of people in my opinion that follow uh Bergkshire religiously that are just going to buy Google.</p>
</details>

苹果在过去10年成为最出色的股票之一的原因是，一旦巴菲特触及苹果，每个人都觉得“哦，巴菲特给出了认可”，很多人就开始购买苹果，而且他们没有卖出。顺便说一下，为了做到这一点，伯克希尔确实卖掉了大约16%的苹果股份。这很合理。你知道，他们从苹果市值5000亿美元时就一直持有。

<p class="english-text">I mean, the reason Apple became one of the most amazing stocks over the past 10 years is once Buffett touched Apple and everyone was like, "Oh, Buffett's given, you know, the Buffett co-sign," a lot of people started buying Apple and you know, they didn't sell Apple. So, in order to do this, by the way, Bergkshire did sell about 16% of their Apple stake. Um, which makes sense. You know, they've held on to it since500 billion dollar market cap.</p>
</details>

但这确实有道理。他们正在转型，投资一家能够增长更快的公司。我认为这可能是一个新的、潜在的由技术驱动的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司在未来十年的开端。如果他们真的这么做，那将是一件令人兴奋的事情。但你看到他们入股了谷歌。

<p class="english-text">But it does make sense. They're transitioning into a company that can grow a lot faster. And I think this might be the start of a new potentially technological driven Bergkshire Hathway over the next decade potentially. It's going to be something that's exciting to see if they do do that. But you have them taking a stake in Google.</p>
</details>

在13F文件中披露的其他信息中，斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒也购买了谷歌。大卫·泰珀卖掉了他所有的联合健康集团（UNH）股票。我知道彼得·泰尔也上了头条，他卖掉了他所有的英伟达股票和基本上76%的特斯拉股票。他确实新建仓了苹果和微软，这有点奇怪，因为如果你要从你的投资组合中剔除整个AI主题并卖掉英伟达，为什么会买入另外两家同样涉足AI的公司呢？但我猜他想要更多安全性，而且它们可能不像英伟达那么波动。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Some of the other stuff in the 13Fs that were disclosed. Stanley Ducken Miller also bought Google. David Ter sold all of his UNH. Uh Peter Teal, I know this has been making the headlines as well, has sold all of his Nvidia. and basically 76% of his Tesla. He did take new stakes in um Apple and Microsoft, which was weird because, you know, if you're getting rid of the entire AI thesis from your portfolio and getting rid of Nvidia, why would you kind of buy two names that are also in AI? But I guess he wanted a bit more safety and they're probably not as volatile as Nvidia.</p>
</details>

但是的，彼得·泰尔确实清仓了英伟达。我认为这并不那么疯狂。我知道很多人试图构建一种叙事，即如果彼得·泰尔在卖，软银也在卖，那么每个人都在抛售英伟达。我认为这是一种叙事和一种论点。我也认为，这些大佬们持有这些股票已经很长时间了，你知道，软银已经持有了大约10年。所以，他们最终会获利了结，这并不奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yes, Peter Thiel did take his entire Nvidia stake off the table. I don't think that's that crazy. I mean, I know a lot of people are trying to put the narrative together that if Peter Teal is selling and that Soft Bank is selling, then, you know, everyone's getting out of Nvidia. I think that that is one narrative and that's one argument. I also think a lot of these guys have been in these names for a long time and, you know, Soft Bank's been in it for like 10 years. So, eventually they're going to take some profits and it's not crazy that they're going to take some profits.</p>

### 加密货币市场：去杠杆化阵痛与后市展望

加密货币仍在受挫。是的，加密货币下跌至9374美元。我们昨晚讨论了正在发生的事情。你可能会继续听到关于强制去杠杆化和结构性去杠杆化的论点。我认为这是加密货币受到冲击的一个合理解释，因为所有这些被引入的**永续合约**（Perpetual Futures: 一种没有到期日的期货合约，允许交易者长期持有仓位）。我们稍后会谈到日本，因为那也对此有影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Crypto still getting hit. Yes, crypto is down 9374. We talked about it last night in terms of what's going on. And you're probably going to keep hearing this argument about force deleveraging and structural deleveraging. I think it is a legitimate reason for why crypto is getting hit for all these perpetual futures contracts that uh you know have been introduced and we'll talk about Japan in a second because that also has an implication right here.</p>
</details>

不幸的是，许多这些永续期货合约允许人们使用从10倍到高达250倍的杠杆。当你使用250倍甚至100倍的杠杆时，正如你所见，比特币ETF基金也出现了每周的加密资产流出。即使是2%的波动也会清算你的整个头寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um a lot of these perpetual futures contracts unfortunately have allowed people to go uh you know from as little as 10x to as high as 250x on leverage. And when you're on 250x of leverage or even 100x of leverage, as you can see, there's also been weekly crypto asset outflows in the Bitcoin ETF funds. Uh even a 2% move will liquidate your entire position.</p>
</details>

从这个角度来看，我们在10月10日看到了这种情况，当时加密货币市场发生了192亿美元的清算，因为比特币出现了一根2万美元的K线。我的意思是，这显然从系统中抽走了大量资金。因此，汤姆·李的论点是，在那次清算中，有很多做市商也遭受了损失，他们现在不得不出售资产以弥补损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So from that perspective, and we saw this on October 10th, you know, there was a 19.2 billion liquidation in crypto because Bitcoin had a $20,000 candlestick. And I mean, obviously that took away a lot of money from the system. As a result, Tom Lee's argument is there's plenty of macro or uh market makers that also suffered during that liquidation and they're now having to sell to recoup a lot of the losses that they have.</p>
</details>

这是否会将加密货币带入结构性熊市？我不知道。我会说不。我会说，就像任何因追加保证金通知而发生清算的股票一样，如果有人对该股票进行了高杠杆投资，这会造成一些短期痛苦，但最终基本面会回归正轨。对于加密货币，你必须相信一种不同于股市基本面理论的范式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does that put crypto in a structural bare market? I don't know. I would say no. I I would say just like any stock that has a liquidation from a margin call or something like that, if someone's heavily levered into that stock, like it's going to create some short-term pain, but eventually the fundamentals come back in place. Uh with crypto, you've got to believe in a different sort of paradigm of fundamentals versus like a stock market fundamental thesis.</p>
</details>

但如果这是一次结构性去杠杆化，而不是熊市的开始，那么加密货币应该会没问题。问题是没人知道。而且有很多人开始认为加密货币的冬天已经来临，对吧？这相当难看。我的意思是，如果你看看比特币从去年11月17日到今年11月17日的价格，比特币是下跌的，这有点疯狂。如果你只是持有一年，10年期国债的回报率都比现在的比特币要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if this is a structural deleveraging and not the beginning of a bare market, then crypto should be okay. The problem is no one knows. And you got a lot of people that are starting to think that crypto winter is here, right? And that is pretty ugly. I mean, if you look at Bitcoin from November 17th last year to November 17th this year, Bitcoin's down, which is kind of crazy. if you just held it for a year. I mean, a 10 year would have got you a better return than Bitcoin right now.</p>
</details>

加密货币受到冲击的另一个原因是，不幸的是，美联储在降息问题上并未给出任何有意义的明确信号。再次强调，降息的概率现在低于50%。比特币依赖于流动性。有趣的是，过去六个月我们增加的M2货币供应量比过去几年都多。M2货币供应量在增加，如果你把它和比特币的价格走势放在一张图表上，你会发现比特币在下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's quite incredible to see this. And and the other reason why crypto's taking a hit is because unfortunately the Fed has not really given any level of meaningful clarity on a rate cut. Again, the probabilities for a rate cut are now below 50%. Bitcoin thrives on liquidity and and funnily enough, we've added more to the M2 money supply over the past six months than we have over the past couple of years. and um like M2 money supply going higher. If you put that on a chart with Bitcoin's price action, you know, Bitcoin's going lower.</p>
</details>

所以，这几乎就像是向系统中注入更多流动性现在并没有真正帮助风险资产。为了使其繁荣，它需要更多的流动性，但如果我们在12月得不到降息，流动性的缺乏将继续给比特币带来一些压力。所以不幸的是，它将成为那种在未来几天需要真正重塑叙事的资产之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's almost like more liquidity into the system is not really helping risk on assets right now. And in in order for it to thrive, it's going to need even more liquidity, but if we're not getting a rate cut in December, I mean, the lack of liquidity is going to continue putting some pressure on Bitcoin. So unfortunately, it's going to be one of those assets that's going to need a real narrative rebooting over the coming days.</p>

### 深度分析：AI投资热潮是泡沫还是机遇？

关于AI泡沫的讨论，周末我听到了更多。这没关系。你知道，这是人们可以持有的一种观点，而且持有这种观点是健康的。但随后你看到两家领先AI公司的CEO说，我们建造这些东西的速度不够快，我们正在努力解决这个星球上的产能问题，我们可能需要到地球之外去建造所有这些数据中心，因为他们认为这将是一件非常大的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when we hear this whole conversation around bubble, which I've been hearing a lot more of over the weekend, that's fine. You know, that is a perspective that people can have and it's healthy to have that perspective. But then you see two of the CEOs of leading AI companies saying that we can't build these things fast enough and we're trying to figure out the capacity on this planet and we might have to go outside of this planet just to be able to build all these data centers because they think it is going to be that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

也许会，也许不会。但这就是地球上一些最重要的科技公司CEO在思考数据中心问题时的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And maybe it will, maybe it won't. But that is the argument from, you know, some of the most important tech CEOs on the planet in terms of what they're thinking about when it comes to data centers.</p>
</details>

作为一名在2000年泡沫时期经历过的科技投资者，我认为将今天与2000年进行比较和对比非常有帮助。首先，我认为思科的市盈率在顶峰时达到了150或180倍，而英伟达现在更像是40倍，所以估值非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of being a tech investor during the um the year 2000 bubble which was really a telecom bubble and I think it's really helpful to compare and contrast today to the year 2000 um you know first I think uh Cisco peaked at 150 or 180 times trailing earnings Nvidia is at more like 40 times so valuations are very differently very different</p>
</details>

然而，最重要的是，2000年的互联网泡沫或电信泡沫是由一种叫做“暗光纤”（dark fiber）的东西定义的。如果你是2000年的老兵，你会知道那是什么。但暗光纤实际上就是铺设在地下但没有被点亮的光纤。光纤是无用的，除非你在两端有光学设备、交换机和路由器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">most important however is that the year 2000 internet bubble or telecom bubble was defined by something called dark fiber um and if you're a veteran of of the year 2000 you'll know what that was but dark fiber was literally fiber that was laid down in the ground and not lit up. Fiber is useless unless you have the optics and switches and routers uh that you need on either side.</p>
</details>

在泡沫顶峰时期，美国铺设的光纤中有97%是暗光纤。与今天形成对比的是，没有“暗GPU”。你只需要阅读任何技术论文就会发现，训练运行中最大的问题之一是GPU正在熔化。有一个非常简单的方法可以触及所有这些问题的核心。那就是对GPU投入最大的公司的投资资本回报率（ROIC），这些公司都是上市公司，自从他们加大资本支出以来，他们的ROIC大约提高了10个百分点。所以到目前为止，所有支出的投资回报率都非常积极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the peak of the bubble, 97% of the fiber that had been laid in America was dark. Contrast that with today. There are no dark GPUs. All you have to do is read any technical paper. And that one of the biggest problems in a trading run is that GPUs are melting. And there's a very simple way to kind of cut to the heart of all of this. It is the return on invested capital of the biggest spenders on GPUs who are all public and those companies since they ramped up capex have seen call it a 10point increase in their ROIC's. So thus far the ROI on all the spending has been really positive.</p>

### “叠叠乐”经济：AI与富裕消费者的双重支撑

当前美国经济就像一个叠叠乐（Jenga）塔，由富裕消费者和AI公司的支出支撑着。叠叠乐塔在倒塌之前可能会越建越高。我们知道经济周期最终会结束。促使我写这篇文章的原因是，当你思考当前经济的支撑时，正如你刚才所说，AI和高端消费者，基本上就是这些了。而小企业受到了伤害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the current US economy to a Jenga tower that's propped up by spending from wealthy consumers and AI companies. Joining us here this morning at Post9, former Bridgewater chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson is back. It's great to see you, RP. >> Good to see you. >> So, Jenga doesn't sound too good. Can you talk about it? >> Sure. I I mean, the Jenga tower could keep getting taller before it topples. We know economic cycles eventually it topples. What what spurred me to write this is when you think about the supports for the economy right now as you just said AI and the high-end consumer it's kind of it right where small businesses have gotten hurt</p>
</details>

是的，她说的没错。我的意思是，AI和高端消费者正在支撑着经济，我认为这甚至没有争议。除了你拥有的大规模AI支出，然后你还有财富效应，导致人们因为过去几年股价上涨而购买东西，这个经济就没有太多其他动力了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">by the way she's right about that I mean AI and the high-end consumer is what's propping up the economy there's I don't even think there's a debate around that there's not that much going for this economy besides you got this massive AI spend and then you have the wealth effect that's leading to people buying stuff because their stock prices have gone up over the past couple years.</p>
</details>

因此，资产价格保持高位、富裕客户和AI支出。这些东西中有任何一个消失，我们还能安然无恙吗？不，不行。这就是问题所在，对吧？所以如果AI的资本支出遇到限制，无论是电力限制、劳动力限制，还是其他任何限制，那对股市将是一个巨大的冲击，因为它们是股市的主要驱动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So asset prices staying high, affluent customers, and the AI spend. Can any of those things go away and we'll still be all right? >> No. No. That's the problem, right? So if the AI capex hits constraints, whether that's uh power constraints, labor constraints, what whatever it is, um that would be a big shock to the stock market given that they're driving so much of the stock market.</p>
</details>

股价下跌会影响高端消费者的消费能力。即使AI没问题，假设有其他事情导致高端消费者变得更加谨慎。也许是美联储降息幅度不够，也许是地缘政治因素，可能是任何事情。如果他们变得更加谨慎，不再购买股票或决定获利了结，那就会拉低股市，从而对AI公司造成更大的冲击。对吧？所以所有这些事情都是相互关联的，你需要所有三个因素都保持稳固，这个派对才能继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stocks come down that affects the high-end consumer's ability to spend. Even if AI is fine, let's say there's something else that causes high-end consumers to get more cautious. Maybe the Fed doesn't cut as much. Maybe it's geopolitical. It could be anything. if they get more cautious and aren't buying equities or decide to take some profit that pulls down the stock which hits AI companies big in a bigger way. Right? So all of these things are linked together and you need all three of them to stay firm for this party to keep up.</p>

### 尾盘观察与总结

好了，各位。我想今天就到这里了。现在是上午11点40分。SoFi下跌1%。标普500指数再次持平。我们将在收盘时看看它会保持多平，但距离转绿只有4美分。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, folks. I think that is it for the day. Uh it's about 11:40 right here. Didn't even realize it was 1140. SoFi down 1%. S&P again is flat. We'll see on the market close how flat it continues to be, but 4 cents away from going green. 67158.</p>
</details>

Hood下跌3%，Palantir几乎没跌，下跌0.5%。特斯拉上涨，是今天的明星，上涨了4%。比特币试图反弹回94,000美元。英伟达也下跌了1%，不算太糟。然后谷歌得到了伯克希尔的刺激，所以上涨了5%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then Hood down three. Pounder barely down. Tesla pounder down half a percent. Tesla up. Tesla's the story of the day up 4%. Bitcoin trying to make a move back to 94. Nvidia also down 1%, not that crazy. And then Google got the Birkshshire stimulus and that's why that's up 5%.</p>
</details>

也许有关于特斯拉的新闻即将发布，市场可能已经知道了。也许有些事情我们得留意。但显然，如果你今天持有特斯拉，你肯定会喜欢它的价格走势。谷歌股价288.75美元，特斯拉420美元，Hood 117美元，然后Palantir 173美元。

</details>

感谢大家。我很感激。我们收盘时再见。我们将看看市场反应如何。再次强调，指数相对平稳。特斯拉正在上涨。Hood下跌3%。Palantir下跌约0.5%。加密货币试图小幅反弹。所以，在收盘时，我们将看看这些价格如何演变。
