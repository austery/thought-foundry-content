title: AI版权之争与硅谷政治激进化：科技巨头如何重塑未来
---
### 生成式AI的承诺与版权挑战

**生成式AI**（Generative AI: 能够根据现有数据生成新内容的人工智能）是否能拓展创造力的边界并扩展人类知识？其支持者无疑是这样认为的。OpenAI的首席执行官**山姆·奥尔特曼**（Sam Altman）表示，人类的创造精神极其重要，他们希望构建能够提升这种精神的工具，让更多人创作出更好的艺术、内容和小说，供我们所有人欣赏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Will generative AI push the boundaries of creativity and expand human knowledge? Well, that's certainly what its boosters think. Here's Sam Olman, CEO of Open AI. I think the creative spirit of humanity is an incredibly important thing and we want to build tools that lift that up that make it so that new people can create better art, better content, write better novels that we all enjoy.</p>
</details>

然而，许多作家、艺术家和记者认为，这一切都建立在盗窃的基础之上。这是因为像**OpenAI**（一家美国人工智能研究和部署公司）这样的公司需要大量材料来训练其模型，而其中很大一部分材料都受版权保护。目前，一些团体正准备在法庭上挑战这一现状。最近，一个加拿大新闻机构联盟获得了许可，可以对OpenAI提起版权诉讼。那么，他们的胜算如何？这类诉讼又将如何改变人工智能和新闻业的未来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But according to many authors, artists, and journalists, it's all based on theft. That's because companies like OpenAI need the material to train their models, and a whole lot of that material is under copyright. Some groups are now about to challenge that in court. Recently, a coalition of Canadian news outlets got permission to proceed with a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. So, what are their chances? And how could lawsuits like this change the future of AI and of journalism?</p>
</details>

此外，富有的寡头们不仅正在重塑科技世界，也日益改变着民主的面貌。本文还将探讨作家**雅各布·西尔弗曼**（Jacob Silverman）的新书《镀金的愤怒：埃隆·马斯克与硅谷的激进化》（Gilded Rage, Elon Musk, and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley），揭示**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk）和**彼得·蒂尔**（Peter Thiel）等人物如何结合企业和政府权力以实现他们的目标。

<p class="english-text">Then, rich oligarchs aren't just remaking the tech world, they're also increasingly reshaping democracy. I talked to author Jacob Silverman about his new book, Gilded Rage, Elon Musk, and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley. This is the rundown.</p>

### 加拿大媒体对OpenAI的版权诉讼

去年，一群加拿大媒体公司对OpenAI提起了诉讼。以下是他们当时发布的部分联合声明内容：“OpenAI通过**抓取**（Scraping: 自动从网站提取大量数据）加拿大媒体的大量内容，以开发其产品，如**ChatGPT**（Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: OpenAI开发的一种大型语言模型），经常违反版权和在线使用条款。OpenAI在未经许可或未向内容所有者支付报酬的情况下，利用这些内容获取资本和利润。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year, a group of Canadian media companies launched a lawsuit against Open AI. Here's a bit of the joint statement they released at the time. Open AI regularly breaches copyright and online terms of use by scraping large swats of content from Canadian media to help develop its products such as chat GBT. Open AI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content without getting permission or compensating content owners.</p>
</details>

现在，安大略省一家法院已决定此案可以继续审理。知识产权律师**凯文·休**（Kevin Seu）就此案的进展以及OpenAI应如何应对针对其提起的众多诉讼发表了看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, an Ontario court has decided the case can proceed here. I asked Kevin Seu, an intellectual property lawyer with Gilbert LLP, how this case is shaping up and how worried Open AI should be about the multiple cases that have been filed against it.</p>
</details>

安大略省针对OpenAI的版权诉讼原告包括**加拿大新闻社**（Canadian Press）、**多伦多星报**（Torstar）、**环球邮报**（The Globe and Mail）、**邮报媒体**（Postmedia）和**加拿大广播公司**（CBC）。他们的主要诉求是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The plaintiffs in the copyright case against Open AI in Ontario include the Canadian Press, Tourar, the Glob and Mail, Post Media, and CBC. What are their main complaints?</p>
</details>

休律师指出，这些原告是加拿大最大的新闻出版商的集合体，他们的诉求相当广泛，但主要集中在OpenAI使用他们从网上抓取的各种新闻文章。例如，人们可以访问CBC或多伦多星报获取新闻文章，其中一些是付费墙内容。原告的诉求是，OpenAI复制、下载并抓取了这些文章，并利用它们来训练其ChatGPT模型，以生产出ChatGPT产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is a conglomeration of I think most of Canada's biggest news publishers and their complaints are um pretty broad but largely they focus on um OpenAI's use of various news articles that they've scraped from um online. So as you know you know you can access CBC or the Toronto Star and get some news articles. um some of them are paywalled and you can access those articles and their complaint is that OpenAI has um copied, downloaded, scraped some of these articles and used it to train um their chat GPT model in order to produce the product chat GPT.</p>
</details>

### 检索增强生成（RAG）与合理使用原则

OpenAI使用一种名为**检索增强生成**（Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG: 一种结合信息检索和文本生成的技术，旨在提高大型语言模型输出的准确性和相关性）的技术，这在案件中至关重要。RAG是**大型语言模型**（Large Language Model, LLM: 拥有数亿甚至数十亿参数的深度学习模型，能够理解、生成和处理人类语言）输出过程的一部分，用于防止或限制“幻觉”（Hallucinations: 指AI生成不准确或捏造信息的情况）。当LLM即将生成输出时，RAG系统通常会访问事实存储或互联网，在给出答案之前对自己的输出进行事实核查，以限制聊天机器人产生幻觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">OpenAI uses what's known as retrieval augmented generation. Uh and it's quite central to this case for people who don't know including myself. What does that actually mean? Yeah. So retrieval augmented generation or rag is the acronym that's often used ra um that refers to one part of the sort of output process for these large language models. So if you've ever used chatpt and you um you know enter some input and the chat GPT bot says something um it goes through a couple of processes. One process is is sort of taking your input um determining what it should do and then there's a process at the end called uh ra which is used to prevent or limit hallucinations. What it does is um when the output is about to be um coming out from the LLM, the large language model, the rag system usually is designed to um access a fact storage or or access the internet and fact check its own output before giving you an answer so that it can you know limit the amount of hallucination um that the uh the chat bot gives you.</p>
</details>

在加拿大，有一项名为“**合理使用**”（Fair Dealing: 加拿大版权法中的一项原则，允许在特定目的下（如研究、教育、新闻报道等）未经许可使用受版权保护的材料）的法律，允许在某些目的下未经许可使用受版权保护的材料，其中也包括新闻报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here in Canada we have fair dealing uh which for people who don't know is a law that allows us to use copyrighted material without permission for certain purposes. One of them including news reporting as well. Um could open AAI have its copyrighted material use that instead?</p>
</details>

休律师解释说，“合理使用”是一个非常微妙的问题，它通常被用作辩护理由，但在加拿大也被称为“用户权利”。如果个人出于教育目的研究新闻，可以购买报纸或在线访问，阅读并可能复制其中一部分内容，用于研究。这些都是允许的合理使用目的，是加拿大用户被允许对受版权保护作品（如书籍和新闻文章）进行活动的范围。这是加拿大版权法中的核心原则，但它也有一定的限制。例如，在教育和研究等特定目的下，肯定允许以符合合理使用原则的方式使用作品，但这通常取决于使用方式和使用量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So fair dealing is a very nuanced subject. Um it's often used as a defense but it's it's called it's also been called a user's right in Canada. So if you or I were just researching news um for our own educational purposes, then we would be able to, you know, uh buy a newspaper or access it online and we can read it and perhaps um you know, reproduce a bit of it, you know, send it back and forth for mark it up for research. Um and those are sort of allowable fair dealing purposes. They're sort of a scope um of permitted activities that users in Canada are allowed to do with copyrighted works like books and news articles. And this is a central doctrine in Canadian copyright law. Um but it has certain limits to it. There are specified purposes like education um and research where you're definitely allowed to um use the fair deal uh work in a manner that is in accordance with fair dealing subject to some limitations but it often depends on what you're doing and how much um you're using that work for.</p>
</details>

### 诉讼的利害关系与对AI商业模式的影响

休律师认为，此案至少涉及两个方面，其中之一是金钱和商业利益。根据加拿大法律，判断某种使用是否“合理”的因素之一，就包括其商业性质。像OpenAI这样的公司是否通过使用多伦多星报或CBC的新闻文章赚取了大量资金？他们确实通过其产品的专业版或高级版收取费用，因此他们确实赚取了一定数额的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I mean I think there are two aspects to it at least two aspects there are many more than that but one is as you've identified it's it's monetary it's commercial um which you know goes back to your last question about fair dealing one of the factors as to whe whether some use is fair or not under Canadian law um includes how commercial that is so is someone like OpenAI or any other company making a lot of money off of right you know Toronto Star or CBC's news articles and you know they do charge a fee for um using some of their you know pro or plus versions of their products. So they are making some amount of money. Um and so at stake in part is who can profit off of those works.</p>
</details>

对于新闻机构而言，其核心业务是销售报纸、网站订阅以及将其内容授权给各种媒体。据我们所知，并且如诉讼中所指控的，OpenAI并未为使用这些作品支付任何许可费。因此，此案的一个重要方面是：OpenAI是否应该为使用这些作品付费？以及应该支付多少费用？如果仅仅是个人购买报纸，支付的费用很低，也并未从中获利。但像OpenAI这样拥有数百万用户的大公司，使用数百万篇文章，他们应该支付多少费用？这是此案的关键所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you know obviously for news organizations um the core of their business is you know selling newspapers selling subscriptions to their website and licensing their content to various outlets. And you know, as far as we know and as complained in the lawsuit, OpenAI hasn't paid any licensing fees for the use of those works. So a large aspect of this is, you know, should OpenAI pay for the use of those works and how much should they pay for the use of those works? Because, you know, some aspects of it is if you're, again, let's take an example. if it's just me and you going to buy a newspaper, you know, we're paying a pretty low amount of money and we're not really profiting off of it. But a large company like Open AAI, which is, you know, has millions of users, how much should they pay for um the use of articles and they use many millions of articles. Um so that's, you know, a key aspect of the case.</p>
</details>

如果此案最终导致OpenAI的商业模式发生变化，他们必须为某些内容付费，这将如何影响他们的利润和商业模式？休律师认为，这对于OpenAI的运营方式来说是相当根本性的。大多数开发大型语言模型的公司声称，他们所带来的技术创新之一是，他们已经将互联网的很大一部分（如果不是全部）内容吸纳到他们的人工智能模型中。他们声称，这就是“大型语言模型”中“大型”的含义。如果他们必须为所消费的大部分或全部内容付费，那么这确实会影响他们的利润，因为他们确实使用了大量数据，并不断抓取信息。根据他们需要支付多少费用来访问或使用这些内容，这可能会严重影响这些模型是否能够实现财务可行性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happens? Uh let's say this court case goes through and and the business model of OpenAI changes where they do have to pay for something. How does that impact their bottom line and their business model? Well, you know, I'm not the I'm not in charge of Open AI, uh, thank goodness, but um, you know, I think it it it's pretty fundamental to how they operate. And I think um if you sort of take apart and look at it at a at a more high level view for most of these companies who develop large language models, right, a part of the technological innovation that they they claim to have brought um to the forefront these days is that they've they've used or they've ingested into their AI models a large portion if not all of the internet. You know, they claim, you know, that's the large in large language model. Um, and if they have to pay for a significant or all of the content that they're consuming, then it really could um impact their bottom line because they, you know, they're they're certainly using a lot of data. They're they're continually scraping um information and, you know, depending on how much they have to pay to access or use that content. Um, it could really impact whether or not those models become financially viable.</p>

### 硅谷科技寡头的激进化

美国的科技寡头们非常富有，其中许多人也对“**觉醒主义心智病毒**”（woke mind virus: 一种贬义词，指代被认为过度关注社会正义和身份政治的思潮）感到非常愤怒，对监管和民主也心怀不满。他们正利用其非凡的财富和权力，试图让世界反映他们的愿景。雅各布·西尔弗曼在他的新书《镀金的愤怒：埃隆·马斯克与硅谷的激进化》中，探讨了埃隆·马斯克和彼得·蒂尔这样的人物如何结合企业和政府权力以实现他们的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">US tech oligarchs are very very rich and many of them are also very angry at the woke mind virus at regulation at democracy and they're using their extraordinary wealth and power to try to make the world reflect their vision. I sat down with Jacob Silverman, author of the new book Gilded Rage, Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley, and host of the CBC podcast, The Making of Elon Musk, to find out how men like Elon Musk and Peter Theel are combining corporate and government power in pursuit of their goals.</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼指出，从很多方面来看，今天的硅谷实际上正在回归其早期根源。在20世纪70年代和80年代，特别是从60年代和70年代的反文化运动中走出来后，科技行业被视为一种新的前沿和几乎是反文化实验的新领域。许多参与旧金山嬉皮运动的人最终学会了编程或投身科技。它被视为一个态度更为自由和进步的行业，对新型社会实验持开放态度。当时，该行业内部并不认为自己与政府关系密切，也不支持国家安全国家或美国外交政策的特权。这种普遍的态度或文化在80年代和90年代持续了一段时间，可以说是当时科技界的主流态度。然而，9/11事件后情况开始真正发生变化，并在近年来不断加剧，直到我们几乎回到了科技在50年代和60年代与国防部直接资助时的那种关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In many ways, the Silicon Valley of today is actually returning to its early roots. But, uh, in the 70s and 80s, especially coming out of the 60s and 70s counterculture, the tech industry was seen as kind of a new frontier and a new area of almost countercultural experimentation. A lot of people, a lot of hippies who were involved in the hippie movement in San Francisco ended up uh, getting learning how to program or getting involved in tech. And it was certainly seen as an industry that was much more liberal and progressive in its attitudes, open to kind of uh new forms of social experimentation. And it wasn't seen and I think in inside as well the industry, it wasn't seen as close to the government or supporting the prerogatives of say the national security state or US foreign policy. And we had that general attitude or culture for a little while certainly in the 80s and 90s. I I would say that was kind of the prevailing attitude in tech. Um, but things really started to change after 9/11 and then have kind of intensified in recent years, I would say, until we're almost more back to the relationship that tech had in in the 50s and 60s when it was being directly funded by the Defense Department.</p>
</details>

快进到2024年的总统大选。根据《华盛顿邮报》报道，80%的旧金山居民和硅谷附近县的约70%居民投票支持**卡玛拉·哈里斯**（Kamala Harris）。那么，西尔弗曼所说的“激进化”究竟指什么？这些“激进化”的代表人物是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's uh fast forward here to uh 2024, the presidential election. Uh, according to the Washington Post, 80% of San Francisco residents and about 70% of residents in the counties near Silicon Valley vote for Kla Harris. So explain to me what do you mean by radicalization and sort of who are the poster boys and I say poster boys because incidentally they are all men.</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼解释说，他谈论的是20到30位男性，几乎都是白人男性，他们是百万富翁和亿万富翁，是科技公司的首席执行官和风险投资家。当然，其中最顶尖的是埃隆·马斯克。但也有他许多朋友和同事，包括被称为“**PayPal黑手党**”（PayPal Mafia: 指PayPal早期员工和创始人，他们后来在硅谷创立或投资了许多成功的科技公司）的成员。**彼得·蒂尔**（Peter Thiel）长期以来一直是硅谷最重要的保守派人物。在过去几年，尤其是在2024年大选前，一些传统科技保守派（如彼得·蒂尔、**大卫·萨克斯**（David Sacks）和**道格·莱昂**（Doug Leone）等知名风险投资家）以及他们的朋友和同事，开始真正地激进化，反对民主党和共和党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are all men. I mean there are a few prominent women in tech who are Trump supporters like Saffric Catz uh who was the co-CEO of Oracle or Genie Remedi from IBM. But you know this we are talking about and this book is a little bit of a group biography of 20 to 30 men almost all white men who uh are millionaires and billionaires. They are uh CEOs of tech companies. They are venture capitalists. And of course at the top of this heap is Elon Musk. But there's also a lot of his friends and colleagues, people from the greater PayPal mafia as it's been called. Peter Teal has long been probably the most important Silicon Valley conservative. And I think what changed really in the last few years leading up to the 2024 election was that you had some traditional tech conservatives like Peter Teal or someone like David Saxs or some lesserk known names like Doug Leon who's a major venture capitalists but then you had a lot of their friends and colleagues people of a similar social status and economic status who who spent time with the with them who really did start getting radicalized against the Democrats and Republican party.</p>
</details>

这种激进化始于旧金山，他们开始将旧金山视为一个失败的城市，并将其归咎于自由派和民主党。他们担心旧金山正在发生的一些社会问题，如无家可归和公开吸毒，本质上是无法解决的，而且正在蔓延到其他城市。这解释了许多转变。此外，一些首席执行官，如主要风险投资家**马克·安德森**（Marc Andreessen），开始认为当时的社会正义运动，如“黑人的命也是命”（Black Lives Matter）或最近针对以色列在加沙军事行动的抗议活动，是不可接受的。他们认为这是“觉醒主义”失控或走得太远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some of that, I think, did really start in San Francisco where they started to see San Francisco as a failed city. And they blamed it on liberals and on Democrats and they saw they feared that what was happening in San Francisco, some of its its social issues, the homelessness, the open air drug use, they essentially decided that it couldn't be fixed. And not only that, it was spreading to other cities. And that I think explains a lot of the transformation. And then you also had um some of these CEOs, people like Mark Andre, who's a major venture capitalist, starting to think that um the social justice movements of the time like Black Lives Matter or more recently some of the protests against uh Israeli military activity in Gaza um that they just found those movements unacceptable. Um you hear from senior people in tech, but publicly especially that um they think that this is wokeness gone a muck or this is something that's gone too far. So whatever vision of kind of liberal attitudes or even social justice that some of these CEOs and venture capitalists may have tolerated before certainly during the co era that started changing to a degree that they they either didn't recognize or weren't willing to tolerate anymore.</p>
</details>

### 彼得·蒂尔的深远影响

彼得·蒂尔可以说是这场运动的“主导教父”。他从一开始就是个政治动物，而埃隆·马斯克则不然。蒂尔自斯坦福大学时期起就是一位坚定的保守派/自由主义者。他创办了一份名为《斯坦福评论》（The Stanford Review）的保守派刊物，并从那时起就一直从该杂志招聘人才到他的公司。他还曾是一名作家，并合著了一本名为《多样性迷思》（Thy Diversity Myth）的书，这本书基本上可以被视为今天的“反觉醒主义”煽动性书籍。当时，主要的“假想敌”是多元文化主义和政治正确，这在90年代初的含义与我们现在谈论的“觉醒主义”或进步政治大致相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He is sort of the the presiding godfather of this movement, I would say. I mean, he is a political animal from from the beginning. And someone like Elon Musk, I would argue, wasn't before. But, uh, Teal has been a hardcore conservative/ libertarian since he was in college at Stanford. He founded a a conservative publication called the Stanford Review. He's been hiring people from that magazine ever since for his companies. And um, he was also a writer for a while and he co-wrote a book called Thy Diversity Myth, which was basically today we' call it kind of like an anti-woke [clears throat] sort of rabble rousing sort of book. At the time, the the big bogey man was multiculturalism, which and political correctness, which in the early 90s kind of meant the same thing as what we might talk about wokeness or progressive politics now.</p>
</details>

**马克斯·查夫金**（Max Chaffkin）曾为彼得·蒂尔撰写传记，他表示，我们所知的“PayPal黑手党”网络（即在PayPal致富并在之后资助了许多公司的这群人），最初更多是一个政治网络，而非商业网络。尽管它起源于PayPal，但其中一些人，包括蒂尔，对政治非常感兴趣。在2016年大选期间，蒂尔是硅谷的关键人物，他帮助促成了硅谷与**MAGA**（Make America Great Again: “让美国再次伟大”，唐纳德·特朗普的竞选口号）以及**特朗普**（Donald Trump）竞选团队之间的联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that has always been something important to Teal. Max Chaffkin, who wrote a biography of Peter Teal, has said that the PayPal Mafia Network, which we know as sort of the group of people who got really rich at PayPal and funded all these companies afterwards, started more as a political network, uh, Chaffkin has said, rather than a business one. Yes, it came out of PayPal, but these were people who were very some of them were very interested in politics, including Teal. And Teal was the Silicon Valley figure during the 2016 election who was kind of helping broker those connections between Silicon Valley and MAGA and the Trump campaign.</p>
</details>

### 政治转向与竞选资金

在特朗普第一任期结束后不久，硅谷及其高管们进一步向右转。在**拜登**（Biden）政府时期，新冠疫情肆虐，一些企业家与政府的冲突比以往更多。例如，在新冠疫情期间，**埃隆·马斯克**对不得不关闭他在加州弗里蒙特的主要特斯拉工厂感到非常不满。他最终表示：“我会照常开工。如果需要逮捕某人，那就逮捕我吧。”这是他典型的夸张风格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Teal himself would say that um the the Trump camp the Trump administration was a little too chaotic for him. And I think there was some dissatisfaction among people in tech or certainly some of Trump's conservative supporters that they didn't get done the things that they wanted to get done. At the same time during the Biden administration there this is when COVID was raging. This is when some of these uh entrepreneurs are coming into more conflicts with the state than they were used to. I would still argue that these weren't necessarily major conflicts by most standards, but for example, like some of the the shutdowns or quarantine uh methods during COVID, Elon Musk especially was very upset about having to shut down his main factory in Fremont, California, his main Tesla factory. And that was something he bowed with local authorities about. He eventually said, "You know what? I'm going to open it anyway. If you need to arrest someone, let it be me." In his sort of typical overdramatic style.</p>
</details>

还有其他例子，比如主要的风险投资家**马克·安德森**。他表示，对他来说的“红线”是拜登政府提议对未实现资本利得征税。这笔税款仅针对数百万美元的巨额资金。这意味着，如果你是一位投资初创公司的风险投资家，公司上市后股价飙升，你可能拥有数亿美元的账面收益，那么你可能需要为此支付一些税款。值得注意的是，这项提议在拜登政府时期并未实施，只是被提出。但安德森在他的播客中表示，这是他的红线，他非常不喜欢。因此，对于这些不同的人来说，触发点各不相同，但他们都认为自己受到了“当权者”的压迫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but there were other instances like Mark Andre, major venture capitalist, major political player now. He said that the red line for him was when the Biden administration proposed attacks on unrealized capital gains. It was really only over a very high amount of money, millions and millions of dollars. But this meant that if you were say a venture capitalist who invests in a startup, it goes public, the stock booms, and say you you have a hundred $100 million in paper gains, you might you maybe have to pay some taxes on it. Now, it's worth noting this was not implemented under the B administration. It was just proposed, right? But that was something that Andre on his own podcast said was a red line and he really didn't like. So um for some of these different people they were different things but they they saw themselves now as being a little more oppressed by the powers that be.</p>
</details>

美国政治的激进化有多少可以追溯到2010年，因为那一年发生了一件大事：最高法院的“**联合公民案**”（Citizens United decision: 2010年美国最高法院的一项判决，允许企业和工会在政治竞选中进行无限制的独立支出）。这项判决为科技精英们干预政治打开了大门。我们现在生活在美国政治竞选活动中“无限支出”的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh I how much of this radicalization of US politics can be traced back to 2010 because something big happens in 2010 Supreme Court citizens united decision. Help us understand how that kind of opens up this door for tech elites to sort of some would say meddal in in some of the politics here. So now we live in the era in the US of unlimited spending for for political campaigns.</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼指出，在上次大选中，埃隆·马斯克捐赠了超过2亿美元，可能接近3亿美元。**加密货币**行业成为最大的行业捐助者，捐赠了约2亿美元，主要流向了一个名为“**公平摇摆**”（Fair Shake）的**超级政治行动委员会**（Super PAC: 一种美国政治组织，可以无限制地筹集和支出资金，以支持或反对候选人，但不能直接与竞选团队协调）。他认为，尤其是在上次大选中，科技行业一旦投入某事，有时会全力以赴，他们习惯于筹集巨额资金。因此，为政治目标投入2亿或4亿美元对他们来说是有意义的。自2010年以来，大量资金涌入政治领域，并创建了这些庞大的超级政治行动委员会。但我们从未真正看到一个行业，或者说科技和加密货币共同投入如此多的资金。这确实是前所未有的。与此同时，一些科技领袖，最著名的是埃隆·马斯克，基本上将自己植入到特朗普的竞选团队中，马斯克本人也开始频繁地出现在舞台上，站在特朗普身边。这种行为也是我们以前从未见过的。

<p class="english-text">How much money are we talking? Give us a sense of that. Sure. I mean the last election must donate more than or donated is a funny term but put forward more than $200 million probably closer to 300. The crypto industry who I talk a lot about in my book um became the biggest donor by industry. They donated about $200 million mostly to uh one political action committee, one of these super PACs called Fair Shake. And I I think in especially in the last election, the the tech industry, you know, they when they go get into something, sometimes they go all the way, you know, and they're used to raising huge amounts of money. So to put 200 or $400 million towards a political goal for them makes a kind of sense. And you know, we had seen since 2010 a lot of money flooding into politics and these huge super PACs being created, but we had never really seen one industry or really tech and crypto together. they're they're kind of one and the same uh put forward so much money at the same time and that I think was really novel and at the same time you also had individual tech leaders most notably Elon Musk basically implant themselves within the Trump campaign and Musk himself starting to be on stage a lot and at Trump's side and that kind of behavior was also something we hadn't really seen before.</p>

### 地方政治干预与“特许城市”

几年前，富有的科技巨头开始介入旧金山的地方政治。旧金山记者**吉尔·杜兰**（Gil Duran）对西尔弗曼书中提到的人的政治野心感到担忧，他曾说：“这些人有足够的钱，可以在很长一段时间内保持愚蠢和危险。他们必须开始寻找方法来夺取地盘和权力，创造一个与我们今天所拥有的美国截然不同的世界。”

<p class="english-text">All right, I want to come back to a point that we were talking about sort of uh local politics. A few years ago, uh wealthy tech mogul started weighing in on local politics in San Francisco specifically. I want to read a quote uh from Gil Duran, a San Francisco based journalist, alarmed by the political ambitions of those people that you mentioned in your book. These people have enough money to be dumb and dangerous for a very long time. They have to start finding ways to seize territory and power and create a different world that doesn't look anything like the United States we have today. I think what we're seeing here in San Francisco politics is like the emergence of that strategy. What are some of the examples of the strategy that Duran is uh describing?</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼解释说，几年前，旧金山的科技界人士向地方政治投入了更多资金，因为他们意识到可以从中获得回报。例如，旧金山学区委员会成员被罢免，这是前所未有的。像**大卫·萨克斯**（David Sacks，现为特朗普的AI和加密货币沙皇）这样的人就站在罢免运动的前沿，捐赠了大量资金。他们还试图罢免州长**加文·纽森**（Gavin Newsom），但未成功。然而，他们在大获全胜地罢免了地区检察官**切萨·布丁**（Chesa Boudin）时，取得了重大胜利。布丁被视为一位改革派进步主义检察官，但被描绘成一位放任罪犯、导致旧金山犯罪率飙升的检察官。当时，这实际上是对局势的误读。旧金山的暴力犯罪并未恶化，但社会贫困、财产犯罪和非暴力犯罪变得非常明显，令旧金山的精英们无法忍受。

<p class="english-text">Well, there there are a couple of important things there. For one thing, the one of the one of the changes that we've seeded seeing a few years ago was uh tech people in San Francisco putting a lot more money into local politics because they realized they can get something for their money. So we saw a recall of members of the San Francisco school board, something that had never happened before. There was and people like David Saxs, who's now Trump's AI and cryptozar, were at the head of this. He was donating a lot of money. And then they tried to recall Governor Gavin Newsome. That actually wasn't successful. But then they had a big victory when they recalled the district attorney Chasa Bodin who was considered this reformist progressive DA but really got tred as someone who was a sororos DA who was you know letting criminals off and and responsible for an upsurge of crime in San Francisco and that that was actually at the time even a misreading of the situation. I would say that the crime didn't uh necessarily crime violent crime wasn't in a bad way in San Francisco. what you had was a lot of uh social destitution. You had a lot of property crime and non-violent crime, but it had become very visible to people there and and intolerable to the San Francisco elites.</p>

此外，科技精英们还参与了“**网络国家运动**”（network state movement: 一种旨在通过数字社区和技术手段建立新型主权实体的政治哲学）和“**特许城市**”（charter cities: 拥有特殊行政和法律框架的城市，旨在吸引投资和人才）等运动，他们试图获得土地主权。洪都拉斯的罗阿坦岛上的**普罗斯佩拉**（Prospera）定居点就是一个典型例子，一家美国公司在那里拥有土地，并在洪都拉斯前右翼政权下获得了这片土地的主权，将其变成了特许城市。

<p class="english-text">So, that's kind of where it started. And when Gil is talking about seizing actual land and territory and there's kind of two tracks that we see the tech elites on. They're involved in regular politics, you know, trying to influence what's happening in San Francisco and nationally via Trump, but they are also uh part of these movements. One's called the the network state movement that Gil reports very well on. They're also called charter cities where they're actually trying to gain land where they can have sovereignty over it. Let's talk about it. Honduras. What's happening?</p>
</details>

这些特许城市的主要目标是避税，建立一个由少数科技精英管理的“定制国家”，某种程度上是一种独裁统治。他们还希望在这些特许城市中进行在美国或其他国家可能不合法的医学实验，这与他们对生命延长研究或激进形式的人体实验的兴趣密切相关。目前，从洪都拉斯到美国本土，再到公海甚至格陵兰岛，都有很多这样的努力。这些精英们正在寻找主权薄弱或地方政府愿意将权力移交给公司或少数美国风险投资家的地方，让他们建立自己的社区。尽管这些项目常被宣传为建设新社区，但实际上它们更像是服务于少数百万富翁和亿万富翁的“迷你独裁政权”。

<p class="english-text">Honduras is the big one which is there's an island called Roatan there and there's a settlement called Prospera which is owned by an American company, a piece of land there that under a previous more right-wing Honduran regime, they were able to essentially buy sovereignty over this land and turn it into a charter city. And the main goal of these things is really to escape taxes, to have a sort of bespoke nation that is somewhat of a dictatorship, you know, run by a small group of tech elites. And one thing that they talk about a lot that they want to do in these kinds of charter cities are medical experiments that may not be legal in in the US or other countries. This very much relates to the industry's interests in life extension research or or radical forms of human experimentation that most of us probably aren't that comfortable with yet. Uh and there h there are a lot of efforts going on right now from in Honduras to even places in the United States to the open ocean uh to um Greenland. Uh there's a there's a big uh charter city startup that would be very happy to see Trump and the United States take over Greenland because that's another possible territory. But um really what they're looking for are places with weak sovereignty or places where the local government has given up and they can hand it over to a corporation essentially or a few American venture capitalists and say here start your own community and you know it's often presented as hey this is just what's wrong with a new community or building something new but it the in practice these things look more like mini dictatorships that are are really there to serve a few millionaires and billionaires.</p>

### 身份认同与科技精英的未来愿景

**彼得·蒂尔**曾资助**J.D.万斯**（J.D. Vance）早期的政治生涯。万斯在耶鲁法学院时遇到了蒂尔，当时他感到有些迷失，正在寻找身份认同。蒂尔的智慧以及他劝告万斯摆脱精英法律界“唯功绩论”的激烈竞争，都吸引了万斯。此外，蒂尔的宗教信仰也深深打动了万斯。此后，万斯的人生轨迹因蒂尔而彻底改变。

<p class="english-text">You mentioned Greenland, so right off the bat, I'm thinking of Vice President JD Vance. Maybe not a a favorite there, but uh you talk about him a bit in in this book. Uh he was sponsored early in his political career by Peter Teal. Um did Teal create JD Vance in his own image or in a in the same way he created say Prosper? Vance was someone who met Teal a little at a different point in his life when he was at Yale Law School and he as as Teal I mean as Vance has described it uh he was felt a little lost. I mean Vance is someone who through his own narrative and and his uh memoir has described himself as searching for a sense of identity at different points of his life. I mean he even changed his name a couple times. He went into the Marines. He uh he was trying to escape kind times hard luck upbringing. And when he met Teal at Teal came to to give a speech at Yale, Teal is someone who goes to a lot of colleges even still to give speeches. And according to his account, he heard someone there who he thought was very smart, but also telling him to kind of get away from the merit-driven rat race of elite law. And also what he liked about Teal is that Teal's religious. He's a Christian. And that appealed a lot to Vance. And after that, Vance got in touch with him. And from there his whole life really changed and was shaped by by Teal. But it it was a it was a choice I would say of Vances of them of him seeing someone who he could use as a model and a mentor and then really going for it.</p>

许多右翼巨头谴责**DEI**（Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元化、公平和包容）政策，但讽刺的是，这些富有的科技巨头以自己的方式痴迷于身份认同。他们中的许多人认为自己是精英，甚至有些人认为自己是“基因精英”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Many right-wing moguls have denounced DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion policies. Uh but I'm hoping you can help me understand the irony here because it seems in their own way these wealthy tech mogul are obsessed with identity. Mhm. How so?</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼指出，不幸的是，在硅谷的许多地方，我们看到了可以委婉地称为“**优生学**”（eugenics: 一种旨在通过选择性繁殖改善人类基因库的社会哲学或实践）的复苏。这不仅体现在生命延长研究上，还体现在**体外受精**（IVF）和各种生殖程序的研究上，这些研究超越了仅仅帮助人们生育的能力，而是通过筛选胚胎来选择不同的特质。科技精英们普遍认为，无论是创始人、工程师还是风险投资家，他们都是这个杰出精英群体的一部分。与此同时，他们非常清楚自己的白人男性身份，并选择认为DEI和任何其他多元化措施，以及一些旨在纠正对边缘化群体旧有错误的社会正义运动，反而构成了对像他们这样的白人的“受害化”或歧视。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh certainly a lot of them consider themselves elites and some of them consider themselves genetic elites. I mean and so in that way there what's the distinction between those two? Well, you unfortunately you see a a recurrence in what could politely be called eugenics in a lot of Silicon Valley. I mean, not just what I was talking about with um this research into life extension, but uh a lot of research into um IVF and different reproductive procedures that go beyond just trying to, you know, make people fertile or ability to reproduce, but actually, you know, screening babies for or embryos for different qualities. And I think there there is a sense among tech elites that whether you're a founder which is a pretty hallowed identity or an engineer or a venture capitalist you are part of this distinguished elite at the same time you know more traditional forms of identity like they are I think they are very conscious of their status that most of them are white males and they have chosen to think that DEI and any other diversity measures and also social justice movements that some of which try to write old wrongs against you for marginalized people are h are instead um a form of victimization or discrimination against white people like them.</p>
</details>

他们似乎觉得自己处于劣势，自己的身份受到了威胁，认为“做一个保守的白人男性是不被允许的”。西尔弗曼认为这并非事实，他们的成功就是证明，但他们感觉自己似乎必须为自己的身份道歉。现在，他们认为可以再次为自己的身份感到自豪，其中一部分就是将自己视为能够统治我们其他人的“被选中的精英”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in that way that they seem to feel like they're on the back foot and that their own identity is threatened, that it's not okay to be a a conservative white male. Um I I certainly don't think that's true and I think the proof is in uh how successful that they they've been but they feel like they sort of have to apolog the the the buying era having to apologize for who they are and now there's a sense that they can be proud of who they are again and part of that is considering themselves the sort of these elites the elect who can rule over the rest of us.</p>
</details>

这些科技巨头不仅成功限制了加密货币和人工智能的监管，还日益深入地融入国家安全体系，并主导了反DEI的“反觉醒主义”浪潮。那么，未来几年他们还会想要什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got one last question for you here. Um, tech moguls as as we discussed have succeeded in not only limiting regulations for cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence. They're becoming more deeply embedded in the national security state and they lead the anti-dei sort of woke charge. What will they want in the years ahead?</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼认为，他们无疑将政府视为一个“现金来源”，渴望获得政府合同。他们知道政府将提供大量资金。鉴于右翼科技领袖们已经围绕**特朗普**并正在填充他的政府，他们现在正在寻求大型合同。当然，仍然会有面向消费者的公司，努力向公众销售产品。但像“**星门计划**”（Stargate initiative: 指美国政府或相关机构为人工智能和计算数据中心投入数百亿美元的计划）这样的项目，将数百亿美元投入到人工智能和计算数据中心，这对科技行业来说是一个巨大的机遇。现在，他们非常自豪地重新为国家、为安全国家工作。这不仅包括**彼得·蒂尔**的**Palantir**公司，还有**谷歌**、**微软**等所有科技公司，以及像**Anduril**这样专门为国防和情报机构服务的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they're certainly looking to the government as uh a cash source. They want contracts with the government. They want, they know that a lot of money is going to be coming from there. It always has, but um given how right-wing tech leads have kind of circled around Trump and are populating his administration, they're now looking for big contracts. And I think that there's still going to be consumer-f facing companies, of course, and trying to sell their products to the public. But with something like the Stargate initiative, which is hundreds of billions of dollars being put into data centers for AI and computing, that that's a huge uh possibility for the tech industry. But now they're ve very proudly going back to working for the state, working for the security state. It's not just companies like Peter Teal's Palanteer, you know, it's Google, Microsoft, all the tech companies and also ones that are purpose-built to work for the uh defense and intelligence uh establishment like Andil.</p>
</details>

西尔弗曼认为，这就是他们现在看到的未来。他们中没有人是真正的实践型自由主义者，即使他们有时在理论上声称是。他们更愿意与当权者联合起来，寻求共同的利润和权力，而这种方式在10到15年前的科技界普通员工看来是不可接受的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um so I think that's where they see their future now is um none of them are really libertarians in practice even if they sometimes claim to be in in in theory and they are much more willing to unite with the powers that be and to seek mutual profit and power there in a way that I think wouldn't have been acceptable kind of to the tech rank and file 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
