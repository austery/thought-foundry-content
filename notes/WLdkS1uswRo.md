### 特朗普政府策略调整与明尼阿波利斯事件

**Will Jarvis**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报今日头条。我是 Will Jarvis，代替 Tracy Mumford。今天是 1 月 27 日，星期二。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Will Jarvis in for Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, January 27th.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 以下是我们今天关注的要点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 好的，显而易见，整个周末事态都非常**动态且快速变化**。至于总统特朗普，我代表他发言，他表示希望让**调查**继续进行，让**事实**说话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Well, look, this has obviously been a very fluid and fast-moving situation throughout the weekend. As for President Trump, whom I speak for, uh he has said that he wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 在此事件中，**白宫**正试图在公众对**联邦探员在明尼阿波利斯击毙 Alex Prey** 事件的愤怒声讨下改变策略。政府官员最初声称 Prey 是一个**危险的威胁**，尽管视频显示他在被探员枪击前已被制服并解除武装。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: In this case, the White House is trying to change course in the face of outrage over the killing of Alex Prey by federal agents in Minneapolis. Administration officials initially claimed Prey was a dangerous threat, even as videos showed he was pinned down and had been disarmed before agents shot him.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: **Steven Miller** 将 Prey 定性为“**国内恐怖分子**”。总统是否同意这种说法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Steven Miller label Prey a domestic terrorist. Does the president agree with that?

</details>

**白宫官员**: 我说过，我没有听过总统那样评价 Prey 先生。不过，我听总统说过，他希望让调查中的事实自己浮现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**White House Official**: Look, as I've said, I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Prey in that way. Uh, however, I have heard the president say he wants to let the facts in the investigation lead itself.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 听到他的高级官员那样称呼他，仓促下判断，总统是否感到震惊？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Was he alarmed to hear his top officials referring to him in that way, rushing to that judgment?

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 请讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Go ahead.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 谢谢，Caroline。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Thanks, Caroline.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 昨天，新闻秘书 **Caroline Levit** 没有为那些言论辩护，也没有重复它们。在地面上，白宫方面表示已派遣边境官员 **Tom Hman** 前往**明尼苏达州**监督相关行动。特朗普总统表示，Hman 将直接向他汇报。我知道他将在几小时内搭乘飞机前往那里，正是应总统的要求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Yesterday, press secretary Caroline Levit did not defend or repeat those statements and in a pivot on the ground. The White House says it has sent borders Tom Hman to oversee operations in Minnesota. President Trump said Hman will report directly to him. and I know that he's catching a plane in just a few hours to do just that at the at the request of the president.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 随着 Hman 的介入，政府正在撤离 **Gregory Bevino**。这位直言不讳的资深边境巡逻官员，已成为联邦探员在该州所使用的**激进策略**的代言人。与此同时，特朗普也收敛了对**明尼苏达州州长 Tim Walls** 的攻击。昨天两人通电话后，特朗普从指责 Walls 应对州内暴力负责，转变为表示他们“似乎**想法一致**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: With Homeman going in, the administration is pulling Gregory Bevino out. The outspoken senior border patrol official had become the face of the aggressive tactics federal agents had used in the state. At the same time, Trump has also backed off his attacks on Minnesota's governor, Tim Walls. After the two talked on the phone yesterday, Trump went from blaming walls for the violence in his state to saying they quote seemed to be on the same wavelength.

</details>

**Tim Walls**: 首先，我请求对 **Renee Good** 和 **Alex** 的谋杀案进行**公正独立的调查**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tim Walls**: First of all, I I ask that we have a fair and independent um investigation into the murder of both Renee Good and Alex. Um

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: Walls 向**明尼苏达公共广播电台**描述了这次通话。他说他已明确表示，目前**移民及海关执法局（ICE）**探员的激增让人们**不敢出门，甚至害怕自己的生命安全**。他说：“我告诉他，这是**不可持续的**，坦白说，你知道，**没有人想要这样**。我希望这是真的，没有人想要这样。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Walls described the phone call to Minnesota Public Radio. He said he's made clear that the current surge of ICE agents has people afraid to go outside and even afraid for their lives. this. I told him that this is unsustainable and I said quite honestly, you know, no one wants this. And I I hope that's true. No one wants this.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 同时，《纽约时报》正在了解更多关于**明尼苏达州居民**在政府**移民行动**中受影响的新细节。据律师、家属和宗教领袖称，近几周来，有**超过 100 名没有犯罪记录的难民**在那里被逮捕，并被送往**德克萨斯州**的拘留中心。与那些抵达美国边境并试图申请居留权的寻求庇护者不同，拥有难民身份的人通常经过**广泛的审查**，并与联邦政府协调的航班抵达。但本月早些时候，政府宣布将开始**重新审查**其中许多人的案件，进行新的背景调查，首先从明尼苏达州的约 5,500 名难民开始。其中一些人描述了一个**令人恐惧且困惑的过程**：他们**毫无预警地被带走**，被送往德克萨斯州的拘留中心接受**没有律师在场**的面试。一些人说他们的钱包、身份证和其他证件被**没收**，并且在被拘留数天后，他们被释放，需要**自行找到返回明尼苏达州的路**。家人和朋友们则争相为他们购买回家的机票和巴士票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Meanwhile, the Times has been learning new details about what's happened to some of the Minnesota residents who've been caught up in the administration's immigration operations. According to lawyers, family members, and faith leaders, more than 100 refugees with no criminal record have been arrested there in recent weeks and flown to detention centers in Texas. Unlike asylum seekers who arrive at the US border and try and make a case to stay, people with refugee status have often had extensive vetting and arrived in the country on flights coordinated with the federal government. But the administration announced earlier this month that it would begin re-examining many of their cases with new background checks, starting with the roughly 5,500 refugees in Minnesota. Some of them have described a frightening and confusing process of being picked up without warning and flown to detention centers in Texas for interviews without lawyers. Some said their wallets, IDs, and other documents have been confiscated and that after multiple days in custody, they've been released to find their own way back to Minnesota. Family and friends have scrambled to buy them plane and bus tickets home.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 对于《纽约时报》的提问，美国**公民及移民服务局**的一位发言人表示，该机构正在“**核实所有难民申请的有效性**，并确保没有问题被忽略”。他没有解释为何难民会被送往德克萨斯州接受面试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: In response to questions from the Times, a spokesman for US citizenship and immigration services said that the agency is quote verifying the merits of all refugee applications and ensuring no issues were overlooked. He did not explain why refugees are being flown to Texas for the interviews.

### 以色列与加沙局势及停火计划

**Will Jarvis**: 以色列。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Israel.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 周一，以色列总理 **Benjamin Netanyahu** 宣布，以色列军队已寻回 **10月7日，2023年** 被掳走的最后一名人质的遗体。**Sergeant Ran Gaville** 在保卫以色列南部边境城镇时牺牲，遗体随后被武装分子带往**加沙**。加维尔是以色列在当天被掳走的约 250 名人质（包括生者和死者）之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israeli troops have recovered the remains of the last captive taken on October 7th, 2023. Sergeant Ran Gaville was killed while defending one of Israel's southern border towns. His body was then brought to Gaza by militants. Gavile was one of roughly 250 people, living and dead, who were taken that day.

</details>

**David Halfinger**: 我认为我们不能真正**夸大**这一点对**普通以色列人**，无论政治光谱如何，有多么重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Halfinger**: I don't think you can really overstate how important it was to ordinary Israelis across the political spectrum to reach this point.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 《纽约时报》驻**耶路撒冷**的**局长 David Halfinger** 表示，从战争开始，“人质被劫持事件确实给以色列军方和以色列政府带来了**带来人质回家的压倒性使命**。战争拖得越久，人质的命运就越成为以色列国内**大规模反战运动**的动力。你看到全国各地都有横幅、广告牌和贴纸。大大小小的抗议活动在每个小镇和主要城市都有。这也成为了**内塔尼亚胡**面临的**最大反对声音**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: David Halfinger is the Times Jerusalem bureau chief. From the start of the war, you know, the seizure of the hostages really created an overwhelming imperative for the Israeli military and for the Israeli government to bring those hostages home. And the longer the war dragged on, the fate of the of the hostages was something that really animated a big anti-war movement in Israel. You saw banners and billboards and and bumper stickers all over the country. There were protests, small and large, in every every little town and Hamlet and major city. It also was like the biggest source of opposition to Netanyahu.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: David 表示，最后一名人质遗体的归来，对整个国家来说是一个**情感上的告别时刻**，也是**加沙停火计划**向前迈出的**关键一步**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: David says that the return of the last captive is an emotional moment of closure for the entire country and also a crucial step forward in the Gaza ceasefire plan.

</details>

**David Halfinger**: 让所有以色列人质回来，也许是让以色列和加沙进入**特朗普和平计划**第二阶段的**最重要先决条件**。而这可能是一个更困难的阶段，因为它要求**哈马斯**解除武装，要求**加沙实现非军事化**。它需要建立一支**旨在维持和平的国际维和部队**。它需要**建立一个新的巴勒斯坦政府**。所有这些事情都在进行中，但它们能否迅速实现尚不清楚。昨天，在加维尔遗体归来后，以色列表示将很快重新开放**加沙与埃及之间**一个已被封锁一年半的关键边境通道。援助组织表示，这可能允许他们撤离需要**高级医疗护理**的人员。它也可能允许那 10 万名在战争中逃离的加沙人返回家园，尽管以色列的袭击已将该地区大部分地区变成了废墟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Halfinger**: Getting all the Israeli captives back was perhaps the most important precondition to allowing Israel and Gaza to move into phase two of the Trump peace plan for Gaza. That may actually prove to be a more difficult phase because it requires Hamas to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarized. It requires the creation of an international force of soldiers designed to keep the peace. It requires the creation of a new Palestinian government. All of these things are in motion, but it's unclear how quickly they can come to pass. Yesterday, following the return of Gavili's body, Israel said that it would soon reopen a key border crossing between Gaza and Egypt that it's locked down for more than a year and a half. Aid groups say that could allow them to evacuate people who need advanced medical care. It could also potentially allow for some of the 100,000 Gazins who fled during the war to return home, though Israeli strikes have turned most of the territory into ruins.

### 社交媒体巨头面临“大烟草式”诉讼

**Will Jarvis**: 在**加利福尼亚州**，一场可能具有**里程碑意义的审判**今天开始，涉及**社交媒体**的影响。**Meta、TikTok 和 YouTube** 面临指控，称其平台对**儿童造成了伤害**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: In California, what could be a landmark trial on the effects of social media kicks off today with Meta, Tik Tok, and YouTube facing allegations that their platforms have caused harm to kids.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 这些公司多年来一直因其托管的内容类型而受到审查。但这是他们第一次真正要在法庭上为**产品本身**以及他们**如何设计产品**以至于可能造成伤害而辩护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: These companies have been under scrutiny for many years about the kind of content they host. But this is the first time that they'll really have to defend themselves in court about the products themselves and how they're engineering the products in a way that's potentially harmful.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: **Cecilia Kong** 负责《纽约时报》的**科技**报道。她说，此案是几起正在尝试的**新法律策略**之一，该策略**借鉴了对“大烟草”公司的诉讼**。基本论点是，社交媒体公司明知自己制造了**潜在危险且令人上瘾的产品**，却仍然将其推向公众。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Cecilia Kong covers technology for the Times. She says that this case is one of several trying out a new legal strategy that's inspired by the lawsuits against big tobacco. Basically, the argument is that social media companies knew they were making potentially dangerous and addictive products and pushed them out to the public anyways.

</details>

**Cecilia Kong**: 在这次首次审判以及今年可能举行的未来审判中，我们将看到**科技公司的 CEO** 为**电子邮件和其他文件**辩护，这些文件让他们直面关于其产品**“粘性”**的证据，以及它们**如何被设计来让人们投入更多时间**，以及这如何让公司内部的许多其他员工感到担忧。例如，**YouTube** 将被要求解释为何内部有幻灯片使用诸如“**如何让我们的应用更具成瘾性**”之类的语言。**Mark Zuckerberg** 也将不得不为内部文件辩护，其中他的员工曾要求他回应他们自己科学家提出的研究，这些研究表明，他们的一些工具，如 **Instagram** 上的**美颜滤镜**以及用于驱动用户观看特定内容的主新闻推送算法，对年轻用户可能**不健康**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cecilia Kong**: In this first trial and potentially future ones this year, we're going to see the tech CEOs defend emails and other documents where they themselves are confronted with evidence about the stickiness of their products and how they're being engineered to get people to engage more and more and how that was really concerning to a lot of other employees within these companies. So for example, YouTube will be asked to explain why there were slide decks internally where they use language like how to make their app more addictive. Mark Zuckerberg also will have to defend internal documents where his employees had asked him to respond to research that their own scientists were coming up with that showed that some of their tools like beauty filters on Instagram and some of the algorithms that were being used in the main news feed to drive people to certain content was unhealthy potentially for young users.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: Cecilia 表示，**Meta** 预计将辩称，原告**过度简化了问题**并**断章取义**地引用了内部文件。而 **YouTube** 则强调了它为儿童**已采取的额外安全措施**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Cecilia says that Meta is expected to argue that the plaintiffs have oversimplified the problems and cherrypicked statements from internal documents. And YouTube has pointed to extra safety measures it's put in place for kids.

</details>

### 纽约市大雪与文化热点

**Will Jarvis**: 最后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: And finally,

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 大雪正横扫我们的城市。**纽约市市长 Zoran Mamdani** 敦促市民利用这场**近期的暴风雪**，在家休息、小睡，或者利用我们**公共图书馆**提供的机会，凭借图书卡免费阅读电子书或有声读物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: the snow is coming down heavily across our city. New York City Mayor Zoran Mamdani urged people to use the recent snowstorm as a chance to stay home, nap, or take advantage of our public libraries offer of free access to

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 他推荐了**《Heated Rivalry》**，这是一本关于两位职业冰球运动员的**爱情故事**，得益于一部非常**火辣的电视改编**，已成为**全球现象**。据《纽约公共图书馆》称，数千人接受了他的建议，下载量激增。后来发现，**Mamdani 市长**本人并没有读过或看过这部剧，但**几乎所有其他人**都看了。根据图书馆的数据，它目前是**全国最受欢迎的爱情小说**，也是去年 **HBO** 观看次数最多的剧集之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Heated Rivalry on ebook or audiobook for anyone with a library card. He pointed people to Heated Rivalry, the love story between two pro hockey players that, thanks to a very steamy TV adaptation, has become a global phenomenon. According to the New York Public Library, thousands of people took him up on his suggestion and downloads surged. Mom Donnie, it turned out later, has not read or watched the series, but basically everybody else has. It's currently the most popular romance novel in the country, according to the library, and it was one of the most watched shows on HBO last year.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 这个故事引发了关于 **NHL** 及其与**LGBTQ+ 社群**关系的许多讨论。联盟从未有过公开的同性恋球员，并且曾一度（几年前）禁止展示某些**骄傲象征**，之后又撤回了这一禁令。然而，**NHL 专员本人**表示他是 **Heated Rivalry** 的粉丝。他称其“有点**火辣**”，但表示他**一口气看完了整部剧**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: The plot has sparked a lot of conversations around the NHL and its relationship to the LGBTQ community. The league has never had any openly gay players and at one point a few years ago banned the display of some pride symbols before backtracking. The NHL commissioner himself though said he's a heated rivalry fan. He called it a little spicy but said he binged the show in one night.
