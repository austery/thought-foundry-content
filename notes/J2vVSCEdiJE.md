### 中国技术官僚的困境与央行报告的“反话”

大家好，欢迎回到小翠时政财经。今天是美东时间2025年11月13日。
今天，**路透社**（Reuters: 一家国际新闻通讯社）突然爆料称，中国证监会主席吴清因身体原因向上级提出辞职。然而，中国官方随即发布了吴清出访的照片，疑似对此进行辟谣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome back to Xiao Cui Current Affairs & Finance. Today is November 13, 2025, Eastern US Time.<br>Today, Reuters suddenly broke the news that Wu Qing, Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, had submitted his resignation due to health reasons. However, Chinese officials promptly released photos of Wu Qing on an overseas visit, seemingly refuting the rumor.</p>
</details>

我们暂且不论此事真假，但至少有一个事实可以确认：中国本届技术官僚的日子非常不好过。这不仅体现在证监会，也包括**央行**（People's Bank of China: 中国的中央银行）。
央行最近刚被**彭博社**（Bloomberg: 一家全球商业和金融信息公司）爆料，其金融系统的贷款数据存在技术造假的嫌疑。巧合的是，央行刚刚发布了第三季度的货币政策执行报告，其中大胆唱衰中国经济，甚至承认已无力拉动**社融**（社会融资规模: 一定时期内实体经济从金融体系获得的全部资金总额）增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Regardless of whether this matter is true or false, at least one fact can be confirmed: the current generation of technocrats in China is having a very difficult time. This is evident not only at the China Securities Regulatory Commission but also at the People's Bank of China (PBOC).<br>The PBOC was recently exposed by Bloomberg for alleged technical fraud in its financial system's loan data. Coincidentally, the PBOC has just released its third-quarter monetary policy implementation report, which boldly expresses pessimism about the Chinese economy and even admits its inability to boost aggregate social financing growth.</p>
</details>

这很可能得罪“咱皇上”（指中国最高领导人习近平）。我预计，央行行长潘功胜也可能很快提出辞职。在“咱皇上”手下工作，确实是太难了。
那么，本期视频，我们就来深入分析央行这份最新的货币政策执行报告，看看其中的内容究竟有多么“大逆不道”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This could very likely displease "our Emperor" (referring to China's top leader, Xi Jinping). I anticipate that PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng might also soon offer his resignation. Working under "our Emperor" is indeed extremely challenging.<br>So, in this video, let's delve into the PBOC's latest monetary policy implementation report and see just how "treasonous" its contents truly are.</p>
</details>

### 金融总量下滑的“官方解释”与真实原因

央行在报告的第一篇专栏中就预告，未来中国金融总量增速将有所下滑，包括贷款增速也会略低一些。央行给出的理由是：中国经济结构和融资渠道发生了变化，且基数越来越高，因此贷款和社融增长乏力。
报告特别提到了四点具体原因，非常值得我们关注，因为央行实际上是在“说反话”，反而向我们揭露了中国经济的真面目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the first special column of its report, the PBOC foreshadowed that China's overall financial aggregate growth would decline in the future, with loan growth also being slightly lower. The PBOC's stated reasons are that China's economic structure and financing channels have changed, and the base figures are increasingly high, leading to sluggish growth in loans and social financing.<br>The report specifically highlighted four concrete reasons, which are highly noteworthy because the PBOC is effectively speaking "in reverse," thereby revealing the true face of the Chinese economy.</p>
</details>

首先第一点，央行称未来贷款增速下降，是因为中国金融体系不再像以前那样依赖银行贷款。今年前三季度，贷款占社融的比重已降至48.3%，而企业债、政府债等**直接融资**（Direct Financing: 企业或政府直接向投资者发行证券募集资金，而非通过银行贷款）占社融的比重上升到44.4%。
也就是说，央行似乎在告诉我们，未来直接融资将越来越多，实体经济对贷款的需求会自然减少。然而，只要稍有金融常识，就会觉得央行在“胡说八道”。央行似乎暗示中国正学习美国，金融体系正从银行贷款主导转向资本市场主导模式，中国资本市场变得更发达，所以贷款占比减少了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firstly, the PBOC states that future loan growth will decline because China's financial system is no longer as reliant on bank loans as before. In the first three quarters of this year, the proportion of loans in aggregate social financing (ASF) decreased to 48.3%, while direct financing, such as corporate bonds and government bonds, increased its share in ASF to 44.4%.<br>In other words, the PBOC seems to be telling us that direct financing will become more prevalent in the future, and the real economy will naturally reduce its demand for loans. However, anyone with a basic understanding of finance would find the PBOC's reasoning preposterous. The PBOC appears to suggest that China is learning from the United States, with its financial system gradually shifting from bank loan dominance to a capital market-led model, implying a more developed Chinese capital market, hence the reduced share of loans.</p>
</details>

但这条路在中国早已被证明行不通。中国的资本市场直接融资根本没有能力取代银行贷款。看看今年的数据就知道了：今年只有政府在发债，社融几乎全靠政府支撑。而资本市场直接融资本应是为民营企业准备的通道，然而今年我们几乎看不到民营企业有加杠杆。
因此，贷款下降的真正原因并非直接融资替代了贷款需求，而是政府发债挤占了贷款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this path has long been proven unfeasible in China. China's capital market direct financing simply lacks the capacity to replace bank loans. This year's data clearly shows that only the government is issuing bonds, with ASF almost entirely supported by government issuance. Direct financing through capital markets should ideally be a channel for private enterprises, yet this year, we see almost no private enterprises increasing their leverage.<br>Therefore, the true reason for the decline in loans is not that direct financing has replaced loan demand, but rather that government bond issuance has crowded out loans.</p>
</details>

第二个疑问是，央行没有告诉我们，如果贷款需求下降，银行利润将如何维持？中国银行业70%的收入依赖于**存贷息差**（Net Interest Margin: 银行存款利息与贷款利息之间的差额），根本不存在向投行转型的可能。
这一点从中国家庭的资产结构就能看出：中国家庭资产主要集中在房地产，而房地产背后就是贷款。这与美国不同，美国家庭资产主要以股票为主，股票背后是资本市场。因此，中国的银行无法转型做投行。
央行给出的第一个理由，在经济学逻辑上是完全不通的。在我看来，这只是非常无力的辩解，甚至可能只是写给“咱皇上”看的，因为其余能看懂的人，没有一个会去点破其中的逻辑悖论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second question is, the PBOC did not tell us how bank profits would be sustained if loan demand declines. 70% of China's banking industry revenue relies on net interest margin; there is simply no possibility of transitioning to an investment banking model.<br>This can be seen from the asset structure of Chinese households: their assets are primarily concentrated in real estate, and real estate is backed by loans. This differs from the United States, where household assets are mainly in stocks, which are backed by capital markets. Therefore, Chinese banks cannot transform into investment banks.<br>The first reason provided by the PBOC is completely illogical from an economic perspective. In my view, it is merely a very weak defense, perhaps even intended solely for "our Emperor," as no one else who understands the situation would dare to expose the logical paradox within it.</p>
</details>

接着，央行又给出了第二个理由：今年地方政府发行了4万亿的特殊再融资债，其中60%到70%被用于偿还银行贷款，因此银行贷款余额下降，因为贷款被政府债券置换了。
这个理由依然是逻辑不通的。不仅逻辑有问题，央行甚至还揭了地方政府的老底。表面上看，央行是在说银行贷款进行了结构调整，地方政府那些“乱七八糟”的贷款都还掉了。但实际上，央行告诉我们的事实是，地方政府是被迫无奈才去偿还贷款的。他们之所以要还掉银行贷款，并非主动选择，而是因为风险已经压不住了。
这是一次被迫进行的债务重组，所以中央才给了地方额外的发债计划。而地方政府已经沦落到，如果没有这些额外的发债额度，贷款就要“爆雷”的地步。大家认为我的解读是否正确？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, the PBOC provided a second reason: this year, local governments issued 4 trillion yuan in special refinancing bonds, 60% to 70% of which were used to repay bank loans. Consequently, bank loan balances decreased because loans were replaced by government bonds.<br>This reasoning is still illogical. Not only is there a logical flaw, but the PBOC even exposed the local governments' true situation. Superficially, the PBOC states that bank loans underwent structural adjustments, and local governments repaid their "messy" loans. However, what the PBOC actually tells us is that local governments were forced to repay their loans out of desperation. Their decision to repay bank loans was not a proactive choice but because the risks could no longer be contained.<br>This was a forced debt restructuring, which is why the central government provided local governments with additional bond issuance plans. Local governments have fallen to a point where, without these additional bond quotas, their loans would "explode" (default). Do you agree with my interpretation?</p>
</details>

接着，央行又给出了第三个理由。央行告诉我们，银行贷款余额减少的另一个原因是**不良贷款**（Non-Performing Loans: 借款人未能按时偿还本金或利息的贷款）加速核销。去年银行核销了1.3万亿不良贷款，今年前9个月又核销了1万多亿。核销的越多，贷款余额自然也相应减少。
这个理由听起来是不是还是怪怪的？我告诉大家一个结论：银行核销的坏账越多，反而会使银行发放新贷款变得越来越难。因此，这条理由，央行真正要表达的意思是：现在银行坏账太多，导致放贷能力下降，这才是贷款余额下滑的原因。
核销坏账会直接伤害银行的**资本充足率**（Capital Adequacy Ratio: 银行资本与风险加权资产的比率，衡量银行抗风险能力），牺牲银行利润。银行资本吃紧，就更加不敢放贷，不能放贷，贷款增速也就下滑了。这并非债务的健康出清，而是恶性循环，是系统性风险的开始。央行当然知道真相，但选择用“说反话”的方式来糊弄“咱皇上”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, the PBOC offered a third reason. The PBOC informed us that another reason for the decrease in bank loan balances is the accelerated write-off of non-performing loans. Last year, banks wrote off 1.3 trillion yuan in bad loans, and in the first nine months of this year, they wrote off over 1 trillion yuan more. The more write-offs, the corresponding reduction in loan balances.<br>Does this reason still sound strange to you? I'll tell you a conclusion: the more bad debts banks write off, the harder it becomes for them to issue new loans. Therefore, the true meaning the PBOC intends to convey with this reason is that there are too many bad debts in banks now, leading to a decline in lending capacity, which is the real cause of the shrinking loan balance.<br>Writing off bad debts directly harms a bank's capital adequacy ratio and sacrifices its profits. When a bank's capital is tight, it becomes even more reluctant to lend. If it cannot lend, loan growth will naturally decline. This is not a healthy deleveraging but a vicious cycle, the beginning of systemic risk. The PBOC certainly knows the truth but chooses to use "reverse speech" to deceive "our Emperor."</p>
</details>

接着是最后一个理由。央行称，由于**轻资产行业**（Asset-Light Industries: 那些通过知识、品牌、技术等无形资产创造价值，而非依赖大量固定资产的行业）现在崛起，它们对贷款依赖较低，因此无法对冲房地产贷款的下降，导致贷款余额自然回落。
这句话实际上是央行在跟我们“摊牌”了。央行的言下之意是，房地产行业衰退以后，中国再也找不到一个行业可以替代房地产来吸收如此大量的贷款。这意味着中国经济的信用扩张时代已经结束，未来将进入一个弱信用、弱投资、弱增长的长期结构性下行阶段。
因此，贷款余额下降是一个恶果，而非一个善果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next is the final reason. The PBOC states that because asset-light industries are now rising, they have a lower reliance on loans. Therefore, they cannot offset the decline in real estate loans, leading to a natural decrease in the overall loan balance.<br>This statement is essentially the PBOC "laying its cards on the table" with us. The PBOC's implicit meaning is that after the decline of the real estate sector, China can no longer find an industry that can replace real estate in absorbing such a large volume of loans. This signifies that the era of credit expansion in the Chinese economy has ended, and the future will be a long-term structural downturn characterized by weak credit, weak investment, and weak growth.<br>Therefore, the decrease in loan balances is a negative outcome, not a positive one.</p>
</details>

### M2增速下滑的“童话故事”与信贷衰退的真相

如果说央行的第一篇专栏是在向“咱皇上”解释，贷款增速下滑并非经济变差，而是国家融资结构更优化了；那么紧随其后的第二篇专栏，央行就是在替未来**M2**（广义货币供应量: 衡量一个国家货币供应量的重要指标，包括流通中的现金、活期存款、定期存款等）增速下滑提前找借口。
请注意，这两篇专栏的顺序绝非巧合，而是央行精心编排好的“双保险叙事”。第一篇专栏先为贷款为何会下降进行辩解，第二篇专栏再为为何连M2都会下降这个问题提前“洗白”。这两篇专栏的真正使命只有一个：稳住“咱皇上”的心理预期，不让他看出中国经济正在进入信用衰退周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the PBOC's first special column was explaining to "our Emperor" that the decline in loan growth was not due to a worsening economy but rather an optimization of the nation's financing structure, then the subsequent second special column is the PBOC preemptively finding excuses for the future decline in M2 growth.<br>Note that the order of these two columns is no coincidence; it's a carefully orchestrated "double insurance narrative" by the PBOC. The first column defends why loans would fall, and the second column preemptively "whitewashes" the issue of why even M2 would fall. The true mission of these two columns is singular: to stabilize "our Emperor's" psychological expectations and prevent him from realizing that the Chinese economy is entering a credit recession cycle.</p>
</details>

以堂堂央行的水平，糊弄住“咱皇上”这样一位“小学生”，那还不是轻轻松松的事？但我们频道的观众，个个智商都碾压“咱皇上”，大家肯定都知道未来M2增速下滑的真正原因是什么。不过就是经济下行周期必然会出现的信贷乘数退化而已：房价下跌、抵押物贬值、平台爆雷、居民去杠杆、企业不投资、银行不敢贷——整个货币派生链条全断了，这M2不掉才怪呢！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a central bank of such stature, it's an easy task to deceive "our Emperor," who is likened to a "primary school student." However, our channel's audience, whose intelligence far surpasses "our Emperor's," surely knows the real reason for the future decline in M2 growth. It's simply the inevitable credit multiplier degradation that occurs during an economic downturn: falling housing prices, depreciating collateral, platform defaults, household deleveraging, corporate reluctance to invest, and banks unwilling to lend—the entire money creation chain is broken. How could M2 *not* fall?</p>
</details>

然而，央行却给“咱皇上”讲了一个童话故事。央行告诉“咱皇上”：“皇上啊，M2下降不是坏事，而是好事。这并非我们经济衰退的表现，而是我们金融体系更成熟的体现。”
央行的故事具体是这样编的：
1.  因为基础货币和M2没有线性关系，所以M2下跌与央行无关，以此撇清自身责任。
2.  银行购买债券、资产价格发生变化等行为也会导致M2产生变化，因此M2增速下滑不代表经济走弱。“皇上您别想歪了。”
3.  中国现在直接融资多了，派生货币的机制也变了，M2下降只是融资多元化的体现，与经济衰退无关。
4.  M2增速变慢是金融体系更加成熟的表现。“皇上您别担心，发达国家都这样啊，我们只是更发达了，不是衰退了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the PBOC told "our Emperor" a fairy tale. The PBOC told "our Emperor": "Your Majesty, the decline in M2 is not a bad thing, but a good thing. This is not a sign of our economic recession, but rather a manifestation of our financial system's greater maturity."<br>The PBOC's story is specifically constructed as follows:<br>1. Because there is no linear relationship between base money and M2, a drop in M2 has nothing to do with the PBOC, thereby disclaiming its own responsibility.<br>2. Actions such as banks buying bonds and changes in asset prices can also cause M2 to change. Therefore, a decline in M2 growth does not indicate economic weakening. "Your Majesty, please don't misunderstand."<br>3. China now has more direct financing, so the mechanism for money creation has also changed. The decrease in M2 is merely a reflection of diversified financing and has no relation to economic recession.<br>4. A slower M2 growth rate is a sign of a more mature financial system. "Your Majesty, don't worry, developed countries are all like this; we are just more developed, not in recession."</p>
</details>

现在，国内技术官僚忽悠“咱皇上”的话术模板，我都帮他们总结出来了：
*   贷款掉了，就说结构升级。
*   M2掉了，就说金融系统更成熟了。
*   国内需求下滑，就说这是高质量发展的必然表现。
*   房地产“爆雷”，就说这是金融系统主动去杠杆。
反正中国没有坏消息，在中国只有好事没有坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I've summarized the rhetorical templates used by domestic technocrats to mislead "our Emperor":<br>* If loans fall, they say it's structural upgrading.<br>* If M2 falls, they say the financial system is more mature.<br>* If domestic demand declines, they say it's an inevitable manifestation of high-quality development.<br>* If real estate "explodes" (defaults), they say it's the financial system proactively deleveraging.<br>In any case, there is no bad news in China; in China, there are only good things, no bad things.</p>
</details>

### 贷款造假与技术官僚的“两难”

我们再把彭博社这两天爆出的中国贷款造假新闻联系起来看，就能完全理解为什么央行愿意放弃坚持贷款增速，开始为贷款下滑、M2下滑找各种结构性理由。
彭博社的报道说得很清楚：银行为了完成监管部门下达的贷款考核目标，宁愿用自己的钱去帮客户垫付利息，只求“冲量刷数据”。这是什么意思呢？市场没有需求，但银行指标必须完成；企业不想借钱，但银行必须让贷款增长；没有真实项目可以投放，银行只能“自借自还”刷数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we connect this with the news of China's loan data fraud exposed by Bloomberg in the past couple of days, we can fully understand why the PBOC is willing to abandon its insistence on loan growth and start finding various structural reasons for the decline in loans and M2.<br>Bloomberg's report clearly states: to meet the loan assessment targets set by regulatory authorities, banks are willing to use their own money to pay interest for clients, just to "boost volume and inflate data." What does this mean? The market has no demand, but bank targets must be met; companies don't want to borrow, but banks must show loan growth; with no real projects to fund, banks can only "self-lend and self-repay" to inflate data.</p>
</details>

这些贷款企业根本就没有需求，是银行纯粹为了应付考核而做出来的“空心贷款”。这种事情偶尔做一两次还行，但年年“冲量”，银行的利润也扛不住啊。
而监管继续硬性考核银行的贷款规模，今年甚至还专门加了一个“民营企业贷款投放比例考核”。你不考核还好，你一考核，又逼着银行弄虚作假。
所以，央行比谁都清楚，现在的贷款增速里有多少是水分。为了不让银行自己把自己“玩死”，央行不如顺势让“咱皇上”接受银行贷款下降的事实，给一个能糊弄住“咱皇上”的理由。其实，这是为了救自己底下的这些商业银行啊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These loans have no real demand from enterprises; they are "hollow loans" created by banks purely to cope with assessments. Doing this once or twice might be acceptable, but year after year of "boosting volume" would be unsustainable for bank profits.<br>Meanwhile, regulators continue to rigidly assess banks' loan sizes, and this year even added a "private enterprise loan allocation ratio assessment." It would have been better not to assess; once assessed, banks are forced to resort to deception again.<br>Therefore, the PBOC knows better than anyone how much "water" (exaggeration) is in the current loan growth figures. To prevent banks from "playing themselves to death," the PBOC might as well let "our Emperor" accept the fact of declining bank loans and provide a reason that can fool "our Emperor." In reality, this is to save the commercial banks under its purview.</p>
</details>

现在，中国的技术官僚在“咱皇上”手下做事，确实非常艰难。因为他们面临着一个几乎不可能同时完成的双重考验：
一方面，他们永远不能说真话，每天必须向上汇报“形势一片大好”，任何问题都要包装成成绩，任何风险都要描绘成机遇。这是体制对他们的基本要求——必须让“咱皇上”听到好消息，让宏观叙事永远保持积极向上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Currently, China's technocrats face immense difficulties working under "our Emperor." This is because they are confronted with a dual challenge that is almost impossible to fulfill simultaneously:<br>On one hand, they can never speak the truth. Every day, they must report upwards that "the situation is excellent," packaging every problem as an achievement and portraying every risk as an opportunity. This is a fundamental requirement of the system—they must ensure "our Emperor" hears good news and that the macro-narrative always remains positive.</p>
</details>

但另一方面，他们又必须处理现实经济的烂摊子：房地产“爆雷”、地方债承压、银行资产恶化、消费疲软、就业紧张。这些问题都是真实存在的，躲也躲不掉。一个不小心，还会发生像**恒大**（Evergrande: 中国大型房地产开发商，面临严重债务危机）“爆雷”、理财违约、**河南村镇银行**（Henan Rural Banks: 曾发生大规模储户资金冻结事件）事件之类的恶性事件。只要一出这种事，“咱皇上”第一个找他们问责。
所以，现在中国的技术官僚压力确实很大。无论是证监会主席还是央行行长，虽然身居高位，但谁知道什么时候就被“咱皇上”逮进去了。金融系统真是“人均高危职业”啊。
因此，我反而认为，吴清同志想辞职的心或许是真的，只是能不能辞职不是自己说了算罢了。也许央行的潘功胜行长也天天在琢磨，自己怎么才能全身而退呢？毕竟时代不同了。

<p class="english-text">But on the other hand, they must deal with the real economic mess: real estate "explosions" (defaults), local government debt pressure, deteriorating bank assets, weak consumption, and tight employment. These problems are real and unavoidable. One misstep could lead to severe incidents like the Evergrande default, wealth management product defaults, or the Henan Rural Banks incident. As soon as such an event occurs, "our Emperor" will be the first to hold them accountable.<br>Therefore, the pressure on China's technocrats is indeed immense. Whether it's the Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission or the Governor of the PBOC, despite their high positions, who knows when "our Emperor" might apprehend them? The financial system is truly a "high-risk profession" for everyone.<br>Thus, I believe that Comrade Wu Qing's desire to resign might be genuine; it's just that whether he can resign is not up to him. Perhaps PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng is also constantly pondering how he can make a safe exit. After all, times have changed.<br>Alright, that concludes today's program.
