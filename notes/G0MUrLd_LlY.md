### 12月FOMC会议回顾与鸽派基调

大家好。今天是12月10日，这是我关于12月**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会）会议的解读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello my friends. Today is December 10th and this is my December FOMC debrief.</p>
</details>

好的，我们刚刚结束了新闻发布会，我告诉大家，我认为这是一次超级有趣的会议，而且令人惊讶地**鸽派**（Dovish: 指倾向于采取宽松货币政策的立场）。现在，在我们讨论今天发生的事情之前，我们先稍微统一一下背景信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, we just had the press conference and let me tell you, I think it was a super interesting meeting and surprisingly surprisingly dovish. Now before we talk about what happened today, let's level sit a little bit.</p>
</details>

在本次会议之前，所有人都普遍预期美联储将在12月降息，但这并非一直如此。9月份时，美联储确实指引了12月会降息。但请记住，在上一次会议上，主席基本上在新闻发布会开始时就表示，**额外的削减**（additional cuts: 指进一步降息）远非定局，并指出FOMC内部存在大量**异议**（dissent: 指投票中持不同意见的成员）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now heading into this meeting, everyone widely expected that the Fed will cut, but that was not always the case. Now in September, the Fed did guide towards a cut here in December. But then remember the last meeting, PAL basically started the press conference saying that additional cuts are far from guaranteed, noting that there was a lot of dissent on the FOMC.</p>
</details>

在随后的几周里，我们开始听到更多关于这些异议的声音。我们看到所有这些美联储主席都出来说，“你知道，我们不应该再降息了，你知道，通货膨胀是个问题”等等。因此，在听到这些言论后，市场将12月的降息预期完全排除在外了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the weeks that followed, we began to hear more about these descents. We have all these Fed presidents come out and say that, you know, we we shouldn't be cutting rates anymore. You know, inflation's a problem and so forth. And so after hearing that the market priced out a December cut.</p>
</details>

然而，在**静默期**（blackout period: 指美联储官员在会议前被禁止公开发言的时期）开始时——静默期是美联储会议前官员不再被允许公开发言的时期——我们有一些重量级人物出来表示，“你知道，12月降息，我我可能会支持。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, uh just as blackout period was beginning, blackout period is the period before a Fed meeting where Fed officials are no longer allowed to speak. We had some heavy hitters come out and say that you know rate cut in December. I I could support that.</p>
</details>

美联储的运作方式是，虽然委员会中的许多人——美联储主席们——可以轮流投票，但每个人在影响力上是不平等的。结果是，那些在委员会中任职时间长、影响力更大、且有正确记录的人投票支持降息，而那些新人则更**鹰派**（hawkish: 指倾向于紧缩货币政策的立场），他们没有得逞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the way that the Fed works is that whereas you know a lot of people on the committee Fed presidents can vote on a rotating basis um each person is unequal in their influence. Now as it turned out the guys that have been on the committee for a long time people who are more influential and have a track record of being correct they were voting for cuts and the guys who are new um they were more hawkish and they did not get their way.</p>
</details>

因此，这就带我们来到了今天，我们确实得到了美联储的降息。看看投票情况，我们发现也有异议。当然，**Myin** 委员希望降息50个**基点**（basis points: 利率变动的百分之一，即0.01%）。他已经这样做几次了。我们还有几位美联储主席反对降息，倾向于完全不降息。但无论如何，**Cherpaw**（主席）设法聚集了多数票，推动了降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that uh brings us to today where we did get indeed a Fed cut. And looking at uh the voting, it looks like we also got desents. We have Governor Myin of course uh would like to have 50 basis points. He's done this a few times now. And we also have a couple Fed presidents who desented preferring not to cut at all.</p>
</details>

### 点阵图、通胀预测与就业数据修正

这也是一次特殊的**美联储会议**（special Fed meeting），我们得到了**点阵图**（dot plot: 美联储官员对未来利率路径的点状预测图）。请记住，我们每季度都会得到点阵图。在点阵图中，每位美联储官员都会标记他们对未来几年通胀、利率和美联储政策的预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So but in any case, Cherpaw was able to muster together a majority and push through a cut. Now, this was also one of these special Fend meetings where we got a dot plot. Remember, we get the dot plot quarterly. And on the dot plot, what each Fed official marks down is their forecasts for inflation, for rates, for uh Fed policy over the next few years.</p>
</details>

这张点阵图非常有趣，因为它基本保持不变，除了通胀的预测实际上被修正得更好了。所以他们降低了通胀预测。中位数的美联储参与者降低了他们的通胀预测。因此，当然，有更多的**通货膨胀放缓**（disinflation: 指通货膨胀率下降，但物价仍在上涨）是暗示着更多的降息，因为通胀预期会改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what's really interesting about this stop plot is that it was mostly unchanged except that um inflation was actually forecast uh the for to be better. So they lowered their inflation forecast. U the median Fed participant lowered their inflation forecast. So you know having more disinflation of course uh is suggestive of uh more rate cuts since of course inflation is expected to to get better.</p>
</details>

当然，发生的另一件事是**资产负债表**（Balance Sheet: 指美联储持有的资产和负债）的问题，我们稍后会讨论。我发现新闻发布会非常有趣，因为它有点泄露了美联储的底牌，给我的感觉是非常非常鸽派的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now one other thing that happened of course was the balance sheet thing which which we'll talk about a bit later. So I found the press conference to be very interesting because it kind of gives away the Fed's hand and struck me as very very dovish.</p>
</details>

众所周知，美联储有两个任务：充分就业和物价稳定。让我们听听**Chow**（主席）对就业的看法。自4月以来，平均每月新增**非农就业岗位**（Payroll jobs: 工资名册上的就业岗位）为4万个。我们认为这些数字被夸大了大约6万个。所以，这意味着每月是负2万个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now as we know the Fed has two mandates, full employment and price stability. Let's listen to what Chowo thought about employment. Payroll jobs uh averaging 40,000 per month since April. We think there's an overstatement in in these numbers by about 60,000. So that would be negative 20,000 per month.</p>
</details>

主席基本上是在说，你知道，我们的官方数字、政府数据显示我们平均每月创造了4万个工作岗位，但根据我们自己的数据，我们认为在修正之后，实际上每月是负2万个。如果我们每月损失2万个工作岗位，这显然是个问题，显然这要求采取的不是中性货币政策，而是宽松的政策。因此，在我看来，这为比市场定价的更多的降息打开了大门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So chairp is basically saying that you know our official numbers government data is saying that we created on average you know 40,000 jobs a month but based on our own data we're thinking that post revisions it's actually more like negative 20,000 a month. Now, if we are losing 20,000 jobs a month, obviously that is a problem and obviously that calls for not just neutral monetary policy but uh easy policy. So that in my view opens the door for more cuts than the market is pricing in.</p>
</details>

一个更鹰派的人会说，是的，我们在失业，但部分原因是我们的人口增长放缓了很多。是的，但我认为无论从哪个角度来看，每月损失2万个工作岗位都将继续推高失业率。事实上，我想，如果我们得到一个NFP（非农就业报告）数据，下周我们就会得到一个，如果那个数据是负数，我认为市场会做出非常强烈的反应，定价更多的降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now a more hawkish person would say yeah we're losing jobs but also in part because our population growth has slowed a lot. Yeah, but I think by any measure, losing 20,000 jobs a month is going to continue to push the unemployment rate higher. That that's actually I think if we got an NFP print and we're going to get one next week, that that had a negative number. I think the market would react very strongly by pricing in a lot more cuts.</p>
</details>

目前，市场定价是明年再降息两次，然后在3%左右停止。这低于美联储认为的**中性利率**（neutral rate: 既不刺激也不抑制经济的利率水平）的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the moment, the market is pricing in we get two more cuts next year and stop at around 3%. that is uh under the power fed what the medium voter considers to be the neutral rate.</p>
</details>

### 通胀评估与资产影响

我们转向通胀数据。如我们所知，通胀仍高于美联储的目标，约为3%，但他们预测通胀将继续下降。以下是**Paul**（指主席）对通胀的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So moving on to the inflation uh data. So again as we all know inflation is higher than the Fed's target. It's about 3% though they forecast it will continue to decline. Here's what Paul said about inflation.</p>
</details>

关于通胀的故事，你知道，我们现在很清楚这是一个既定事实，那就是如果你撇开**关税**（tariffs: 进口税）不看，通胀率就在2%出头。所以，主要是关税造成了大部分通胀超调，而且我们认为在当前情况下，这些很可能是**一次性**（one-time price increase: 一次性的价格上涨）的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The story with inflation and uh you know we're well aware that this is a story at this point is that if you get away from tariffs inflation is in the low twos right so it's really tariffs and that that's causing the most of the inflation overshoot and we do think of those as likely to in the current situation as likely to be a one-time you know one-time price increase.</p>
</details>

所以他的意思是，是的，它高于目标，但这主要是由于关税，而关税是暂时的。所以，如果你把关税剔除，我们基本上就在2%的水平。如果你把这两点加起来：通胀基本在2%，劳动力市场陷入困境。这是一个要求政策转向宽松的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what he's saying is that yeah, it's it's above target, but that's mostly due to tariffs and tariffs are temporary. So you take that out, yeah, we're basically at 2%. Now, you know, you put two and two together, inflation basically at 2%, labor market in trouble. That's a that's a call for policy to move to um easing.</p>
</details>

我认为这在市场中还没有完全体现出来。看看黄金和白银等资产，这对它们来说相当看涨。对股市来说就更难说了。一方面，降息对股票是利好；另一方面，经济衰退对股票不利。如果我必须猜测，我会认为股市更关心降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's um not in the market. And looking at assets like gold and silver, that's uh quite bullish for them. Harder to say on the equity market, um on the one hand, rate cuts are positive equities. On the other hand, recession is not positive for equities. If I had to bet, I would guess that the equity market cares more about rate cuts.</p>
</details>

### 储备管理购买的重启

另一件超级有趣的事情是，美联储宣布重启**储备管理购买**（reserve management purchases: 美联储为管理银行准备金水平而进行的资产购买）。他们说，他们将在未来几个月内每月购买价值400亿美元的**国库券**（Treasury bills: 短期政府债券），然后根据情况进行调整。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the other thing that was super interesting that happened this is that the Fed announced its restarting of reserve management purchases. So what they said is they're going to start buying uh Treasury bills to the tune of 40 billion a month for the next few months and then adjust thereafter.</p>
</details>

他们这样做的原因是**货币市场利率**（money market rates）存在上行压力，而且我们正临近年底，年底时货币市场利率通常会有很大压力。所以他们不想再出现2019年末**回购利率**（repo rates）飙升的“**回购危机**”（repocalypse: repo market crisis）情况。他们正在提前应对这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the way the reason they're doing this is because there's upward pressure in the money market rates and we're also heading towards year end where often times there's significant pressure in money market rates. So they don't want to have another, you know, re repocalypse as they call it where repo rates surged in late 2019. So, they're getting ahead of this.</p>
</details>

我还要指出，早在11月，我就预测到了这一点，当时这还是一个非常非共识的观点。当时在推特上有些人说我太蠢了。但伙计们，今天发生的就是这样。每个人在不同的领域都有不同的专业水平等等。但在涉及货币市场、金融体系方面，好吧，听着，我在公开市场交易台工作了很多年，接触了大量的机密数据，与市场参与者进行了大量的交谈。这是我真正擅长的事情。因此，我很容易就能看出这会发生。如果你了解金融体系和美联储，我还要指出，上周，一家大银行——美国银行——也加入了这一行列。今天我们都被证明是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would also note that all the way back in November, I had called this and at that time it was super non- consensus. And uh some people were on Twitter calling me stupid. Uh but that is exactly what happened today guys. Everyone has different levels of expertise and different domains and so forth. But when it comes to money markets, the financial system, uh, well, listen, I I spent a number of years on the open markets desk having access to tons of confidential data, tons of conversations with market participants. This is something that I am really, really good at. And so, it was not hard for me to see that this would happen. If you understand the financial system and the Fed and I'd also note last week, one big bank, Bank of America, also jumped on the bandwagon. and uh today we were both proved correct.</p>
</details>

所以非常有趣，当然，我个人不认为这对市场有太大的影响，但我知道有些人认为这对风险是积极的，这就足够了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So very interesting and of course I personally don't really think of this as having too big of an impact on markets but I also know that there are people uh who perceive this to be risk positive and that's kind of enough.</p>
</details>

### 政治压力与未来展望

好了，这就是我为今天准备的内容，超级有趣的**美联储会议**（Fed meeting），明年一切都将改变。昨天有一条新闻说，**特朗普总统**（President Trump）正在关注美联储，他说，“你知道，这些美联储理事的任命，有些可能是用**自动签名笔**（autopen: 自动签名设备）签的。也许应该调查一下，对吧？不能让自动签名笔来签。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right so that's how I prepared for today super interesting Fed meeting and next year you know everything is going to change. Uh yesterday there was a headline that President Trump was uh looking at the Fed and he was like, you know, some of these Fed governor appointments, they were signed maybe by the autopen. Maybe someone should look into that, right?</p>
</details>

那是不对的。当然，他可能是在开玩笑，但你知道，他们会加大压力，寻找更多控制权的方法。让我们看看他们会怎么做。好了，周六再和大家聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can't have the autopin sign it. That's uh that's not correct. And of course, he's probably joking, but you know, they're going to turn up the pressure and find ways to have more control. Uh let's see what they do. All right, talk to you guys um Saturday.</p>
</details>
