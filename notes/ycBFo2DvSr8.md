title: 瑞银CEO埃尔莫蒂：从足球梦想、瑞信收购到全球金融领导力
---

### 从足球梦想走向全球金融

今天，我们非常荣幸地欢迎全球金融界最具影响力的领导者之一，**瑞银集团**（UBS: 瑞士最大的银行之一，提供财富管理、投资银行等服务）首席执行官塞尔吉奥·埃尔莫蒂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">today we are very excited to welcome one of the most impressive leaders in global Finance, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of UBS, which is one of the biggest banks in the world.</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生曾在2011年至2020年间领导瑞银，最近在历史性收购其主要竞争对手**瑞士信贷**（Credit Suisse: 瑞士第二大银行，后被瑞银收购）之后，戏剧性地重返岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sergio led UBS from 2011 until 2020, but he recently made a dramatic return after the historic acquisition of the main rival Credit Suisse.</p>
</details>

首先，埃尔莫蒂先生将回顾他的早年经历，谈谈他年轻时曾是一名才华横溢的足球运动员，以及他最终如何进入银行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But first, Sergio will go all the way back and talk about when you were even younger, you were a talented football player, so how come you ended up in banking?</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生表示，他显然没有那么有天赋，他的梦想是成为一名职业足球运动员，甚至到现在，他可能仍然愿意用现在的工作去交换在世界杯决赛中进球的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">I wasn't so talented obviously, so I guess, well, my dream was definitely I would have swapped until today probably playing a final of the World Cup and scoring a goal with my current job for sure, so I guess my dream as a young person was definitely to be a professional football player.</p>
</details>

然而，在瑞士，他可以通过**学徒制**（apprenticeship: 一种结合在职培训和课堂学习的职业教育模式）的教育体系。因此，他将进入银行业作为足球生涯的“B计划”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then, but then I in Switzerland, you know, we we could go through, you know, an education system that allows you to go through an apprenticeship, so I started in banking as a plan B, you know, to the football career.</p>
</details>

当他发现自己不够格成为一名职业足球运动员时，他选择了成为一名交易员，从而开启了他的银行职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when it turned out that I wasn't good enough to be a football player or a professional one at least, then I opted for becoming being a Trader, and so my career in banking started.</p>
</details>

主持人指出，埃尔莫蒂先生在金融领域也“进了不少球”。他27岁时就担任了一个非常重要的职位，这可能是他职业生涯中一个决定性的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, well, I would argue you've got you've scored quite a lot of goals, but it's just that it's being in finance rather than football, but what happened, you got a very important position, you were only 27 years old, yeah, that was probably the defining one of the defining moments in my career.</p>
</details>

当时，他通过学徒制学习，并在瑞士南部的卢加诺（Lugano）获得了银行硕士学位。之后，他被**花旗银行**（CitiBank: 一家美国跨国投资银行和金融服务公司）聘为可转换债券和期权交易员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because back then I went through an apprenticeship, I stayed in Lugano, the south of Switzerland, and I I did a master in in banking, and then I was hired by City Bank to be a Trader for convertible bonds and options and and so on.</p>
</details>

他做了18个月后，接到了**美林证券**（Merrill Lynch: 一家美国投资银行，现为美国银行的财富管理部门）一个“无法拒绝的著名邀约”。这个邀约并非纯粹的财务性质，而是让他有机会在瑞士建立他们的**瑞士法郎**（Swiss franc: 瑞士的官方货币）资本市场业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I did it for 18 months, and then I got the the famous offer you can't refuse from from from uh from Mar Lynch, which was not necessarily Financial, was the ability or the opportunity to to build up their Swiss frank Capital Market operation in Switzerland.</p>
</details>

那是1987年，他们几乎是从零开始，没有办公室，没有电话。埃尔莫蒂先生和另外两三位同事，其中他作为两位领导之一，踏上了建立瑞士法郎业务的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">1987, so basically from scratch, was almost no office, no no telephone, so and me and another two or three colleagues, you know, myself as one of the the two leader took on the embarking to this journey of building from scratch at the Swis Frank operation.</p>
</details>

这项业务最终发展壮大，他们上市并获得了银行牌照，这是一段非凡的旅程。埃尔莫蒂先生白天进行交易，晚上则处理后台管理和整个运营事务，这在今天看来是完全不可想象的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That eventually got bigger, we went to the stock exchange, we got a banking license, and that was a a fantastic Journey, so I was training during the day in the evening sorting out, you know, how to manage the back office and how to manage the entire operation, something totally Unthinkable today.</p>
</details>

那是一次决定性的经历，他学会了如何管理和建立一家企业，以及如何成为一名领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was a defining experience because I I I I learn how to manage how to build up a business, how to you know, look at different ways of being you know, a leader and and still being.</p>
</details>

主持人问为什么在今天看来这是不可想象的。埃尔莫蒂先生解释说，如今的**监管环境**（regulatory environment: 规范金融机构行为的法律、规则和标准）和大型组织的**公司治理**（governance: 公司管理和控制的系统）已经完全不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why would that be Unthinkable today? Because today I would say the regulatory environment is completely different, governance around large organizations is completely different.</p>
</details>

因此，让一个27岁的年轻人负责建立这样一家企业，在今天看来很可能是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So giving a to a 27 years old person a mandate to build up such a business was a probably yeah, I think is Unthinkable today, most likely, yeah.</p>
</details>

### 瑞信收购：危机中的抉择与使命召唤

时间快进到2023年3月19日，瑞银同意收购瑞士信贷。在此之前的一周，市场经历了巨大的动荡。埃尔莫蒂先生当时作为旁观者，对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fast forward to 19th of March, 2023, when UBS agreed to buy Credit Swiss, there was a big big turbulence in the market in the week up to this, now what did you what did you think well, seeing this from the sideline in a way at that stage?</p>
</details>

他表示，当时他作为瑞士经济委员会主席，也作为一名银行家或前银行家，对局势的发展感到非常遗憾。但他从未想过事情会如此戏剧性地结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, some kind of interested because I I I even back then I was a a chair of swissy and but also the facto as a as a banker or a former Banker, I felt you know, very sorry for seeing that, you know, situation developing and and and and but I I have to say that I never thought that it would hand so dramatically right over.</p>
</details>

直到那个周末前的周三，当他听说瑞士联邦委员会召开紧急会议时，他才意识到情况非常糟糕。他知道那个周末将会发生一些几乎不可能的事情，因为联邦委员会不会无缘无故地在这种特殊会议上发布重大公告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, of course, you know, until Wednesday the Wednesday before the weekend there that day when I heard that the Swiss fed Council was in an emergency U um session that I understand I understood that something must be pretty bad, and actually I knew that the weekend would turn out into something so almost impossible that they make such announcements on special sessions of the federal Council without something meaningful coming and there.</p>
</details>

他不得不承认，事态发展之快令人感到悲剧和惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I uh but I I have to say that the the speed at which things developed was was uh somehow tragic and and surprising.</p>
</details>

主持人指出，这在某种程度上是自**雷曼兄弟**（Lehman Brothers: 一家曾是全球领先的投资银行，在2008年金融危机中破产，引发了全球金融市场动荡）以来最大的失败，并问他有多震惊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this was in a way the biggest fault since Lon Brothers, right, so how shocked were you?</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生坦言，多年来他一直认为瑞士信贷可能没有可持续的商业模式，因此他对他们等待如此之久才采取激进决策感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To be fair, I think that we recognize I recognize for many years that maybe C.S. didn't have a sustainable business model, and in that sense, I was surprised that they waited for so long to take a radical decision.</p>
</details>

特别是他们在去年10月的增资未能获得投资者良好反响后，他认为他们会尝试寻找买家、进行拆分或采取其他激进措施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as time went by, particularly after their Capital increase in in in in October that didn't really, you know, go through well with investors, not only in terms of the placement of the stocks, but you know, the strategy, I I thought that they would try to find a buyer or to do a break up or do something's radical.</p>
</details>

因此，让外部因素，如区域银行危机，迫使他们采取行动，这有点令人惊讶。他认为，瑞士信贷以及其他潜在参与者可能长期以来未能完全掌控局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically to let that external factors like the regional banking crisis would force them somehow to you know, to to have to take actions was a little bit surprising, and but you know, I think it was the bank and and and potentially even other actors, I mean, they were probably not on top of the situation for for too long.</p>
</details>

他认为，瑞士在那个周末做得非常好，避免了一场“雷曼式危机”。金融危机吸取的教训，包括建立资本缓冲计划，使得私人解决方案并非不可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Switzerland did a pretty good job during the weekend to avoid a Leeman alike crisis, because I think that one has to also put into the context that at least the lessons learned from the financial crisis has created uh plans Capital buffers and that would not translate into a an impossible mission for a private solution to happen.</p>
</details>

此外，他认为，即使瑞士信贷倒闭，也不会让纳税人承担任何费用，但肯定会在市场中造成巨大的混乱和不确定性，因为人们会很快问：“下一个是谁？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also, which is our Theory, and that is proven a wind down of credit swis would have not costed the taxpayer any money, but of course, he would have created a lot of turmoils and uncertainties in the market, because the question would have been very quickly, was next, right?</p>
</details>

主持人问，在这样一个非同寻常的周末，当所有人都聚在一起解决危机时，具体发生了什么。埃尔莫蒂先生表示，从周三开始，他就接到了前同事或竞争对手的电话，询问他对局势的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so what happens during a weekend like that? I mean, this is not an ordinary weekend, I mean, what happens in a country who yeah, but for me, you know, I'm I was I was still a half Observer absolutely, but you were still you, I mean, UBS is a is a is a very significant power in the financial industry, yeah, but in in a weekend like that where everybody gets together to solve a crisis, what is what is happening specifically, yeah, it was interesting because uh yeah, from Wednesday onward, I started to get phone calls from you know, former colleagues or or competitors of the banks right, the banks, uh from people in the industry actually asking me what I thought about the situation.</p>
</details>

他们当然进行了辩论和讨论。在周末期间，他也接到了电话，但并非来自瑞银，而是关于制定其他计划的考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We were of course debating And discussing, and then uh during the weekend, you know, I I also got uh some phone calls um um in during the process, but I not from the UBS part, but uh as a you know, there was a a consideration about developing uh other plans.</p>
</details>

因此，在周末期间，他已经有所准备，知道会发生一些事情。他认为，当时很快就出现了私人解决方案，成为最可行的方案，能够带来确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh so I was somehow during the weekend prepar that something would would happen, and yeah, I think that's what you what you saw is that the facto uh uh very rapidly uh the private Solutions developing as the most viable one, the one that would create certainty developing.</p>
</details>

周日下午，当他听说瑞银被选为解决方案时，他感到某种程度的宽慰，因为他觉得公共解决方案会造成很大的损害，并非正确的做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so uh I have to say that Sunday afternoon when I heard that UBS was uh basically chosen as the solution, I was somehow relieved because I felt that you know, having a public uh uh solution would have been quite damaging uh not the right thing to do.</p>
</details>

之后，事情平静了几个小时，直到周一早上，他接到了董事长的电话。董事长告诉他：“我们需要谈谈。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh so and then things uh stayed quiet for few hours until Monday morning, and then I got a phone call from from the German from the German, yeah, and what did he say, yeah, I said that we we uh he told me we need to talk.</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生怀疑这不仅仅是喝啤酒或寻求建议。他们决定在周二见面，几分钟后，会议的目的就非常清楚了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and so I suspected was not probably just having a beer or just asking my uh advice, it could have been because we but uh then we decided to meet on Tuesday, and uh and after a few minutes, it got pretty clear on the reason for for the meeting.</p>
</details>

他当时的想法是，一方面，他感受到了对瑞银的忠诚和一种“职责召唤”，也是对国家的责任。他感到荣幸，人们会想到他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you think, well, of course, I was uh you know, on one end, uh I felt like uh yeah, the Temptation uh was a sense of uh of loyalty to UBS uh kind of Call of Duty also to the to the country, uh you know, I was I felt honored that people were thinking about me.</p>
</details>

另一方面，他必须找到自己的动力。他的动力在于，他认为从一个不理想甚至悲剧的局面中，他们可以创造一些伟大的东西，最终为股东、客户和员工创造持久的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the other hand, you know, I had to find my own motivation, so and uh my own motivation that I thought and I still believe today that you know, out of something that is definitely not ideal and quite tragic, we can do something great, and eventually something that can create longlasting value for for shareholders, but also for clients and employees of the of because.</p>
</details>

他指出，对许多瑞士信贷的员工来说，过去几年是痛苦的煎熬；而对瑞银的员工来说，他们现在拥有更强的竞争地位和更多样化的业务。客户和股东也将从中受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, on one end, you know, may for many of the credit Swiss employees was an Agony in the last few years, and I think that for the UBS employees, we now have a even stronger competitive position, uh more Diversified business, our clients will benefit, and I do think also shareholders will benefit over time.</p>
</details>

因此，他觉得这其中存在一种动力，可以做一些对行业具有变革意义的事情。他花了48小时来考虑这个决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I felt okay, there is we think so too, by the way, yes, good, but there there was also a motivation for me to do something that was quite transformational, and uh for the industry, and uh and therefore um so I got a good motivation, so it took me 48 hours to to think about.</p>
</details>

他与妻子和几位朋友进行了交流，但没有人告诉他不要接受。每个人都相当确信他应该接受这个挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who did you speak to, who do you take advice from, well, the I I think I I spoke to my wife, uh but after a few seconds, she told me, but it looks like you're looking at my face, she thought she felt I already decided as I was talking to her, but uh no, honestly, I I uh I a couple of friends, uh I spoke to, uh but uh you know, I have to say that none of them told me don't do it, everybody was quite uh convinced that I should should follow m.</p>
</details>

主持人问，他之前在瑞银非常成功，现在回去承担一项有风险的任务，他对此有何看法。埃尔莫蒂先生表示，这可能是真正决定性的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you you had been very successful at UBS, and now going back and taking on something which is you know, in part risky, right, what did you what did you think about that?</p>
</details>

他做了一个非常简单的分析：他之前提到的对瑞银和瑞士的责任感发挥了作用。如果他拒绝，而事情没有好转，他会感到某种程度的共同责任，因为他没有勇气或自私地拒绝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, that was probably the the really deciding uh moment because I made a very simple analysis, the reason I mentioned to you this the the the sense of uh duty to UBS uh uh and and and and to Switzerland played a role in making me feel like if I say no, and things don't turn out well, not that I think I can resolve every problem to be honest, but I would feel somehow Corr responsible for not not having the guts or being egoistic about not doing it for whatever my own reasons, right?</p>
</details>

因此，他觉得在这种情况下无法感到安心。另一方面，如果事情成功了，他会觉得自己当初没有做是多么愚蠢。所以他觉得别无选择，必须去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So so I felt I could not really feel comfortable about being in that situation, and then on the other end, I felt that if it turns out to be a success, like I believe it is, I would feel stupid for not having do it, so I said I have no choice, I had absolutely no choice, I had to do it, so because I would feel most likely bad about any of the two scenario, so the likelihood that we're going to be an on event is very low, so I think that's uh in that sense, uh that was my rational for taking the decision.</p>
</details>

主持人问，这种对国家的责任感从何而来。他认为，这可能因为他来自瑞士南部意大利语区，这是一个少数民族。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this sense of Duty for your country, where does that come from, you think, probably because we as the southern part of Switzerland, the Italian part of Switzerland is a minority.</p>
</details>

这可能是第一次有来自瑞士南部的人担任如此重要的职位。他认为，必须有一种展示给全国其他地区看，证明他们也能行的责任感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's probably also the first time that somebody from the south of Switzerland has such a important uh position, I don't know, I don't know, is a good question, I I do believe that there is I love this, but I do believe there has to be some kind of uh sense of standing and demonstrating uh to the rest of the country that that we we can we are also.</p>
</details>

他强调，瑞士的生存之道在于文化多样性，包括德语区和法语区。意大利语区只有30万人，在850万人口中确实是少数，但他们与法语区人民有着非常凝聚的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, no, no, no, no, I did it because I believe, no, I I mean, fundamentally, I think Switzerland is a is living out of diversity between cultural diversity, the German 23 of Switzerland, we are only 300,000 people out of uh eight and a half n million people, so definitely a minority, but uh but still the with the French people, we have a very cohesive way of looking at it.</p>
</details>

### 整合挑战：稳定与未来

埃尔莫蒂先生谈到，他回到瑞银的最初几周，情况非常超现实。他一周内就回到了他以前的办公室，在银行里待了48小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I have to say that it was quite surreal how things developed so quickly, I found myself into into into my office, uh old office within a week, uh in the bank within 48 hours, or you know, basically we announced it on the 29th of March, so basically the next morning I was in the bank.</p>
</details>

工作强度如此之大，他必须专注于优先事项：如何稳定客户和员工？如何启动整合计划？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh and uh it it was so intense that I had to focus on the priorities, the priority was okay, what what do we need to do to stabilize uh uh the clients, what do we need to do to stabilize the employees, what needs to be done to to to really start to you know, uh develop uh the integration plan, what are the priorities?</p>
</details>

他必须开始考虑与他合作的团队。对他来说，首要任务是充分了解他们承担了哪些风险，以及公司的流动性状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I had to start to consider okay, with the team that is going to uh be with me, uh and and and one of the first priority for me from the very beginning was okay, I need to fully understand what kind of risk we took on, what is the liquidity position of the company Bank, not only for risk management.</p>
</details>

他告诉董事会，他的首要任务是尽快偿还政府的紧急流动性支持，并尽快归还对被认定为潜在问题投资组合的担保。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But because my first priority, I told the board, was we need to repay as quickly as we can the emergency liquidity support of the government, and we need to return the guarantee on the portfolio that was uh uh selected as a potentially problematic, uh as soon as possible, and that was my number one priority.</p>
</details>

主持人问，为什么尽快偿还如此重要。埃尔莫蒂先生认为，一旦他们能够证明自己有能力吸收任何多余的风险并掌控局面，这将是最终安抚所有利益相关者、客户、员工和整个社区的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why is that so important to pay that by quickly? Because that was in my point of view, once we would determine that we have the strength and the ability to absorb any of the excess risk that we uh would find, and then we are in control of that, that would be the ultimate way to reassure um our stakeholders, clients, and in general, you know, our employees and and and the rest of of the community in which we operate.</p>
</details>

能够说“我们接管了，我们掌控局面，我们可以用自己的资本和流动性来做到这一点”，这对他来说是最终的证明，表明他们对**尽职调查**（due diligence: 在进行交易或投资前对目标公司进行全面调查和评估）感到满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the ability to say, okay, we took over, we are in control, we can do it with our own Capital, our own liquidity, for me, was the the ultimate thing that we were comfortable about our due diligence.</p>
</details>

完成这些花了三四个月的时间，但对他来说，从一开始的几周内，他就很清楚他们很有机会做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it took uh uh three four months to do that, right, so to to to to come, but for me, was almost very clear from the very beginning after a couple a couple of three four weeks, I you know, I realized that we we would have a good chance to to do that.</p>
</details>

他曾表示，瑞士信贷没有可持续的商业模式。他指的是什么？埃尔莫蒂先生解释说，最危险的莫过于一家大型银行或一家银行不赚钱或亏钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You said that it was clear to you that credit F didn't have a sustainable business model, what do you how could you see that, what what do you mean by that, in a very easy way, it's very simple, there is nothing more dangerous than a large bank or a bank not making money or losing money.</p>
</details>

如果一家银行无法覆盖其**资本成本**（Cost of Capital: 公司为筹集资金而支付的成本）甚至亏损，那么就知道有问题了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That should be in mind, there is no Capital, no liquidity, no no matter what do you think if you have a bank that is either not covering its cost of capital or even worse losing money, then you know that something is wrong.</p>
</details>

对他来说，如果一家以**财富管理**（Wealth Management: 为高净值个人提供投资、财务规划等综合金融服务）和**资产募集**（Asset Gathering: 吸引和管理客户资产）为核心业务，并在瑞士拥有强大全能银行市场地位的银行，却无法支付其资本成本，那么就存在问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in in in in essence for me, when you have a a a a Wealth Management Center business an asset Gathering, let's call it right Centric business with a strong position in the Universal banking Market in Switzerland, if you are not able to pay for your cost of capital, then you know there is a problem, and that was the case.</p>
</details>

问题在于，他们将过多的资本分配给了**投资银行**（Investment Bank: 提供企业融资、并购咨询、证券承销等服务的金融机构），其回报低于**股本成本**（Cost of Equity: 公司为吸引股权投资者而必须提供的最低回报率）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what was the problem? I mean, why were they not making money? Because they were allocating too much Capital to the Investment Bank, yeah, below and with returns below their cost of equity.</p>
</details>

他们过度依赖利用信贷作为杠杆来建立业务关系，包括财富管理。虽然这本身没有错，但如果一家以财富管理或资产募集为核心的组织，贷款应该是一种补充客户服务的工具，而不是获取业务的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh because they were still relying too much on taking uh or or using credit uh as a lever to go into business relationship including wealth management, which is not bad for per se, but you know, if you are a wealth management or an asset Gathering Centric organization, Landing is a tool that you give to clients, you know, to comp Le your offering is not the tool that you get in order to get into business.</p>
</details>

瑞士信贷拥有非常优秀的人才、产品和能力，在过去几十年中一直被视为一家具有创业精神的银行。但从某种意义上说，它变得过于“创业”和过于冒险，以至于随着时间的推移，完全失去了对风险回报和资本回报的纪律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and and you know, Cru is very strong, c as very good people, very good products, very good capabilities, and was seen over the last uh centuries and the last decades as a entrepreneurial bank, so but in a sense, it become way too entrepreneurial, and way too risk-taking in order to accommodate clients that over time it lost completely the disciplines on risk reward and return on Capital.</p>
</details>

接管时，员工士气如何？埃尔莫蒂先生表示，当时有很多失望、愤怒的人。有些人不愿失去作为组织的身份，有些人因为各种原因损失了很多钱，还有些人完全不适应突然要和他们多年来一直竞争的对手在同一屋檐下工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was the moral like, what was the moral like in the workforce there when you took over, definitely a lot of disappointment, a lot of angry people, a lot of a lot of people that were you know, for different reason, you know, the one that uh that they were absolutely not uh comfortable with losing their identity as as an organization, the one that were totally pissed off because they lost a lot of their money uh in different, you know, uh and uh and so on and so forth, so the one that were absolutely uh uncomfortable with the idea now all of a sudden to be in the same house as the one they've been fighting at for for years and years.</p>
</details>

这是一种复杂的局面，从外部很难想象，毕竟他们竞争了170年。他用了一个比喻来解释：“我们一直在争夺全国冠军，现在我们是瑞士国家队，我们需要为更大的比赛而战。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So was a mix, I think it's probably difficult to imagine from the outside because you've been competing for how many years, I mean, crit with and uh and 170 years, 170 years, right, on on one on each Corner in every town in Switzerland, right, yeah, and then suddenly you are going to be friends and family, yeah, it's not it's not yeah, but my analogy I'm telling to people is to say fine, we we have been fighting to for for the national championships, now we are the Swiss national team, and we need to play for the bigger games, and therefore that's a new Mission.</p>
</details>

他认为，这种合并在和平时期是无法实现的，但在银行业，所有能创造价值的合并都发生在压力时期。回顾美国银行，它们之所以能达到今天的地位，都是因为在金融危机期间被允许或被要求整合那些即将倒闭或正在倒闭的银行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean, uh I mean, the reason we thought Al so attractive the situation is because it's a kind of merger you can never do in peace time, but look in banking, all the mergers that creates any value are coming at moments of stress, yeah, look back at US Banks, you look back how they got now into their position, it's all about them being allowed or being asked during the financial crisis to grab or put together banks that were about to fail or they were failing and so on and so forth.</p>
</details>

金融危机时常发生，所以这是一个等待的游戏。遗憾的是，往往需要一场危机才能创造出有意义的东西，但这却是现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so and financial crisis, they come every so often, so it's the waiting game, right, yeah, so the issue is that it's a Pity that it takes a crisis to create something that makes sense, but that's a reality.</p>
</details>

许多并购失败并非因为产业逻辑或财务逻辑不存在，而是因为人们的“化学反应”不佳，在治理或各自角色上无法达成一致。但在危机期间，有赢家也有输家，这种情感因素就排除了，这就是交易能够达成的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, you know, that a lot of m& fails not because the industrial logic is not there, not because the financial logic is not there, not because blah blah blah, but because of chemistry of people not agreeing on governance or or their own roles, so it's a Pity and then during a crisis, there is a winner and loser, and therefore that kind of emotions goes out of the equation, and that's the reason you have the deals.</p>
</details>

现在一年过去了，他目前的优先事项是什么？第一阶段是整合，现在最大的优先事项是合并运营实体，即所谓的母公司银行：瑞银集团和瑞士信贷集团。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now we are one year later, what are your priorities at this stage, phase one was the integration, the biggest priority right now is to go into the merger of the operating entities, so-call parent company Banks, UBS AG, credit Swiss AG.</p>
</details>

瑞士信贷将大约600个法律实体纳入瑞银框架，所以他们需要进行合并。

<details>

</details>

### 瑞士银行业的优势与欧洲的挑战

谈到瑞士和银行业，埃尔莫蒂先生认为，在过去三四十年里，情况已经完全改变和演变。他15岁开始职业生涯时，一切都基于银行保密和自由裁量权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on a bit, what is it about Switzerland and banking? It's a combination first of all, had completely changed and evolved in the last 30 40 years, when I started my career at 15 was uh all based on banking secrecy and uh and discretion.</p>
</details>

现在，一切都关乎提供专业的服务。他认为，这是专业服务与瑞士政治体系的可靠性相结合的结果，更重要的是政治的稳定性以及法治，这些都赋予人们信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now is it's all about having Professional Services, uh I would say it's a combination of of that, but also uh the reliability of of the Swiss political system, uh the kind of neut it's not really the neutrality, it's more about the stability of the political and and uh the rule of law that allows people the strengths of the Swiss rank as as a currency also gives a lot of confidence to people.</p>
</details>

瑞士法郎作为货币的强势也给人们带来了很多信心。他认为，有很多原因可以解释为什么瑞士作为一个国家，在金融领域表现出色，甚至在制药、食品、创新和大学等领域也“超水平发挥”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it takes a lot of uh um you know, um uh re reasons to get why Switzerland is as big as you know, it is uh U punching well above its weight, but not only in banking, I if you look at Pharma, you look at Food, you look at Innovation, the universities, Switzerland is a country that punches well above its weights.</p>
</details>

他认为，这得益于瑞士在教育上的大量投入，以及灵活且充满活力的劳动力市场和优秀的教育体系，这些都是在当今时代取得成功的先决条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, why is that you think? I I think the fact that we invest a lot in in education, I mean, at the end of the day, we have a pretty flexible and Dynam IC labor market, and a very good education system, which are the prerequisite if you want to be successful in uh nowadays.</p>
</details>

主持人提到，自他在伦敦金融界工作以来，美国投行几乎完全取代了欧洲的竞争对手。他认为这是为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One other thing that I think is interesting is just since I started to work in finance in London, uh us investment banks have pretty much wiped away so much of the European competition, why why do you think that is?</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生解释说，在金融危机期间，美国监管机构对美国银行施加了限制和吸取了教训，但他们明确表示希望美国银行继续成为金融服务行业的领导力量。因此，他们允许美国银行发展壮大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So during the financial crisis, the facto U with all the uh the constraint and the Lessons Learned, us Regulators put on their US Banks, one thing they made it clear, they wanted US Banks to continue to be or to be uh the leading Force going forward in in in in in the financial services industry, and so they allow them to grow.</p>
</details>

欧洲则采取了相反的做法，他们尽一切可能不让银行变得更大或更成功。欧洲的碎片化，无论是监管还是政治层面，缺乏**资本市场联盟**（Capital Market Union: 欧盟旨在整合成员国资本市场以促进投资和增长的计划）和**银行业联盟**（Banking Union: 旨在加强欧元区银行监管和解决银行危机的机制），阻碍了强大替代者的出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Europe did the contrary, Europe did everything they could have done to uh to don't allow uh Banks to be uh bigger or successful, so and and and and the fragmentation of Europe also from a political not political, but I would say a regulatory and SL political standpoint of view without a capital Market Union without a banking Union has prevented the creation of strong and alternative uh players.</p>
</details>

瑞银之所以能够脱颖而出，是因为他们拥有更充足的资本。虽然瑞士业务利润丰厚，但瑞士只有900万人口，无法与任何主要国家相比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so the reason why we are now emerging as a uh uh David versus goolia is because we are a more capital L, we we are able to uh you know, of course, the Swiss business is very profitable, but it's a 9 million people country, so it's it can really be as big as any major countries.</p>
</details>

但瑞银的优势在于财富管理和资产募集。欧洲很少有其他银行能做到这一点。他认为，欧洲仍然存在一种政治意愿，不希望银行变得太大，以及很多“地方主义”思想，每个国家都想拥有自己的“国家冠军”，却忘记了赢得国内冠军在全球竞争中作用不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But because our strength is the the wealth management asset Gathering angle, so few few other banks in Europe can do that, but I do think that uh there is a a political uh uh desire to not allow Banks to become too big, still a lot of parochial thinking in Europe about being big Banks, so each each wants to have their own national champions forgetting that winning the the national championships doesn't take you very far in terms of global same same with Airlines, yeah.</p>
</details>

### 领导力、企业文化与人才培养

主持人问，瑞银的核心文化有多重要，以及它与其他银行的核心文化有何不同。埃尔莫蒂先生表示，他们努力对员工非常坦诚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How how important has the Cora culture of UBS been, and what is I mean, how would you define the corpa culture, UBS versus other Banks? I think that we try to be very clear to our people, and uh it's funny because when I started in 2011, 2012, I was confronted with a lot of uh uh criticism by external people, even internally about where the culture of the bank banks in general, the culture of the bank, not not good culture, blah blah blah.</p>
</details>

他回忆说，2011-2012年他刚上任时，内外都对银行文化有很多批评。他试图探究银行是否真的没有文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I try to really say, but is it true, is it true that we don't have a culture, and when I started to look bottom up and top down what we stand for, I realize that we had clearly some common uh commonalities and things that we could build on.</p>
</details>

当他自下而上、自上而下地审视瑞银的价值观时，他发现他们确实有一些共同点和可以发展的基础。他们所做的就是明确区分，在薪酬和晋升方面，不仅要看员工做了什么，还要看他们如何实现结果，并给出两个分数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we did is to really make a big differentiations between okay, now we look at people in terms of not only compensation, but promotions in scoring uh alongside what people do and how they achieve their results and giving two scores.</p>
</details>

确保要成为成功的领导者或团队成员，不能只擅长其中一项，而必须两方面都优秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Making sure that in order to be a successful leader or member of the team going forward, you can be just great in one or the other, you need to be good at both.</p>
</details>

他曾说过，“我们需要团队合作，但我们不能总是朋友。”他指的是什么？他用体育来打比方：年轻时踢球，并非每个队友都是朋友，但他们有一个共同点——都想赢得比赛，并确保场上每个人都全力以赴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've said that um we need teamwork, but we cannot be friends all the time, what do you mean by that, well, friends are not I mean, I take my analogy from Sports, and when I was playing young, I mean, it's not like every teammate was a friend, but uh you know, but we had to have one thing in common, we wanted to win the game, and we wanted to make sure that all the people on the pitch would follow and give 100%.</p>
</details>

这意味着他们需要对共同的目标和价值观有共同的理解，并抛开更多情感化的“友谊”部分。如果友谊自然产生，那当然很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so that's what I mean is that H we need to have common understanding of what we stand for and our goals and and uh we need to leave out the more emotional part, the Friendship part, if it comes, it's good, I mean, my God, I mean, it's absolutely better to have it that way.</p>
</details>

但在某些情况下，过深的工作中个人关系也可能带来危险，因为它可能随着时间成为冲突因素，使领导者无法保持可信和公正。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in some cases, it can be also dangerous because you know, when when you develop too deep of a personal relationship at work, it may over time be a conflicting element that doesn't allow you to be uh a credible leader, uh an unbiased leader, so you have to pay attention all the time how how you balance the two the two factors.</p>
</details>

当然，他分享了一个在美国的同事的奇妙轶事：一位同事第二次失去肾脏，急需寻找第二个肾，结果有一群瑞银员工自愿捐献肾脏。这表明他们之间发展出了超越同事关系的深厚情谊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course, you know, I can tell you that uh what I saw in the US is I don't know if you heard that anecdote is fantastic uh a colleague of ours uh was uh lost for the second time his kidney, and so he needed desperately to find a second one, and he got a group of UBS people volunteering to donate the kidney, wow, so it must be that something's there developed Beyond being just a colleague, right?</p>
</details>

他对此没有任何异议，但这并非组织应该强求的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So and you know, I have nothing against that, but of course, it's not something that we should force as an organization.</p>
</details>

主持人问，他被要求寻找自己的继任者，他会如何着手。埃尔莫蒂先生表示，他只是这个过程的一部分，就像上次一样，责任在于董事会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, you have been tasked also to find your own successor, how do you go about doing that, well, it's not really I'm part of the process, like I was last time, the responsibility is for the board.</p>
</details>

现在谈论这个还为时过早，因为他已经承诺会留任直到整合完成，至少到2026年底，甚至2027年初。他认为，提供一些候选人是首席运营官工作的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's it's really premature because right now, I mean, I made a commitment and the board wants me to to stay till the integration is over, so very minimum the end of 2026, and then early part of 2027, and I think that you know, it's it's part of of of my job, the COO job to be to to offer a numbers of candidates, right?</p>
</details>

在当今时代，要找到两三个以上可靠的候选人并不容易。主持人问为什么不容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one has to be realistic nowadays to to have more than two or three credible candidates is not easy, how do you well, why is it not easy?</p>
</details>

埃尔莫蒂先生解释说，无论银行有多少员工，当职位越高，虽然有很多非常有才华和专业的人，但要找到能够对业务有更广泛和完整理解的人并不容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, because I mean, you got how many how many thousand people have you got in the bank now, no, but that's exactly the point is is because no matter I mean, as you as as you go up, uh I'm sure you appreciate that you have maybe a lot of very talented people, a lot of specialized people, so it's not easy to find the people that can then take a broader and more complete um understanding of the business.</p>
</details>

这不仅仅是技术问题，还包括领导力、情感领导力、知识、应对压力的能力以及决策能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and you know, it's not just a technical issues, also there is the uh the leadership, uh the emotional leadership, uh the knowledge, uh the ability to leave with stress, uh the ability to make decisions.</p>
</details>

因此，当你在组织中向下看时，会有很多非常有才华和优秀的专业人士，但要将他们都培养成能够领导更复杂业务的全面领导者并不总是那么容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you narrow down that you know, when you go down in the organization, you can have extremely you know, talented people and and and and and great professionals, but it's not always easy to then translate all of them into uh broad leaders for a more complex business.</p>
</details>

他如何培养他们？对他来说，最重要的一点是他从美林证券17年的经验中吸取教训，即迫使自己作为管理者，也迫使每个人思考一个人在组织中还能做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do you how do you develop them? For me, the most important issue, which I took from my days at Mar Lynch 17 years, uh is is to really force myself as a uh as a the manager and and and force also every each of us to number one think about what else can a person do in the organization.</p>
</details>

他的团队中一个很好的例子是，执行董事会的大多数成员都可以在执行团队中担任其他职务，这种**可互换性**（fungibility: 指在组织中，员工能够胜任多个不同职位或任务的能力）非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the things which I think is is good in my team that a big number of the team members of the executive board could do another job in the executive team, so fungibility is very important.</p>
</details>

他们必须推动组织中各个层级的人员流动，去尝试其他经验，因为这至少能拓宽他们的视野，激励跨部门协作，并最终培养出更优秀、更全面的管理者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So be successful in your business, but how much and and what we can do, we have to do, we have to push people at in any level on the organization to move around to do other experiences because I think at the very least, they broaden up their Horizons at the very least, you incentivivate cross collaborations in the organization, but eventually as time goes by, you develop better managers, better more rounded managers.</p>
</details>

主持人问，培养一个优秀的领导者需要多长时间。埃尔莫蒂先生回答说，20年。这与**摩根大通**（JPMorgan Chase）首席执行官詹姆斯·戈尔曼（James Gorman）的数字相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How long time is how long time does it take to develop a good leader, defining good leader for what t ask to take over UBS 20 years, that's exactly the the same number as James Gman uh said, yeah, okay, but it's very simple, it's justes no, but it's just you take 20, you start, let's say meid 20, you start, and you say, okay, you know, when you get into a level of matureness, and then is mid 40s, early 50s, so it takes around that age.</p>
</details>

他解释说，如果一个人在20多岁中期开始，到40多岁中期或50岁出头时达到成熟水平，大约需要这个时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's very simple, it's just you take 20, you start, let's say meid 20, you start, and you say, okay, you know, when you get into a level of matureness, and then is mid 40s, early 50s, so it takes around that age.</p>
</details>

主持人问，公司是否真的那么早就开始培养。埃尔莫蒂先生回忆说，美林证券曾经一度过度频繁地调动员工。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do do companies actually start that early? I mean, how many companies do that? The you we went we went well, I I remember M they were almost at a point in time doing even too much of moving people around.</p>
</details>

他认为，在组织中较低层级的管理者往往非常保护他们最优秀的员工，不愿看到他们调到组织的其他部门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you can argue that there is a value in in in in stability, uh in many cases, I found that it's more difficult for in in when you go down in the organizations, uh managers at lower levels are very protective of their best people, so are not so Keen to see them going somewhere else in in the organization.</p>
</details>

他试图做的是，让管理者和员工都说出他们想在舒适区之外做的两份工作，以避免员工觉得对老板不忠诚。他还强迫管理者说出他们认为这个人应该做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what I try to do not as successfully as I want yet, but I still we are making some good inroad is to force both the manager and the employee to mention two jobs they would want to do outside their comfort zone, so in order to uh to avoid uh the feeling that as an as as an employee or subordinate, you are not loyal to your boss when you say that you would like to do something else, I force the manager also to say what do you think that person should do, right?</p>
</details>

他们尝试将其纳入人力资源系统，并越来越多地利用人工智能筛选简历和开放职位。当有才华的员工表示想做其他事情时，他们会强制性地采取非常规的观点来任命新职位，从银行的其他部门调动人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how of you doing that, well, we try to put it into our HR System, and then now you know, also using more more and more the CVS, uh the artificial intelligence screening when we look at CVS, and we look at uh uh open positions, so we try to leverage that one also in a way that when we have a talented person that says they would like to do something else, when we say, okay, it's time to force in some cases, I force myself, I force people to take unconventional views on on new appointments, taking talents from other part of the bank.</p>
</details>

他表示，在他最初的十年里，他曾多次这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so I did it few times in in in in my first 10 years.</p>
</details>

什么造就了一位高效的领导者？埃尔莫蒂先生认为，最终，高效的领导者是那些以身作则，不滥用权力的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What makes you in effective leader? I would say at the end of the day, the effective leader is the one that's leads by examples and doesn't abuse The Authority versus the uh so you can get away with uh managing without Authority.</p>
</details>

他不会要求员工做他自己不做的事情，并且他会非常选择性地使用权力。他会确保人们在需要他发号施令之前就已经心领神会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean, I'm not asking people to do things that they don't see me doing, and number two, I'm using very selectively Authority, so I try to to make sure that people smells the coffee before um before I have to say that I want something, right?</p>
</details>

通过这样做，通常会获得更多的动力和结果。主持人问他何时选择使用权力，何时不使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So and by doing that, usually you get more tractions and results, and tell me a bit more about how you when you choose to use your Authority, and when you don't, what is what other the situations?</p>

<p class="english-text">So what's been the most challenging leadership decision you made after you came back, decision, yeah, well, it's a little bit of a delicate question to be honest, uh but it's always around people, yeah.</p>
</details>

最微妙和最复杂的决定总是与人有关。他学到的一点是，最终他职业生涯中最大的遗憾，并非总是负面的，也有正面的，是未能更早地让合适的人加入团队，或者让某些人在岗位上待得比应有的时间更长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most delicate and most complex are always around people, people the one you is you know, the one thing I I I learned is that uh eventually it's always in my career the regret is not having taken not necessarily just always negative, also positive, not having on board the the right person earlier than I uh than I could or should have or or or letting certain people in the job longer than I should have.</p>
