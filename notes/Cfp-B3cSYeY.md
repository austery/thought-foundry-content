### 节目介绍与节日送礼的挑战

大家好，我是克里斯汀·泽雷特。我是凯拉·布莱克韦尔。我是罗茜·加林。欢迎收听《连线》节目。嘿，各位，我是罗茜。今天我们要重播一期我们最近非常喜欢的节目。这是我们《连线》同事们分享他们今年尝试、测试、报道并喜爱过的物品的汇总。这是一期特别的节目，每次听到我们朋友和同事的声音，我都会感到无比温暖。希望你们喜欢，也祝你们节日快乐。

 I'm
 Kyra

 I'm
 Rosie
 Garin.
 And
 you're


listening
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


Hey
 guys,
 it's
 Rosie.
 Today
 we're


reairing
 a
 favorite
 recent
 episode
 of


ours.
 It's
 a
 roundup
 of
 our
 colleagues


at
 Wire
 Cutter
 talking
 about
 items
 they


tried,
 tested,
 reported
 on,
 and
 loved


this
 year.
 It's
 a
 really
 special
 one,


and
 I
 always
 get
 the
 warm
 and
 fuzzies


hearing
 from
 all
 our
 friends
 and


colleagues.
 I
 hope
 you
 enjoy,
 and
 I
 hope


you
 have
 happy
 happy
 holidays.

### 送礼压力与高期望

“你好，朋友们。你好。”“你在为我的节日礼物忙活吗？”“什么？”“你那方面进展如何？你的具体情况。”“我的意思是，我们先从我开始，然后我们可以……”“是时候了，我们正在谈论送礼。”“我觉得我爱也恨这个话题。我喜欢一年中的这个时候。我感到巨大的压力，要为孩子们、朋友们、配偶准备好所有的礼物。是的，这真的很多。而且当你是一名《连线》的员工时，这会格外困难，因为人们真的期望你每次都能选对礼物。”“标准很高。”“标准确实非常高。我坚信，每年挑选一份好礼物、体贴又用心的礼物都变得越来越难，因为我觉得即使你在一年中受到启发并记录下来，到了年底，总会有那么四五个人让你觉得，‘糟了，他们怎么办？’” “是的。”“是的。”

>> Hello,
 friends.
 Hello.


>> Are
 you
 working
 on
 my
 holiday
 gifts?


>> What


>> Where
 are
 you
 at
 with
 that?
 your


specific.


>> I
 mean,
 we'll
 start
 with
 me
 and
 then
 we


can


>> it's
 getting
 to
 be
 that
 time
 and
 we're


talking
 about
 gifting.


>> I
 think
 I
 love
 and
 hate
 this
 topic.
 I


love
 this
 time
 of
 year.
 I
 feel
 so
 much


pressure
 to
 get
 all
 the
 all
 the
 kid


gifts,
 all
 the
 friend
 gifts,
 all
 the


spousal
 gifts.
 Yeah,
 it's
 a
 lot.
 It
 is


extra
 hard
 too
 when
 you're
 a
 wire
 cutter


employee
 because
 people
 really
 do
 expect


you
 to
 get
 it
 right
 every
 single
 time.


>> The
 bar
 is
 high.


>> The
 bar
 is
 very
 high.
 I'm
 convinced
 that


giving
 gifts,
 like
 good,
 thoughtful,
 and


meaningful
 gifts,
 does
 get
 harder
 every


year
 because
 I
 think
 even
 if
 you're


inspired
 throughout
 the
 year
 and
 jot


things
 down,
 by
 the
 end,
 there
 are


always
 like
 four
 or
 five
 people,
 you're


like,
 "Shoot,
 what
 about
 them?"


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.

### 现代消费习惯下的送礼难题

“而且也很难，因为大家似乎都喜欢在想要的时候就买下自己想要的东西。你可以在两天内收到送货上门的服务，有时甚至在几个小时内就能收到。所以，很难买到人们还没有自己买过的东西。”“这倒是真的。为了让今年的送礼稍微容易一些，也希望能更有趣，我们首先要听听《连线》全体员工分享他们今年发现并真正喜爱的物品。这些是我们他们在过去12个月的报道中偶然发现的物品，或者是他们自己测试过并喜欢的，放在购物车的，或是准备送给亲人的愿望清单上的物品。我非常期待听到这些人的推荐，因为过去我从我们员工那里得到的推荐，总是非常独特。它们非常有趣，而且经过了充分的测试。”

>> And
 it's
 also
 hard
 because
 everybody


kind
 of
 already
 buys
 exactly
 what
 they


want
 when
 they
 want
 it.
 You
 can
 get
 it


delivered
 to
 your
 door
 within
 2
 days,


sometimes
 within
 a
 few
 hours
 even.
 So,


it's
 hard
 to
 get
 people
 something
 that


they
 haven't
 already
 gotten
 themselves.


>> That's
 true.
 To
 help
 make
 gift
 giving
 a


little
 easier
 this
 year
 and
 hopefully
 a


little
 bit
 more
 fun,
 we're
 kicking
 it


off
 with
 wall-to-wall
 dispatches
 from


the
 wire
 cutter
 staff
 about
 the
 items


they
 discovered
 this
 year
 that
 they


truly
 loved.
 These
 are
 things
 they
 came


across
 throughout
 their
 reporting
 over


the
 last
 12
 months
 or
 things
 they
 tested


themselves
 and
 loved,
 items
 in
 their


shopping
 carts
 or
 on
 wish
 lists
 to
 give


to
 their
 loved
 ones.
 I
 am
 super
 pumped


to
 hear
 what
 these
 folks
 are
 going
 to


recommend
 because
 in
 the
 past
 when
 I've


gotten
 recommendations
 from
 our
 staff,


they
 are
 always
 really
 unique.
 They're


very
 interesting
 and
 they're
 also
 really


well
 tested.

### 节日礼物推荐：烛光晚餐与舒适盖毯

“好了，我们开始吧。休息后，我们将听到《连线》员工关于他们在2025年喜爱的物品的分享。马上回来。”欢迎回来。今天我们分享的是今年登上《连线》员工榜单前列的物品。别担心，我们会在节目笔记中提供所有提及物品的链接。好了，我们开始吧。我们来听听。你好，我是安·玛丽·基。我是《连线》的一名副主编，我想告诉你们，我非常喜欢**Yummy Taper 蜡烛**。它是我们**锥形蜡烛指南**中的首选。我其实不太喜欢蜡烛。我不喜欢家里有火和蜡烛的想法。但我的11岁女儿是喜欢蜡烛的人。她喜欢生日蜡烛，喜欢烧完蜡烛的味道，喜欢餐桌上摆放蜡烛的氛围。所以我买了我们推荐的这款，因为它们相对便宜。它们燃烧效果好，燃烧干净。我们几乎每顿饭都一起用它们。这是一种很棒的方式，可以提升日常生活的品质。所以，你完全可以伴着烛光吃麦圈麦片。坦白说，你应该这样做。

我叫杰基·里夫，是家居装饰团队的资深撰稿人，负责报道床上用品。我今年买的最好的东西，其实是一床我测试并推荐了好几年的被子。如果你们想追求奢华，那就是**company stores company cotton vo quilt**（公司商店的棉质绗缝被），有些人会念成“voy quilt”。我的测试架上有很多毯子，但如果我特别喜欢某样东西，我就会买下来，这样我就可以永远拥有它。这床被子就是这样。在过去几年的测试中，我总是忍不住去拿它。我看到一个喜欢的颜色在打折，价格很划算。于是，我买了一床单人尺寸的，用来当盖毯。今年这床被子尤其变得很特别，因为我做了手术。回家后，它成了我恢复期间最喜欢的舒适毯子。你知道，我的其他毯子，有些太重了，或者太贴身，或者质地或温度不合适，而这床被子却很完美。它很轻便，超级容易清洗，那床单人尺寸的。我洗了很多次，甚至用很热的水，它都表现得很好，让我感觉身体好多了，但我也说不清，也许在精神上、灵魂上、情感上也是如此。绗缝被总能让我感到被好好照顾，感觉一切都会好起来。今年我真的很需要这种感觉，这床被子做到了。

>> Hello,
 I'm
 Ann
 Marie
 Ki.
 I'm
 a
 deputy


editor
 at
 Wire
 Cutter
 and
 I'm
 here
 to


tell
 you
 that
 I
 love
 the
 Yummy
 Taper


candles.
 It's
 a
 top
 pick
 in
 our
 guide
 to


taper
 candles.
 And
 I
 am
 not
 really
 a


candle
 person.
 I
 don't
 love
 the
 idea
 of


fire
 and
 wax
 inside
 my
 house.
 But
 my


11-year-old
 is
 a
 fire
 person.
 She
 loves


candles.
 She
 loves
 birthday
 candles.
 She


loves
 the
 smell
 of
 blown
 out
 candles.


She
 loves
 the
 atmosphere
 of
 candles
 on
 a


table.
 And
 so
 I
 bought
 our
 pick
 because


they're
 relatively
 inexpensive.
 They


burn
 well.
 They
 burn
 cleanly.
 And
 we


have
 been
 using
 them
 for
 almost
 every


meal
 that
 we
 eat
 together.
 And
 it's


lovely.
 It's
 a
 lovely
 way
 to
 upgrade
 the


everyday.
 And
 so
 you
 can
 totally
 eat


Cheerios
 by
 Candlelight.
 And
 frankly,


you
 should.
 My
 name
 is
 Jackie
 Reev
 and


I'm
 a
 senior
 staff
 writer
 covering


bedding
 for
 the
 home
 decor
 team.
 The


best
 thing
 I
 bought
 this
 year
 was


actually
 a
 quilt
 that
 I've
 tested
 and


recommended
 for
 a
 few
 years.
 The
 company


stores
 company
 cotton
 vo
 quilt
 if
 you're


feeling
 fancy
 in
 French
 or
 voy
 quilt


some
 people
 say.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


blankets
 on
 my
 test
 shelves,
 but
 if
 I


particularly
 love
 something
 in
 testing,


I
 will
 buy
 it.
 so
 I
 can
 keep
 it
 forever.


And
 that's
 what
 happened
 with
 this


quilt.
 I
 just
 kept
 gravitating
 towards


it
 during
 testing
 over
 the
 last
 few


years.
 And
 I
 saw
 a
 color
 I
 liked
 on


clearance
 at
 a
 great
 price.
 So,
 I
 bought


a
 twin
 size
 to
 use
 as
 a
 throw.
 And
 this


one
 became
 particularly
 wonderful
 this


year
 because
 I
 had
 to
 have
 surgery.
 And


when
 I
 got
 home,
 it
 was
 my
 go-to
 comfort


blanket
 for
 recovery.
 You
 know,
 my
 other


blankets,
 some
 of
 them
 were
 too
 heavy
 or


too
 clingy
 or
 not
 the
 right
 texture
 or


temperature,
 and
 it
 was
 perfect.
 It
 was


lightweight,
 super
 easy
 to
 wash
 that


twin
 size.
 I
 washed
 it
 many
 times,
 even


really
 hot,
 and
 it
 did
 the
 job
 and
 made


me
 feel
 so
 much
 better
 physically,
 but
 I


don't
 know,
 maybe
 also
 mentally,


spiritually,
 emotionally.
 There
 is


something
 about
 a
 quilt
 that
 just
 makes


me
 feel
 well
 taken
 care
 of,
 like
 it's


all
 going
 to
 be
 okay.
 And
 I
 really


needed
 that
 this
 year
 and
 this
 quilt


came
 through.

### 游戏爱好者的宝石骰子与儿童手表

你好，我是詹姆斯。我是负责《连线》游戏和爱好板块的撰稿人。今年我刚好结婚了，这当然是一段美好的时光。但当我为我的伴郎们寻找礼物时，我最终从一个叫**Norse Foundry**的地方淘到了一套非常特别的宝石骰子，不过你可以在很多地方买到。本质上，它们就是普通的骰子，从D20到D4，都是由宝石制成的。比如，我为我的伴郎们买了青金石、血石、蓝纹石、孔雀石、玉石，等等。首先，它们非常漂亮，其次，当你掷骰子时，它们拿在手里感觉很好，而且会发出一种相当令人满意的咔哒声。不过，你不应该把它们互相碰撞太多，因为它们是宝石，会碎。但总之，这很棒。这是我今年送出的最喜欢的礼物。嗯，是的。

嗨，我是艾米·克拉维茨，是《连线》婴儿和儿童团队的一名编辑。我给我5岁的女儿买了一块**Swatch Flick Flack 手表**，她一整年都很喜欢戴着它。我们在给七岁孩子的礼物指南中推荐了它。它是一块简单的模拟手表，没有什么智能之处，除了它能帮助教我女儿看时间。她不是每天都戴，它更像是一种配饰，她会在特殊场合或者有人来访时要求戴上，想稍微炫耀一下。我觉得它是一个不错的配饰，价格不算太贵，但又足够特别，让她知道要小心对待。这块手表和我小时候戴的**Swatch**很像，我也很喜欢这种怀旧感，即使那部分只有我一个人享受。谢谢。

Hello,
 I'm
 James.
 I'm
 the
 staff
 writer


covering
 games
 and
 hobbies
 for
 Wire


Cutter.
 So,
 this
 year
 I
 happened
 to
 get


married,
 which
 was
 a
 great
 time


obviously,
 but
 when
 I
 was
 looking
 for


gifts
 for
 my
 groomsmen,
 I
 ended
 up


getting
 very
 special
 gemstone
 dice
 from


a
 place
 called
 Norse
 Foundry,
 but
 you


can
 get
 them
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places.


Essentially,
 they're
 normal
 array
 of


dice,
 so
 D20
 through
 D4
 that
 are
 made
 of


precious
 stones.
 Like
 for
 my
 groomsman,


I
 got
 lapis
 lazuli,
 blood
 stone,
 blue


vein
 stone,
 malikite,
 jade,
 all
 sorts
 of


stuff.
 They're
 gorgeous,
 number
 one,
 and


number
 two,
 they
 feel
 good
 in
 your
 hand


when
 you're
 rolling
 them,
 and
 they
 make


a
 fairly
 satisfying
 clacking
 noise.


Although,
 you
 shouldn't
 pluck
 them


together
 too
 much
 because
 they
 are


precious
 stones
 and
 they
 will
 break.
 But


it
 was
 lovely.
 They
 all
 appreciated
 it.


It's
 my
 favorite
 gift
 I've
 given
 this


year.
 And
 yeah.


>> Hi,
 my
 name
 is
 Amy
 Kravitz,
 and
 I'm
 an


editor
 on
 the
 baby
 and
 kid
 team
 at
 Wire


Cutter.
 I
 bought
 our
 5-year-old
 a
 Swatch


Flick
 Flack
 watch
 and
 she's
 loved


wearing
 it
 throughout
 the
 year.
 We


recommend
 it
 in
 our
 gift
 guide
 to


seven-year-olds.
 It's
 a
 simple
 analog


watch.
 Nothing
 smart
 about
 it
 except
 for


the
 fact
 that
 it's
 helping
 to
 teach
 my


daughter
 how
 to
 tell
 time.
 She
 doesn't


wear
 it
 everyday.
 It's
 an
 accessory
 she


asked
 to
 wear
 for
 a
 special
 event
 or
 if


someone
 is
 visiting
 and
 she
 wants
 to


show
 off
 a
 bit.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 nice


accessory
 that's
 not
 too
 expensive,
 but


just
 special
 enough
 that
 she
 knows
 to


treat
 it
 with
 care.
 The
 watch
 is
 very


similar
 to
 the
 Swatch
 I
 had
 as
 a
 kid,


and
 I
 also
 love
 the
 nostalgia
 factor,


even
 if
 that
 part's
 just
 for
 me.
 Thanks.

### 户外徒步与复古收音机的实用性

我是特雷·弗伦奇，一名负责户外装备的撰稿人。我喜欢这款**Sawyer Squeeze 滤水器**。我的生活几乎围绕着徒步展开，我每周都会去几次。我喜欢带上这款滤水器，因为它小巧轻便，非常方便，可以随手塞进背包，以防我没水了，需要在路上从天然水源过滤水，或者只是为了少带点水，因为水本身就很重。

嗨，我是布伦特·巴特沃斯，是《连线》音频产品部门的撰稿人。我一直通过智能音箱收听网络广播，但它们会通过TuneIn和iHeart Radio等服务，这些服务会插入很多重复的广告，即使是公共广播电台也是如此。所以，我买了一台**Sanjen WR15**，这是我们**桌面收音机**中的首选。它的声音非常棒。前面有一个老式的手动调谐旋钮，可以让我像给智能音箱下达语音指令一样快速地切换本地电台。我把收音机放在书桌椅的臂长范围内，这样在我工作时它总是在我身边。当然，有时我仍然想听网络广播，我可以通过手机收听。WR15没有蓝牙，但它后面有一个辅助输入接口。所以我连接了一个蓝牙接收器，这样我就可以通过WR15播放手机里的声音了。这是复古与现代科技的完美结合，对于日常音频收听系统来说，它简直太棒了。

I'm
 Trey
 French
 and
 I'm
 a
 staff
 writer


covering
 outdoor
 gear.
 I
 like
 this


Sawyer
 Squeeze
 water
 filter.
 I've
 kind


of
 designed
 my
 life
 around
 hiking.
 I
 do


it
 several
 days
 a
 week
 and
 I
 like
 to


bring
 this
 water
 filter
 because
 it's


small
 and
 lightweight
 and
 it's
 really
 a


no-brainer
 just
 to
 throw
 in
 my
 pack
 in


case
 I
 run
 out
 of
 water
 and
 need
 to


filter
 water
 from
 natural
 sources
 along


the
 way
 or
 just
 so
 that
 I
 can
 bring
 less


water,
 which
 is
 pretty
 heavy
 to
 begin


with.


Hi,
 I'm
 Brent
 Butterworth,
 staff
 writer


covering
 audio
 products
 for
 Wire
 Cutter.


I've
 been
 getting
 all
 my
 radio
 off
 the


internet
 using
 smart
 speakers,
 but
 they


go
 through
 services
 like
 TuneIn
 and


iHeart
 Radio,
 which
 insert
 a
 lot
 of


repetitive
 advertising,
 even
 on
 public


radio
 stations.
 So,
 I
 bought
 a
 Sanjen


WR15,
 which
 is
 our
 top
 pick
 in
 tabletop


radios.
 It
 sounds
 really
 great.
 And


there's
 an
 old
 school
 manual
 tuning
 knob


on
 the
 front
 that
 lets
 me
 flick
 between


my
 local
 stations
 as
 fast
 as
 I
 could


probably
 give
 a
 voice
 command
 to
 a
 smart


speaker.
 I
 keep
 the
 radio
 within
 arms


length
 of
 my
 desk
 chair,
 so
 it's
 always


with
 me
 all
 through
 my
 workday.
 Now,


there
 are
 times
 when
 I
 still
 want
 to


listen
 to
 internet
 radio,
 and
 I
 can
 get


that
 off
 my
 phone.
 The
 WR15
 doesn't
 have


Bluetooth,
 but
 it
 does
 have
 an
 auxiliary


input
 on
 the
 back.
 So,
 I
 connected
 a


Bluetooth
 receiver
 that
 lets
 me
 play
 the


sound
 from
 my
 phone
 through
 the
 WR15.


It's
 a
 perfect
 blend
 of
 vintage
 and


modern
 tech,
 and
 for
 a
 day-to-day
 audio


listening
 system,
 it's
 just
 fantastic.

### 精致衬衫与智能家居助手

嗨，我是詹妮弗·亨特，《连线》资深时尚编辑。我今年最喜欢的时尚发现是**TWWP Next Morning 衬衫**。我是一位衬衫鉴赏家，几乎每天都穿一件，而且我对它们非常挑剔。这件衬衫的所有细节都处理得恰到好处。袖子上巧妙的纽扣设计，当你卷起袖子并固定好时，可以将其扣住，整天都不会松开，不像我穿过的其他衬衫。它还有非常漂亮的剪裁，前面较短，而且非常宽松。面料也很棒，是那种非常漂亮的、光滑、挺括的棉质。它感觉非常昂贵，而且物有所值。这件衬衫确实是一笔‘奢侈’。价格接近400美元，我知道这很让人心疼，但如果你是为像我这样喜欢买一件昂贵又漂亮的物品然后穿很久的人准备的，这绝对是一个绝佳的选择。祝大家购物愉快。

嘿，我是约翰·蔡斯，《连线》的智能家居编辑。我推荐的礼物，适合10到15岁的孩子，而且当我说是**Amazon Echo Dot**时，请不要生气。我曾犹豫是否要在儿子的卧室里放一个，但它比让他拥有一个设备来听音乐或收听广播要好。它给了他一点自主权，让他能够体验他想听的音乐并探索音乐。它也让我可以设置闹钟，发挥一点创意。有时我可以用它作为内部通话系统。所以，是的，这是我反复思考后送给他的礼物，他很喜欢，对我们来说也很棒。

>> Hi,
 I'm
 Jennifer
 Hunter,
 Wire
 Cutter,


senior
 style
 editor.
 One
 of
 my
 absolute


favorite
 style
 finds
 this
 year
 was
 the


TWWP
 Next
 Morning
 shirt.
 I
 am
 a


button-up
 shirt
 connoisseur.
 I
 wear
 one


almost
 every
 single
 day
 and
 I'm


extremely
 picky
 about
 them.
 And
 this


shirt
 does
 all
 the
 details
 right.
 There


are
 these
 ingenious
 buttons
 down
 the


sleeve
 so
 when
 you
 roll
 and
 cuff
 your


sleeve
 just
 right,
 you
 can
 button
 it
 in


place
 and
 it
 doesn't
 come
 undone


throughout
 the
 day
 like
 other
 shirts
 I


wear.
 It
 also
 has
 this
 really
 nice
 cut.


It's
 shorter
 in
 front
 and
 it's
 perfectly


slouchy.
 And
 the
 fabric
 is
 gorgeous,


too.
 It's
 this
 really
 lovely
 smooth,


crisp
 cotton.
 It
 just
 feels
 so
 expensive


and
 it
 better.
 This
 shirt
 is
 a
 splurge.


It's
 almost
 400
 bucks
 and
 I
 know
 that's


painful,
 but
 if
 you're
 buying
 for


somebody
 like
 me
 who
 likes
 to
 get
 one


beautiful
 splurgy
 thing
 and
 then
 wear
 it


forever,
 this
 is
 a
 great
 contender.


Happy
 hunting
 everybody.
 Hey,
 this
 is


John
 Chase.
 I
 am
 the
 smart
 home
 editor


at
 Wire

 A
 gift
 I
 would
 recommend


for
 kids
 around
 10,
 15
 years
 old.
 And


don't
 get
 upset
 when
 I
 say
 this
 is
 an


Amazon
 Echo
 Dot.
 I
 was
 reluctant
 to
 put


one
 in
 my
 son's
 bedroom,
 but
 it
 was


better
 than
 him
 having
 a
 device
 for
 when


he
 wants
 to
 listen
 to
 music,
 if
 he
 wants


to
 listen
 to
 the
 radio.
 It
 gives
 him
 a


little
 autonomy
 and
 allows
 him
 to


experience
 music
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 hear


and
 to
 explore
 music.
 And
 it
 also
 lets


me
 set
 alarm
 clock
 alarms,
 be
 a
 little


creative.
 Sometimes
 I
 can
 use
 it
 to
 drop


in
 like
 an
 intercom
 system.
 So
 yeah,
 it


was
 it
 was
 something
 I
 I
 thought
 a
 lot


about
 and
 gave
 it
 to
 him
 and
 he's
 loved


it
 and
 it's
 been
 great
 for

### 智能喂鸟器与厨房刮刀的惊喜

嗨，我是瑞秋·萨拉科拉，《连线》资深撰稿人。我今年期待送出的礼物是**Bird Buddy**，它结合了喂鸟器、摄像头和智能手机应用程序。多年来我填满了许多喂鸟器，但我总是错过鸟儿活动的精彩瞬间，结果只剩下满地鸟食孔和一堆鸟粪。**Bird Buddy**会在鸟儿前来觅食时提醒你的手机，并捕捉到色彩鲜艳、细节丰富的视频和图像。该应用程序还会提供关于访客类型的信息以及关于该物种的趣闻。它甚至有一个观鸟社区，你可以分享你的发现，或者看看世界各地其他喂鸟器的画面。这就像拥有你自己的私人自然频道。只需确保购买带太阳能电池板的版本，这样你就永远不必担心给摄像头充电了。这真的是一份送给所有年龄段的观鸟爱好者，或者任何正在寻找新爱好的人的绝佳礼物。

嗨，我是凯瑟琳·卡斯特，《连线》的资深编辑。今年我买的、让我感到最快乐的东西是这个15美元的**Oxo 刮刀**。它是由我的同事、厨房撰稿人麦琪·雅azawa推荐的，她自从上烹饪学校近十年以来一直在使用它，并且曾在餐厅厨房工作过。它是那种你直到尝试之前都不知道自己需要的东西。它能完美地将切好的蔬菜从砧板上刮入锅中，而不会弄得一团糟或丢失任何小块红椒。它还奇怪地帮助我刮掉餐桌时间弄脏的台面上的婴儿食物，那里的地方总是很脏。它很棒的一点是价格不到20美元，这意味着你也可以买一堆送人，这正是我计划做的。我要送一个给我公公，他会在节日期间负责所有的烹饪。我想他会很喜欢。

>> Hi,
 this
 is
 Rachel
 Sarakola,
 senior


writer
 with
 Wire
 Cutter.
 The
 gift
 I'm


looking
 forward
 to
 giving
 this
 year
 is


the
 bird
 buddy,
 which
 combines
 a
 bird


feeder,
 a
 video
 camera,
 and
 a
 smartphone


app.
 I've
 filled
 a
 lot
 of
 bird
 feeders


over
 the
 years,
 but
 I
 always
 seem
 to


miss
 all
 the
 bird
 action,
 which
 just


leaves
 me
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 seed
 holes,


and
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 bird
 poop.
 The
 Bird


Buddy
 will
 alert
 your
 phone
 when
 birds


come
 to
 feast
 and
 capture
 it
 videos
 and


images
 that
 are
 bursting
 with
 color
 and


detail.
 The
 app
 also
 provides


information
 about
 the
 type
 of
 visitor


and
 trivia
 bits
 about
 the
 species.
 It


even
 has
 a
 whole
 community
 of
 birders
 so


you
 can
 share
 visits
 or
 get
 a
 peek
 at


other
 feeders
 all
 around
 the
 world.
 It's


like
 having
 your
 own
 private
 nature


channel.
 Just
 make
 sure
 to
 get
 the
 one


with
 the
 solar
 panel
 so
 you
 never
 have


to
 worry
 about
 charging
 the
 camera.
 It


really
 is
 a
 great
 gift
 for
 bird
 watchers


of
 all
 ages
 and
 anyone
 just
 looking
 for


a
 fun
 new
 hobby.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Katherine
 Cast,


a
 senior
 editor
 at
 Wire
 Cutter.
 And
 the


thing
 I've
 bought
 this
 year
 that
 has


sparked
 the
 most
 joy
 for
 me
 is
 this
 $15


Oxo
 bench
 scraper.
 It
 was
 recommended
 by


my
 colleague,
 kitchen
 writer
 Mackie


Yazawa,
 who
 has
 used
 it
 since
 going
 to


culinary
 school
 almost
 a
 decade
 ago
 and


has
 cooked
 in
 restaurant
 kitchens.
 It's


one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 you
 don't


really
 know
 that
 you
 need
 until
 you
 try


it.
 It's
 awesome
 at
 getting
 every
 single


chopped
 veggie
 from
 your
 cutting
 board


into
 your
 pot
 without
 making
 a
 mess
 or


losing
 any
 little
 pieces
 of
 red
 pepper.


It's
 also,
 weirdly,
 helped
 me
 scrape
 up


baby
 food
 off
 of
 my
 countertop
 at
 meal


times,
 which
 gets
 super
 messy.
 The
 great


thing
 about
 it
 is
 that
 it's
 under
 $20,


so
 it
 means
 that
 you
 can
 also
 buy
 just
 a


bunch
 of
 them
 for
 gifts,
 which
 is
 what


I'm
 planning
 on
 doing.
 I'm
 going
 to
 give


one
 to
 my
 father-in-law,
 who
 does
 all


the
 cooking
 over
 the
 holidays.
 I
 think


he's
 going
 to
 love
 it.

### 空气炸锅烤箱与创意染发棒

“我们要休息一下，回来后，将有更多来自《连线》同事的送礼推荐。马上回来。”欢迎回来。让我们直接进入更多来自《连线》同事的推荐。请听。嗨，我叫汤姆·邓恩，是《连线》的一名资深撰稿人，住在波士顿。我今年买的最好的东西绝对是**Kosori 空气炸锅烤箱**。我们的旧烤箱用了大概15年了，而且可能已经危险地出了故障一段时间了，然后我们的主烤箱坏了。长话短说，更换它需要花费数千美元。那时，我们意识到我们不如干脆更新整个厨房。但这不是一天就能完成的事情。所以，在此期间，我们买了**Kosori 空气炸锅**，同时也在规划我们的方案。在接下来的6个月里，它成了我们家里的主要烹饪设备。它比我们旧烤箱能做的功能更多，而且坦白说，它们做得都好得多。它烹饪得更均匀，烤面包也更均匀，烘烤效果更好。简直太棒了。事实上，它非常有用和方便，以至于我们只是习惯了它，并一直推迟我们正式的翻新计划，因为它们似乎不再那么紧迫了。谢谢。

嗨，我是艾伦·李，是婴儿和儿童团队的资深撰稿人。今年我测试起来最有趣，现在也打算作为礼物送出的是**Oh My Hair Chalk**（我的头发粉笔）。我的女儿们有一头又长又浓密的黑发，这个东西在上面效果很明显。它带有夹子，所以很容易使用，而且也非常容易洗掉。如果你受到K-pop恶魔猎人的启发，它能为你的头发增添很多色彩。

>> We're
 going to
 take
 a
 quick
 break
 and


when
 we
 come
 back,
 more
 gifting


recommendations
 from
 our
 colleagues

 Stay
 tuned.


Welcome
 back.
 Let's
 jump
 right
 back
 into


more
 recommendations
 from
 our
 colleagues


at
 Wire
 Cutter.
 Take
 a
 listen.


>> Hi,
 my
 name
 is
 Tom
 Dunn.
 I'm
 a
 senior


staff
 writer
 here
 at
 Wire
 Cutter
 and
 I


live
 in
 Boston.
 The
 best
 pick
 I
 bought


this
 year
 was
 easily
 the
 Kosori
 air


fryer
 toaster
 oven.
 We'd
 had
 our
 old


toaster
 oven
 for
 probably
 15
 years
 or


so,
 and
 it
 was
 probably
 dangerously
 on


the
 fritz
 for
 a
 while,
 and
 then
 our
 main


oven
 died.
 And
 long
 story
 short,
 it
 was


going
 to
 cost
 us
 several
 thousand
 to


replace.
 At
 which
 point,
 we
 realized


that
 we
 may
 as
 well
 just
 update
 the


entire
 kitchen.
 But
 that's
 not
 the
 kind


of
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 overnight.
 So,
 in


the
 meantime,
 we
 bought
 the
 Kosori
 air


fryer
 while
 we
 figured
 out
 our
 plans.


And
 it
 became
 the
 primary
 cooking
 source


in
 our
 home
 for
 the
 next
 6
 months.
 It


did
 more
 things
 than
 our
 old
 oven
 ever


did.
 And
 frankly,
 it
 did
 them
 all
 a
 lot


better.
 It
 cooked
 more
 evenly.
 It
 It


toasted
 more
 evenly.
 It
 broiled
 better.


It's
 just
 amazing.
 In
 fact,
 it
 was
 so


helpful
 and
 convenient
 that
 we
 just
 kind


of
 got
 used
 to
 it
 and
 kept
 putting
 off


our
 proper
 renovation
 plans
 cuz
 they


just
 didn't
 seem
 so
 urgent.
 Thanks.

 my

 And
 the
 thing
 that
 was
 most
 fun


for
 me
 to
 test
 this
 year
 and
 which
 I
 now


plan
 to
 gift
 was
 the
 Oh
 My
 Hair
 Chalk.


My
 daughters
 have
 long,
 luscious
 black


hair,
 and
 this
 stuff
 shows
 up.
 It
 has


clamps,
 so
 it's
 easy
 to
 apply,
 but
 it's


also
 very
 easy
 to
 wash
 out.
 And
 if
 you


are

 by

it
 adds
 a
 lot
 of
 color

### 充气气垫的便利性与奢侈品唇膏的魅力

嘿，我是利亚姆。我为《连线》撰写家居装修方面的内容。今年我购买并测试过的最令人惊喜的实用物品是这个**充气气垫**，我在TikTok上看到的，它能非常轻松地将家具或电器抬高几英寸。我用它来把除尘器塞到冰箱下面。嗯，昨晚我用它来帮助把地毯卷到沙发腿下面。它大约18美元。这不是我每天或每周都会使用的东西，但仅仅拥有它，就会让我更有可能完成一些项目，而这些项目如果不是因为这个工具，可能会因为太麻烦或令人沮丧而让我选择回避。这个东西看起来有点像血压袖带。你只需要把这个扁平的、未充气的袋子滑到你需要抬起的东西下面。挤压一个气球，它就会逐渐充满空气，然后你沉重的东西就会悬浮在那里，让你做任何你需要做的事情。我把它放在一个抽屉里，不占地方。没有迹象表明它很快会磨损。当我需要它时，我很高兴我拥有它，而且它甚至有点好玩。

这是妮可拉。我是一名资深时尚撰稿人。我收到了一管**Prada 唇膏**。它售价50美元，对于一支唇膏来说是笔巨款，但它装在一个非常可爱的金属管里，上面有Logo。我个人喜欢它被我的钱包磨损的样子，管子上有一些小小的凹痕和划痕。这让我感觉它属于我，它见证了我们在一起的时间。这有点让它变得迷人，就像它有点超出它本身的功能。而这正是让它从包里拿出来，并与之共处如此有趣的原因。我期待着给我的唇膏补充。这次我想买有颜色的，因为我之前买的是无色的。另外，我觉得你可以在丝芙兰和诺德斯特龙之类的商店买到，但我建议你从**Prada**官网购买，或者去**Prada**专卖店，因为那样你就能得到所有可爱的包装，它会立刻变得适合送礼。它看起来更特别。我的意思是，你花了50美元。要充分利用这50美元。

>> Hey,
 this
 is
 Liam.
 I
 write
 about
 home


improvement
 for

 The
 most


surprisingly
 useful
 thing
 I
 bought
 and


tested
 this
 year
 was
 this
 inflatable
 air


wedge
 that
 I'd
 seen
 on
 Tik
 Tok
 that


makes
 it
 really
 easy
 to
 prop
 up


furniture
 or
 appliances
 a
 few
 inches.


I've
 used
 it
 to
 get
 a
 duster
 underneath


my
 fridge.
 Uh,
 last
 night
 I
 used
 it
 to


help
 roll
 a
 rug
 out
 underneath
 the
 legs


of
 my
 couch.
 It
 was
 about
 18
 bucks.
 It's


not
 the
 kind
 of
 thing
 I
 use
 every
 day
 or


even
 every
 week,
 but
 just
 having
 the


thing
 makes
 me
 a
 little
 more
 likely
 to


follow
 through
 on
 certain
 projects
 that


would
 be
 uncomfortable
 or
 frustrating


enough
 that
 I'd
 probably
 try
 to
 avoid


them
 otherwise.
 The
 thing
 looks
 sort
 of


like
 a
 blood
 pressure
 cuff.
 You
 just


slide
 this
 flat
 deflated
 bag
 under


whatever
 you
 need
 to
 lift.
 Squeeze
 a


bulb
 and
 it
 gradually
 fills
 up
 with
 air


and
 then
 your
 heavy
 thing
 just
 floats


there
 while
 you
 do
 whatever
 you
 need
 to


do.
 I
 keep
 the
 thing
 in
 a
 drawer.


Doesn't
 take
 up
 much
 space.
 No


indication
 that
 it'll
 wear
 out
 anytime


soon.
 When
 I
 need
 it,
 I'm
 really
 happy


that
 I
 have
 it
 and
 it's
 even
 sort
 of
 fun


to
 use.


>> This
 is
 Nicola.
 I'm
 a
 senior
 style


writer.
 I
 was
 given
 a
 tube
 of
 Prada
 lip


balm.


It's
 $50,
 which
 is
 an
 insane
 amount
 of


money
 for
 lip
 balm,
 but
 it
 comes
 in
 this


really
 cute
 metal
 tube
 that
 has
 the


logo.
 I
 personally
 love
 the
 way
 that


mine
 looks
 kind
 of
 beat
 up
 from
 like


being
 in
 my
 purse
 and
 having
 little
 like


dings
 and
 nicks
 in
 it.
 Kind
 of
 just


makes
 me
 feel
 like
 it's
 mine.
 It
 shows


the
 time
 we've
 spent
 together.
 That's


kind
 of
 what
 makes
 it
 charming
 is
 like


it's
 a
 little
 bit
 extra
 for
 what
 it
 is.


And
 that
 is
 what
 makes
 it
 so
 fun
 to
 pull


out
 of
 your
 bag
 and
 live
 with.
 And
 I
 am


looking
 forward
 to
 refilling
 mine.
 I


think
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 a
 color
 this
 time


cuz
 I've
 had
 just
 the
 plain
 one.
 Also,
 I


think
 you
 can
 get
 this
 at
 like
 Sephora


and
 Nordstrom
 and
 stuff,
 but
 I
 say
 buy


it
 from
 the
 Prada
 website
 or
 go
 into
 the


Prada
 store
 because
 then
 you
 get
 all
 the


cute
 little
 packaging
 and
 it
 just
 makes


it
 it's
 instantly
 giftable.
 It
 just


looks
 more
 special.
 I
 mean,
 you're


spending
 $50.
 Get
 everything
 you
 can
 out


of
 that
 $50.

### 大蒜压榨器与刀具磨刀器

你看，我爱大蒜。说到给菜肴里加蒜，我相信你应该凭感觉来加，而不是用量勺。嗨，我是凯特琳·威尔斯，负责《连线》纽约办公室的家居办公和效率板块，我喜欢烹饪。在厨房里切大蒜一直是我的冥想练习。当我需要快速切很多大蒜时，我会转向我信赖的**OXO 压蒜器**。但去年，我患上了周围神经病变，这会导致肌肉无力、震颤等症状。这使得完成基本任务更加困难，包括开罐头和切碎或压碎大蒜。挤压**OXO**对我来说已经不再是选择了。所以我转向了**O2 Garlic 压蒜器**，它成了我今年最喜欢的购买品。这款灵感来自德古拉的厨房小工具，只需转动几下手腕就能磨碎大蒜、种子和香料。前后运动让人想起我切菜的日子，而且使用时我不会感到任何疼痛。如果你想为你的空间增添一点趣味，或者只是需要一个简单有效的工具，这绝对是一款值得入手的厨房小工具。

你好，我是梅尔·普劳特。《连线》的宠物撰稿人。今年我买的、在《连线》上找到的、不是宠物产品却极大地改变了我生活的物品，就藏在**折叠刀指南**的深处。它实际上不是一把折叠刀，而是一把**刀具磨刀器**。它叫做**Spyderco Triangle Sharpmaker**。它是一个很酷的小装置，有一个可以打开的塑料底座，取出磨刀石，将它们放在槽里，然后装上保护杆。我能够磨利我家里所有的刀具，这太不可思议了。所以，我不仅可以用一把非常非常锋利的刀打开我门口收到的所有包裹，我还能切番茄，就像它们没有皮一样。当你不再与厨房里的番茄刀搏斗时，一切都变得不同了。总之，就是这样。磨利你的刀。使用**Spyderco**。它非常棒。

Look,
 I
 love
 garlic.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


adding
 it
 to
 dishes,
 I
 believe
 you


measure
 that
 amount
 with
 your
 heart,
 not


a
 teaspoon.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Caitlyn
 Wells
 and
 I


cover
 the
 home
 office
 beat
 and


productivity
 for
 wire
 cutter
 in
 New
 York


City.
 And
 I
 love
 to
 cook.
 Chopping


garlic
 has
 always
 been
 my
 mini


meditation
 practice
 in
 the
 kitchen.
 And


when
 I
 need
 to
 chop
 a
 lot
 in
 a
 hurry,
 I


turn
 to
 my
 trusty
 OXO
 garlic
 press.
 But


last
 year,
 I
 developed
 peripheral


neuropathy,
 which
 causes
 muscle
 weakness


and
 tremors,
 among
 other
 things.
 It's


made
 completing
 basic
 tasks
 more


difficult,
 including
 opening
 jars
 and


chopping
 or
 crushing
 garlic.
 Squeezing


the
 oxo
 is
 no
 longer
 an
 option
 for
 me.


So,
 I
 turned
 to
 the
 O2
 Garlic
 garlic


crusher,
 which
 has
 become
 my
 favorite


purchase
 this
 year.
 The
 Dracula
 inspired


kitchen
 gadget
 grinds
 garlic,
 seeds,
 and


spices
 with
 a
 couple
 twists
 of
 the


wrists.
 The
 back
 and
 forth
 motion
 is


reminiscent
 of
 my
 chopping
 days,
 and
 I


don't
 feel
 any
 pain
 while
 using
 it.
 This


is
 definitely
 a
 kitchen
 gadget
 to
 grab


if
 you
 want
 to
 add
 a
 little
 whimsy
 to


your
 space
 or
 just
 need
 something
 simple


and
 effective
 to
 use.
 Hello,
 this
 is
 Mel


Plout.
 I
 am
 pets
 writer
 at
 Wire
 Cutter


this
 year.
 The
 thing
 that
 I
 bought
 that


I
 found
 on
 Wire
 Cutter
 that
 wasn't
 a
 pet


product
 and
 that
 made
 a
 huge
 difference


in
 my
 life
 is
 buried
 deep
 inside
 the


guide
 to
 pocket
 knives.
 And
 it's


actually
 not
 a
 pocket
 knife
 at
 all,
 but


it
 is
 a
 knife
 sharpener.
 And
 it's
 called


the
 Spyderco
 Triangle


Sharpmaker.
 And
 it's
 this
 really
 cool


thing
 where
 it's
 like
 this
 little


plastic
 base
 that
 you
 open
 up
 and
 you


take
 out
 these
 sharpening
 stones
 and
 you


set
 them
 in
 their
 grooves
 and
 there's
 a


little
 protective
 poles
 that
 you
 put
 on.


I
 have
 been
 able
 to
 sharpen
 every
 single


knife
 in
 my
 house
 and
 is
 incredible.
 So,


not
 only
 can
 I
 open
 all
 the
 packages


with
 all
 the
 products
 that
 arrive
 in
 my


doorstep
 with
 a
 very,
 very
 sharp
 knife,


but
 I
 can
 also
 slice
 tomatoes
 as
 if
 they


had
 no
 skin
 at
 all.
 Everything's


different
 now
 when
 you're
 not
 fighting


with
 a
 tomato
 in
 your
 kitchen
 knife.


Anyway,
 that's
 it.
 Sharpen
 your
 knives.


Use
 a
 Spyderco.
 It's
 pretty
 awesome.

### 无线肉类温度计与节目致谢

嗨，我是凯瑟琳·斯奎尔斯，《连线》厨房事务的撰稿人，在纽约市工作。我今年研究和测试中发现的最喜欢的礼物创意是**真正无线肉类温度计**。我今年给自己送了我们推荐的**ThermoPro Temp Spike Plus**。它大大减轻了我烧烤时的压力和猜测。**Temp Spike Plus**允许你通过手机或平板电脑远程监控你的肉类，所以你不必在烹饪时守在烤架或烤箱旁。我喜欢它的准确性、易用性，并且在高达600英尺的距离内都能工作。你只需将探针插入肉中，然后就可以一边做其他事情，一边实时查看烹饪进度。在我同时处理多项任务或只是稍作休息时，能够关注我的肉类真是太方便了。最棒的是，我再也不用担心肉类会烤得太生或太熟了。祝大家节日快乐。

非常感谢《连线》的同事们与我们分享他们喜爱的物品。别担心，我们会在节目笔记中包含所有物品的链接，方便你们查找和点击。

《连线》节目由我，罗茜·加林担任执行制片人，艾比盖尔·基尔担任制片人。工程支持由马蒂·纳齐埃洛和尼克·皮特曼提供。今天的节目由凯瑟琳·安德森混音。原创音乐由丹·鲍威尔、马里安·劳萨诺、艾丽西亚·尤普、罗恩·尼斯托、凯瑟琳·安德森和黛安·王创作。克利夫·利维是《连线》的副出版人和总经理。本·弗曼是《连线》的编辑兼首席执行官。我是凯拉·布莱克韦尔。我是克里斯汀·泽雷特。我是罗茜·加林。感谢您的收听。

 My
 favorite
 gift
 idea


during

 this

is
 a
 truly
 wireless
 meat
 thermometer.
 I


gifted
 our
 pick,
 the
 ThermoPro
 Temp


Spike
 Plus
 to
 myself
 this
 year.
 It's


taken
 so
 much
 of
 the
 stress
 and


guesswork
 out
 of
 my
 grilling
 game.
 The


Temp
 Spike
 Plus
 allows
 you
 to
 monitor


your
 meat
 remotely
 from
 your
 phone
 or


tablet,
 so
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 hover
 over


your
 barbecue
 or
 oven
 while
 cooking.
 And


I
 love
 that
 it's
 accurate,
 easy
 to
 use,


and
 works
 at
 up
 to
 600
 ft.
 You
 can
 just


stick
 a
 probe
 into
 your
 meat
 and
 walk


away
 to
 watch
 your
 cooking
 progress
 in


real
 time.
 It
 is
 so
 convenient
 to
 keep


tabs
 on
 my
 meat
 while
 I
 multitask
 or


just
 simply
 take
 a
 breather.
 The
 best


part
 is
 I'll
 never
 ever
 have
 to
 fret


about
 under

 overcooked
 meat
 again.
