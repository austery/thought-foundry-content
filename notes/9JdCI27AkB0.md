summary: 在世界经济经历深刻变革之际，马克·卡尼强调，旧有的规则导向型开放贸易模式已不再适用。本文探讨了加拿大在日益多极化的世界中，如何重新定位其外交政策，特别是加强与亚洲（包括中国和印度）的关系，以应对美国可能退出全球秩序的挑战。前加拿大驻华大使阿里·拉尼认为，加拿大在亚洲问题上错失了十年，现在必须务实地与非同道国家接触，并积极参与塑造国际秩序。

title: 加拿大外交政策：全球变局下，亚洲是新方向吗？
---

### 全球秩序变革与加拿大的战略考量

马克·卡尼在上周的**APEC**（Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation: 亚太经济合作组织）峰会上直言不讳。他告诉亚太地区领导人，旧有的基于规则的开放贸易模式已不再奏效，全球经济正经历一个深刻变革的时期，其深刻程度堪比1989年柏林墙倒塌以来的任何时期。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Mark Carney did not mince words at last week's APEC Summit. He told Asia-Pacific leaders that the old model of rules-based open trade no longer works and that the global economy is in a period of profound change, one of the most profound since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</p>
</details>

那么，这对加拿大意味着什么？如果加拿大不能再依赖其最大的贸易伙伴美国，我们应该在哪里建立和加强联系？卡尼曾谈到加拿大与欧洲的紧密联系，但将重点放在与亚洲建立新关系是否会更有意义？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does that mean for Canada? Where should we build and strengthen ties if we can no longer rely on the US, our biggest trading partner? Carney has spoken of our close connections with Europe, but would it make more sense to focus on building new relationships with Asia?</p>
</details>

就此问题，我们采访了前加拿大驻华大使、国际治理创新中心（Center for International Governance Innovation）杰出研究员阿里·拉尼，听取了他的看法。

### 亚太峰会：亚洲崛起与双边关系的重要性

谈到在韩国举行的**APEC**（Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation: 亚太经济合作组织）峰会，阿里·拉尼指出，此次会议有三个主要发展或启示。首先，亚洲的重要性不言而喻，世界各国领导人齐聚于此。在此之前，还举行了**ASEAN**（Association of Southeast Asian Nations: 东南亚国家联盟）峰会，以及唐纳德·特朗普总统与习近平主席之间，以及与马克·卡尼总理之间非常重要的会晤。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first I think it's just the importance of Asia uh you know world leaders were there. There was the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian nations just before a very important meetings between Trump and President Xi uh and also Prime Minister Carney.</p>
</details>

其次，双边关系的重要性凸显。许多重要的双边会议在此举行，而**APEC**峰会本身并非真正的焦点。第三个对加拿大而言非常具体的启示是，加拿大终于意识到了亚洲在经济、人口以及日益增长的智力方面的力量。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the importance of Asia second I think the importance of bilateral relationships you know there were a lot of important bilateral meetings um and the actual apex summit itself you know wasn't really the the showpiece and I think the third takeaway very specific for Canada is I think Canada finally woke up to the reality that is the economic demographic and increasingly the intellectual power that's in Asia.</p>
</details>

拉尼认为，这是加拿大现在需要迈出的旅程。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And and that's the journey Canada needs to make now.</p>
</details>

### 加中关系：务实接触的转折点

马克·卡尼与习近平主席会晤了大约40分钟，这对于一直紧张的关系来说是一个重要的进展。回溯到2018年，卡尼也曾接受邀请访问中国。卡尼本人曾用“转折点”来形容这次会晤，那么这是否真的是两国关系的转折点？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Mark Carney and President Xi Jinping met for about 40 minutes. This is a relationship that's been strained. We go back to 2018. Um Carney accepted an invitation as well to visit China. Could this be a turning point? Those those are words that he himself has used. Mark Carney. Is this a turning point for that relationship?</p>
</details>

阿里·拉尼认为，这必须是一个转折点。他认为这是一个务实国家的世界，不再是一个礼貌、安全、有保障的世界。像加拿大这样的国家需要务实。中国不会消失，加拿大必须与其接触。在接触的同时，加拿大仍然可以坚持自己的原则，但对于加拿大这样的国家来说，袖手旁观没有任何好处。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has to be a turning point is the way I look at it. Uh I think it's a world of pragmatic states. Uh you know this is no longer a polite, safe, secure world and countries like Canada need to be pragmatic. Uh China's not going away. Uh you have to engage it. Uh and you can engage it and still hold your principles, but there's no advantage for a country like Canada to be on the sidelines. So I I think it's a it has to be a turning point.</p>
</details>

加拿大必须与中国接触，也必须明白这种关系将永远是不对称的：中国是一个更大的力量，而加拿大不是。加拿大有一些牌可以打，现在是时候打出这些牌了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have to engage China and we also have to understand that the relationship will always be, you know, asymmetric. They're a bigger power. We're not. We have certain cards to play and it's it's time that we play them now.</p>
</details>

当被问及中国能为加拿大人提供什么时，拉尼表示，他不能确定中国具体会为加拿大人提供什么，但他认为中国作为一个国家，显然正在影响全球体系。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think I'm not sure what it will offer Canadians, but I think a nation like China is clearly influencing the global system.</p>
</details>

面对像美国这样正在退出全球秩序的伙伴，加拿大需要能够影响中国。其次，中国市场对加拿大经济也有优势。中国刚刚恢复了对中国游客的旅游签证，这将带来大量收入。因此，虽然存在一些经济方面的好处，但拉尼认为加拿大需要能够与这个正在关键性地塑造国际秩序的国家进行接触。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and Canada faced with a partner like the United States which is withdrawing from the global order needs to be able to influence China. Second, I think uh you know there are advantages to our economy. The Chinese have just reinstated uh the tourist visas for Chinese travelers. You know, that's a lot of revenue. Um, so there are some economic aspects, but I just think Canada needs to be able to engage the country that's that's crucially shaping the international order.</p>
</details>

### 超越西方：加拿大需探索新地缘

拉尼强调，加拿大绝对需要超越西方，转向亚洲。他认为加拿大需要“驾驭新地缘”，这不仅是物理上的，更是思想上的。总理已经在欧洲停留了一段时间，现在又在亚洲，他认为加拿大需要从欧洲走向**欧亚大陆**（Eurasia: 欧洲和亚洲的统称）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Absolutely. I think Canada needs to what I call navigate new geography and not just physically but intellectually. uh and the prime minister has spent some time in Europe and now he's in Asia and I think Canada needs to make the journey from Europe to Eurasia. You know, that's where the center of power is and and Eurasia uh includes the Middle East and the Gulf States and Central Asia.</p>
</details>

他指出，权力中心正在向欧亚大陆转移，这包括中东、海湾国家和中亚。加拿大绝对需要这样做，但加拿大在这方面已经迟了，因此需要迅速行动。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Canada absolutely needs to do that. Canada is late to the game. Um and so we really need to move quickly.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大在亚洲的“失落十年”

**印太地区**（Indo-Pacific: 印度-太平洋地区）占世界经济活动的三分之一以上。当被问及加拿大为何在利用这一关系方面如此迟缓时，拉尼认为这是一个“乌龙球”，加拿大在过去十年中经历了一个“失落的十年”。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Indopacific accounts for more than a third of the world's economic activity. When you say slow to the game, why why why has Canada been so slow to capitalize on this relationship? Well, I think it's been an own goal. I I really think we've had a lost decade the last 10 years.</p>
</details>

他指出，加拿大曾有一个与真正重要的国家关系不佳的政府。与中国和印度的关系都在恶化，如果不能与这两个国家中的任何一个搞好关系，就很难制定**印太战略**。因此，加拿大确实浪费了时间。与此同时，欧洲和美国都在与欧亚大陆进行接触。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, we had a government uh which had bad relationships with the countries that really mattered, right? I mean, we had a deteriorating relationship with China and a deteriorating relationship um with India. It's pretty hard to have an Indopacific strategy if you can't get along with either of those two countries. So, we've really lost time. And at the same time, the Europeans and the Americans have all been engaging Eurasia.</p>
</details>

拉尼认为，加拿大还有很多工作要做，虽然手上的牌不是最强的，但总理正在尽力打好这场牌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um we've got work to do. I think we don't have the strongest hand, but I think the prime minister is trying to play uh the best game he can.</p>
</details>

### 印度崛起与加拿大在G7中的角色

在加拿大所能打的牌中，印度是一个重要因素。那么，现在是否是加拿大推动**G7**（Group of Seven: 七国集团）邀请印度成为正式成员的时候？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of those cards in that game is India, which you had mentioned. Is it time for Canada to push the G7 to invite India to be a full-time member?</p>
</details>

拉尼公开倡导这一点。他认为西方几十年前押注俄罗斯，而现在押注印度是一个更好的选择。尽管会存在问题，但印度是一个民主国家。在不断演变的世界秩序中，需要与非同道国家接触。十年前，**G7**邀请印度以及中东国家等伙伴国，被视为一种恩惠。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. I mean, I've advocated for it publicly. I think the West took a bet on Russia decades ago. I think taking a bet on India is a better bet. Uh there will be problems. Well, one, it's a democratic country. Uh and I think in the evolving world order um you need to reach out to countries that are not likeminded right uh at the moment the G7 uh you know always invites India it invites uh Middle East countries it invites these partner countries 10 years ago it used to invite them because it was seen as a favor to them.</p>
</details>

现在，拉尼认为，如果**G7**不邀请印度，那么**G7**将变得无关紧要。在一个同道国家聚在一起变得不那么重要的世界里，非同道国家聚在一起反而更重要。因此，他认为加拿大可以在推动这一理念方面发挥作用。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I would argue that if you have a G7 and you don't invite India the G7 is irrelevant. So, it's a world where like-minded countries getting together is less important than non-like-minded countries getting together. So, I think Canada could really uh play a role here in in uh advancing that idea.</p>
</details>

### 对加拿大外交部长的建议

加拿大发挥作用是一回事，但它是否有足够的影响力来推动其他成员国接纳印度？拉尼认为，如果加拿大继续积极参与，它就能做到。过去几周，加拿大所做的第一件事就是积极参与，这很重要。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Canada playing a role is one thing, but does Canada have I want to say clout, but does it have that power to really push the other members to get India in it? Well, I think Canada can if it continues to to show up to the game, right? So, I talked about this. Are we showing up different than when we were a couple years ago? Well, it remains to be seen, right? I mean, I think the first thing we did the last couple of weeks was was show up to the game, which is important.</p>
</details>

由国家领导人，即总理来领导，这一点很重要。在欧亚大陆，领导人必须亲自出席，这是一种文化现象。因此，总理的出席很重要，而不是仅仅派遣部长。但之后还需要兑现承诺。一些协议已经签署，未来6到18个月将是关键时期，以观察加拿大是否能真正执行这些协议。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's important that it's it's led by the leader of the country and the prime minister. Uh I think that's a cultural thing in Eurasia. Uh the leaders got to show up. So, I think that was important opposed to opposed to sending ministers and but then you've got to deliver. So some agreements have been signed. Uh the next 6 18 months are going to be really important to see if if we actually execute.</p>
</details>

如果给加拿大外交部长安妮塔·阿南德（Anita Anand）一条建议，那会是什么？拉尼的建议是：与非同道行为者接触。鉴于美国正在发生的变化、欧洲的现状以及经济权力的转移，加拿大在某种程度上现在是独自面对世界。因此，加拿大必须弄清楚如何与那些非同道但可能存在共同利益的伙伴进行接触。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of ministers, um if you had one piece of advice uh for Canada's foreign affair minister, Anita Anand, what would that be? Engage non-like-minded actors. uh Canada in some ways is now alone in the world given what's happening with the United States given where Europe is and given where the economic power is. So, I think you really have to figure out how you engage partners that are not like-minded, but with whom you may find some common uh interest.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大外交政策的历史性挑战

回顾历史，加拿大是否曾处于目前这种需要建立关系的位置？拉尼认为这是一个非常有趣的问题，很难找到加拿大曾处于类似境地的时候。在第二次世界大战之前，加拿大是英帝国的一部分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Historically, has Canada been in a place that it is in right now when we look at forging sort of those relationships? You know, that's a really interesting question. And if um if you think about it, it's it's hard to see when Canada has been in a place like this. you know, before World War II, we were really part of the British Empire, right?</p>
</details>

二战后，加拿大作为一个独立国家出现，但很大程度上处于美国的轨道，欧洲其他国家也是如此。之后是冷战时期，冷战在某种程度上对加拿大这样的国家来说是容易的，因为只需要选择一边并坚持下去。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We emerged from World War II uh as an independent nation, but very much in the orbit of the United States, as was the rest of Europe. Um, and so in some and then we had the Cold War. And the Cold War in some ways was easy for a country like Canada. You picked a side and you stayed on that side.</p>
</details>

现在，加拿大没有明确的“阵营”可供选择。加拿大必须在世界更多地区更加积极，在一个拥有更多经济力量的世界中。因此，目前对加拿大这样的国家来说，这是一个非常艰难的时期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, now there are not sides for Canada to choose, right? uh Canada has to be more active in more parts of the world um and in a world which has more economic power. So it's a very tough place for a country like Canada at the moment.</p>
