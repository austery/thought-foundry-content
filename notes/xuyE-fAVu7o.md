title: 市场解读：AMD的AI雄心与数据中心板块回调的博弈
---

### 市场概览：冰火两重天

欢迎回来。今天市场发生了很多事值得我们讨论。我们将在大约30分钟后，也就是4:15到4:20左右，迎来“技术星期二”环节，Jason将会加入我们。由于前几周被大型科技公司的财报占据，我们已经有几周没有这个环节了，现在所有财报都已公布，我很期待深入探讨这些数据。

今天市场发生了什么？我们看到了很多不同的头条新闻，而且情况相当有趣。标普500指数是绿色的，意味着更广泛的市场是上涨的。但哪些板块是红色的呢？几乎所有的数据中心概念股都下跌了。正如你在屏幕上看到的，数据中心股票今天遭受了重创。Hive下跌2%，Wolf下跌14%，CleanSpark下跌6%，IREN下跌5%，Cipher下跌6%，Nebius下跌9%，即将跌破100美元。Galaxy下跌3%，Core（CoreWeave）受创最重，下跌15%，Apply Digital下跌8%。

<p class="english-text">Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We will have technical Tuesday today in about 30 minutes, 4:15ish, 4:20ish, Jason will be on. So, we will have a full-on session of Technical Tuesday. It's been about a couple weeks since we've had it and that's because we've had big tech earnings. So, now that all those earnings are done, very excited to go through a lot of these numbers. What is happening in the market today? We got a lot of different headlines. It's actually quite interesting. S&P 500 is green, meaning the broader market is green. What's red? Well, pretty much all the data center plays. I mean, data center plays absolutely getting wrecked today as you can see right here on the screen. Hive down two, Wolf down 14, CleanSpark down six, Ian down five, Cipher down six, Nebius down nine about to go below 100. Galaxy right there down three. Core getting hit the worst down 15% and then Apply Digital down 8%.</p>
</details>

### 数据中心股回调：债务担忧与交易拥挤

我认为数据中心股票今天受挫有几个原因。首先，我们过去几天一直在讨论，市场对这些公司承担的债务负担越来越担忧。Core在昨天的财报电话会议上明确表示，他们将通过债务为更多活动融资。Oracle，作为大型云计算公司之一，今天也下跌了2%，这可能也是因为企业债务问题日益凸显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Couple reasons why I think the data center plays are getting hit today. Number one, and we've been talking about this over the past couple days, there is a little bit more concern around the debt load that these companies are taking on. And Core yesterday on the earnings call for those that listen, they really made it very clear that they're going to be financing a lot of more activities through debt. Oracle, one of the larger cloud computing players that is also down 2% of the day, likely because of what we've got in regards to corporate debt becoming more of an issue.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，我认为问题不仅仅在于这些公司的债务状况，它们确实有债务，并且会进行股权稀释。当然，如果稀释所得的资金能够用于扩张数据中心容量并产生良好的投资回报，那么这种稀释可能是增值的。Nebius今天就表示，他们已经售出了所有可能的容量。他们与Meta的30亿美元交易，坦率地说，如果不是因为容量不足，规模可能会大得多。他们没有更多的容量可以提供给**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscalers: 指的是像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样提供大规模计算资源的巨头公司）。这向我表明，需求不是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, I don't think it's just the debt profile of a lot of these companies that do indeed have debt and will engage in dilution. Again, a lot of that dilution could be accretive if that dilution is going to be good enough to be able to generate an ROI given that they're expanding data center capacity. One of the things that Nebia said today was that they sold as much capacity as they possibly had. The meta $3 billion deal quite frankly based on what Nebby said would have been a lot larger. It's just they didn't have more capacity to give out to the hyperscalers. That shows me that demand is not a problem.</p>
</details>

结合Lisa Su在AMD投资者日上的讲话——她公布的数据意义重大——我认为问题不仅仅是债务。另一个原因可能是这个交易变得过于拥挤，人们有些厌倦了。坦白说，作为一个想在Nebius建立真正仓位的人，我喜欢这种情况。我认为让这些股票喘口气是健康的，尤其是当我认为它们下跌并非出于根本性原因时。当然，对于Core，你可以从债务负担的角度谈论其基本面。对于Nebius，我相信人们也能在财报中找到一些危险信号，尽管我个人没有看到太多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And based on what Lisa Sue said, which we'll look at in a second, she had her AMD investor. That was a very big deal in terms of the numbers she put out there. I think it's not just that much about debt. I think it's also about this trade is just getting crowded and people got kind of tired of it. And quite frankly, as someone who wants to actually establish a real position in Nebius, I like it. I think it's healthy for a lot of these plays to just take a breather, especially if there's not a fundamental reason why I think these plays are getting hit. Now, Cororee, you could speak to some of the fundamentals around their debt load. Neb, I'm sure there's some red flags that people could find out in the earnings. Overall, I didn't see too many.</p>
</details>

### 市场轮动与避险情绪

今天市场可能出现了一些板块轮动。标普500指数是绿色的，但许多科技股却是红色的，这一点很耐人寻味。标普指数在一天中的大部分时间里是红色的，大约在20分钟前才翻绿。然而，Nvidia下跌了3%。当Nvidia下跌3%时，Nebius、Cipher和Wolf是不可能上涨的。同样，AMD也下跌了2.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You might be seeing a little bit of a broadening out trade in the broader market given the S&P 500 is green, but a lot of the tech names are red. which I thought was pretty fascinating. S&P was red most of the day and it kind of just flipped green about 20 minutes ago. But Nvidia is down 3%. I mean Nebius and Cipher and Wolf are not going up on a day when Nvidia is down 3%. Uh same when AMD is down 2.5% and we'll talk about AMD in a second.</p>
</details>

这可能是一种避险行为。Palantir、Tesla、Nvidia和Robinhood都在下跌。虽然它们的跌幅并不算巨大，大约在1%到3%之间，但数据中心股票是受创最严重的。这可能正是我们看到更多避险情绪的地方，投资者们在说：“好吧，我在这只股票或这组股票中已经有足够的利润了，因此我不需要继续加倍下注。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a flight to safety. It might be a flight to safety. You got pounder down, Tesla down, Nvidia down, hood down. Now they're not all down some dramatic amount. seven, eight percent, they're down one to three percent. The data center players are the ones that are getting hit most. And I think that's where you might be seeing a little bit of a flight to safety of people just saying, you know what, I have enough profits in this stock or in these basket of stocks and therefore I don't need to continue doubling down on these names.</p>
</details>

也许是Nvidia的头条新闻吓到了人们，即软银出售了部分股份。但我们早上讨论过，软银打算用出售Nvidia股票所得的60亿美元做什么？他们要把它投给OpenAI，而OpenAI会购买更多的Nvidia芯片，并需要使用更多的**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscalers）来获得更多的云服务交易，从而支撑整个数据中心生态系统。所以这实际上并非净利空。我只是认为今天的交易有些疲劳，结果导致了一次洗盘，而我认为这实际上是相当健康的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe the Nvidia headline is spooking people. The idea that Soft Banks sold some of their stake. We talked about that in the morning. What did Soft Bank say they're going to do with their $6 billion of Nvidia? They're going to give it to OpenAI, which is going to buy more Nvidia chips, which is going to have to use more hyperscalers to get more NeoClouds deals to be able to prop up the entire data center ecosystem. So, it's not really net bearish. I just think the trade got a little fatigue today and as a result, you're seeing a flushing out, which I think is actually pretty damn healthy.</p>
</details>

### AMD投资者日：为AI的未来投下信任票

话虽如此，长期的净看涨情绪应该是存在的，因为Lisa Su今天在她的投资者日上是这么说的：

> “数据中心AI的收入机会对我们来说固然令人兴奋，但我们今天想传达的另一个信息是，我们业务的其它所有部分也都在全速前进。这是一个非常好的状态。我们今天要讨论的一些其它关键目标，是我们认为有能力以远超市场动态的速度增长的领域。在服务器方面，我们目前约占40%的份额，我们有明确的路径在未来3到5年内，在一个更大的**潜在市场总额**（Total Addressable Market, TAM）中，占据超过50%的服务器市场收入份额。在客户端收入市场份额方面，我们现在大约处于20%多的水平，同样有明确的路径在三到五年内达到超过40%的份额。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, the net bullish sentiment should be long on a lot of the stuff because here's what Lisa Sue said today at her investor day.
> Now, as exciting as the data center AI, you know, revenue opportunity is for us, um the other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders. And um that's actually a very nice place to be. Um some of the other, you know, key targets that we're going to talk about today are um areas where we think we have the ability to grow significantly ahead of the market um dynamics. So um on the server side, Dan McNamera is going to show you uh sitting currently at approximately 40% share, we have a clear path to over 50% uh revenue share of the server market over a larger TAM um over the next uh 3 to 5 years. Um Jack will talk about our client uh revenue market share. We're sitting, let's call it, in the high 20s right now. um again a clear path to over 40% client revenue market share um in this three to five year time frame and then cel will talk about uh the 70% adaptive revenue market share is the last thing that she's talking about.</p>
</details>

基本上，Lisa Su表示，对AI计算基础设施的需求仍然极高，客户并未减少在AI方面的投资。AMD预计未来三到五年年收入增长将达到35%。要知道，他们在第二季度的一个主要诟病是增长率只有22-23%，数据中心业务增长14%。所以他们大幅提高了预期，这正是每个分析师想听到的。他们还预测数据中心的**复合年均增长率**（Compound Annual Growth Rate, CAGR）将超过80%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basically Sue said demand for AI computing infrastructure remains extremely high customers are not reducing their investments in AI AMD is projecting annual revenue growth of 35% over the next three to five years again one of the biggest knocks on them in Q2 was that they, you know, were growing at 22 23%, data centers at 14%. So they pretty much up the ante on the expectations, which is pretty much what every analyst wanted to hear and they're forecasting data center growth exceeding 80% ker. So again, when you see stuff like this and there was a lot of other tidbits that Lisa Sue had to say, but they did not disappoint in terms of the level of excitement that they brought to the overall uh data center thesis as more and more demand for AI comput infrastructure continues to remain high.</p>
</details>

至于AMD股票今天下跌，我认为这是Nvidia下跌以及大盘整理的结果。另外要记住，今天是退伍军人节，信贷市场休市，这意味着全天交易量都很低。由于缺乏波动性和交易量，许多对冲基金经理可能在不同股票之间来回操作。所以明天可能会是另一番景象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the stock being down today again I think that is a function of Nvidia being down the broader market kind of consolidating a little bit. One thing to also remember is uh today's Veterans Day, right? So you have the credit markets that are uh closed which means across the board you've been seeing low volume. You could have a lot of different hedge fund managers uh going back and forth in terms of names they're getting in and out of due to the lack of volatility and due to the lack of volume today. So tomorrow potentially is a different story.</p>
</details>

### 市场轮动细节与宏观动态

今天市场出现了一轮轮动。消费防御性股票如沃尔玛是绿色的。医疗保健股如礼来公司今天创下历史新高，强生和艾伯维也上涨。而科技和半导体板块则下跌。昨天情况正好相反：沃尔玛和礼来下跌，而Nvidia则一飞冲天。今天的逆转意味着所有与大型科技股相关的数据中心和加密货币概念股也会随之下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is your rotation. Take a look at this. So consumer defensives like a Walmart are green. Healthcare like a Eli Liy all-time highs today. J&J Abby that's up. And then you got tech and semiconductors that are down. So yesterday this was kind of the opposite. Walmart was down, Lily was down, and you know, Nvidia was literally going to the moon. And today kind of had a reversal, which means all the data center plays, crypto plays that are attached to a lot of the big tech names associated in that space. They're also going to take some of those companies to go down as well.</p>
</details>

关于特朗普关税问题，我之前认为最高法院不会推翻特朗普的关税，因为他们会考虑到实际操作的困难，比如退还所有已缴关税会引发混乱。然而，今天美国进口商表示，如果最高法院裁定必须退还他们为特朗普关税支付的款项，操作上会很简单。他们指出，有文件清楚地记录了他们为进口到美国的商品支付的关税，退款会非常容易。这对于特朗普来说不是个好消息。此外，CNBC报道称，在上周三的口头辩论中，大多数最高法院大法官对这些关税的合法性表示怀疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the core arguments I said for why uh the Supreme Court would not overturn the Trump tariffs is because they would be practical and say, "Hey, if we did this, all this money would have to be reversed. Like that's probably not something we want to cause. We have to think about ultimately uh the practicality of us making this decision." Today, American importers said that if the Supreme Court rules that the money they have paid for President Trump's tariffs must be repaid, it would be simple to do so. They said importers pointed to paperwork that clearly details the tariffs they pay on goods brought into the US and it would be very easy to refund the money. So, every time you think maybe the Supreme Court would go in the opposite direction. Now, even the people having to pay back the money, they're saying to be honest, it wouldn't be that hard. It would be pretty easy, which is not good for Trump. And then you have CNBC reporting that during oral arguments last Wednesday for a case that will decide the fate of Trump's tariffs, most Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism that the duties were legal.</p>
</details>

另外，关于政府关门，众议院议员们正在返回华盛顿，准备明天下午投票以重开政府。目前看来，法案通过的可能性很大。特朗普已经祝贺共和党人重开政府，所以势头很足。如果政府在本周末前重开，这显然会成为宏观经济的利好因素，或许这也是标普指数尾盘拉升的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">House members look right now they are making their way back to DC for the first time in more than 50 days to vote tomorrow afternoon to reopen the government. We're expecting that around 4 p.m. Might be a little later. And look, if there's any sign that this will not pass, we haven't seen it yet. It seems full speed ahead. Granted, Republicans, they can only afford to lose two members, but that's what they lost last time. And remember, they actually had one Democrat join them. And Trump has already congratulated Republicans on reopening the government. So again, lots of momentum there in this getting done tomorrow, which means we're now looking ahead. The Senate is now trying to see if there is any path on extending those Affordable Care Act tax credits. But Republicans are eyeing bigger changes to Obama's signature healthc care law. Okay, so it looks like the House is going to take a vote tomorrow. That vote is going to be really important. The Republicans really don't have any votes to lose, so they've got to be able to get as many votes as they can. And if that's the case, then maybe the government reopens by the end of the week. That could obviously be a tailwind for the broader macro. Maybe that's also why the S&P is getting a little bit of a pump right here.</p>
</details>

### Oklo财报速览与AI债务迷思

今天，那些在过去几个月里上涨的**高贝塔**（High Beta: 指波动性高于整个市场的股票）动量股都遭到了抛售。我认为这没关系，而且非常健康，尤其是在标普指数收绿的情况下。这可能会为市场创造更多的盘整机会，来决定哪些股票值得资本流入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pretty much all the momentum names, high beta momentum. If you've been running up over the past couple of months, you are getting hit today. I think that's okay. I think that's also really healthy with the S&P green, but a lot of those momentum names down. Um, and a lot of that's probably creating a lot more consolidation for the market to be able to figure out what names deserve that capital.</p>
</details>

Oklo的财报已经出来了。该股在盘后有所上涨。财报显示，公司没有收入，每股亏损20美分，而市场预期是亏损13美分。他们在每股收益上错失了54%。尽管如此，股票还是绿的。我对这个国家的核能未来以及AI对核能的需求抱有希望，但问题是，对于一家尚未真正执行任何计划的公司，你是否愿意给予如此高的市值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oklo earnings are out. What do we got for Oakllo? Um stock is up a little bit after hours. You see that green candle? uh no revenue and they lost 20 cents a share instead of 13 cents a share. They missed by 54% on EPS. They missed by 54% on EPS and no revenue. Stock's green. You got a stock that's green, baby. I think there's a bright future for nuclear energy in this country and I think there is a lot of need for nuclear energy via AI. I just, you know, do you give a company this much market cap for not really executing on any of it yet? That's the broader question.</p>
</details>

我想多谈谈正在引发一些恐惧的“AI债务交易”。坦率地说，这也可能是许多数据中心股票受到冲击的原因。

> “AI仍然是市场的热门交易，但裂缝已经开始显现。软银套现Nvidia引发了新的估值问题。Burry的警告针对的是那些支撑着大盘的巨头公司。而转向借贷正在将AI从一个增长故事变成一个杠杆故事。这就是此刻的不同之处。最初由炒作和市盈率扩张带来的轻松收益可能已经过去，投资者正在权衡维持这场繁荣的成本。市场正在奖励像谷歌这样销售基础AI服务的公司，而像Meta这样支出超过收入增长的公司，则因承诺未兑现而受到惩罚。换句话说，这是工具和服务与愿景的对决，而市场现在想看到结果。与此同时，债务无疑正在重塑AI交易的动力，并增加了更多风险。基础设施建设不再由风险投资或利润驱动，而是靠贷款、债券和私人信贷。这给了像Michael Burry这样的空头更多的弹药。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk a little bit more about this AI debt trade that's creating some fear. And quite frankly, this could also be why a lot of the data center plays took a little bit of a hit.
> AI is still the market's trade, but cracks are starting to show. You mentioned some of them. Stock bank cashing out on Nvidia raises fresh valuation questions. Bur's warning is aimed at the mega caps that are carrying the broader markets. And the move to borrowing is turning AI from a growth story into a leverage story. That's what makes this moment different. The easier initial gains from the hype and the multiple expansion that may now be behind us as investors, they're weighing the cost of keeping the boom alive. Now, this chart you see, it's Meta versus Alphabet over the last few months, and it really sums up a shift in the AI trade. The market is rewarding players like Google that are selling basic AI services. Meta on the other hand where spending is outpacing revenue gains that's being punished for promises without payoff. Another way of putting it is tools and services versus a vision and the market right now wants to see results. Scott debt meanwhile that is certainly reshaping what powers the AI trade and it's adding more risk. The buildout it's no longer being fueled by venture capital or profits. It's loans bonds. private credit and that gives bears like Michael Bur more ammunition.</p>
</details>

我听到越来越多的人在谈论这个债务问题。人们之所以恐慌，是因为在2000年的互联网泡沫中，电信公司就是通过债务为其互联网建设提供资金，结果并不理想，许多公司破产，从而产生了泡沫的概念。许多人认为AI的轨迹将完全不同，因为在产生投资回报方面，这项技术更有前景。但要实现这一点，显然需要资金。过去几年是自由现金流，现在变成了债务。问题在于，多大的债务会变得不可持续？我读到一篇文章说，未来几年将达到万亿美元。这对我来说听起来很激进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that debt argument again, I'm just hearing a lot and lot more of people talking about this. The reason people are freaking out about it, is because in in the dotcom bubble that was one of the core ways that um the telecommunication companies financed a lot of their buildout of the internet which was through debt and obviously that didn't end up working out. A lot of those companies went bankrupt and that created the idea of a bubble. The reason a lot of people think that AI is going to have a fundamentally different trajectory here is because there is a lot more promising technology in the context of how they generate that ROI. But to get there, you obviously need money. And over the past couple years, it was free cash flow. Now it ends up being debt. The question is just how much debt becomes unsustainable. And I was reading one article today saying it's going to be a trillion dollars in the next couple years. And that to me sounds aggressive.</p>
</details>

不过，对债务的担忧是合理的。即便是Nebius也在宣布更多的稀释，他们有这种“at-the-market”发行。IREN也在稀释。所有这些公司都在稀释。作为投资者，问题就变成了：你是否愿意接受稀释以换取它们的增长？当你听到Nebius说，他们与Meta的30亿美元交易之所以只有这个规模，是因为他们实在没有足够的容量，否则Meta会付更多钱。当你听到IREN说，他们只授权了其所有可用设施的12%，还有巨大的增长空间，并且有足够的需求来签订建设数据中心的合同。这些都让人更加相信，他们承担的债务并非出于错误的原因，而是为了真实的需求。问题只是市场能容忍到什么程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the broader concerns around debt I think are warranted. I mean even Nebius is announcing more dilution and they have this at the money offering. Iran has dilute. All these companies have dilution. The question becomes as an investor. Are you okay with the dilution in order to allow them to grow? And when you hear things from Anbius that says we only were able to get a $3 billion deal with Meta because we literally don't have enough capacity otherwise Meta would have paid us a lot more money. When you hear things from Ire saying we are only licensing 12% of our all of our overall available facilities and we have so much more room to grow and the demand is there to be able to get those deals to build out those data centers. It becomes a lot more encouraging that the debt they're taking on is not for a faulty reason. It's for something real. It's just how much is the market going to be able to put up with it is the broader question.</p>
</details>

### AMD盘后异动与住房政策新动向

盘后，AMD股价上涨了4%。这是一个相当大的变动。我认为这可能是对投资者日消息的延迟反应。我看到一条新闻可能是原因：AMD预计毛利率在55%到58%之间。这个数据可能几小时前没有披露。他们还预计年收入增长35%，数据中心收入增长60%，并在5年内达到千亿美元的年化运行率。Lisa Su表示，到2030年，数据中心市场总额将达到1万亿美元，需求是“永不满足的”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD is moving after hours. Is it? AMD is up 4%. You are correct. Why is it moving after hours? That is a good question. Are we just getting a delayed reaction after investor day? I think this might be the headline. AMDC's gross margin ranging between 55 to 58%. That might not have been disclosed a couple hours ago. I thought it was, but maybe it wasn't. Projected annual revenue growth at 35%. Data center revenue to grow 60% with a hundred billion annual run rate in 5 years. Lisa Seuss's total data center market will hit 1 trillion by 2030. Demand is insatiable. I think it's the gross margin. A lot of these other headlines are old.</p>
</details>

从宏观角度看，房利美正在考虑降低获得抵押贷款的信用要求。他们准备取消620分的最低信用分要求，转而使用自己对风险因素的分析。官方称他们正在为借款人扫清障碍。这是旨在在美国创造更多购房机会的一系列政策变化中的最新一项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From a macro perspective. Um, so here's what Fanny May is thinking of. They're thinking of dropping their credit requirements on getting a mortgage. Fanny May is set to drop its 620 credit score minimum. The mortgage giant will instead use its own analysis of risk factors. Officials say they're easing barriers to borrowing. These are from homes.com. It's just the latest in a series of policy changes aimed at creating home ownership opportunities in the United States.</p>
</details>

现在有两件事让很多人想起了《大空头》里的Michael Burry。一是这个50年期抵押贷款，二是降低获得抵押贷款的信用要求。上一次我们大规模这么做，导致事情失控，是在2008年，结果并不好。特朗普昨天也为50年期抵押贷款辩护：

> “这甚至不是什么大事。从30年到40年，现在到50年，这意味着你每个月支付的少一些，只是支付的时间更长。这可能有点帮助，但问题是拜登提高了利率。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's two things that are going on right now that have a lot of people tweeting Michael Bur memes from the big short. Uh, and you've got people just thinking, goodness, like, is this really happening? Number one is this whole fifth year mortgage. And then number two is the idea of dropping credit requirements in order to qualify for a mortgage, which the last time we did that at a scale where, you know, things got a bit out of hand was in 2008. That didn't work out too well. Here was Trump yesterday speaking about the fifth year mortgage as well.
> It's not even a big deal. I mean, you know, you go from 40 to 50 years and what it means is you pay you pay something less from 30 that some people had a 40 and then that now they have a 50. All it means is you pay less per month. You pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor. It might help a little bit, but the problem was that Biden did this. He increased the interest rates.</p>
</details>

瑞银今天对此做了分析，他们说，对于一栋平均价值42万美元的房屋，50年期抵押贷款相比30年期，每月还款额能减少约119美元。但将贷款期限从30年延长到50年，将使你支付的总利息大约翻倍，并显著减缓房主积累资产的速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, UBS did some analysis on it today, and they said on a average $420,000 home, the lower monthly payments on your fifth year mortgage versus 30-year mortgage would be about $119. So, you'd save about 23 grand on the monthly payments. But by stretching the loan from 30 to 50 years, it would roughly double the total interest that you pay and obviously slow down the rate of time for homeowners to build equity.</p>

### 技术分析：大盘与关键个股解读

**Jason:** 我们回来了。距离上次已经很久了，但好处是现在所有财报都已公布，我们可以真正进行分析了。市场似乎在等待Nvidia的财报。上周五下午市场看起来很糟糕，但突然之间，仅仅是基于政府可能重新开放的预期，市场就逆转并回到了高点。

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** We made it back, baby. It's been a long time, man. It's been a long two weeks, but it's good because now we had all the earnings finished, so we can actually we well we've had all we've had we've had all the mega cap except for you know the beloved Nvida Nvidia still to come. Feel like the market's almost like you know waiting for that to to hit still. It was looking ugly Friday afternoon and then all of a sudden, you know, just on the idea that maybe just maybe the government would open back up and then boom reverse right back to the highs on Friday and then here we are just kind of trying to to let the dust settle and see how how you know if it can actually sustain.</p>

**Jason:** 关于SPY，趋势仍然向上。我们有过一次短暂的触底，但现在又回到了高点附近。只要我们能守住678这个上周的低点，那么通往690甚至历史新高的道路就是敞开的。今天市场参与者不全，因为债券市场休市，所以明天的走势会更重要。

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** The trend is still up. We had a little brief love tap, which, you know, was it probably felt rough in the midst of it, but here we are kind of back towards the highs and right back to last week's level. As long as we can actually hold within this kind of range, if we can kind of come in, chop around like that, that's going to be good at least to 690, that's going to be that that's all-time highs really. Tomorrow is going to be an important day. Today not so important because the bond market is closed and we don't have the full participants in the market today.</p>

**Amit:** 即使Nvidia下跌，标普指数最终收绿，你认为这有益于市场吗？

<p class="english-text">**Amit:** Do you like that we ended green even though Nvidia was red? You think that was productive? The S&P?</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我认为这正是我所说的市场广度在扩大。即使巨头科技股没有上涨，市场其他部分也在被拉动，这说明市场并非熊市。资金正在流向其他成长性板块，这是一个健康的迹象。在熊市中，资金只会涌向现金，你会看到美元指数飙升，但我们现在没有看到这种情况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** I think that's exactly the broadening that I'm talking about. So, the the broadening of the of the market as a whole is uh is important is an important note. So, even if the mega caps don't go up, what's what's happening under the hood to tell you that this is in fact not a bare market is that other components are catching a bit. other components are being lifted and helping out uh lift the broader trend. We're seeing money flood to growth, but in other sectors of the of growth and just other sectors, right? In a bare market, money just floods to cash and you see the dollar ripping face, right? That's not what we're seeing. You look under the hood here and we're seeing um we're seeing the market broaden. And that's what we started this whole segment with. And and this is bullish net, right?</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 关于Palantir，它回落并重新测试了它刚刚突破的区域，也就是170美元左右的支撑位。这个位置被测试了六次，这是一个相当多的次数。我希望看到它在更高的位置，大约183美元左右，也就是之前的阻力位，形成新的支撑。这被称为**支撑-阻力转换**（Support/Resistance Flip, SR Flip）。今天我们在185美元看到了买盘介入。我希望看到价格在这个区域盘整，而不是再次深度测试170美元。目前图表显示的是盘整，最好是等待更明确的信号。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** On Palantir, what happened is that this came back down and retest the same area it just broke out of. Right? So this area here was what was acting as support where buyers were were showing up right here in that 170 area. Six is a lot. What I'd like to see is this hold um higher up here. So, this area that was prior resistance, what we're going to be looking for is called a it's called an SR flip or where resistance becomes support. And that's more towards this 180 kind of three level. We see one test here 185 and we see some buying action come in literally today and if this area holds I can see price chopping like this but I want to see that kind of price action where where buyers step in right around this 185 type level. Best case scenario, what this chart is telling me is it's actually telling me chop. So, I would like to see this turn into consolidation.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 关于CoreWeave，我个人在财报后会遵循“三天规则”。目前它正在测试近期的双底。我倾向于认为它可能会跌破这个双底，一个值得关注的价格是心理关口100美元。一个关键的支撑位在85美元左右。我不会直接在这里买入，而是会等待买方力量出现的信号。从135美元下跌以来，下行势头一直在增强，你需要先看到横盘整理，这意味着空头在回补。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jason:** On Core Weave, personally, I do invoke the 3-day rule post earnings. I think we get to test this double bottom, which it looks like we're coming into right now. A price of interest is at basically the psychological level of $100. The number is, what is the number here? Let's get it. $85.26. I think on the third one, it probably breaches just slightly. I would really wait for buyers to show up um before stepping into this one because the momentum here is from that 135 breakdown. the momentum has been building to the downside and you want to see some kind of sideways action which would be would would would mean that the shorts are covering and we're not seeing that first.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 关于Meta，三周前你问我会在什么价位买入，我当时说的就是630美元以下。从技术上讲，从近期高点796美元到低点479美元的50%回撤位正好是633.90美元。如果股价无法回到634美元以上，那么从统计概率上看，有65%的可能性会跌至585美元。我个人已经在600美元以下开始小量买入了。我认为Meta需要一个月左右的横盘整理，这对于建立新的投资者基础是健康的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** On Meta, three weeks ago, you asked me what what price I would buy Meta at. I think you said 630 or below. Yeah, we're like right there. A 50% pullback from here to here happens to be 633.90. If we cannot get back above 634 we have a 65% probability of actually getting here. So those are the statistics. That's the math right now. I've been nibbling because it's one of those stocks where I don't want to be overly precise. I think sideways price action for a month even is actually going to be pretty healthy to let some people create a new investor base on Meta.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 关于AMD，盘中一度看起来像是“卖出新闻”的事件，但它守住了227美元这个关键的前期高点。只要能持续保持在225美元以上，它就会成为支撑。展望未来，它可能会形成一个新的“杯柄形态”，突破267美元后，可能会回撤到255美元，那将是一个买入机会，最终目标可能指向300美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jason:** On AMD, it was a very shaky ground in intraday. This looked like it was going to be a sell the news event. Retesting this 227 is a prior all-time high. That's constructive. As long as it can hold sustainably over that. That's that's going to be your support line. You're going to want to see this create a new cup and handle. You're going to need this to breach that 267. Then you're going to expect a pullback. You're going to need to buy that dip if that happens. And that dip is going to be around 255. And that's going to take you to the goddamn promised land of 300.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 关于Nvidia，上次我们谈到，在“七巨头”财报前做多Nvidia是明智的，事实也证明了这一点。现在，它回落到了178美元的支撑位。我认为在11月19日财报前，股价会横盘整理。关键的突破区域是195美元，突破后会迅速到达200美元，再往上是210美元。如果能突破，下一个目标可能是225-230美元，这可能会成为年底“圣诞老人行情”的一部分。

<p class="english-text">**Jason:** On Nvidia, what we said three weeks ago was that you want to be long Nvidia before the Mag 7 reports. That's the deal. And that's then and this right here is what happened. We got a again another disappointing dip all the way back into 178, which by the way, we also called this. I would expect to see some kind of consolidation sideways. This is going to be sideways movement. And then eventually a couple days before earnings, this start to get its butt in gear one more time. Which means that 195 is going to be your clear breakout zone and 195 will definitively bring you every time to 200. And then if you get up and through 200, that's quickly going to take you to 210. And then your breach, your breakout is going to look like something like this. This is going to take you into 225s, maybe 230. This is going to be your Santa Claus rally.</p>

### 快速技术分析环节

*   **SoFi (SOFI):** 图表形态没有改变，趋势完全完好。关键枢轴点在30美元左右，只要能守住这里作为支撑，目标仍然是35美元。年底前突破35美元是完全可能的。
*   **以太坊 (Ethereum):** 目前处于关键的3350-3400美元区域。如果跌破，下一个重要支撑在3182美元（50%回撤位），甚至可能出现一次快速的流动性攫取，跌至2700-2800美元区间，那将是一个非常好的长线买入点。
*   **BMR:** 走势与以太坊类似。如果以太坊出现2800美元的下跌，BMR的对应价格大约在33美元。目前看来，可能会先反弹至阻力位，然后再决定方向。我不会卖出，但准备在更低的位置买入。
*   **特斯拉 (Tesla):** 处于建设性的盘整中。415美元是关键的枢轴点，目前正作为支撑。只要这个更广泛的上升趋势保持完好，即使回调至390美元也是健康的。
*   **Rocket Lab (RKLB):** 这是一个典型的“突破后令人失望的大幅回调”形态，而这种回调往往是绝佳的买入机会。50美元是一个坚实的支撑位。如果能守住，下一个目标是65美元。
*   **亚马逊 (Amazon):** 财报后突破了高点但未能守住。目前正在239美元（50%回撤位）附近找到支撑。它将再次尝试突破255美元的高点。如果成功，下一个目标是262美元，最终目标是275美元，这符合一个巨大的杯柄形态的预期。
*   **Rivian (RIVN):** 处于活跃的突破模式中。12.85美元是长期支撑。如果能突破18.60美元，下一个目标将是23美元。
*   **甲骨文 (Oracle):** 我不喜欢这只股票。图表显示了一个典型的“财报后跳空失败”形态。它未能突破高点，随后跌破了整个跳空区间的底部。目前没有看到任何买盘兴趣，处于明确的下降趋势中。
*   **DraftKings (DKNG):** 从技术角度看，这是一个很好的交易设置。它在25美元附近找到了支撑（一个关键回撤位）。如果能重新站上32美元，下一个目标是37.5美元，然后是42美元。从交易角度看，这很有吸引力。

<p class="english-text">**SoFi (SOFI):** No change on SoFi and this is still intact fully intact. As long as 30 just under 30, 29.50 ends up acting as support where it was resistance in the past. The targets have always been and remain 35. No, that's that's definitely possible.
**Ethereum (ETH):** This 35ish level is important. It's possible that we get another dip. And that dip is likely going to come in in the flavor of a flash crash. 50% of this extreme low to extreme high is 31.82. I have this little sliver right here just around 2,800 as actually a really good spot to actually get long.
**BMR:** The equivalent of a $2,800 dip on on ETH is about 33 on BMR. I'm not selling BMR, but I I am prepared to buy it lower.
**Tesla (TSLA):** Constructive consolidation but concerning at the same time. 415 was the level. It still is the level. A pullback to 390 is still fine, right, for this trajectory to fives and ultimately sixes.
**Rocket Lab (RKLB):** There's a setup. It certain times in the market there are certain setups that start to show up. Right now, this one of the setups is like a breakout like this and an extremely disappointing pullback that ends up shaking out a lot of people. Which which also ends up being a massive dip by. 50 bucks is a solid hold. 65 is I think where it would be.
**Amazon (AMZN):** Whenever you have a power earnings gap, there's always a setup. 50% of that move is boom, smack dab at 239. Right now, what's happening is that you're going to get another shot to break this high. That high is 255. That should take you to at least 262 and a quarter. And then your boom into 275, which by the way has always been the target on Amazon.
**Rivian (RIVN):** 12.85 is and has been support for forever. We're just in active breakout mode is what we are. Um, and so if we can get through 18.60, um, well, in that case, then it should be a straight shot to 23.
**Oracle (ORCL):** Oracle, I don't like, dude. Oh, and then some. It's not that they lost their entire pump. They lost their entire pump and continued. I have no interest in buying this dip. I don't see any investor sentiment showing up here.
**DraftKings (DKNG):** I like DraftKings. I like it from a technical perspective. Below 32, it was 25.38, which is like literally exactly where we got. So from from here, what what you expect is you expect a little bit of a chop. And if DraftKings can get back over 32, it's on the men definitively. And and when it's back over 32, you should expect 36s.</p>
