### 明尼苏达州联邦检察官集体辞职：司法独立面临挑战

六名联邦检察官因对美国司法部（DOJ）处理明尼苏达州一起致命冰冻枪击事件的调查方式深感不满而集体辞职。据《纽约时报》消息，在Renee Good被联邦特工枪杀后，时任DOJ民权部门负责人（由特朗普总统任命）曾告知其团队，她不考虑启动调查，以确定该特工是否违反了联邦法律。相反，司法部将调查重点转向了Good的遗孀及其与反对特朗普政府移民政策的当地激进组织之间的潜在联系。此次辞职的最高级别官员是明尼苏达州美国律师办公室的二把手Joseph Thompson。知情人士透露，Thompson还反对司法部阻止他与州政府官员合作调查此案的举动。在枪击事件发生前，Thompson一直在负责对当地索马里社区的福利欺诈进行复杂调查。特朗普政府将该欺诈行为作为向该州派遣大量联邦特工的理由。明尼阿波利斯警察局长表示，Thompson的辞职将严重打击该欺诈调查。

From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's
 Wednesday,
 January
 14th.
 Here's
 what
 we're
 covering.
 In
 Minnesota,
 six
 federal
 prosecutors
 have
 resigned
 over
 how
 the
 Justice
 Department
 is
 handling
 the
 investigation
 into
 the
 deadly
 ice
 shooting
 there
 last
 week.
 Sources
 tell
 the
 Times
 that
 after
 Renee
 Good
 was
 killed
 in
 her
 car
 by
 a
 federal
 agent,
 the
 head
 of
 the
 DOJ's
 civil
 rights
 division,
 who
 was
 appointed
 by
 President
 Trump,
 told
 her
 staff
 that
 she
 was
 not
 considering
 opening
 an
 investigation
 into
 whether
 the
 agent
 had
 violated
 federal
 law.
 Instead,
 the
 department
 pressed
 for
 a
 criminal
 investigation
 into
 the
 actions
 of
 Goods
 widow
 and
 her
 potential
 connections
 to
 local
 activist
 groups
 opposed
 to
 Trump's
 immigration
 crackdown.
 The
 most
 senior
 figure
 to
 resign
 was
 the
 second
 in
 command
 at
 the
 US
 Attorney's
 Office
 in
 Minnesota,
 Joseph
 Thompson.
 People
 familiar
 with
 his
 decision
 say
 he
 had
 also
 objected
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 DOJ
 blocked
 his
 efforts
 to
 work
 with
 state
 officials
 to
 investigate
 the
 killing.
 Before
 the
 shooting,
 Thompson
 had
 been
 overseeing
 the
 complex
 investigation
 into
 welfare
 fraud
 in
 the
 Somali
 community
 there.
 The
 Trump
 administration
 has
 pointed
 to
 that
 fraud
 as
 the
 reason
 for
 its
 surge
 of
 federal
 agents
 to
 the
 state.
 The
 Minneapolis
 police
 chief
 said
 Thompson's
 resignation
 will
 deal
 a
 major
 blow
 to
 that
 fraud
 investigation.

### 移民政策与执法争议：明尼阿波利斯紧张局势升级

与此同时，明尼阿波利斯街头的紧张局势依然高涨，联邦移民特工持续进行强硬行动。经过《纽约时报》核实，相关视频显示他们砸碎汽车窗户，释放催泪瓦斯，并拘留美国公民。当地居民表示，他们被基于种族或民族进行歧视性执法。特工在行动中声称正在进行移民检查和公民身份检查。此外，特工还询问被拘留者的出生地，引发了“这是我的家”的强烈反抗。作为此次打击行动的一部分，特工逮捕了数十名合法入境的难民，其中大部分来自索马里，包括儿童。这些难民此前已经通过了严格的安全审查和背景调查。大部分被拘留者已被转移到得克萨斯州的拘留设施。联邦官员尚未对此事发表评论，但特朗普政府此前曾承诺重新审查数千名难民的身份。

 Tensions

 As
 part
 of
 the
 crackdown,
 agents
 have
 arrested
 dozens
 of
 refugees
 who
 entered
 the
 country
 lawfully.
 According
 to
 lawyers
 and
 immigration
 rights
 advocates,
 the
 group
 is
 mainly
 from
 Somalia
 and
 includes
 children.
 They
 had
 previously
 passed
 extensive
 security
 screenings
 and
 background
 checks.
 Most
 of
 the
 detainees
 have
 now
 been
 flown
 from
 Minnesota
 to
 facilities
 in
 Texas.
 Federal
 officials
 did
 not
 respond
 to
 a
 request
 for
 comment,
 but
 the
 Trump
 administration
 previously
 vowed
 to
 re-examine
 the
 status
 of
 thousands
 of
 refugees.
