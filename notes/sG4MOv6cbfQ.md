### 纽约市住房挑战的全球共鸣

**Joe:** 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的**OddLots podcast**（OddLots播客：彭博社旗下专注于金融和经济的播客）。我是乔·魏森塔尔（Joe Weisenthal）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我是特蕾西·阿洛威（Tracy Alloway）。乔，我不想让这个播客完全专注于纽约市，但说句公道话，我们不仅住在这里，而且纽约市发生的事情——它面临的问题和挑战——实际上在世界各地都能看到。所以，做几期与我们周边发生的事情相关的节目也并非坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Tracy Aloway. Uh Tracy, I don't want the podcast to be like an entirely New York City focused podcast, but like in our defense, not only do we live here, but you know what happens in New York City, it has it has problems and it has challenges that are seen really all around the world. So it's not terrible to do a few episodes related to, you know, what's happening around in our neighborhood.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我一点也不觉得这很糟糕。事实上，纽约市在住房领域确实具有全国性乃至全球性的相关性，对吧？我们知道纽约市住房短缺。人们长期以来一直在努力寻找改善方法，增加供应，同时也降低租金。因此，这对于许多其他可能同样面临容量限制的城市和地区都有影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think it's terrible at all. And in fact, one specific area where New York really does have national maybe even global relevance is in the housing arena, right? So, we know New York City has a shortage of housing. People have been trying to come up with ways to improve that, build more supply for a long time and also lower rents. And so that that has, you know, implications for a lot of other cities and places that might also be capacity constrained.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 完全正确。我的意思是，纽约的住房负担能力达到了令人震惊的程度，但我认为世界上每一个蓬勃发展的城市都面临着负担能力的挑战，至少在西方是这样，但我认为基本上 everywhere 都是如此。所以人们总是谈论如何解决它等等。当然，过去的OddLots嘉宾**佐兰·马姆达尼**（Zohran Mamdani: 纽约州议会议员，以其进步派住房政策提案闻名）提出了他解决住房负担能力问题的建议，包括对该市很大一部分住房实行**租金冻结**（rent freeze: 指政府规定租金在一定时期内不得上涨或只能小幅上涨的政策）。因此，我们需要了解这意味着什么，以及它对商业的影响，以及它是否可行。我认为，这里更广泛的主题是公共部门在私人市场中的作用，对吧？如果我们真的想从概念上探讨这个问题，那基本上就是我们正在讨论的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. I mean like New York is sort of at egregious levels of housing on affordability but every city around the world I think every city that's booming has some challenges of affordability and uh building more at least in the west but I sort of think basically everywhere and so you know people always talk about trying to solve it etc. Anyway, of course, past OddLots's guest Zoran Mumani has his uh proposals for how to address housing affordability, including a rent freeze on a significant chunk of the housing stock um in the city. And so, we sort of need to get a sense of like what that means and how that you know what what the implication is for business, whether it could work, you know. Well, the broader theme here, I guess, is the role of the public sector in the private market, right? Like if we want to get really really conceptual with this, that's basically what we're talking about.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。当然，马姆达尼有一系列提案和想法，包括免费公交、更快的公交，还有公共杂货店试点等等。但是，我们最近与**凯西·怀尔德**（Kathy Wild: 纽约伙伴关系组织负责人）做了一期节目，她代表了纽约市许多主要雇主。我确信他们出于多种原因对马姆达尼感到焦虑，但她说在他们的社区中，真正最“吓坏了”的是房地产行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And of course, Manny has a slew of proposals and ideas, free buses, faster buses, also has a public grocery store trial, etc. But, you know, we did that recent episode with uh Kathy Wild, the head of the Partnership for New York, which represents a lot of major employers in the city. I'm sure they're anxious about him uh for a number of reasons, but uh she said within their community, it's really the real estate industry that is the most freaked out, so to speak.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的。我对这一点很感兴趣，因为人们把房地产行业说成是一个整体，但它当然不是，对吧？有住宅、有商业、有豪宅、有更经济适用房。所以我想深入挖掘一下，确切了解他们的担忧是什么，以及这些担忧是否来自房地产网络的不同部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I'm really interested in this because people talk about the real estate industry as this sort of monolith, but of course it isn't, right? There's residential, there's commercial, there's luxury, there's more affordable. So I I want to dig into this a bit more and understand exactly what the concerns are and whether they're coming from different parts of the real estate network.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。然后，在房地产行业内部，还有经纪人，还有独立于房东的开发商等等。总之，我们请来了完美的嘉宾，一位我们已经请过几次的嘉宾。每次纽约市房地产成为新闻焦点时，我们都喜欢和他聊天。我们将与**本·卡洛斯·泰彭**（Ben Carlos Typen: Quantier公司创始人）进行对话。他是**Quantier**（Quantier: 一家专注于房地产分析的公司）的创始人，该公司分析房地产。他也是纽约市的房东和经纪人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And then there's, you know, even within real estate, there's brokers and then there's developers who are separate from landlords, etc. Anyway, we do have uh the perfect guest, someone we've had on a few times every time New York City real estate is in the news, a guy we like to chat with. We are going to be speaking with uh Ben Carlos Typen. He is the founder of a firm called Quantier, which analyzes real estate. He is also a New York City landlord and broker.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 有趣的想法。

<details>

### 马姆达尼愿景下的房地产行业焦虑

**Joe:** 凯西·怀尔德在我们与她交谈时确实说过，在所有经济部门中，房地产行业是最焦虑的。那么，具体来说，谁真正感到焦虑？或者说，马姆达尼的愿景中，什么最让房东或房地产行业的其他参与者感到不寒而栗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kathy Wild uh when we talked to her did say that the real estate industry is the uh of all of the sectors of the economy the most an anxious. What uh what specifically, you know, who's who's really anxious or what what about Mumani's sort of vision most sends chills down the spine of uh landlords or other players in the real estate industry?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 嗯，我的意思是，我认为对马姆达尼的反应实际上与八年前**比尔·德布拉西奥**（Bill de Blasio: 纽约市前市长）上任时的反应并没有太大不同，哦，抱歉，是十二年前。我认为这被我们所处的政治环境、马姆达尼的政治身份、他的种族、民族和宗教所放大。但是，我认为最让这些人感到害怕的是——当我说这些人时，我指的是那些正在表达恐惧的人，我认为他们不一定能代表房地产行业的每一个部分，正如特蕾西指出的那样——我认为最让他们害怕的是，马姆达尼的城市管理前提并不围绕着他们。嗯，你知道，这在德布拉西奥政府期间是一个大问题，媒体对此进行了大量报道，德布拉西奥尽管任命了一些对房地产友好的委员，并且总体上有一个对房地产相当不错的政府，但他并没有习惯于“亲吻戒指”（kissing the ring: 意指向有权势者谄媚），也没有习惯于出现在他们的盛大晚会上，打电话给他们，并以一种方式抚慰他们，而相比之下，现任市长**埃里克·亚当斯**（Eric Adams: 纽约市现任市长）在这方面做得非常好。所以我认为，很多这种情绪都是关于他们在城市中的地位，他们在市政厅的影响力，以及根据政策的不同，实际政策和市场影响力的脆弱程度也各不相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean, I think the reaction to Mumani is actually not that different from the reaction to Bill Delasio uh 8 years ago when when he came in or excuse me, 12 years ago. I think it's been amplified by, you know, the political environment we're in, Mam Nani's political identity, his, you know, his race, his his ethnicity, religion. But, you know, what scares these people, I think, the most. And when I say these people, I mean the people that are, you know, vocalizing their their fear, which I think don't necessarily speak for for every um portion of the real estate industry. uh as as Tracy pointed out, I think what most scares them is that Mamdani's sort of premise of city management uh does not revolve around them. Um and you know this was a a major issue during the Delasio administration that the press covered a lot where you know Delasio despite h you know appointing you know some real estate friendly u commissioners and generally having a pretty good administration that was pretty good for real estate he didn't he wasn't in the habit of kissing the ring um and sort of showing up to their gallas and calling on them and and stroking them in a way that you know in contrast Eric Adams um the the current mayor has been very uh you um good at doing. Um so I think a lot of this is sort of meta feelings about you know their place in the city, their influence in city hall and the you know depending on the policy there could be you know there's varying degrees of of tenuousness to actual policy and market implications.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那么，谁最害怕呢？请给我们一些关于这种氛围的细微差别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So who is most scared? Give us some nuance on on the vibes.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 当然。我认为最害怕的群体是**租金稳定型公寓**（rent stabilized apartments: 纽约市一种受租金管制法律保护的公寓类型，租金上涨受到限制）的房东，因为马姆达尼承诺冻结租金稳定型公寓的租金。然后是大型开发商，那些最大的开发商，他们的商业模式不仅在很大程度上依赖于某种非正式的卡特尔，并与制定城市政策的人以及最有权势的参与者保持最佳关系，而且他们还对公民责任和他们在公民社会中的角色有更强的意识。我认为马姆达尼的言论和一些政策威胁到了他们对自己在城市中地位的认知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So I think the most scared groups are rent stabilized landlords because you know Mam Dani has pledged to freeze rents on rent stabilized apartments and then large developers the sort of you know the biggest developers who not only have business models that largely depend on sort of being in a you know informal cartel um and having you know the best possible best relationships with the the people that you know make policy in the city and and the you know the most powerful players but also, you know, have a a greater sense of civic duty and and their role in civic society. And I think Mani's rhetoric and some of his policies threaten their sort of sense of uh their own place within the city.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 乔，这很有趣。我回想起，我们在采访马姆达尼后不久，采访了泽西市市长，他没有赢得州长初选提名。所以，不是每个来OddLots的嘉宾都能自动获胜。但他当时说的一件事非常有趣，那就是通过——他谈到了“去政治化”。是的。也就是说，通过使审批流程更加简化，那些开发商，他们可能曾经的优势在于他们真的知道如何在这些委员会、在社区中玩转游戏。突然间，这种微小的优势在一个更加直接的系统中消失了。如果我没记错的话，本，马姆达尼本人也谈到过他确实想要更多的开发。他谈到了市场价格开发，他也谈到了，如果开发商符合某些要求，比如劳务工资等，就让这个过程更加直接。这似乎再次印证了你的观点，即那些最受威胁的实体可能是那些规模大、最擅长玩政治游戏的实体。是的，我认为简化流程不一定有利于那些根深蒂固的现有企业。嗯，我认为他们在马姆达尼政府下不一定会表现得很差，但他们——至少如果人们认真对待马姆达尼的政策声明——就不会处于主导地位。你知道，在布朗克斯区建造小型多户住宅的阿尔巴尼亚人，他将更有可能从这些简化政策中受益，而不是那些在《纽约时报》上被引用的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's interesting, Tracy. I'm thinking back, you know, we did that not long after we interviewed Mandani. We interviewed the Jersey City mayor who didn't win his primary nomination for governor. So, not everyone who comes on odd lots uh automatically win. But one of the things he said that was really interesting is that by you know he said he he talked about depoliticizing. Yeah. And that you know essentially by making it sort of more streamlined the process to get approvals that there are these developers who maybe their edge was that they really knew how to play the game within these boards within you know the community. Suddenly like that is a marginal edge that disappears in a system that is much more straightforward. And Mumani himself, if I'm not mistaken, Ben, has also talked about he does want more development. He's talked about market rate development and he's also talked about just sort of making that process if the developer meets certain requirements, labor pay, etc., just much more straightforward, which again would seem to speak to your point that perhaps some of the most threatened entities would be those ones who are big and best positioned to sort of play the politics side of the game. Yeah, I I think streamlining does not necessarily benefit the most entrenched incumbents. Um I think that they wouldn't necessarily fare badly under Imamani administration, but they um at least if if one takes Mani's policy pronouncements at face value would not be in the driver's seat. you know, the the Albanian guy in the Bronx who's building a small multif family building, he's going to be in a lot more position to benefit from these streamlined policies than, you know, the type of people that are being quoted in the New York Times.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 顺便说一句，特蕾西，在我忘记之前，本谈到了与德布拉西奥的相似之处。这很有趣，因为我想我看到凯西·怀尔德昨天在新闻中有一段话，我们是在7月16日录制这期节目的，她基本上说：“马姆达尼就像比尔·德布拉西奥，只不过我们喜欢他。”他本质上是讨人喜欢的，但你知道……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Tracy, before I forget, you know, Ben talked about the similarities with Delasio. It's funny because I think there was a quote, we're recording this July 16th, I think I saw a quote yesterday from Kathy Wild in the news that was basically like, "Mumania is like Bill Delasio except we like him." like he's likable essentially, but you know</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's pretty funny.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我的意思是，是的，我明白了。嗯，好的。所以，这次讨论的一部分，我理解为什么开发商可能会担心在与市政厅打交道时失去竞争优势等等。除了项目初步审批之外，还有其他担忧吗？例如，是否担心公共住房的强调可能会挤占私人开发？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, yeah, I get it. Um, okay. So, part part of this discussion I I understand why developers might be concerned about like losing their competitive advantage when it comes to navigating city hall and all of that. Are there any concerns beyond initial approval for projects? Is there a concern, for instance, about an emphasis on public housing perhaps crowding out private development?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 我认为普遍存在一种担忧，即马姆达尼政府及其氛围将抑制私人投资，无论是在现有住房还是新建私人住房方面。然而，即使在这种情况下——我不太同意这种观点，认为这有点犬儒——也会有受益者。所以，假设这种情况真的发生了。租金稳定型公寓的租金被冻结，新开发和新住房的私人投资骤降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a generalized concern that the Mamani administration and its vibes are going to depress private investment, whether that's in existing housing or building new private housing. However, even under that scenario, which I I don't really agree with and think is kind of a cynical view, there would be beneficiaries of that scenario. So, let's say that does happen. Rent stabilized rents are are frozen and private investment in new development and new housing plummets.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 他们会提高市场价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're going to upcharge the market rate.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 完全正确。市场租金将大幅上涨。因此，在这种情况下，市场租金房东会做得非常好，而那些已经表现不佳的租金稳定型公寓房东将继续表现不佳，而那些只建造公共补贴住房的经济适用房开发商——马姆达尼希望在补贴住房上投入更多资金——也将受益。所以，你知道，这确实说明了房地产行业内部有许多不同的利益相关者，他们拥有不同且有时相互冲突的利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. Market rate rents would increase considerably. So in under that scenario, the market rate landlords would do very well and the rent stabilized landlords who are already not doing well would continue to not do well and the affordable developers who only build uh housing with public subsidy which you know Mam Donnie wants to spend you know uh considerably more on on subsidized housing would also benefit. So you know it really speaks to the the many different stakeholders within the real estate industry who I who have different and and sometimes conflicting interests.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与机遇

**Tracy:** 如果纽约市居民的总体需求保持稳定或继续增长，就像目前的情况一样，在这种理论上开发商只想撤退的情况下，那些拥有市场租金单位的房东，你可能会认为他们会做得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If demand for residents in New York City broadly is stable or continues to grow as it has been in this scenario where in theory developers just want to pull back, the landlords who have exposure to the market rate market rate units, you'd think they would do very well.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 是的。事实上，我有一些市场价格开发商客户，他们现在正在市场上筹集资金，并以此为论据，说你应该立即资助我们的这个项目，因为我们将在马姆达尼上任并冻结一切之前，成为最后一批开发的建筑，因此我们将在市场上拥有最好的产品，并能够收取最高的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and in fact, I have clients who are market rate developers who are out in the market fundraising right now on with this argument to say that if we should you should fund this project of ours right now because we're going to be the last buildings to to be developed before mom Donnie comes in and freezes everything and therefore we're going to have the best product in the market and be able to charge the highest price.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这太棒了。所以成本转移基本上已经发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's amazing. So the cost shift is already happening basically.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 是的。但就像我说的，人们正在恐慌。我不确定这是否一定符合现实，但我认为我们所看到的，在马姆达尼初选胜利之后，无论是公开还是私下的许多言论，都是公关和宣传。你知道，在房地产行业，每个人都总是在寻找一个角度来说明为什么他们的项目是最好的，或者为什么他们的项目应该获得资助，或者为什么我没有做出这个决定，以及为什么，你知道，为什么我因此看起来很聪明。所以，你知道，我们仍然非常处于宣传区。让我们多谈谈这一点，因为我觉得有一个老生常谈的说法，可能有一些道理，那就是那些恐慌并让自己歇斯底里的人，在商业上不如那些适应新环境并抓住机会的人做得好。所以你描述了一群现在可能正在机会主义思考的人，他们可能有机会在租金冻结生效之前建造一些东西。他们将因此拥有定价权。还有哪些机会是人们感受到的呢？是的。好吧，也许我们不喜欢这些政策，但在马姆达尼政府下，有赚钱的机会。还有谁在“摩拳擦掌”呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But like again we're people are freaking out. I'm not sure that that is necessarily uh grounded in reality, but I think a lot of the the rhetoric both public and private we've seen in in light of Mam Dani's primary victory has is is PR and spin. You know, in real estate, everyone's always trying to find an angle to say why their project is best or why why their project should be funded or why I'm not making this decision and why, you know, why I look smart because of that. So, you know, we're still very much in in the spin zone. Let's talk more about that because you know I feel like one of those cliches which probably has some truth is that yeah people who freak out and like let themselves get hysterical don't do as well as business as people who adapt to the new environment and sense the opportunity. So you've described one set of people who may be thinking opportunistically right now which is the people who might have the opportunity to build something before rent freezes come into place. they're going to have the pricing power uh by this. What else are the opportunities that people sense about? Yeah. Okay. Maybe we don't like the policies, but there's a money-making opportunity under the Mani uh administration. Who else is sort of licking their chops, so to speak?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 另一个“摩拳擦掌”的群体是专门建造经济适用房的开发商，他们既有营利性开发商，也有非营利性开发商。你知道，他们在德布拉西奥政府期间做得很好，在亚当斯政府期间也做得很好。他们一直做得很好，因为马姆达尼希望建造比任何前任市长都多的政府补贴住房。但这并不是说建造这些住房的开发商和劳动力会凭空从政府中出现。你将需要私营部门的参与者来完成这项工作。所以这些群体或这些参与者正在采取与房地产行业中其他一些纯市场价格开发商不同的方法，并试图与马姆达尼政府建立一种单独的关系，说：“嘿，你知道，我们想帮助你实现目标，我们知道你想花很多钱，这对我们双方都有好处。”我认为另一个群体，讽刺的是，他们并没有“摩拳擦掌”，因为我认为他们非常害怕，那就是租金稳定型建筑的业主。因为，正如我们之前的一个播客中讨论过的，这是一个陷入困境的行业，它一直在走向清算，我认为马姆达尼的政策将导致这种趋势的加速，所以这里会有一些变化。我认为它可能以一种犬儒的方式发生，你知道，在最高法院，或者它可能以一种更乐观的方式发生，通过马姆达尼成为某种“尼克松访华”（Nixon to China: 指采取出人意料的、具有历史意义的举动），前往奥尔巴尼，为这些建筑制定一些新制度，这些制度既不给租户增加负担，又能稳定它们，并确保它们不会倒塌，这不符合任何人的利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One other group that's licking their chops is the developers that specialize in building affordable housing, which are both for-profit and and nonprofit developers. And you know they have done pretty well or they did very well under the administration. They've done well during the Adams administration. They consistently do well because you know the Mdani wants to build more government subsidized housing than any uh previous mayor. But it's not like the the developers and the labor for building that housing is just going to materialize out of the government. You're going to be using private sector players to do this. M so these groups or the these players are taking a a different approach than some other you know pure market rate developers in the real estate industry and trying to craft sort of a separate piece with the Bombani administration to say like hey you know we we want to help you meet your goals we know you want to spend a lot of money this is good for you know for for both of us and I think another group ironically and they're not so much licking their chops because I think they're they're very scared is the rentstabilized building owners because you know as as we've discussed on our one of our previous podcasts you know this is a distress sector and it's sort of been heading for a reckoning and I think Mdani's policies are going to lead to an acceleration of that trend so that something gives here and I think it could give in a in a sort of cynical way you know at at the Supreme Court or or it could give in a you know more optimistic way by by sort of Mamani being uh something like Nixon to China and going to Albany and crafting some sort of new regime for these buildings that you know does not burden tenants but also um stabilizes them and make sure that they don't collapse which is not really in the interest of anyone.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，这提供了很好的背景信息，因为长期受苦的租金稳定型建筑业主长期以来一直试图放松监管，我认为他们甚至以宪法为由提起了诉讼，显然目标是试图将此案提交最高法院。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this is good context because the long-suffering rentstabilized uh building owners have been trying to loosen regulation for a long time and I think they even sued um on a constitutional basis and clearly the goal is to try to get this to the Supreme Court,</p>
</details>

### 劳动力与成本考量

**Tracy:** 但在这种背景下，你很快提到了劳动力，我想回到这一点，因为马姆达尼的提案之一是使用工会化劳动力来建造所有这些经济适用房。我很好奇这有多可行，可用性如何，以及它实际上如何影响成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in that context, you mentioned labor really quickly and I want to go back to that because one of the proposals that Mumani has is using unionized labor to build all this affordable housing and I'm curious how feasible that is, what the availability is and how that actually feeds into costs.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 当然。所以，在谈论这个问题时，我认为重要的是要记住，这不是一个马姆达尼的问题。所有的建筑工会都支持科莫。这实际上是一个普遍的纽约问题。我们将看到马姆达尼如何处理，你知道，与其他大多数有影响力的工会不同，建筑工会仍然没有放弃科莫。他们还没有认可马姆达尼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So when talking about this issue, I think it's important to keep in mind that this is not a Mum Donnie issue. The construction unions all were backing Cuomo. This is really a New York issue at large. We'll see how how Mum Donnie, you know, they the unlike most of the other powerful unions, the construction unions still have not abandoned Cuomo. They have not um endorsed mom donn yet.</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 话虽如此，有组织劳工的工作显然是为其成员争取最高的工资和最好的福利。他们还需要确保其成员继续工作。所以现在我们面临的情况是，在两个立法会议前谈判的这项税收计划中，特别是对于大型项目，劳工要求被视为过于繁重，没有人建造符合这个工资标准的建筑。所以这里需要某种和平协议。我认为这可能是一个机会，你知道，凭借马姆达尼在左翼建立的所有信誉，可以在劳工和开发商之间达成和平协议，以便我们能够用工会化劳动力建造住房，但又不会让成本过高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That said, there's obviously organized labor's job is to advocate for the most wages and and best benefits for their members. They also need to make sure that their members keep working. So right now we're in a situation with this tax program that was negotiated uh in two uh legislative sessions ago where in for particularly large projects the uh labor requirements are are viewed as as too ownorous and and no one is building buildings that qualify under this this this wage standard. So there needs to be some sort of peace that is brokered here. And I think this could be an opportunity, you know, with all the credibility that Mdani has built on the left to craft a peace between labor and and developers to make it so that we can build housing with unionized labor, but um it doesn't break the bank.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这很有趣。你指出了一点，我一直在思考，但你指出，例如，大多数工会都支持科莫，其中一些，比如建筑工会——我之前没有意识到——仍然支持科莫。科莫也赢得了酒店工会（虽然他们后来改变了立场）的认可，我也想谈谈这一点。但这对我来说很有趣，因为当人们想到一位左翼市长以及他可能如何出错时，他们会想到芝加哥的**布兰登·约翰逊**（Brandon Johnson: 芝加哥市长，曾是教师工会成员）。布兰登·约翰逊是工会机器出身。我的意思是，他是芝加哥教师工会的一部分。马姆达尼，尽管他肯定在意识形态上与有组织劳工有亲近感。但他不像布兰登·约翰逊那样出身于那个机器，更不用说在某种程度上科莫也是如此。所以，这确实让人觉得有可能出现某种“板块移动”。

<p class="english-text">It's interesting.

I mean, he was part of the teachers union in Chicago. Manny, for all his, I'm sure, ideological affinity for organized labor.

### 税收与“富人外逃”的迷思

**Tracy:** 这其中有多少只是归结为——富人不喜欢更高的税收？因为我想，你知道，如果他们试图传达一个信息，说他们不喜欢税收，这可能不会引起很多纽约人的共鸣，但如果说因为更高的税收或因为所有这些其他政策，房地产开发会减少，经济适用房会减少。这只是他们在试图这样宣传吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much of this just boils down to uh people wealthier people not liking higher taxes? Because I imagine, you know, if they're trying to get a message out there saying that they don't like taxes probably doesn't resonate with a lot of New Yorkers, but saying that because of higher taxes or because of all these other policies, there's going to be less development of property, less affordable housing. Is that just them trying to spin it that way?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 我个人认为是的，你知道，我们的媒体环境就是这样构建的，这样做并没有太大的负面影响。所以，你知道，你听说过，还记得几年前有很多关于**大卫·泰珀**（David Tepper: Appaloosa Capital Management创始人）从**Appaloosa Capital Management**（Appaloosa Capital Management: 一家对冲基金公司）搬到佛罗里达以逃避新泽西州所得税增加的故事。我们知道媒体对此非常狂热，但没有人报道他搬回来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I personally I think so and you know our media environment is structured as such that there's not really much downside in doing that. So you know you hear about remember a couple years ago there was a lot of stories about David Ter that from Appaloosa Capital Management moving to Florida to to duck a income tax increase in New Jersey. We know there's a media frenzy about this but no one covered that he moved back. And</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我总是说，没有人会留在佛罗里达。饶了我吧。而且，你知道，我认为，已经完成的数据或分析表明，像百万富翁税收外逃实际上很大程度上是一个神话，其发生率远低于中低收入人群。而且，你知道，有各种各样的群体利用这种动态。例如，一位豪华房地产经纪人会向媒体宣称：“我的电话响个不停，都是想在这里卖掉公寓或搬到棕榈滩的人。”你知道，这是否能引起更多有这种想法的人的注意？是的。但这是否反映了市场现实，或者是否有人在检验他们是否被证明是错的？没有。而且我认为，你知道，这不仅仅是纽约市的现象。我们看到人们的意识形态和政策先验与实际经济分析之间存在很多不一致。我认为一个非常好的例子是纽约市的一位市长，他多次提高税收，包括对高收入者的税收，他是播客的朋友**迈克尔·布隆伯格**（Michael Bloomberg: 彭博社创始人，纽约市前市长）。而许多抱怨佐兰的同一个人，却认为布隆伯格是他们的模范市长，并且真的想回到布隆伯格经济时代。所以，你知道，人们都在手足无措地寻找任何可能的方式来宣传自己的偏好。

<p class="english-text">I'm always saying this no one's going to stay in Florida. Give me a break. And I you know I think you know the the data or and analysis that has been done is this shows that like millionaire tax flight actually is largely a myth and occurs at a much lower rate than it does for for middle and lower income people and you know there's all sorts of groups that sort of take advantage of this dynamic. So, for instance, a luxury real estate broker um will be, you know, p going to the press and say, you know, I'm getting my phone is ringing off the hook on people that want to sell their apartments here or move to Palm Beach. You know, does that get them the attention of more people who might be thinking that way? Yeah. But does it reflect market reality or or is anyone, you know, testing to see if that they've been proven wrong? No. And I think, you know, we're this isn't just a New York City phenomenon. We're seeing a lot of dissonance between people's sort of ideological and policy priors and actual economic analysis. And I and I think a really good example is a mayor who raised taxes including on upper earners several times in New York City, friend of the pod, Michael Bloomberg. And a lot of these same people who are complaining um about Zoron think that Bloomberg was their model mayor and and and really want to go back to the Bloomberg economy.

**Ben:** 对。嗯，我鼓励大家去谷歌搜索**克里斯特尔·鲍尔·扬**（Crystal Ball Young: 康奈尔大学教授），她是一位康奈尔大学的教授，在这个问题上做了很多工作。你知道，凯西·怀尔德在你的采访中提到过，你普遍在商界领袖中听到，尤其是在商业房地产而不是多户住宅领域，我们劳动力的重要性。如果那些为纽约市提供动力的优秀人才无法负担在这里生活，那对纽约市的经济是不利的。是的。而且……

**Joe:** 降低住房成本对一些房东来说会很糟糕吗？是的。但它对城市的许多其他部门，包括办公房地产部门来说会很好吗？

<p class="english-text">would you know lowering the cost of housing uh be bad for some landlords? Yes. But it would would it be good for a lot of other sectors of the city including you know the office real estate sector?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 是的。同样，对于儿童保育，我不知道有谁真正反对儿童保育，我认为这对每个人来说都是一个问题，它将帮助雇员和雇主，但也将帮助房地产业主，因为如果你记得在德布拉西奥政府期间，他们推出了**全民学前班**（Universal Pre-K: 美国政府资助的学前教育项目）。并不是说公共建筑里有所有这些空置空间，可以用来放置儿童保育设施。这些设施将租用私人建筑，并带来大量的租赁活动，这通常会发生在那些难以租赁的空间中。

<p class="english-text">Yes. Similarly with child care would I don't know who anyone who's really opposed to child care like I think that's a problem for everyone and it would uh help employees and employers but also help real estate owners because if you remember during the Bas administration they rolled out universal prek. It's not like there's all this empty space in public buildings near people's houses that you're going to put, you know, childcare facilities. This these are going to be rented in private buildings and result in a huge amount of leasing uh velocity that will often occur in space that is otherwise hard to lease.</p>
</details>

### 犯罪与城市治理

**Tracy:** 当我们与凯西交谈时，她确实提到了犯罪问题。你知道，最初，你可能不会在经济政策和犯罪之间建立直接联系，但论点是，如果城市里发生大量犯罪，人们就会想搬走，回到纽约市人口外流的观点。房东或房地产行业如何看待这个特定方面？这对他们重要吗？因为这可能是一个支持埃里克·亚当斯这样的人的理由，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we spoke to Kathy, she did bring up crime. And you know, initially, maybe you don't make a direct connection between economic policy and crime, but the argument is if there's lots of crime going on in the city, people are going to want to move away to that New York City flight exodus point. How are landlords or the real estate industry thinking about that particular aspect? Is it important to them? because that would be maybe a reason to go for someone like an Eric Adams,</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 我认为这对房地产行业非常重要，而且，你知道，很多人都对20世纪70年代和80年代纽约的经历感到恐惧，即使当时纽约问题的原因是多方面的和复杂的。你知道，每个人都同意，一个犯罪猖獗的城市不符合建筑业主和房产价值的利益，也不符合整个城市的利益，因为我们的大部分预算都依赖于房产税。而且，你知道，马姆达尼说过他正在考虑留用现任警察局长**杰西卡·蒂施**（Jessica Tisch: 纽约市警察局长），并且他不会减少**纽约市警察局**（NYPD: New York City Police Department）的人员编制。我认为房地产行业对此非常怀疑，但你知道，其中比较冷静的人正在记住，纽约市最终是州政府的产物，我们有一位非常温和的州长。我们有一个比马姆达尼更温和的立法机构，以及纽约州宪法的遗产，还有20世纪70年代的财政危机，这为**奥尔巴尼**（Albany: 纽约州首府，常代指纽约州政府或议会）提供了许多方法来确保城市不会在这种问题上走极端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? I I think it's very uh important to the real estate industry and and you know a lot of people are uh scarred by the experience of the 1970s and 80s uh in New York even if the contributing factors for New York's issues back then are are u myriad and complicated. You know, everyone agrees that, you know, having a a crimeridden city is is not in the interests of building owners and and property values and really the city at large given how much of our budget is based on property taxes. And, you know, Mi has said that he's, you know, considering keeping on Jessica Tish, the current police commissioner, that and that he's not going to reduce NYPD headcount. I think the real estate industry is very skeptical of this, but you know, the cooler heads within it are are sort of keeping in mind that New York City is ultimately a creature of the state and we have a very moderate governor. we have a more moderate than um Mandani uh legislature and the legacy or you know of the New York state constitution but also the fiscal crisis in the 1970s provides Albany with a lot of ways to make sure that the city does not go off the deep end on on issues like this.</p>

### 亚当斯市长的住房政策评估

**Joe:** 我们能谈谈过去四年吗？我的意思是，这是一个奇怪的四年，因为，你知道，你从2021年开始，那是在疫情后混乱最严重的时候。我认为有相当多的建设。然而，这是一个非常昂贵的城市。负担能力问题在最近的市长初选中如此有效是有原因的。比如，你知道，你对亚当斯市长在住房方面的表现有什么评价吗？

**Ben:** 反馈。当然。我认为土地使用政策总体上是相当不错的。你知道，你可能听说过的“Yes之城”（City of Yes），这是大概70年来分区法规最大的变化。收入支持政策，你知道，我们很多住房困境，显然租金太高，价格也太高，但工资也太低了。嗯，你知道，我们需要确保人们能负担得起租金。我们需要确保人们能负担得起为新建筑融资所需的租金。而亚当斯政府一直在反对扩大代金券资金。我认为它在住房方面做得不足的地方是处理我们住房市场的结构性问题，特别是房产税系统。他们不是第一个在这个问题上做得不足的政府。但我认为这说明了亚当斯非住房政策和“课外活动”对解决房产税等结构性问题的能力产生了多大的影响。

The income support policy, so which, you know, a lot of our our housing woes are, you know, obviously the rents are are too damn high and prices are too damn high, but also wages are too damn low. Um, and you know, we need to make sure that people can afford to pay uh rents. We need to make sure that people can afford to pay the rent that it costs to finance a new new building. And the Adams administration has fought sort of the expansion of of voucher funding. Where I think it's fallen short on housing is dealing with sort of structural issues with our housing market, particularly the property tax system. And they are not the first administration to fall short on this issue. But I think it speaks to how much Adams's non-housing policies and sort of extracurricular activities have impacted his ability to address structural issues like property taxes.</p>

### 纽约市房产税制度的结构性问题

**Ben:** 纽约市的房产税系统有两个主要的分配问题。一个是像**公园坡**（Park Slope: 布鲁克林一个相对富裕的社区）这样的社区，相对于像**卡纳西**（Canarsie: 布鲁克林一个相对贫困的社区）这样的贫困社区，税收严重不足。在这些社区中，两处相同的房产支付相同的房产税。**皇冠高地**（Crown Heights: 布鲁克林一个正在经历士绅化的社区）的房产价值将是卡纳西房产的五倍，但却支付相同的房产税。另一个分配问题是多户住宅与单户住宅，或一到三户住宅。多户住宅和商业地产的税收远高于其对城市总房产税的相对价值贡献。嗯，这是一个长期存在的问题。报告接连不断，委员会也一直在说：“我们应该怎么做？”但没有人想出如何去奥尔巴尼制定一个新制度来解决这些问题，这些问题除了产生大量歧视性影响外，还严重阻碍了我们的住房生产和现有住房的运营成本。我认为现在是解决这个问题的特别成熟的时机，因为租金稳定型建筑的某个部分正面临危机，因为这些建筑的税收过高。所以我们可以看到，在最好的情况下，马姆达尼政府已经实施了租金冻结。你知道，建筑开始出现问题。马姆达尼政府不想看到这些建筑倒塌。这对租户不利。对他们的政治形象不利。嗯，对城市的形象不利。所以奥尔巴尼说：“好吧，我们将为这些租金稳定型建筑制定一个新的类别，它将降低它们的税收，这将减轻这些业主保持低租金的负担。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So New York City's property taxes property tax system has two sort of major distributional issues. One is that a neighborhood like Park Slope is way undertaxed relative to a poorer neighborhood like Canari. the same two properties paying the same amount of property taxes in those neighborhoods. The property in Crown Heights will be worth five times more and is paying the same amount of property taxes as the property in Karsi. The other distributional issue is multif family versus single family uh or one to three family and uh multif family and commercial are taxed way more than their relative value contribution to the city's total property tax role. Uh, and this is a a long-standing issue. There's been, you know, report after report and commission saying, you know, here's what we should do. And no one has sort of figured out how to go to Albany to craft a new regime that, you know, addresses these issues, which, you know, in addition to producing a lot of, you know, discriminatory impacts are really hampering our housing production and on existing housing operating costs. And I I think this is a particularly ripe time when it to address this issue because of the crisis with a certain segment of the rent stabilized buildings because these buildings are way overt taxed. So one could see you know in in a best case scenario the Mdani administration is you know it's instituted its rent rent freeze. You know buildings are starting to have trouble. The Mdani administration doesn't want to see these buildings. You know they don't want collapsing buildings. That's not good for tenants. It's not good for their their political optics. Uh it's not good for city the city's, you know, uh image. So Albany says, "All right, we're going to craft, you know, create a new class for these rent stabilized buildings, and it's going to lower their taxes, and that's going to alleviate, you know, the burden on these owners from keeping their rents very low."</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 如果利率大幅下降，房地产行业表达的这种生存担忧会消失多少？我认为会消失很多，但它仍然会非常存在。我认为它会变得不那么尖锐，但会持续存在，因为很多问题都是关于这些房地产行业与房东和租户之间，以及哪个政治派别管理纽约之间的长期冲突，即使利率降低，这些分歧也会依然存在。我认为利率会挽救一些人，增加交易量，并延迟那些陷入困境的人破产的时间，但结构性问题会依然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much of this sort of existential concern being expressed by the real estate industry goes away if interest rates come down significantly? I think a lot of it but it's still ve it would still be very much there. I think it would become acute become less acute but would persist because uh a lot of this is about these are long-standing conflicts between the real estate industry and um you know between landlords and tenants between you know what political faction runs New York and those cleavages would would remain even if interest rates are lower. I think interest rates would bail some people out and increase transaction volume and delay the the time at which someone uh that's in trouble might go bankrupt, but the structural issues would remain.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 你能很快解释一下税收差异的根源吗？或者为什么像**布鲁克林高地**（Brooklyn Heights: 布鲁克林一个历史悠久且富裕的社区）的单位相对税收不足？马姆达尼遇到了一些麻烦，因为我想他的网站上某处曾提到过“历史上的白人社区”，人们就说：“哦，他想对白人征更多的税。”然而，很多受益于这种结构的社区确实是白人居多，这是事实。但为什么某些社区的税收会不足，考虑到它们的经济基础？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you real quickly just explain the roots of the tax disparity or why say a unit in Brooklyn Heights is relatively underted? Bomb Dani got into a little bit of trouble because I think somewhere on his website at one point it said something about historically white neighborhoods and people are like, "Oh, he wants to tax white people more." It happens to be true, however, that a lot of the neighborhoods that benefit from this structure do happen to be more white. But what is the origin of why certain neighborhoods are undertaxed given their sort of like, you know, their economic base?</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 当然。所以，目前的房产税制度是在20世纪80年代初因一起法院案件而制定的，它对评估价值的增长设定了上限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So I this the current property tax regime was crafted in the early 1980s as a result of a court case and it instituted caps on the amount that assessments can increase.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">these places have seen their assessment surge</p>
</details>

**Ben:** 结果就是这样。是的。所以，像卡纳西在1982年可能是一个收入相当、中等收入、中低收入的地区，就像现在一样，而公园坡当时是一个远不如现在富裕的地区。像公园坡、**威廉斯堡**（Williamsburg: 布鲁克林一个快速士绅化的社区）以及在某种程度上像布鲁克林高地这样的地方的房产价值已经飙升，但这些房产的税负并没有相应增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as a result. Yeah. So like Canary in 1982 was maybe a comparable income, you know, middle income, lower middle income area that as it is now, whereas Park Slope was a much less well-off area than it is now. And the property values in places like Park Slope and Williamsburg and and to some degree a place like Brook Brooklyn Heights have skyrocketed, but the the tax burden on those properties have not gone up commensurately.</p>

**Tracy:** 我总是很喜欢和本聊天。我之前没有意识到这种——我的意思是，有很多有趣的地方，比如房产税差异的来源。如果你不能以一定的速度提高房产税，那么像威廉斯堡这样任何蓬勃发展的社区最终都会相对税收不足，这很有道理。是的，考虑到纽约市近期故事的很大一部分是士绅化和所有这些社区，这似乎是一个问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I always really like talking to Ben. I had not realized the sort of I mean there was a lot there that was interesting that sort of that source of the disparity in property taxes. It makes a lot of sense that if you just can't raise property taxes at a certain clip, how you know relatively undertaxed any sort of booming neighborhood such as Williamsburg will inevitably end up being. Yeah, that seems like a problem given that like a big chunk of the recent story of New York City is gentrification and all these neighborhoods where like</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 20世纪80年代一个可能只值10万美元的仓库，现在可能值1000万美元或其他什么。嗯，我认为另一个非常有趣的地方，它再次强调了我们之前讨论过的观点，那就是大型房东的竞争优势基本上在于他们可以在市政厅建立人脉，他们可以处理文书工作等等。所以，如果一个政府上台，危及了这种特定的优势，那么他们就不会喜欢它。

**Tracy:** 对吗？就像也许开发规则会更严格，但如果它们只是统一的，比如，好吧，我不知道在房地产领域怎么可能这样，但我们假设，你知道，在抽象中，你勾选了这四个框，你就被批准建造一个新的开发项目，那么直观上，嗯，是的，那会削弱大而有实力的实体所享有的相对优势，这些实体可以说“了解系统”。另一方面，当然，也许有一些小型房地产开发商真的很喜欢简化流程的想法，取消停车要求之类的东西，双楼梯与单楼梯。我不知道。我，我确实认为，你知道，如果你对马姆达尼政府将带来什么感到焦虑，你不能真正同时争辩说它会扼杀开发和租金，如果开发被扼杀，那么市场租金就会上涨。

<p class="english-text">right? like maybe the rules for development will be more stringent, but if they're just sort of uniform where it's like okay, and I don't know how it could ever be in real estate, but let's just say, you know, in the sort of abstract and you check these four boxes and you are approved to build a new development, then intuitively um yeah, that would sort of undermine the relative advantage enjoyed by a big powerful entity that sort of knows the system, so to speak. On the other hand, of course, maybe there are smaller property developers who really like the idea of a streamlined process, doing away with things like the parking requirement and stuff like that, dual staircases versus single. I don't know. I I and I do think like you can't you know if you're anxious about what uh the Mumani administration is going to bring you you can't really sim simultaneously argue that it's going to stifle development and rents right if development gets stifled then the market rents go up</p>

**Joe:** 而且，你知道，所以会有这种平衡效应。你知道，显然有一些房东深度暴露在租金稳定市场中，我们之前谈论过他们，但他们现在正在受苦。我还认为，在某个时候，也许我们应该谈谈未来几年最高法院可能审理一个案件，彻底取消租金稳定或租金管制。你知道，你提到了马姆达尼可能成为一个加速器，让这个案件在某个时候提交给最高法院的犬儒可能性，这可能会产生重大影响。

<p class="english-text">and if uh you know and so there will be this balancing effect you know obviously there are the landlords who are deeply exposed to the rent stabilized market we've talked about them before, but they're hurting right now as it is. I also do think at some point maybe we should talk about the prospect of a Supreme Court case in the next couple of years that eliminates rent stabilization or rent regulation period poss. You know, you mentioned the sort of cynical possibility of Mumani being an accelerant that gets that case in front of the Supreme Court at some point could have big implications.</p>

**Tracy:** 整个对话让我想起我需要打电话给我的管理员，修理我公寓里的一些东西。所以，这很有用。这就是我怀念租房生活的地方，我不能轻易地打电话给某人。租房有一些优势，你知道。

<p class="english-text">This entire conversation has reminded me that I need to uh call my super and get something fixed in my apartment. So, this was useful. This is what I miss about being a renter is I don't have uh someone that I can call as easily. There are some advantages. There are some advantages to being a renter, you know.</p>

**Joe:** 好的。我们就到此为止吗？

**Joe:** 实际上，我确实有一个管理员。我只是现在必须为他支付费用，而以前所有这些各种维修和东西的负担都落在我的房东身上。现在，负担……

<p class="english-text">Actually, I do have a super. I just have to pay him now for it where it used to be all these various uh repairs and stuff. The burden fell on my landlord before. Now the uh the burden</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这还不错，因为我觉得管理员最大的问题就是可用性，或者说修理东西最大的问题就是找到人并让他们上门。

<details>

<p class="english-text">that's not too bad cuz like the the big problem with supers I feel is just availability or the big problem with getting something fixed is finding someone and getting them in.</p>

**Joe:** 总之，现在每次有什么东西坏了，我都得自己掏钱。他们在你成为业主的时候可没告诉你这一点。

**Tracy:** 我很确定他们告诉了。
