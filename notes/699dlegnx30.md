title: Palantir股价突破200美元：高速增长下的估值迷思与未来展望
---

### Palantir Weekly 的演变：从每周更新到季度回顾

Amit: 大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Palantir Weekly。我们已经有一段时间没做这个节目了。Arie 今天来不了，我甚至不确定 Amir 是否能赶到。他说他会来，但他住在地球的另一端，考虑到时差，他可能真的来不了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Pounder Weekly. It has been a while since we've done Pounder Weekly. Uh Arie cannot make it today. I don't even know if Air is going to make it today. He said he would, but he lives across the world and he honestly might not be able to just given the time difference.</p>
</details>

Amit: 这也引出了我想谈的第一件事。我们已经公开说过，并且都公开讨论过，但 Palantir Weekly 未来很可能不再是每周更新了，原因有二。第一，协调每个人的日程以保证每周更新真的很难。这是生活的一部分，大家都有孩子和各种各样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which kind of speaks to the first thing I want to talk about, which is uh and we I've said this publicly already and we we talked about it all publicly, but uh Palenteer weekly is likely not going to be weekly going forward uh for two reasons. Number one, it really is hard to get the schedules to line up and get everything to go weekly. Um that's just like the product of life and people have kids and you know, all this different stuff.</p>
</details>

Amit: 第二，我也很好奇 Matt 对此的看法，那就是现在这家公司值得分析的内容不像四年前那么多了。今天它的股价突破了200美元，我们稍后会讨论这个，但我认为这本身就表明公司已经有点进入“自动驾驶”模式。虽然仍有可分析之处，但已经达不到它股价还在6美元时的那种程度了。这意味着我们可能不再需要每周都做一期节目了。所以，Matt，关于公司日趋成熟，以及内容创作者也随之成熟，你有什么总体看法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is, and I'd be curious to get Matt's thoughts on this as well, is there's not as much to analyze on the company as much as there was four years ago. It crossed $200 a share today. So, we'll talk about that, but I think that in of itself is indicative of the fact that company's a bit more on autopilot and there are things to analyze, but not to the level that it was when it was six bucks, which means you might not need a weekly episode anymore. So, Matt, any thoughts in general about the company maturing and content creators maturing with the company as well?</p>
</details>

Matt: 我觉得你说到点子上了。老实说，我要特别感谢 Arie 和 Amir，因为即使他们必须在黎明时分起床，他们的抱怨也远没有我可能会有的多。所以，在我看来他们是真正的勇士，是他们让节目得以持续。回想起来，全程报道这家公司真是一件非常愉快的事，从最初的辟谣和澄清错误信息——我认为这是我们做 Palantir Weekly 的主要原因，因为人们当时完全不明白这家公司到底在做什么——到现在，大家已经有了很多了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I think uh I think you hit it on the head. I mean to be honest uh big shout out to Arie and and Amir because even though they would had to wake up at like the break of dawn, they didn't complain nearly as much as I would have complained. So, um, so they they they're they're real troopers in my eyes and they kept it kind of going and, um, it's been it's been a blast in retrospect to really cover the company literally from discrediting in misinformation, which I think is the main reason why we were doing Palunteer Weekly is like people just really didn't understand at all what uh what the heck was going on with the company uh to now really having a lot or I guess knowledge</p>
</details>

Matt: 现在人们可以坐下来说：“好吧，这个人根本就是个黑子，或者可能是个收钱办事的政治说客。”现在很容易就能识别出这些人。而以前，信息非常匮乏，我认为人们真正能掌握和依赖的信息很少，所以任何人都可以随心所欲地引导舆论。因此，我们当时责任重大，当然不只是我们，还有公司本身也在发布优质信息，以及 Elellaniano、Chad 和所有那些人都在发布优质信息，真正帮助人们一路走来，理解其真实潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and now people can sit there and be like, "Okay, this person is literally just a hater or is probably a a paid political shill." Like they don't know anything that's going on. It's very easy to spot those people now. Whereas before there was so little information that I think people truly could grasp and hang their hat on that anybody could steer the ship in whatever way that they wanted. And so it was really relying on us to to really not us all alone of course and in tandem with the company putting out great information and Elellaniano and Chad and and all those guys putting out great information to to really help people along the way to understand the true potential.</p>
</details>

Matt: 我想现在人们都明白了。所以我同意你的看法，随着公司进入新的发展阶段，我觉得我们不必再像以前那样为社区付出那么多了。尽管人们喜欢我们每周都来谈论它，但现在已经有很多优秀的人在报道它了。我们去纽约的时候就看到了，你和我遇到了一群人，很多优秀的人一直在报道它。Amir、Arie，你知道，你不再需要一个每周的节目了。只要关注那些人，你就能得到任何你需要的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think now people get it. And so I'm I'm with you like as as the company has gotten into its its uh new stage I feel like we don't have to give as much to the community. Uh, as much as people love for us to talk about it every week, it's there's so many great people that are covering it and we saw that when we were going into New York, you and me, we met up with a group of people and so many great people that have been covering it. Um, Amir, Arie, you know, you don't necessarily need a weekly episode. Just follow those guys and you'll get whatever information that you need.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，我同意。哦，我们来自瑞典的兄弟赶到了。Amir，你好吗？

Amir: 嘿，Palantir 六月刊，我们来了。大家好吗？天啊，你们这么快就开始了。我以为我们通常会晚五分钟开始，所以是我的错。我来了，很高兴见到大家。我听到了 Matt 说的大部分内容，我完全同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I agree. And uh, well, our brother from Sweden made it. Amir, what's up? >> Hey, Palanteer six monthly. Here we are. What's up, everyone? Man, you guys rush this episode. I I thought we used to do this like five past, so my bad. I'm here. Happy to see everyone. Uh, happen to hear most of what Matt said and I can only agree.</p>
</details>

Amit: Amir，我们刚才在讨论，我们可能甚至不会每月做一期，但我们很可能会在每次财报发布后回来，我们所有人一起做一期节目，但不再是每周了。所以，关于做周播节目的必要性的演变，谈谈你的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, yeah, Amir, we were just talking about how we're going to probably not even monthly, but this we will likely be back every earnings for for a episode with all of us, not weekly anymore. So, just your thoughts on the evolution of the need to do a weekly episode.</p>
</details>

Amir: 是的，你知道，可能每一位观众在相当长的一段时间里也对 Palantir 有同样的感觉。投资论点基本上保持不变。Palantir 达到我们认为他们最终能够达到的位置的速度，我的意思是，他们可能超出了包括我在内的所有人的预期。但你知道，当投资论点开始应验时，在某种程度上感觉就像进入了自动驾驶模式。当然，你必须持续追踪公司，确保他们在正确的轨道上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, you know, um, probably every viewer as well felt it for quite a while at Palanteer. really the the thesis has largely remained the same. The pace of uh how quickly Palanteer actually reached where we thought that they ultimately would be able to reach. I mean they probably blew past everyone's expectations including mine. But you know when when the thesis starts to play out it kind of feels sort of autopilot in a way. Of course, you have to keep track of the company, make sure that they're on on the right track, but</p>
</details>

Amir: 但是，为 Palantir 做一期周播节目，尤其是当他们自己也不再觉得有同样的需求去证明自己时……你知道，在过去，他们会发布所有这些频繁的新闻稿。有很多东西需要去发掘，去理解每个 Palantir 产品的功能。有很多东西可以深入研究。但最近，我相信很多人都有同样的感觉，就是我们好像在谈论同样的事情。也许股价创了新高，感觉像是每两周发生一次。所以我们会谈论股价，对估值发表一些评论，但说实话，并没有太多实质性的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, doing a weekly episode for Palanteer, especially when they themselves didn't really feel the same need to prove themselves. You know, in historically, they would have all these uh frequent press releases. There was a lot to try to uncover, try to understand what each Palunteer product does. like uh there was a lot to dig into, but you know, as of late, I'm I'm sure um a lot of people felt the same way that well, we're kind of talking about the same things. Maybe the stock reached a new all-time high. It felt like like bi-weekly. Uh so, so we would talk about the stock price. We would, you know, give some comments about the valuation, but you know, there wasn't really much meat to to the bone, so to speak.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以我认为这样做很有道理。我的意思是，即使最初的想法是，好吧，每周可能有点太频繁了，那么每月怎么样？但即使是每月一次，情况也差不多。所以我认为现在的安排很有道理，比如改成季度性的，或者如果发生什么大事，我们可以做一期节目来讨论。你知道，随机应变，当有东西可谈，有价值可提供，有事情需要社区一起讨论时，那么聚在一起谈论它就有意义了。但仅仅为了做周播节目而做，已经没有同样的需求了。我的意思是，我们都知道，Amit 在他的节目里几乎每天都在报道 Palantir。我相信 Matt 也经常发表评论。我也一样，就像 Matt 在我加入之前说的那样。所以对我来说，这样做非常有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I think it makes a lot of sense. I mean even you know the first idea was to you know okay well weekly might be a bit too much how about monthly but even on a monthly basis I mean it's still kind of the same thing so I think this makes a lot of sense that would make it like quarterly maybe if something big happens you you know we can do an episode to discuss that you know just do it you know play it by ear like when when there's something to talk about when there is value to provide when there's stuff to discuss as a community then it makes sense you know to um uh get together and talk about it, but just, you know, making the weekly episodes. There's simply not the same need for it. I mean, we all, you know, Amit covers, I'm sure, Palanteer like daily anyway on his show. I'm sure um Matt gives out comments frequently. I I do that as well, just like Matt was talking about before I joined in. So, to me, it it makes a lot of sense to do it this way.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的。是的，尽管我会想念和你们这么频繁地交谈。

Matt: 但你不会想念早起。所以这很合理。这对你和 Arie 来说是个很大的负担，但你们俩在过去一年半里几乎每次都出席，这证明了这段旅程是多么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah, even though I'll miss um talking to you guys so often, but >> you're not going to whis up making up. You're not going to miss waking up early, which you know, so it's like it makes sense. It was a big burden on you and Arie, but the fact that you showed up basically for the past year and a half, both of you, it's a testament to how much this journey has mattered. Um,</p>
</details>

### 股价突破200美元：里程碑与市场情绪

Amit: 好了，各位。让我们进入正题。在财报发布前，今天是个大日子。Palantir 股价达到200美元。我甚至不知道该如何形容。感觉就像是突然发生的。就连100美元也感觉像是突然发生的，然后100美元就变得常态化了。我想我们先从你开始吧，Matt。当你看到这个价格时，你的反应是什么？对于一只现在股价200美元、市值接近半万亿美元的股票，你是怎么看的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all right, folks. Let's get into it. Big day as we head into earnings. Palenteer $200 a share. I don't even know how to describe it. I mean, kind of felt like it just happened. Even a hundred just felt like it happened. Then a hundred got normalized. I mean, I guess we'll start with you, Matt. Like, what was your reaction when you saw this? And how are you thinking of a stock now that is uh $200 a share and reaching half a trillion in market cap?</p>
</details>

Matt: 我的意思是，这太疯狂了。对我来说，这是一个里程碑，因为我最初在2020年9月购买 Palantir 时，我的牛市情景预测就是5000亿美元的市值。现在，显然那个目标已经移动了，但最初5000亿美元的市值感觉像是，哦，你知道，1500亿、2500亿，也许5000亿，那将需要很长时间，它最终会在2035年中期左右达到。它将不得不证明自己。而现在它只用了我预期的大约三分之一的时间就做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, it's um it's insane. I mean I when I first purchased it's kind of a milestone um for me because my bullcase when I was first kind of purchasing Palunteer back in September 2020 was like a $500 billion market cap at that point. Right now, obviously that target has moved, but initially it was like a a $500 billion market cap was like, oh, two, you know, 150, 250, maybe 500, right? It's going to take forever and uh it'll eventually get there, you know, by mid 2035 or something like that. It's going to have to prove itself and just it's just obviously took uh about a third of the amount of time that I was really expecting it to.</p>
</details>

Matt: 我认为部分原因是人们看到了它的真正潜力，机构也真正看到了它能为企业软件做什么。但我也认为，它正在并继续证明自己是经济和其支柱的重要组成部分。而且我认为，随着2026年和2027年数据和交易的公布，这种情况只会愈发明显。我的意思是，这家公司持续合作的政治领导人数量之多，简直令人难以置信。所以对我来说，我们达到这个水平是完全合理的，而且，现在知道了正在发生的一些事情和一些交易，这并不那么可怕了。这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you know partly I think is because the people see the true potential of it and you know institutions uh really see what what it can do for enterprise software but I think also it is in it continues to demonstrate itself to be a huge part of the economy and the backbone and I think it's only going to get even more so uh as as numbers get released and deals get released in 26 and 27. I mean, just the amount of political leaders that the company just continues to work with, it's insane. So, to me, it makes complete sense um that we're here and, you know, not not uh not that scary now that I know some of the things that have been going on and some of the deals. It just it's insane.</p>
</details>

Amit: Amir，同样的问题给你。你知道，你是一直帮助我们理解估值的人，你真正懂得 Excel 表格、**DCF**（Discounted Cash Flow: 现金流折现法，一种通过预测公司未来现金流并将其折现到当前价值来评估公司价值的方法）等等。我想我们所有人在过去一年半里都感到谦卑，因为在某个时刻我们都同意，嘿，这东西变得太贵了，然而它还在继续变贵。增长也在继续上升。但如果股价持续上涨，增长也持续上升，你知道，估值倍数仍在扩大而不是下降，因为归根结底，市值的增长速度与公司增长速度相比是指数级的，所以现在它的市销率仍然超过100倍。你是如何看待市值和估值的？你是否已经放弃了“嘿，也许它太贵了”这种想法，因为他们已经将增长故事证明到了让你相信他们会继续增长以匹配估值的程度？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Amir, uh same question to you. And you know you have been someone who's really helped us understand valuation. You are someone who really understands Excel sheets, DCFs, etc. Uh I think all of us got humbled over the past year and a half because at some point all of us agreed, hey this thing is getting expensive and it well it continues to get expensive. the growth continues to go up. But if the stock continues to grow up and the growth continues to go up, you know, the multiple still expands versus comes down because at the end of the day, the the rate of growth of the market cap is so exponential compared to the rate of growth of the company that you know now it continues to trade above 100 times sales. How are you thinking of the market cap, the valuation, and have you kind of given up on this whole idea of saying, "Hey, maybe it's too expensive because they've proved the growth story to such an extent that you just believe they're going to keep growing into it."</p>
</details>

Amir: 你知道，这在很大程度上是一次令人谦卑的经历。而且我认为，今天在听的各位，你们在投资生涯中不会经常，甚至可能再也不会经历这样的事情。感觉就像昨天 Palantir 的市值还是500亿美元，现在我们已经超过了半万亿美元，正朝着万亿美元迈进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, it is quite a humbling experience in a in a big way. And I I I don't think that many like everyone listening today, I don't think you will experience something like this like very often or perhaps even ever again in your investing lifetime. You know, it felt like it was yesterday that Palanteer was like $50 billion market cap. Now we are past half a trillion like well on our way to that one trillion.</p>
</details>

Amir: 当我说这是一次令人谦卑的经历时，是因为内在价值评估的运作方式是，每当你获得一个理由时，你就需要重新评估这家企业。对于 Palantir 来说，过去的每个季度，我这边的内在估值都在指数级增长。我的意思是，在上个季度财报之前，我的公允价值大约是75美元，而当时股价在130、140美元，甚至接近150美元。然后第二季度财报出来了，Karp 就像在说，是的，我们将在五年内将美国收入增长10倍。你就会想，天啊，好吧，这对内在价值意味着什么？仅仅一个季度，我的内在价值就几乎翻倍到了135美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now when I say humbling experience is because the way intrinsic valuation works is that you need to revalue the business every time you're given a reason to Palunteer like each quarter that has been passing like the intrinsic valuation on my end has just like been exponentially increasing. I mean, prior to last quarter's earnings, my fair value was something like 75 and we were trading like at 130 um 140, you know, pushing 150. Q2 earnings come out come out and corp is like, yeah, we're going to 10x like US revenues like in five years. And you're like, damn, okay, what does that mean for, you know, intrinsic value? And my intrinsic value almost doubled to 135 just just in a quarter.</p>
</details>

Amir: 而即使在那个季度之前，你知道，第一季度的75美元，也比前一个季度增长了很多。所以每个季度过去，Palantir 都在不断证明所有人是错的。我的预期，我相信华尔街很多人的预期都太低了。这家公司的执行速度比任何人预期的都要快得多。所以，当每个季度过去，你几乎将估值翻倍时，这确实是相当 humbling 的，因为你学到了太多新东西，你有了新的、更高的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And even prior to that quarter, you know, 75, you know, as of Q1, it also like increased a lot like from the quarter prior. So each quarter that that passes, Palanteer just, you know, keeps proving everyone wrong. Like that my expectation, I'm sure a lot of people on Wall Street expectations are just simply too low. Uh like uh the company is executing at a way faster pace than you know anyone really expected. So it's it's it's quite humbling when you know each quarter that passes you like almost double the the valuation each quarter because you learn so much new you get new and higher expectations</p>
</details>

Amir: 而这些期望，如果我们倒退两个季度，人们会说，是的，我们对这家公司期望很高，因为正如你提到的，它一直都很贵。在相当长的一段时间里，我们都觉得，嗯，可能很贵，市盈率很高，市销率也很高。公允价值可能远低于股价。但市场让我们所有人都谦卑了。市场实际上可能一直在让 Palantir 在其真实公允价值附近交易。只是我们都落后了。我们只是还没看到而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and those expectations like if if we just rewind like two quarters people would have said that like yeah we're expecting a lot from this business because you know as you mentioned it's been expensive like all throughout you know for quite a while we we all felt like h probably expensive the P is up there the price to sales is up there. Fair value is probably, you know, way below where the stock code is. But the market humbled all of us. You know, the the market has actually probably been giving Palunteer, you know, letting it trade around, you know, what is actual fair value. It's just that we're all trailing it. You know, we we just don't see it yet.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以我认为这个季度可能也会类似，我提高了对公司的期望，但如果我仍然过于悲观，并且不得不再次修正我的公允价值，我也不会感到惊讶。正如我提到的，目前它大约是135美元，这是基于 Karp 自己的引述所带来的大量增长。但是，是的，我的意思是，这家公司在这方面相当神奇，你永远不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think this quarter might be similar where you know um I raised my expectations from the company but I wouldn't be surprised if I'm still you know way too bearish and I would have to revise my fair value again. So as as I mentioned as of right now it is around 135 and that is like by a lot of growth you know given Karp's own quotes but yeah I mean this company is quite magical in that sense you like you never know like even um</p>
</details>

Amir: 就像，你知道，我敢肯定我们稍后会谈到，但如果你回顾一年前，人们会告诉你，是的，Databricks 会抢走 Palantir 的生意，以及所有这些事情。然后你会发现，不，这实际上是一个完全不同的竞争领域，实际上这些公司都想和 Palantir 合作。而现在这已经发生了，你知道，与 Databricks 的合作，与 Snowflake 的合作，这是另一个在早期被认为会抢走 Palantir 生意的公司。这些公司根本不是同一类型的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like seeing uh you know I'm sure we we're going to get get into it but you know if you go back like a year ago people would would have told you yeah data bricks is going to eat Palanteer's lunch and like all of these things and then you're like no it's not actually a completely different different playing field actually these people all want to partner up with Palunteer and that is what what has happened now you know the data bricks partnership snowflake partnership another one that that was going to you know eat Palanteer's lunch if we go back to the early days like these aren't given like the same kind of companies so yeah</p>
</details>

### 估值之谜：为何传统指标在Palantir身上失效？

Amit: 是的，我认为这是一个公平的观点。我有五个简单的理由来解释为什么我认为估值会以这种方式持续扩大。第一，OpenAI 市值万亿，却不盈利。它是一家基础模型公司，可能商品化。而 Palantir 被视为人工智能在现实世界中的实际应用案例。所以华尔街会想，嘿，如果 OpenAI 能值一万亿，那么 Palantir 可能也得有个差不多的估值，也许不是一万亿，但肯定……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah I think it's a fair point I have like five simple reasons why I think the valuation has continued to expand the way it has. Number one, OpenAI is worth a trillion, not profitable. Foundation model company, potentially commodity. Uh, Pounder is seen as the actual use cases for AI in the real world. So, the street's like, hey, if OpenAI gets a trillion, then Pounder probably has to get something that's maybe not a trillion, but definitely</p>
</details>

Amir: 那个万亿是从哪来的？是现在预期的 IPO 估值吗？因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Where's the the trillion from? Is that like the expected IPO now? Because the race</p>
</details>

Amit: 哦，是的。是的，抱歉，我就是这个意思。是的，我就是这个意思。OpenAI 现在是5000亿，但当他们上市时，估值将不得不在万亿左右。所以我猜华尔街是这么看的。但你知道，当 Palantir 是1000亿时，OpenAI 是3500亿。所以现在 Palantir 正在追赶它。但是的，我猜 OpenAI 的预期价值显然在万亿级别，而你会认为 Palantir 更有价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's Sorry, that's what I meant to say. Yeah, that's what I meant to say. OpenAI is 500 billion but whenever they go public it will have to be at around that trillion dollar range. So I guess the streets kind of come like that but you know OpenAI was 350 billion when Palenter was 100 billion. So now Pounder is catching up to it but yeah I guess the expected value of OpenAI obviously is in the trillions and you would argue Palunteer is more valuable.</p>
</details>

Amit: 第二是期权市场。我知道我几个月前谈过这个，但期权市场的流动性非常大，Palantir 是全球整个股票市场中交易量排名前十的股票，每天都是如此。我们说的是每天至少有100万份看涨和看跌期权交易。所以当有这么多人交易这只股票本身时，股价就会有一个底部，因为会有很多人准备抄底，然后同时卖出或买入看跌和看涨期权。所以从这个角度来看，我认为从算法上讲，这只股票在散户和机构投资者社区中获得了如此大的影响力，从而导致了持续的势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is the option market. So, I know I was talking about this a couple months ago, but the amount of liquidity in options, Palunteer is a top 10 traded stock in the entire stock market globally every single day. We're talking about minimum of a million calls and puts traded. So, when you have that many people just trading the name in and of itself, there's going to be a floor to the stock because there's going to be a lot of people ready to buy the dip and then ready to sell or put puts and calls on it uh simultaneously. So from that perspective I think algorithmically the name has gotten such a big presence in the community for investors retail and institutional that has led to the sustained momentum.</p>
</details>

Amit: 第三点是基于此的延伸，如果现在出现下跌，人们就会想买入。所以如果它从200美元跌到180美元，有人可能会说180美元仍然非常激进，但人们会买入，就像当 Citron 说他们做空时，它从180美元跌到142美元一样。我不知道，他们过去几个月什么也没说，但是当那次下跌发生时，人们买了，而且是积极地买入。所以我认为现在这只股票也有一种特斯拉、英伟达那样的态度，如果你遇到下跌，就会有人垂涎欲滴地等待获得敞口的机会，这就为价格创造了一个底部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh number three piggyback piggybacks off that if there is a dip now people want to buy right so if it falls from 200 to 180 like one could argue 180 is still really aggressive but people will buy just like when it fell from 180 to 142 when Citron said they were short and I don't know they haven't said anything in the past couple months now but uh when that dip happened people bought and people bought aggressively so I think now the name also has kind of that Tesla Nvidia type of attitude towards it where if you get a dip you have people that are just salivating for the opportunity to get exposure and that creates a floor to the price.</p>

Amit: 第四个原因，他们比所有人都增长得快，对吧？这是地球上唯一一家为第三季度指引了50%增长，并为2026年指引了45%增长的 **SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）公司。没有其他 SaaS 公司，我想最快的是一些网络安全公司，大约32%，但没有一家增长这么快。我的意思是，在某种程度上，我们第三季度的增长速度可能比英伟达的增长速度还要快。你知道，规模不同，但关键是在人工智能时代，如果增长是最重要的，而 Palantir 能够维持这种增长，尤其是考虑到他们的自由现金流利润率，它很可能会继续获得溢价。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Fourth reason, they're growing faster than everybody, right? So, this is the only SAS company on the planet that has guided 50% growth for Q3 and 45% growth for 2026. No other SAS company, I think the fastest you have is like 32% by some of the cyber security names, but none of them are growing this fast. I mean, there's a world in which we could grow faster in Q3 than Nvidia grows faster. and you know it's a different scale but the point is in the age of AI if growth is what matters and counter can sustain it especially with their free cash flow margins um it will likely continue getting the the premium</p>
</details>

Amit: 最后，Karp 与波兰人士会面，Karp 与乌克兰人士会面。我的意思是，在国际上，他的品牌水平和他已经成为的摇滚明星，Palantir 从世界领导人、政府、机构、美国商业客户，现在还有国际商业客户那里获得的入站需求，这也为股票增加了溢价。人们想押注于一位领导者。Karp 的自传将在一周后出版。我实际上采访了这本自传的作者，那个视频明天会在我的频道上发布。但事实上，真的有关于这个人的书在写，这会增加溢价。我认为，归根结底，任何公司的股价都是某人愿意为其支付的价格。如果除了增长之外还有所有这些其他原因——而增长本身已经令人难以置信——这就解释了为什么人们愿意为其支付。这就是为什么你今天看到了这样的股价。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and then finally Karp's meeting with people in Poland carps meeting with people in Ukraine I mean just internationally the level of his brand and the the rockstar that he has become the amount of inbound that Palanter is getting from world leaders governments institutions US commercial clients now international commercial clients that also adds the premium to the talk. People want to bet on a leader. Karp has an autobiography coming out in a week. I actually interviewed the author of the autobiography and that video will come out on my channel tomorrow. But like the fact that there are literally books being written about this guy, it's going to add a premium. And I think again the stock price at the end of the day of any company is how much someone is willing to pay for it. And if there's all these other reasons besides just the growth, which the growth is incredible, that adds to why people are willing to pay for it. That's why you've got the stock trading today.</p>
</details>

Amir: 是的，我经常在这些节目中提到，但我认为 Palantir 是终极的动量股，因为它已经有将近一年半的时间没有任何负面催化剂了。每一件事都对公司超级超级积极。每一条新闻出来，每一次财报都比上一次好。所有围绕公司的新闻都是一个接一个的积极催化剂，没有任何东西拖累这家公司，这就是为什么我相信它能够持续创下新高。所以我认为这也对我们能如此迅速地达到200美元起到了很大的作用。我想没有人真的预料到 Palantir 在这个时候会达到200美元，但是，是的，一年半以来一直都是积极的消息，那么一段时间后，你就会达到这种定价倍数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mentioned it, you know, quite often on on these episodes, but I think like Palanteer is the ultimate momentum stock because it's been, you know, almost like a year and a half now where there's like no negative catalyst attached to the name. Like every single thing is just like super super positive for the company. Like every news that comes out like each earnings is is is better than than the last. all the news surrounding the company like this just like positive catalyst after positive catalyst like there there hasn't been anything like tying this company down which is why I believe like it was able to reach like all these new highs continuously like uh so I think that also plays a big um you know part part of how we were able to reach 200 so quickly I don't think anyone really expected Valentine to be at 200 by this point you know uh but yeah you all positive news all the time for like a year and a half, then yeah, you you reach these kind of pricing multiples, you know, after a while.</p>
</details>

Amir: 你知道，对于这种超高速增长的公司，估值倍数并不真正适用，历史上也从未适用过。所以试图用市盈率来合理化，比如，让我看看，目前 Palantir 的市盈率是665倍，市销率是150倍。这些都是基于过去12个月的数据。即使你展望一年后，使用那些历史上被证明过于悲观的分析师预期，它仍然说不通，因为公司正在以50%的速度增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look, the the thing with with multiples is that you know they don't really work for this kind of hyperrowth company and they've never done it uh you know historically either. So trying to rationalize like uh let me see currently Palanteer is trading at 665 times PE 150 times price to sales. Now those are you know looking at a trailing 12 months. Even if you look a year out with you know uh analyst expectations that have been proving you know too pessimistic historically it will still not make sense because the company's growing at 50% like</p>
</details>

Amir: 这些倍数，它们增长得太快了，以至于市盈率是600、500还是400都无关紧要，这些都很贵。如果 Palantir 股价减半，市盈率降到300，那仍然很贵。所以你不能用倍数来合理化这类公司。你可以通过做估值来合理化它，你看看，好吧，这家公司在未来10年里会做什么。哦，我的意思是，我们目前最好的猜测是什么，然后你就可以开始理解它了，因为你在看它们在遥远的未来会做什么，然后你把它带回到今天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">these multiples you know they um they grow just too quickly where like it doesn't really matter if the uh PE is 600 500 400 like these are all expensive like if if Palanteer was you know cut in half at 300 PE that will still be expensive. So you can't rationalize this kind of company by u the multiples. You can rationalize it you know uh by doing an evaluation where you look okay what is this company going to be doing for the you know next 10 years. Oh I mean what's our best guess as of right now and then you can start to make sense of it because you're looking at okay what are they going to do you know far out into the future and and you know you bring it back today.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以在估值方面，你可以试着看看 Palantir 的价值，但当你试图用市盈率和市销率来定价时，对于这类公司来说永远说不通。历史上，你无法购买任何这些超级大公司，今天的十大、五大公司，当它们处于这个阶段时，因为它们都有昂贵的倍数，也许程度不同，但同时，哪家公司在如此规模下还能以50%的速度持续增长，同时提高利润率？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So valuation wise you can try to you know see okay what is palunteer work but when you try to price it you know with the PE and and price of sales it will never make sense for this kind of company historically you you wouldn't be able to buy any of these you know uh super large you know to today's you know top 10 top five companies when when they were in in this phase because they all had expensive multiples may maybe not to to this degree but at the same time like which company was expected to grow you um continuously at 50% at this size, you know, while improving margin.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以，你可以为定价中的溢价是否合理提出各种论点。但即使你把股价减半，它仍然说不通。你必须让它下跌80%，才能让它说得通。我想即使是最大的空头也会同意，Palantir 的价值可能比它下跌80%到一个市盈率合理的水平要高。在 Palantir，定价在一段时间内是说不通的。所以，过度关注它对我来说没有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, you can make all these arguments for is the premium in the pricing justified or not. But even like if you cut the stock price in half, it still doesn't make sense. Like you would have to, you know, drop it by 80% to, you know, kind of make sense of it. And I think even the biggest bears would agree that yeah, Palunteer is probably worth more than if it was, you know, going to drop 80% to a place where the PE makes sense. You know, pricing will not make sense for a while in Palunteer. So, you know, hyperfocusing on it doesn't really make sense to me.</p>
</details>

Amir: 现在，如果你告诉我你对公司进行了估值，你看了，好吧，这是我对业务、增长、现金流以及与该增长和现金流相关的风险的期望。然后你告诉我，“是的，我认为它值这个价。”然后你试着围绕它进行推理，那么我们可以进行一次真正的对话。但如果你的论点只是，“是的，市盈率太高了。”那么，对于这类公司来说，这在很长一段时间内都说不通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you tell me that you value the company and you looked at, okay, here are my expectations for the business, you know, for the growth, cash flow, and risk associated with that growth and cash flows. and then you tell me, "Yeah, I think it's worth this." And then you try to, you know, reason around it, then we can have an actual conversation. But if if your argument is just like, "Yeah, the P is too high." Well, like it won't make sense for this kind of company, not for a long while yet.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以，这类投资者，他们总是存在的，他们试图理解定价，是的，这只股票不适合你。这并不是生活在泡沫中。这只是业务的机制处于这个阶段。对于任何处于这个规模、以这个速度增长的公司来说，这永远说不通。定价对你来说永远说不通，这没关系。如果你不是那种看到高市盈率就感到不舒服，而不愿深入研究的投资者，那么这只股票根本不适合你。请记住，定价只是近期的或过去12个月的，它无法捕捉到 Palantir 的整个增长叙事。为此，你需要对其进行估值，而那是完全不同的。无论如何，我是这么看的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, those kind of investors, you know, they will always exist where they, you know, try to make sense of the pricing and yeah, the the the the stock is is not for you. And that's not like living in bubble territory. It's just like the mechanics of the business in is in this stage. It will not make sense like ever for any company that's you know at this size growing you know at this space like the pricing will will never make sense for you and and it's fine like if you're not the kind of investor that's comfortable you know by looking at a high PE and not really beyond that then you know the stock is simply not not for you. Keep in mind like pricing is just near-term or like uh trailing 12 months like it won't capture the whole growth narrative of Palanteer. For that you need to value it and that's completely different. That's that's the way I view it. Anyway,</p>
</details>

Amit: 我认为这是一个非常好的观点。我认为你刚才说的最重要的一点是，如果你把 Palantir 的市盈率减半，从600降到300，那仍然是一只非常昂贵的股票，市盈率是300倍。所以这几乎变成了数字无关紧要。我这么说不是为了贬低看那些倍数的复杂性，而是想说，对于一家超高速增长的公司，特斯拉、亚马逊都是非常明显的例子，倍数总是看起来很激进，但如果公司真的能够实现增长，情况就会改变，叙事也会改变，然后显然公司可以成长到匹配那些估值。在 Palantir 的商业生命周期中，某个时候它会变得非常成熟。它将无法像今天这样增长，但这并不意味着在那些早期增长的日子里，因为无法预见未来会怎样而购买它是一家糟糕的公司。它还低估了 Palantir 在未来十年可能推出的所有创新、所有研发、所有新产品，而我们很多人对此还一无所知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think that's a really good point. I think the the most important thing you said right there is like if you were to cut the pounder PE in half and it goes from 600 to 300, that's a pretty expensive stock trading at three 300 times earnings. So it almost becomes like the numbers are irrelevant. And it's like it's not to say that to undermine the sophistication of looking at those multiples, but it's rather to say on a hyperrowth company and Tesla, Amazon, these are very clear examples of it. Uh the multiple always seems aggressive, but if the company actually is able to put up the growth, things change, narrative changes, and then obviously the companies can grow into those valuations. And over the life cycle of Palun's business, at some point it's going to become very mature. It's not going to be able to grow like it's growing today, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad company to buy in those early days of growing based on not being able to see what the future is going to entail. It also discounts all the innovation, all the R&D, all the new products Pounder might be able to come out with over the next decade that, you know, a lot of us don't even know about yet.</p>
</details>

### 业绩前瞻：Q3增长预期与关键指标

Amit: 好了，让我们进入财报部分。公司指引的收入约为10.3亿或10.8亿美元。我会查一下确切数字。华尔街预计是10.9亿美元。这将是大约50%的增长，确切地说是50%的增长。我想我们就从这里开始。Amir，交给你。你认为 Palantir 会交出怎样的成绩单？你最关心哪些数字？现在股价在财报前上涨了大约20美元，你对财报前的价格走势怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, agreed. All right, so let's get into earnings. Uh the company is guided for about 1.03 or 08 billion in revenue. I'll get the exact number. The street's expecting 1.09. So that would be about 50% growth. Uh, exactly 50% growth. And so I guess we'll start with there. Amir, I'll give it to you. Um, what do you think Palanteer is going to put up? What numbers are you the most concerned about? And now that the stock has made a run of about 20 bucks before the earnings, how are you thinking of the price going into?</p>
</details>

Amir: 嗯，我想，感觉你好像在给我抛软球。我感觉像是在低估，但我预计他们会做到11.2亿。所以这大概是54.5%的增长。这个拆分是6.2亿政府业务，5亿商业业务。但你知道，这是基于预期**净收入留存率**（Net Dollar Retention: 衡量现有客户收入增长的关键指标，计算方式为（期初收入 + 升级收入 - 降级收入 - 流失收入）/ 期初收入）将达到130%，这意味着这54%的增长中有30%来自现有客户。所以整个可扩展性仍然扮演着重要角色，并在某种意义上给你带来了很多“免费”的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh well, I think maybe like it kind of feels like uh you're kind of like uh softball balling it like me. Uh I I feel like I'm softballing but I I have them doing 112. So that's like 54.5ish and um like the split is uh 620 government 500 commercial but you know that is you know by expecting that net dollar retention is going to reach you know 130% which means that you know 30% of these 54 are like from existing customers. So like the whole scalability is still like playing a major part and gives you a lot of like kind of free growth in in in that sense.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以我预计他们会做到11.2亿，54.5%的增长，感觉有点低估了，但这仍然是我的预测。我们知道，历史上 Palantir 在给出指引时，他们几乎是保证能超过的，而且通常会超出不少。所以11.5亿可能太低了，但这就是我的预测。但这仍然非常令人印象深刻，54.5%的增长，而且正如我提到的，这是基于130%的净留存率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I have doing 112 54.5 kind of feels low lowballing it but uh that's still um you know where I'm at. Uh and we know historically Palanteer kind of um when when they give out their guidance they're like kind of guaranteed to beat it and quite often by quite a margin. So 115 maybe too low but that's where where I'm at. But that's still like really impressive 54.5 and that is as I mentioned off off the back of you know net retention of 130%.</p>
</details>

Amir: 如果他们能保持目前的营业利润率——我实际上期望他们能提高——那将意味着**40法则**（Rule of 40: SaaS公司的一个关键绩效指标，即增长率与利润率之和应大于40%）得分将首次超过100。我们都一直在开玩笑，甚至 Karp 自己也说，“是的，我们应该把40法则改名为80法则，然后是90法则。”我认为他们这个季度实际上会超过100。所以这就是我对那些主要数字的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which also if they just retain their current operating margins which I actually expect them to you know improve that would mean a rule of 40 score surpassing 100 like for the for the first time. You know, we're all been like memeing about even Karp himself like, "Yeah, we should rename the rule of 40 to rule of 80, then rule of 90." I think they're going to actually surpass 100 this quarter. So, that's uh where I'm at with those, you know, major numbers.</p>
</details>

Amir: 但我真正期待的一个数字实际上是客户数量的增长。我认为这可能是现有客户首次实现三位数的增长。所以如果他们这个季度能增加超过100个客户，那将是我非常兴奋的主要数字，因为我们已经知道他们如何扩展现有客户，尤其是现在有了AI，有了FD的推出，所有这些他们一直在发布的新AI代理。所以，现有客户的可扩展性可能已经存在，因此追踪新增客户数量仍然是第一位的指标。如果他们能做到100个新增客户，并且40法则得分达到100，那就相当高了。但是，是的，我实际的收入数字是54.5%左右，也就是11.2亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the one the one number that I'm really looking forward to is actually uh the customer count growth. I think this might be the first triple digit increase in uh existing customers. So if they can do more more than 100 added customers for this quarter then that's like the main number that I'm very very hyped about because we already know how they're able to scale their current customers you know with the especially now with you know AI um FD is coming out all of these new AI agents that they've been unveiling so you know scalability is probably there with existing customers so it remains like the number one metric to track like how many new customers can they add and if they can do hundred and then 100 rule of 40 then pretty high but yeah my actual revenue numbers 54.5ish which is 1.12</p>
</details>

Amit: Matt，同样的问题给你，你有什么预期？在你回答之前，我只想说，我认为 Palantir 财报持续超预期的原因之一是，他们给出的收入指引是10.87亿，基本上就是10.9亿，而华尔街的预期是10.909亿。这和很多公司不一样。很多公司会给出一个指引，然后华尔街会对他们能达到的业绩过于热情，因为华尔街知道公司倾向于给出比实际能达到的更低的指引，所以他们会提高预期，这意味着公司必须超过那个预期。我想在过去七个季度里，华尔街几乎没有真正提高过对公司指引的预期，因为他们每次都觉得，他们不可能真的以他们所说的速度加速增长，他们不想变得太乐观，然后 Palantir 大幅超出预期，股价就疯涨，因为感知就是现实，而当 Palantir 超额交付时，对增长的预期或感知最终与现实不符。所以 Matt，你认为我们在进入第三季度时会再次看到这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Matt same question to you what are you expecting and before you go I just want to say I think one of the reasons Pounder keeps beating on earnings is that they guided revenue of 1.087 which is basically 1.09 the street has them at 1.09 09. And this is not the same for a lot of companies. Companies will give out a guide and then the street will be overly enthusiastic about uh what they can put up because the street knows that companies tend to go lower than what they can put up and they raise the estimate which means the company has to beat the estimate. I think almost for the past seven quarters, the street has not really raised the estimate against what the company guided because every time they kept thinking there's no way they're going to be able to actually accelerate at the level that they say they will and they don't want to get too optimistic and then pounder beats by a wide margin and the stock goes crazy because perception is reality and the expectation or the perception of the growth ends up not being reality when pounder overdelivers. So Matt, do you think that is something we could get again going into Q3?</p>
</details>

Matt: 我想是的。我的意思是，我认为他们持续地知道自己的位置，并且他们想有意识地超越分析师的预期。所以我认为他们总是试图保持合理，而且我认为，令他们自己也感到惊讶的是，他们在季度内看到了很多效率的提升。我知道能做的事情不多。如果你想一下，季度业绩是提前几年就定好的。你正在做的事情，你必须提前几个季度就开始布局，当然也有一些小的调整可以做，让一些数字提前一点。所以我感觉他们总是对数字的样子有很好的把握。正如我们所看到的，这不是一个非常周期性的业务。这是一个非常基于订阅的业务。所以你可以很早就看到事情的轨迹，如果事情按预期发展的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think so. I mean, I'm I'm thinking that they continually know where they're at and they want to knowingly beat analyst expectations. Um, and so I think that they always try to be reasonable and I think to their own surprise, I think they see a lot of efficiency gains in quarter. And I know there's a lot to there's there's not a lot you can do. The quarters are baked in years ahead of time if you think about it. like the things that you're doing, you have to set in motion quarters upon quarters ahead of time and and there are some small tweaks that you can do to make some numbers uh come forward a little bit. But so I feel like they always have a very good grasp as to what the numbers look like. And as we've kind of seen, it's not a very cyclical business. It's a very, you know, subscriptionbased business. So you can kind of see where things are trajectory, the trajectory of things very far in advance if if things come in as expected.</p>
</details>

Matt: 我个人认为我们将迎来一个收入增长52%的季度。给大家一些数据，信不信由你，去年同期的收入是7.25亿美元。我预计我们将达到11亿美元，这想起来都觉得疯狂，但这是可能的。我同意 Arie 的看法，他发布了一些东西，具体来说，他好像也认为会超过50%。肯定是以5开头的数字，但我同意他，我很好奇利润率会如何表现，因为上个季度的现金流运营利润率和收入利润率等等都表现得非常强劲，而我习惯于看到它有点波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I personally am thinking that we're going to have a 52% revenue growth quarter. Um, so to give people some some notes, I think we were at seven, believe it or not, 725 million uh in the year ago quarter. I'm thinking we're going to get to 1.1 billion uh which is crazy to even think about, but possible. The things I think I agree with Arie, he he posted something specifically like he he also I think was sinking north of 50%. Definitely a five handle, but I'm with him. I'm I'm curious to see how the margins show up because the cash flow ops margin and the income margin and everything showed up so strong last quarter and I'm used to seeing it kind of waver a little bit.</p>
</details>

Matt: 所以，我很好奇它们是否能保持在现有水平，因为上个季度让我大吃一惊的是，我们在现金流利润率方面进入了一个新领域。我们在运营利润率方面也进入了一个新领域，我想分别是54%和46%，或者反过来。我的想法是，如果这能维持下去，那么我对公司及其市值的轨迹就需要重新调整了，因为我一直认为我们最多也就达到40-45%。但如果我们已经处于公司发展的这个初期阶段，而且他们甚至还没有真正开始优化那些东西，那么你可能会看到自由现金流利润率增长到50%中期和60%高位。那样的话，你谈论的是，嘿，当你达到每年100亿美元的运行率时，你谈论的可能是50到60亿美元的自由现金流。我们已经知道这是一个非常轻资本的业务。所以，我不知道，只是对明年利润率的走向有一些非常有趣的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm curious to see if they stay where they're at because the thing that blew my mind last quarter was we entered a new territory for cash flow margin. we entered a new territory for ops margin I think being like 54 and 46 respectively or swap them. Um my thought process is is like if that's able to be maintained then my trajectory for the company and its market cap needs to be readjusted because I was always thinking we'd top out at like a 40 45%. But if we're already this much in its infancy of where the company is and they haven't even really tried to optimize for that stuff yet, then you could see something potentially growing into the the mid50s and high 60s in terms of free cash flow margin. And in that case, you're talking about, hey, when you get to 10 billion a year run rates, you're talking about potentially five to six billion dollars of free cash. Uh we already know it's a very capital-like business. Um, so I don't know, just very interesting uh thoughts about where margins might go um going into to next year.</p>

### 与Nvidia的战略合作：重塑企业AI格局

Amit: 好的，让我们谈谈与 Nvidia 的合作。让我在这里播放一下片段。在华盛顿特区的 Nvidia GTC 大会上看到这一幕非常具有标志性。Jensen 和 Karp 还一起登台接受了 CNBC 的采访，那也非常不可思议。但这是 Jensen 周二的讲话，讨论与 Palantir 的合作。

But this was Jensen on Tuesday. discussing the partnership with Pounder.</p>
</details>

Jensen Huang: 这是世界上增长最快的单一企业公司。可能是当今世界上最重要的单一企业技术栈。Palantir **本体**（Ontology: Palantir的核心技术，用于创建一个连接所有数据源的语义层，使数据具有业务上下文并可被人类和AI理解）。这里有来自 Palantir 的人吗？我刚才还在和 Alex 聊天。这就是 Palantir 本体。他们获取信息，获取数据，获取人类的判断，并将其转化为商业洞察。

They take information, they take data, they take human judgment and they turn it into business insight.</p>
</details>

Jensen Huang: 我们与 Palantir 合作，加速 Palantir 所做的一切，以便我们能够以更大得多的规模和更快的速度进行数据处理。无论是过去的结构化数据，当然我们也会有结构化数据、人类记录的数据、非结构化数据，并为我们的政府、为国家安全、为世界各地的企业处理这些数据。以光速处理这些数据并从中发现洞察。这就是未来的样子。Palantir 将整合 NVIDIA，以便我们能够以光速和超凡的规模进行处理。好的，Nvidia 和 Palantir。

<p class="english-text">We work with Palanteer to accelerate everything Palanteer does so that we could do data processing, data processing at a much much larger scale and more speed whether it's structured data of the past and of course we'll have structured data, human recorded data, unstructured data and process that data for our government, for national security and for enterprises around the world. process that data at speed of light and to find insight from it. This is what it's going to look like in the future. Palunteer is going to integrate NVIDIA so that we could process at the speed of light and at extraordinary scale. Okay, Nvidia and Palanteer.</p>
</details>

Amit: 他们接着做了一个演示，也上传了，是关于 Lowe's 以及他们如何将 NVIDIA 模型集成到 Palantir AIP 中。Matt，我们从你开始。你对看到这个合作的反应是什么？你认为它对公司长期有什么影响？

</details>

Matt: 是的，我的意思是，我认为这至关重要，对吧？我的意思是，计算显然是让事情启动和运行的一个巨大组成部分，这与双方的伟大合作完全匹配，对吧？我的意思是，如果不能以适当的方式构建事物并使其自动化，也就是以一种有意义的顺序和方式来组织它，那么计算它又有什么意义呢？我的意思是，这在能够这样做方面没有意义。

I mean, Compute is is obviously a huge piece of being able to get things up and running and it matches entirely with a great partnership with with both of them, right? I mean without being able to structure things in an appropriate manner and have them automated in an appropriate manner um which is obviously putting it in an order and in a a manner that makes sense then you know why compute it at all right I mean this does doesn't make sense in terms of being able to do so</p>

Matt: 现在，如果你能让事情运行得更快，并且设置了自动化的计算，你就能让事情运行得更顺畅，时间序列数据也能以更快的方式呈现。创建模型的能力也会增强，这些模型可以显示你的数字孪生需要在这里、那里或其他地方进行优化。它会缩短每次计算所需的时间，或者它会增加你可以用来查看是否需要更多优化的模型运行次数。

<p class="english-text">now if you're able to have things running much faster and having calculations set up that are automated you're going to be able to get things that run much smoother um time series data that shows up in a faster manner. Um the ability to to come up with models that showed that your digital twin needs to be optimized here or there or elsewhere. It'll shrink the amount of uh or shrink the amount of time it takes for each individual say calculation to take place and or it'll increase the amount of model runs that you can use to see if more optimization needs to be done.</p>
</details>

Matt: 有时会发生的情况是，人们会说，“好吧，我只对这个计算运行100次迭代，其中可能有数千个不同的节点，因为这需要时间。”好吧，如果你能够与 Nvidia 芯片或系统集体集成，那么你可能会做一千次。你可能会发现一两个可以采取的额外步骤，这可能会带来数千美元的额外机会，否则你可能就因为时间原因而跳过了。

<p class="english-text">Sometimes what ends up happening is people will say, "Well, I'll only run 100 iterations of this calculation which might have thousands of different nodes in it because of the time it takes." Well, if you're able to integrate collectively with with an Nvidia chip or or system, then you might do a thousand. You might be able to find one or two additional steps that you could take that might lead to thousands of dollars of additional uh opportunity that otherwise you might have just skipped over for time purposes, right?</p>

Amit: Amir，你对这次合作的看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amir, your thoughts on the partnership?</p>
</details>

Amir: 是的，你知道，我不是工程师，无法从根本上理解与 Nvidia 在这种能力上的合作到底意味着什么，比如合作前后有什么区别。所以从我的角度来看，这里最大的收获是 Nvidia 重申了 Karp 和团队一直在强调的事情，那就是本体是最重要的部分，也是你将 AI 恰当地引入企业所需要的东西。能够为任何类型的数据分配属性，并以一种没有本体就无法做到的方式将所有内容情境化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, you know, I'm I'm not an engineer to actually understand fundamentally what a partnership with Nvidia in this capacity actually means like what's the difference, you know, prior to the partnership and after. So from my perspective, the biggest takeaway here is that Nvidia reiterates you know what Corp and the team has been you know banging on on the table for you know continuously and that is you know that ontology is like the most important part and that is what you will need in order to you know bring AI properly into the enterprise. you know being able to assign properties to any kind of data you know uh and contextualize everything in in a way that you can't do without an ontology.</p>
</details>

Amir: 所以我从这次合作中得到的最大收获是，黄仁勋重申了本体是最重要的部分，而且你确实需要它。然后，关于实际合作的作用，它如何加速一切，我还不理解那部分，我需要有人给我分解一下才能真正理解。所以我不知道那部分，但我仍然认为，Nvidia 现在是世界上最大的公司，市值5万亿美元。他们一直处于这场 AI 革命的最前沿。每个人都关注他们。他们站出来说，正如你提到的，是的，这可能是世界上最重要的企业软件公司。这意义重大，并重申了 Carpenter 团队一直在说的关于本体的一切。所以这是我从这一切中得到的最大收获，而且正如你提到的，我也认为这对很多企业来说会是一个警钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the my biggest takeaway from this you know partnership is uh Jensen Huang reiterating that ontology is the most important part and you do need it you know then in terms of like what the actual partnership does how it accelerates everything like I I don't understand that part uh yet like I would have to have it broken down to me to actually make sense of it. So, I don't know about that part, but I still think like Nvidia is now the biggest company in the world, $5 trillion market cap. They've been at the forefront of this whole AI re revolution. Everyone pays attention to them. And them coming out and saying, as you mentioned, like, yeah, it's probably the most important, you know, uh, enterprise software company in the world. Like that speaks volumes and reiterating like everything that, you know, Carpenter team has been saying about ontology in general. So that's like my biggest takeaway from all of this and uh um as you mentioned I also think that it will be kind of wakeup call to a lot of businesses out there.</p>

### 60亿美元现金储备：Palantir的下一步棋

Amit: 你们的最后一个问题。他们有60亿美元现金。下个季度可能会有62到63亿美元。没有债务。有很多关于股票分割的谣言，很多关于收购的谣言。他们应该把钱投资到不同的风险投资公司吗？我的意思是，我很好奇你们在想什么。我先简单说一下我的想法。我不认为会有股票分割。我认为这是一个奇怪的谣言。我的意思是，你需要股价远高于200美元，他们才能有理由进行分割。而且，已经有25亿股流通股了。我不认为 Palantir 想要有80或100亿股流通股。所以我真的不认为这会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">last question for you guys. So they have six billion in cash. They're probably going to have 6.2 to 6.3 billion in the next quarter. No debt. Uh a lot of rumors of a stock split, a lot of rumors of acquisition. Should they be investing the money in different venture companies? I mean, I'm curious what you guys are thinking. I'll just give my thoughts real quick. I do not think there's going to be a stock split. I think that's a weird rumor that got started. I mean, you're going to need the stock to be a bit higher than 200 for them to justify splitting it. Also, there's already 2.5 billion shares outstanding. I don't think Pounder wants to have 8 10 billion shares outstanding. So, I really don't think that's going to happen.</p>
</details>

Amit: 关于他们的现金，我认为他们不应该对他们的现金做任何事情。我认为他们不应该回购股票。我也不认为他们应该投资加密货币。我认为他们不应该买黄金。我认为他们应该把它放在资产负债表上，从货币市场基金中获得不错的3.5%的回报，就让那些现金待在那里。因为除了把它投资于销售和市场营销，也许雇佣人来增加增长之外。我的意思是，那些事情很棒。我不认为他们应该用那些现金承担那么大的风险。我认为拥有那些现金和坚固的资产负债表是非常重要的。Matt，你是怎么看待这60亿美元现金的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Terms of their cash, I don't think they should do anything with their cash. I don't think they should buy back stock. And I don't think they should invest it in crypto. I don't think they should buy gold. I think they should keep it on the balance sheet, get a nice three and a half% return from money market funds and just let that cash sit there because other than investing it in sales and marketing, maybe hiring people to increase growth. I mean, like that stuff is great. I don't think they should be taking that much risk with that cash. I think having that cash and having a fortress balance sheet is really balance sheet is really important. Matt, how are you thinking of the the six billion in cash?</p>
</details>

Matt: 我的意思是，我也不认为他们应该疯狂地花钱，但我确实认为可以利用其中一部分用于风险投资。而且我认为有很多人因为有创业精神而离开 Palantir，其中一些钱可以用来帮助他们创办公司，或者至少为他们提供一些资金，当然前提是他们是友好离开的。而且，你知道，Palantir 不一定想把他们正在做的任何事情嵌入到 Palantir 更广泛的产品线中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I don't I don't necessarily think that they should be spending it like crazy either, but I do think that there's a place to utilize some of it for venture capital and uh I think that there's a lot of people that leave unfortunately Palanteer because they have the entrepreneurial spirit and some of that money could go to help starting up some of their companies or at least fe feeding or fueling some of them if they leave on amicable terms of course. uh and and you know, Palanteer doesn't necessarily want to embed whatever they're working on into into the broader product uh line of of what's going on at at Palanteer.</p>
</details>

Matt: 我还认为，其中一个关键的事情，你知道，我自己也在纠结，所以我要说出来，我相信人们会对此提出质疑，这是我已经说了很长时间的事情。与云业务有很多合作，比如 AWS、Azure、Google Cloud，这很好。我认为那应该没问题，因为那让 Palantir 能够非常迅速地启动和运行。但我认为，有一件事可以以溢价来做，Palantir 可以更多地控制，特别是如果有一些非常专有的数据，他们想确保，你知道，非常隔离，也许远离其他公司。他们可以创建自己的独立云产品，让他们能够更多地控制过程。当然，我知道这需要大量的基础设施和资本，但我认为从长远来看，我们已经看到这对其他一些公司，如 AWS 或者说亚马逊、微软和谷歌，产生了多好的价值倍数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think that one of the key things, which you know, I I I wrestle with myself, so I'm going to say it and I'm sure people will poke holes on it and it's something I've been saying for quite some time. There's a lot of partnerships that go on with the cloud businesses like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and that's good. I think that that should be fine because that that allows Palanteer to get up and running very quickly. But I think one of the things that could be done at a premium that Palanteer could control more so especially if there's very proprietary data uh that they want to make sure you know is very isolated and and maybe kept away from say other companies. They could create their own disperate um cloud product that is allowing them to potentially control a little bit more of the process. Granted, I know it will requires a lot of infrastructure and capital, but I think in the long run, we've seen how good of a multiple that's generated for value for some of these other companies like AWS and or sorry, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.</p>
</details>

Matt: 也许这很有用，但我认为我宁愿走风险投资的路线，而不是做那样的事情，因为我认为风险投资，投资于像 Ouija 和其他一些可能成功也可能不成功的东西。我认为从长远来看，这有助于推动我们进入下一个十年或二十年的新产业。所以我希望是这样。当然，我希望看到一些回购，因为有股权激励。作为股东，我总是试图获得更多公司的股份。所以，我至今仍在购买。我停了很长一段时间，但你知道，自从我们在纽约见面后，继续购买更多公司的股票就变得有意义了。我认为这是一家我想长期持有的优秀公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe it's something that's useful, but I think I would rather go the venture capital route before doing something like that because I think venture capital investing in stuff like Ouija and and some of these other things that unfortunately may or may not pan out. I think in the long run helps propel us into the next uh the next decade or or two of new industries that can arise. So that's where I would hope. Of course, I would like to see some buyback because of the the sharebased compensation. As a shareholder, I'm always trying to acquire more of the company. Um, so I'm still buying to this day. Um, and uh, I I took a long pause for a long while, but you know, since we since we met up in New York, it made sense to just continue to buy more and more of the company. I think it's a phenomenal company I want to hold for a long term.</p>
</details>

Matt: 所以，我有点自私，不一定把所有钱都用于回购，对吧？不要超过运营现金流，但我确实认为应该有5%到10%，也许接近10%的运营现金流用于回购，至少可以抵消。我知道保持在10%是可以的，但最终你希望能完全抵消股权激励，我认为很多人在过去几年里一直在抱怨的就是因为股权激励导致的股份数量扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I am somewhat selfish that not necessarily use it all for buybacks, right? don't don't exceed cash flow from operations but I do think that there should be 5 to 10% maybe closer to 10% of that cash flow from operations to be used for for buybacks to at least offset and I know stay at 10% that's fine but eventually you'll hopefully be able to to fully offset sharebased compensation which I think a lot of people have been complaining about for the last several years is that expansion of of share count because of sharebased compensation</p>
</details>

Amir: 是的，这是一个公司面临的很好的问题，你知道，没有债务，现金储备不断增加。Matt 提出的关于拥有自己的云基础设施，可以为高度敏感的业务提供服务的想法很有趣。但我看到的唯一问题是，那会压缩利润率。它会从一个轻资本的业务变成一个相当资本密集的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> thoughts on the cash pile Yeah, it's it's a it's a great problem to have as a company, you know, no debt and ever increasing cash pile. Uh that is an interesting thought that Matt made about having, you know, own cloud infrastructure that you can offer you know in highly sensitive stuff. But the problem the the only problem I see is that that will compress you know margins. it will you know go from a capital light business to you know quite capital uh intense business where you</p>
</details>

Amir: 因为我们看到的问题是，每一代新芯片都越来越贵，你需要不断升级，这就是为什么你看到这些资本支出周期，每个季度过去，这些超大规模数据中心都在增加，是的，我们未来需要比预期多花数亿美元。所以我不太希望 Palantir 进入那个领域。我认为他们目前的轻资本模式具有无限的可扩展性，可以拥有极高的利润率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">have to you know because the the the problem is that we're seeing is that you know each new generation of chip you know increasingly more expensive and you need to like keep upgrading that's why you see like these capex cycles you know like for for every quarter that passes like these hypers scales are like increasing yeah we're going to be need spending like hundreds more than we expected you know over the over the coming periods. So I I don't really want Palunteer to enter that. I think they have like kind of infinite scalability with their current capital light model where they can have like extreme margins.</p>
</details>

Amir: 我不知道这样做对 Palantir 及其现金的全部影响。我不认为他们有足够的现金来妥善地做到这一点。他们很可能需要承担债务，你知道，60亿美元，我不知道，你知道，建设整个数据中心及其基础设施等等需要多少钱，但这是一个有趣的想法，也许未来会有这样的情景，这样做是合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I don't know necessarily like the whole implications of what you know doing that would mean for Palunteer and its cash. I don't think they have enough cash to do that properly. they would have to take on that mo most likely you know $6 billion I don't know like how much you know building out the whole data center with the infrastructure and stuff would mean but it is an interesting thought and maybe there is such a scenario in the future where it does make sense</p>
</details>

Amir: 目前，我们总是提到，Palantir 的董事会里有一些最优秀的投资者，你知道，联合创始人，Peter Thiel，世界上最著名、最成功的投资者之一，Alex Karp 自己也经营过对冲基金。所以我们一直觉得很奇怪，他们没有早点走风险投资的路线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">currently you know we always mention like well palanteer has some of the best investors you know on its board you know the co-founders you know Peter Kil uh one of the most famous investors in the world, most successful investors in the world, Alex Karp himself ran a hedge fund. So we we always thought that it was kind of strange that they didn't really go the venture route, you know, earlier, you know, um</p>
</details>

Amir: 甚至其他联合创始人，比如 Joe Lonsdale，也长期从事投资。我本希望看到，你知道，他们可能很快就会上市，但我一直觉得，如果他们持有 Anduril 的股份，那会很有意义，而 Anduril 持有 Palantir 的股份也很有意义，考虑到他们之间的紧密联系。在硬件加软件方面，重叠非常非常小。Anduril 做一些软件，我猜 Palantir 在非常有限的能力下也做一些硬件，但都不是主要的。所以持有 Anduril 的股份是有意义的。我本希望看到那样，你知道，相互促进，推动西方进入下一代战争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh even you know other co-founders like Joe Ldale also like involved in uh investments for a long time. I would have liked to see, you know, probably they're going to go public soon, but it always made sense to me, you know, if they would have a stake in Andre and it would have made sense for Andre to have a stake in Palanteer considering how tightly knit they are. H, you know, on the hardware plus software side of things, there's, you know, tiny tiny o overlap. you know, Andre does some software and I guess Palanteer in a very limited capacity does some, you know, hardware as well, but you know, not anything major. Uh, so it would have made sense to have a stake in Andrew. I would have liked that, you know, mutually, you know, to propel, you know, the West into the next generation of warfare kind of thing.</p>
</details>

Amir: 但老实说，我真的不知道，而且这也不是他们现在必须解决的问题，你知道，当利率处于当前水平时，就继续赚取那些现金收益。但随着利率下降，他们能从购买国债等工具中获得的收益很可能会随着时间推移而下降，这个对话将变得越来越重要。所以这是一个需要考虑的问题。我真的没有答案，什么是最合理的。正如我提到的，这是一个很好的问题。他们也不应该为了烧钱而烧钱。所以只要你能赚取收益，就继续做，之后，是的，我们可以进行对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, I to to be honest, I don't really know and it's not really a problem that they have to address quite yet, you know, while um you know interest rates are where where they are just keep farming that cash. But that is a conversation that will become more and more important you know as rates come down as the yield that they they're able to get you know from um buying treasury instruments and stuff like that will come down over time most likely. So it is something to consider. I don't really have an answer like what makes most sense. As I mentioned, it is kind of a nice problem to have. They shouldn't really burn cash for the sake of burning cash either. Um, so as long as you can farm yield do that afterwards, then yeah, we can have a conversation.</p>
</details>

Amir: 但你知道，Karp 已经在多个场合表示，他们在增长方面不受现金限制。投入更多现金，烧掉更多现金，并不一定意味着增长会有意义的增加。所以目前，你知道，这不是我太关心的事情，但持有 Anduril 的股份，也许还有该领域其他一些非常杰出的参与者的股份，你知道，特别是考虑到他们有 FedStart。考虑到他们有 FedStart，他们对这个领域有相当多的洞察力，我们已经看到和听到了很多关于所有这些新公司试图在政府领域竞争的消息，由 Palantir 赋能。所以他们很早就知道哪些公司可能会成为赢家，所以，你知道，收购他们认为与他们的价值观和核心使命一致的公司的股份是有意义的。所以也许这是我们未来会看到的事情，但目前，你知道，只要利率像现在这样有吸引力，这就不是一个需要我们太担心的大问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, Corp has said on on multiple occasions now that they're they're not cash constrained in terms of their growth. like piling in more cash like uh burning more more cash won't ne necessarily mean meaningful increase in growth. So for now, you know, it's not really something, you know, that I'm concerning myself with too much, but a stake in Andre, maybe some other very prominent uh players in the space, you know, especially con considering they have um uh um what's the gov ramp? What's the product name? It's too early. >> Fed start. >> Fed start. Yeah. like considering they have fed start they have quite a bit of insight into the field and we've been seeing and hearing a lot you know about all of these new companies trying to compete you know in the government space you know enabled by Palanteer so they have early visibility into you know which companies might be winners there so it would make sense to you know to kind of acquire stakes in what they believe you know are aligned with their values and their core core missions you know and stuff like that so Maybe that's something that we will see in the future, but for now, you know, it's not a big problem to concern ourselves with as long as rates are, you know, as attractive as they are.</p>

### 一代人的旅程：回顾与展望

Amit: 好了，各位。再次感谢大家的加入。很高兴再次来到这里。我们很可能不会再每周做这个节目了，我们在开头谈了原因，但我们每个季度都会在这里。我会每天都在谈论 Palantir。Matt 和 Amir 也在推特上谈论它。所以我们并不是停止报道。只是这个周刊版可能不再需要了。而且，老实说，这是一件非常好的事情，因为它被需要了四年，而公司执行了。我想我们谁也没想到当它还是6美元的时候会达到4500亿。但我也同意 Amir 之前在节目中说的，我认为我们在有生之年再也看不到这样的事情了。我的意思是，我真的不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, there we go, folks. Thank you all for joining once again. Uh very excited to be here again. Uh we are likely not going to be doing this weekly anymore, and we talked about why in the beginning, but we will be here every single quarter. I'll be on, you know, every single day talking about pounder. Matt and me are tweeting about it. So, it's not like we're stopping the coverage. It's just the weekly edition of this likely is not needed anymore. And, you know, that's a really good thing to be honest because it was needed for four years and the company executed. I don't think any of us expected 450 billion when it was $6. But I I I also agree with what Amir said as well earlier in the show that I don't think we're ever seeing this again in our lifetimes. I mean, I really don't.</p>
</details>

Amit: Matt，我很好奇你的想法，但我不知道我们是否还会看到一只股票在不到三年的时间里以这种方式从6美元涨到200美元。我们都应该珍惜我们正在经历的旅程，因为20、30年后回首往事，我们会觉得，天啊，我们这些来自世界各地的陌生人，因为 YouTube、Twitter 和这些直播，得以体验见证历史，见证一家可能在几个世纪后都会被谈论的公司，如何成为世界上最重要的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it's Matt, I'm curious your thoughts on it, but I I don't know if we're ever going to see a name go from six to 200 in less than three years in the way that it has. And we should really all cherish the journey we're on because we're going to look back on this 20, 30 years from now being like, man, we all across the world as strangers got to experience because of YouTube and Twitter and these live streams, uh, witnessing history for a company that will be talked about probably centuries from now in terms of how they became the most important company in the world.</p>
</details>

Matt: 是的，这很难。你不会经常看到这种情况。我的意思是，也许你对此也有很好的视角，因为你也以相当便宜的估值买入了 Robinhood。但这很少见。我认为其中一件事是，有些公司可能会做这样的事。它们可能会以这种方式变动，但很多都只是炒作，然后什么都没有实现。这家公司实际上在执行。他们做得非常好。所以在这方面，你知道，我有信心，是的，也许，你知道，人们可能会说，“哦，天啊，他们在庆祝200美元。”也许它确实会回撤。没关系。我明白。它被高估了。但从长远来看，我们谈论的是一家在我看来会轻易达到1.5到2万亿美元的公司。所以，你知道，当然，你可以庆祝你的胜利。如果它跌到150美元，没关系。我仍然会买入，最终它会值500、600美元一股，甚至更多。而且，在某个时候，它会支付股息，在某个时候，它会回购大量股票，我将能够用它来抵押贷款或写备兑看涨期权，继续过我的快活日子。但是的，很难找到像我们当初那样，以如此便宜的估值，被如此误解，然后达到今天这个位置的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's tough. Uh you don't think I don't think uh you'll see this very regularly. Um I mean maybe you you have a good lens on it too because you you had hood at quite cheap valuations as well. So um but it's rare and few and far between and I think one of the things is is some companies might do something like this. They might move in a manner like this, but a lot of them will be all hype and then something never really comes to fruition. This company's actually executing. They're doing really well. Um, so in that respect, you know, I feel confident that yeah, maybe the, you know, people might say, "Oh my god, they're celebrating $200." Maybe it does retrace. That's fine. I get it. It is overvalued. But in the long term, we're talking about a company that's going to be one and a half to two trillion dollars in my mind easily. And so, you know, sure, you know, t take your victory lap. If it drops to 150 bucks, that's fine. I'm still gonna be buying and uh eventually it'll be worth uh you know, $500, $600 a share easily, probably more. And um you know it'll be at some point paying dividends at some point buying back a crap ton of stock and I'll be able to borrow against it or write covered calls and continue to to live and and go about my merry way. But yeah, it's going to be very difficult to to find something like we did um at at such a a cheap valuation that uh was so misunderstood and uh got to where it is.</p>
</details>

Amir: 是的，我有点怪 Amit，你知道，因为我们以前都经常被问到这个问题，哦，好吧，Palantir 涨了50倍什么的。我甚至不知道人们的平均成本是多少，然后他们会说，“好吧，好吧。那么，Palantir 的故事现在结束了。下一个 Palantir 是什么？”我就想，“伙计，Palantir 才刚刚开始。我们甚至还没有1000个客户。Salesforce 有20万个客户。Palantir 才刚刚开始，这根本不算什么，Palantir 的故事远未结束。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I kind of blame Amit, you know, because uh we, you know, we all used to get the question, oh, okay, Palunteer it uh like uh you know, 50x whatever. I don't even know like from where people had their averages and they're like, "Okay, okay. So, uh Palunteer like is is over now. What's the next Palanteer?" I'm like, "Dude, Palanteer is just getting started. Like, we're not even at 1,000 customers. Salesforce 200,000 customers like Palunteer like just getting started like this is nothing like Palanteer's story is not over like by far. Uh okay.</p>
</details>

Amir: 然后人们会说，好吧，那下一个 Palantir 是什么？Amit，他去对 Robin Hood 做了同样的事情，两家公司做了同样的事情，把这种事情正常化了，就像，哦，那么下一个 Palantir 和 Hood 是什么？你好像经常能挑中它们。所以告诉我们下一个 Palantir 和 Hood 是什么。他把这件事正常化了，以至于人们没有真正意识到找到这种高质量、执行力如此之强、增长如此之快的企业是多么极其罕见。所以我每次被问到“下一个 Palantir 是什么”这个问题时，都完全怪 Amit，因为他好像总能不断地找到更多这样的公司。所以 Amit，当你找到下一个时，告诉我们，然后我们也可以为那家公司做一个周刊。
