### AI投资与市场现状：是泡沫还是价值？

人们在这些模型上投入了大量资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">people are spending a lot on these models.</p>
</details>

他们这样做大概是因为这些模型能带来价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're presumably doing this because they're getting value from them.</p>
</details>

你或许会争辩说：“哦，我认为那种价值并非真实，我觉得人们只是在玩玩而已。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can maybe argue like, oh well, I don't think that value is real. I think people are just playing around, whatever.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，他们正在为此付费，这是一个相当可靠的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like [music] whatever, they're paying for it. That's a pretty solid sign.</p>
</details>

我们几乎是在给你一个有用的答案，比如：“我不认为这是一个泡沫，因为它还没有破裂。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're almost giving you here the useful answer of like, I don't think it's a bubble cuz it's not burst yet.</p>
</details>

当它破裂时，你就会知道它是一个泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When it's burst yet, then you'll know it's a bubble.</p>
</details>

人们常说：“哦，AI还没有盈利，他们还在投入更多资金以使其盈利。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People often make the case, oh, AI hasn't been profitable yet, and they're spending more to make it profitable.</p>
</details>

实际上，他们很快就会收回过去所有开发成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In reality, they'll have paid off the cost of all the development they've done in the past very soon.</p>
</details>

他们只是在为未来进行更多的开发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just that they're doing develop more development for the future.</p>
</details>

>> 他们会后悔这笔开支吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Will they regret that spending?</p>
</details>

他们到底投入了多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much are they spending?</p>
</details>

你可以看看**英伟达**（Nvidia: 一家全球领先的图形处理器和人工智能计算公司）每年的销售额，看看它是否持续增长，你就能知道情况是否看起来会持续良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can look at Nvidia and how much they're selling each year and you can see whether it keeps on growing and you can [music] see whether stuff is kind of looking good to continue.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，至少对我来说，我思考这个问题的方式是，我将人们在计算等方面的支出视为一个重要指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, for me at least, um, the way that I thought about this a little bit is I look at kind of the big indicator being how much people are spending on stuff like compute.</p>
</details>

而且，他们是否会后悔这笔开支，这在某种程度上是相关的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I guess maybe some sense of will they regret that spending, that's relevant.</p>
</details>

关于他们投入多少的问题，你可以看看**英伟达**每年的销售额，看看它是否持续增长，以及情况是否看起来会持续良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the how much are they spending thing like you can see you can look at Nvidia and how much they're selling each year and you can see whether it keeps on growing and you can see whether stuff is kind of looking good to continue</p>
</details>

至于他们是否会后悔，那只能拭目以待了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the will they regret it side I mean that's just to bec right like we'll actually have to wait and see</p>
</details>

目前看来，大部分计算资源都用于**推理**（Inference: AI模型在接收到输入后生成输出的过程），公司到目前为止似乎并不后悔将其用于提供产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it does seem as if most compute gets spent on inference that companies don't so far regret like using to offer their products</p>
</details>

所以，从这方面来看，我觉得目前还没有形成太大的泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I mean on that side I'm like thinking not too bubbly yet.</p>
</details>

不过，我的信心不足，还有其他事情需要考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but yeah, I low confidence. So there's other stuff to think about.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，目前公司实际获得的利润（不包括模型最初的开发成本）似乎非常可观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Uh right now the amount of money companies are actually earning in profit not including the cost to develop the models initially is seems to be like very positive such that if they stop developing bigger and bigger models and just stick with the ones they've had, they've be they'd have earned a profit pretty quickly at the current margins.</p>
</details>

如果他们停止开发更大规模的模型，只保留现有的模型，他们将很快以目前的利润率实现盈利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and in this sense it doesn't seem bubbly.</p>
</details>

从这个意义上说，这似乎不是泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the other hand, um at any given time they are investing in building even uh in building even larger and larger models and you know if that goes well then they'll earn more money and if that doesn't go well then no matter how profitable they are right now it'll be uh a small amount of money compared to how much they would have spent.</p>
</details>

另一方面，他们一直在投资构建更大规模的模型，如果进展顺利，他们将赚取更多资金；如果进展不顺利，那么无论他们现在多么盈利，与他们可能已经花费的金额相比，那都将是小数目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so it's like uh I think right now there are not financial signs that that things are actually that there's a bubble.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为目前并没有金融迹象表明存在泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, a lot of people worrying about bubbles just like aren't necessarily used to the level of spending um, and just like the level of success that sort of happened in like scaling.</p>
</details>

许多担心泡沫的人只是不习惯当前的支出水平以及在规模化方面所取得的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but if it there is a bubble, it could happen very suddenly and be pretty bad. So,</p>
</details>

但是，如果真的有泡沫，它可能会非常突然地破裂，并带来相当严重的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah, I think we're almost giving you here the useful answer of like I don't think it's a bubble because it's not burst yet. When it's burst yet, then you'll know it's a bubble.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我认为我们几乎是在给你一个有用的答案，那就是我不认为这是一个泡沫，因为它还没有破裂。当它破裂时，你就会知道它是一个泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. I do think like there's you could imagine a world which there's all the spending and the current level of success does does not like people often make the case oh AI hasn't been profitable yet and they're spending more to make it profitable but right now it's you know not making anything and in reality they're making you know they'll have paid off the cost of all the development they've done in the past very soon it's just that they're doing develop more development for the future uh so I think like there's this like underlying financial success so far that I wouldn't expect to see if there were the very least an obvious bubble.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，是的。我确实认为，你可以想象这样一个世界：所有这些支出和目前的成功水平，人们常常会说“哦，AI还没有盈利，他们还在投入更多资金以使其盈利”，但实际上他们现在并没有赚到任何钱。然而，他们很快就会收回过去所有开发成本，他们只是在为未来进行更多开发。所以，我认为目前存在着这种潜在的财务成功，如果存在明显的泡沫，我不会期望看到这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that does seem very relevant.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这确实非常相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People are spending a lot on these models. They're presum like, you know, users to use them.</p>
</details>

人们在这些模型上投入了大量资金，用户也正在使用它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're presumably doing this because they're getting value from them.</p>
</details>

他们这样做大概是因为这些模型能带来价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can maybe argue like, oh well, I don't think that value is real. I think people are just playing around, whatever.</p>
</details>

你或许会争辩说：“哦，我认为那种价值并非真实，我觉得人们只是在玩玩而已。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like whatever, they're paying for it. You know, that's that's a pretty solid sign.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，他们正在为此付费，这是一个相当可靠的迹象。

### AI能力与发展瓶颈

>> 我想问一个与此相关的问题：你在报告中提到了2030年的AI，基本上你没有看到这些模型有高原期或能力停止增长的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I guess one quick question on on related to this is like you talked in the report of the AI in 2030 basically that you haven't seen signs of of um basically these models kind of plateauing or like the capabilities keep increasing and you have the benchmarks you have the amount of data that is going the amount of compute do you think phases or parts of the models are plateauing though like for instance pre-training um are we seeing some sort of plateauing in that or do you think people are still exploring some innovations in that stage and u curious on what you think about that.</p>
</details>

你拥有基准测试、数据量和计算量，那么你认为模型的某些阶段或部分是否正在达到高原期，例如**预训练**（Pre-training: AI模型在大量数据上进行初步训练的过程，以学习通用特征）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think phases or parts of the models are plateauing though like for instance pre-training um are we seeing some sort of plateauing in that or do you think people are still exploring some innovations in that stage and u curious on what you think about that.</p>
</details>

我们是否看到了某种高原期，或者你认为人们仍在那个阶段探索一些创新？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are we seeing some sort of plateauing in that or do you think people are still exploring some innovations in that stage and u curious on what you think about that.</p>
</details>

你对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and u curious on what you think about that.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我认为这变得更难观察了，我们进入了一个没有太多公开数据可以说明问题的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I think this gets a bit harder to look at like we get to an area where there isn't as much public data to say a lot, right?</p>
</details>

**预训练**似乎相对而言不再是重点，部分原因是现在有了**后训练**（Post-training: 在预训练之后，对模型进行进一步的微调和优化，以提高特定任务的性能）这个令人兴奋的新方向，他们在推理等方面做了很多工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems as if pre-training is comparatively less of a focus than it was before partly because like you have this exciting new direction of well new newish direction of postraining where they've done so much about reasoning whatever.</p>
</details>

但是，我并不一定将其视为“哦，不，这意味着预训练无法进一步扩展”的证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but then I don't necessarily take that as evidence of like, oh no, and that means pre-training you couldn't scale further, whatever.</p>
</details>

似乎有更多有意义的数据可用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, it seems as if there is meaningfully more data out there.</p>
</details>

而且似乎很可能，很多东西都是协同作用的：你开发一个更好的模型，利用后训练使其更好，然后获得大量模型实际成功或失败使用的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems as if plausibly like even, you know, a lot of this stuff is quite synergistic. You develop a better model. You like use post-training stuff to make it better. You get a load of data of the model actually being used uh successfully or not.</p>
</details>

其中很多数据下次都可以用于**预训练**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of that can probably go into pre-training next time.</p>
</details>

>> 你没有预测一个纯软件的**奇点**（Software-only singularity: 指AI通过自动化自身的研发过程，实现智能的快速迭代和指数级增长，而无需外部硬件或人类干预的突破），即AI能够自动化AI研究，因为这是一个自动化的反馈循环，为什么不呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you you aren't projecting a software only singularity where AI is able to automate AI research uh because automated feedback loop why not</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我的意思是，我可能会回答这个问题，然后我会说更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah I mean I guess like I might answer this and I'll yeah say more and it's like for me it's like that report it's no one person's kind of oh this is like the forecast this is the prediction right this report very specifically looks at what are the current trends are there reasons that they clearly like couldn't continue or might not and if they do continue where do they lead um I think whether you see this self-improvement thing that's very hard to do from a sort of trend extrapolation basis right like currently AI stuff does help AI R&D at least a little in terms of stuff like uh coding or selecting your data sets and creating those whatever but it's quite hard to actually measure and it's not really helping in some big way like this kind of self-improving thing suggest um there are reasons that you might think it could be very hard.</p>
</details>

对我来说，那份报告并不是某个人的“哦，这就是预测，这就是预言”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for me it's like that report it's no one person's kind of oh this is like the forecast this is the prediction right</p>
</details>

这份报告非常具体地审视了当前的趋势，是否存在明显无法持续或可能无法持续的原因，如果它们持续下去，会走向何方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this report very specifically looks at what are the current trends are there reasons that they clearly like couldn't continue or might not and if they do continue where do they lead</p>
</details>

我认为，你是否看到这种自我改进的事情，从趋势外推的角度来看是很难做到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think whether you see this self-improvement thing that's very hard to do from a sort of trend extrapolation basis right</p>
</details>

目前，AI确实在编码、选择数据集和创建数据集等方面对AI研发有所帮助，但很难实际衡量，而且并没有像这种自我改进所暗示的那样提供巨大的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like currently AI stuff does help AI R&D at least a little in terms of stuff like uh coding or selecting your data sets and creating those whatever but it's quite hard to actually measure and it's not really helping in some big way like this kind of self-improving thing suggest</p>
</details>

有一些原因让你可能会觉得这会非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um there are reasons that you might think it could be very hard.</p>
</details>

人们之前讨论过，如果事情真的很大程度上取决于计算规模的扩大，那么自动化大部分研发可能就没有那么有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh people have discussed before how possibly you know if stuff does just depend a lot on scaling up compute then maybe automating a lot of the R&D isn't that helpful.</p>
</details>

我发现这有点令人信服，但我也认为这很不确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I find that somewhat compelling but I think it's also just it's pretty uncertain.</p>
</details>

很难推测这种非常规的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's hard to speculate about something that's quite out of regime like that.</p>
</details>

为了实现纯软件**奇点**，需要发生的一件事是，你需要处于这样一个世界：扩大研究人员的研发时间，基本上可以让你足够改进AI，以弥补无法扩大实验计算或**预训练**的不足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing that needs to happen in order for a software only singularity to occur is you need to be in this world where scaling up the amount of researcher R&D time basically um allows you to like improve AI enough that it makes up for the lack of being able to scale experimental compute or pre or pre-training.</p>
</details>

我认为，如果情况是这样，你会期望看到的是，实际上没有使用那么多实验计算，而是所有的钱都流向了研究人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that something you would expect to see if this were the case is, you know, maybe not that much experimental compute being used in practice and instead all of the money is going towards researchers.</p>
</details>

现在，有充分的理由认为有大量的资金流向研究人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there's a very good case that there's a very large amount of money going towards researchers.</p>
</details>

但据我们所知，实验计算（似乎是进行研究所必需的）也获得了类似的资金，事实上，它获得的资金是实际发布的模型最终训练运行的许多倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But as far as we can tell, experimental compute, which you seem to need to do research, is al is receiving a similar amount of money and that in fact uh it's receiving many times more money than the final training runs that are actually of the models that are actually being released.</p>
</details>

我认为这在我看来是一个强有力的更新，表明“哦，你实际上需要进行大规模实验才能进行研究”，而且我们没有充分的证据表明研究人员（仅仅是研究人员）能够在不进行更多实验的情况下加速进程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think this is uh in my mind is a strong update towards oh you actually need this you need to do very large scale experiments to do research and that we don't really have large have good evidence that researchers and just researchers would be able to speed speed things up without doing more experiments.</p>
</details>

然而，关于这一点，双方都有相当好的论据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um however um the actual there are like pretty good arguments on either side of this.</p>
</details>

我倾向于认为“不，你实际上需要进行更多实验，这意味着你无法实现纯软件**奇点**”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I tend to lean towards no, you actually need to do more experiments and that means you can't get this software only uh singularity.</p>
</details>

但我认为那些持不同意见的人并非“疯子”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but I don't think the people who claim otherwise are like crazy.</p>
</details>

我认为他们有一些非常合理的观点差异，我们都在推测数据目前非常稀疏的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're making some like they have like very reasonable differences and we're both uh speculating on something where the data is currently pretty sparse.</p>
</details>

>> 实际上，与此相关的是，你认为研究人员正在尝试的一些探索是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> actually related to that like what do you think on so so if if you have like some of some of the exploration that researchers are trying</p>
</details>

我的意思是，显然人们正在用**强化学习**（Reinforcement Learning, RL: 一种机器学习范式，通过智能体与环境的交互来学习最优行为策略）进行大量探索，试图超越可验证的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean obviously like people are exploring a lot with RL trying to go beyond verifiable domains and um</p>
</details>

你认为关于**梯度下降**（Gradient Descent: 一种优化算法，用于在机器学习中最小化模型的损失函数）在当前数据集学习方面表现非常好的论点如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what do you think about the argument for instance that gradient descent is is really good on learning in the current data set that you're giving right</p>
</details>

如果不断重复训练，它会开始忘记之前训练过的内容，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and just if you keep training this over and over it's going to start forgetting things that it was trained before right like catastrophic forgetting</p>
</details>

就像**灾难性遗忘**（Catastrophic Forgetting: 神经网络在学习新任务时，忘记之前学习到的知识的现象）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and is this there's this argument right like well kids don't don't learn that way or like you maybe there's some imitation learning that kids do maybe there's some sort of exploration that they do and uh I wonder what you think about it.</p>
</details>

有这种说法，比如“孩子们不是那样学习的”，或者“也许孩子们会进行一些模仿学习，也许他们会进行某种探索”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean if and it sounds right like if kids really would just learn on imitation learning I think parents would have a great time just raising kids but it seems like the reason why they have such a hard time raising kids is because they explore all these different things.</p>
</details>

我想知道你对此有何看法。我的意思是，如果孩子们真的只通过模仿学习，我想父母在抚养孩子时会轻松很多，但他们之所以如此困难，似乎是因为孩子们会探索所有这些不同的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think about it in terms of the algorithms and like the things we need to keep improving these models over and over beyond the data and the compute?</p>

你认为在算法方面，以及我们需要不断改进这些模型，超越数据和计算的限制方面，你有什么看法？

我对于比较AI如何学习与人类如何学习持谨慎态度。

<p class="english-text">Not because I don't think they are comparable, but because I think we know a lot more about how AIs learn right now than we know about how humans learn.</p>

不是因为我认为它们不可比，而是因为我认为我们现在对AI学习方式的了解远多于对人类学习方式的了解。

<p class="english-text">And people like making sort of assumptions about how human learning works and saying, "Oh, AI doesn't do it that way."</p>

<p class="english-text">And I don't know, maybe that's true. Um maybe human kids learn via RL. Um I I I'm not very I I think that yeah I I I don't have strong opinions on whether or not like you know you need to change to a method that's more like what we think kids do right now.</p>

我不知道，也许这是真的。也许人类孩子通过**强化学习**来学习。我对此没有很强的看法，即是否需要改变成我们认为孩子们现在所做的那种学习方法。

<p class="english-text">I suspect people will find some method that works to use the compute available because they've been able to do this in the past.</p>

我怀疑人们会找到一种有效的方法来利用可用的计算资源，因为他们过去一直能够做到这一点。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I'm also sort of reluctant. I guess as well it's one of those things where when we point to particular issues like the example of catastrophic forgetting it's sort of well okay but as we've scaled up we have managed to do quite well at like having models that remember more and more things.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我也有些不情愿。我想，这也是那种情况，当我们指出特定问题，比如**灾难性遗忘**的例子时，就会觉得“好吧，但是随着我们规模的扩大，我们已经成功地让模型记住越来越多的东西了。”

<p class="english-text">So then you could just draw from that kind of like oh okay so extrapolating to 2030 you need and I think for there it was in the report I don't know I calculated but I think it was on the order of like a percent kind of GDP increase that's in a few years right that's not presuming AGI that's presuming like if Nvidia stock not stock revenues keep like growing as they sort of previously have and you assume that they make roughly as much compute from it as before and so on.</p>

所以你可以从中得出结论，比如“哦，好吧，那么推断到2030年，你需要……”我认为报告中提到，我不知道我计算过，但它大概是GDP增长百分之一左右，那是在几年之内，对吧？那不是假设**通用人工智能**，那是假设如果**英伟达**的股票（不是股票，是收入）像以前那样持续增长，并且你假设他们从中获得大致相同的计算能力，等等。
