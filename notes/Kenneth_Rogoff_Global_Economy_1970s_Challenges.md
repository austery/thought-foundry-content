## 全球经济现状：70年代的既视感

**Nicolai Tangen:** Hi everyone, I'm Nicolai Tangen, the head of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund and today I'm in really good company with Ken Rogoff. Now Ken is known for his insights into global finance, economic history and for his incredible book which he wrote together with Carmen Reinhart which is like a seminal book actually and it's called This Time It's Different. He's out with a new book coming up soon. Uh and you can look forward to it. Ken, wonderful to have you here.

**Nicolai Tangen:** 大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金的负责人 Nicolai Tangen，今天我非常荣幸能与 Ken Rogoff 对话。Ken 以其在全球金融、经济史领域的深刻见解而闻名，他与 Carmen Reinhart 合著的《这次不一样》(This Time Is Different) 是一部里程碑式的著作。他的新书也即将问世，敬请期待。Ken，非常欢迎你的到来。

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Uh wonderful to be here. Thank you for having me on your podcast.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 非常荣幸能来到这里。感谢你邀请我上你的播客。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So, um, Ken, I think I've said once that discussing, you know, inflation with you, that's a bit like discussing, uh, the Bible with, uh, with with Jesus. But, I mean, let's let's give it a go, huh?

**Nicolai Tangen:** Ken，我好像说过一次，和你讨论通货膨胀，有点像和耶稣讨论《圣经》。不过，我们还是来试试看吧？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** I don't know how we can live up to that.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 我不知道该如何才能不负此言。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Ken, um, how would you assess the current state of the global economy just now?

**Nicolai Tangen:** Ken，你如何评估当前全球经济的状况？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, it was uh in modestly good shape, but obviously it's being thrown into chaos with uh the restructuring of globalization that Donald Trump comes with uh what's happening in Europe. Uh you know, it it's a pretty wild time. I don't think it's it'd be a little bit much say it's unlike anything we've seen before. I think it feels a little like the 70s to me. Trump actually feels a little like Nixon to me, but obviously we're in for a wild ride.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 此前，全球经济状况尚可，但显然，随着唐纳德·特朗普带来的全球化重构以及欧洲正在发生的事情，经济正陷入混乱。这是一个相当疯狂的时期。说它前所未见可能有点夸张，但我感觉这有点像70年代。特朗普给我的感觉有点像尼克松，但显然，我们正面临一段动荡的旅程。

## 关税、贸易战与美国例外论

**Nicolai Tangen:** Where are we in terms of American exceptionalism now?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 我们现在处于美国例外论（American exceptionalism：指美国因其独特的起源、政治体系和历史发展而与众不同的信念）的哪个阶段？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, it's been dented. I mean, I'd almost we sometimes call the US the hegemon, the one that dominates everything. And it's almost like the hegemon is turning on itself. And Trump says, and I hope he has a plan, that it's all going to be better on the other side of this, but uh obviously the stock markets are getting nervous. Uh everybody's getting nervous that there might not be a plan. I don't know. I mean, I say I I he's the president of the United States. I wish his policies well, but uh it's it's hard to understand exactly where he's going and what he's doing. Again, it feels like a throwback to the 70s in a lot of ways.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 它已经受到了削弱。我们有时称美国为霸主（hegemon），主宰一切。现在感觉就像是这个霸主在自我攻击。特朗普说——我希望他真有个计划——度过这个阶段后一切都会变得更好，但显然，股市开始紧张，每个人都开始担心可能根本没有计划。我不知道。我的意思是，他是美国总统，我希望他的政策能有好结果，但真的很难理解他到底要去向何方，在做什么。再次强调，这在很多方面都感觉像是回到了70年代。

**Nicolai Tangen:** What are your biggest concern when it comes to the current economic policy?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 对于当前的经济政策，你最大的担忧是什么？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, I mean, the the the biggest concern is that uh we undermine the institutions that are the bedrock of US exceptionalism. You trust the rule of law. Uh when the United States gives its word, it keeps its word. I'm not saying we always did that, but you know, uh certainly with respect to paying our debts, uh I'm concerned uh certainly about this view that people uh who believe in global trade and global integration are globalists. I'm an unapologetic globalist myself. uh and uh this fracturing of the global economy. I mean, Trump sometimes and his people sometimes say, "Let's go back to the 50s." Well, we had a lot lower income back in the 50s. Like, okay, maybe we'll have more manufacturing jobs, maybe, but things will cost a lot more. I mean, it's it's just a little hard to know how much of its bluster theater. He'll retreat.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 最大的担忧在于，我们正在侵蚀那些作为美国例外论基石的制度。比如对法治的信任，以及美国一旦做出承诺就会信守的原则。我不是说我们总是能做到，但在偿还债务方面尤其如此。我也很担心那种将相信全球贸易和全球一体化的人视为“全球主义者”（globalist）的观点。我自己就是一个毫无歉意的全球主义者。全球经济的这种分裂令人担忧。特朗普和他的人有时会说，“让我们回到50年代吧。”可50年代我们的收入要低得多。好吧，也许我们会有更多的制造业岗位，也许，但物价会高得多。真的很难判断这其中有多少是虚张声势的表演，以及他是否会退让。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Where do you see tariffs a year from now?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 一年后，你认为关税会是怎样的状况？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Whoa. You threw in the year from now. I mean, it seems like he's spinning a wheel when he when he wakes up every morning. And first he spins the wheel to see what country it points at, and then he spins the wheel to see what tariff he wants to put on, and then he changes his mind the next day. I mean, that's that's a really hard thing to forecast, but I I I think he's very intent on it. So I'm guessing the US will have tariffs for example on Europe uh on on the uh on the order of uh uh I don't know at least 10 you know 15% 20%. And Europe will have retaliated and there'll have been a lot of noise back and forth. He he he seems to be a believer.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 哇，你还加了个“一年后”的时间限制。感觉他每天早上醒来就像在转轮盘。先转一下看指针指向哪个国家，再转一下看要加征多少关税，然后第二天又改变主意。这真的很难预测。但我认为他对此非常执着。所以我猜，美国会对欧洲加征关税，税率大概在10%、15%到20%之间。欧洲会进行报复，然后双方会有一番喧嚣的来回。他似乎是关税的信徒。

**Kenneth Rogoff:** I even back in 2016 when he was first running someone who was uh close to him called me and just for did I have any general thoughts and I said okay first of all this conversation never happened I'm I I can't be seen as talking to you but if you ask me I discussed some things but the tariffs are a terrible idea why are you doing the tariffs this is this is and uh you know the person said Well, you know, the candidate, uh, Trump, uh, he knows politics better than I do, and he thinks 80% of Americans love tariffs. And actually, you know, I, sadly, I find that hard to argue with.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 早在2016年他第一次竞选时，一个和他关系密切的人打电话给我，问我有没有什么总体看法。我说：“好吧，首先，这次谈话从未发生过，我不能被外界看作在和你交谈。但如果你问我，我会讨论一些事情，但关税是个糟糕透顶的主意。你们为什么要搞关税？”那个人说：“嗯，候选人特朗普比我更懂政治，他认为80%的美国人都喜欢关税。”说实话，可悲的是，我发现这一点很难反驳。

**Nicolai Tangen:** How bad are Tariffs for globalization?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 关税对全球化的危害有多大？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** So, truth be told, if we just slapped on 20% tariffs, it would be very bad, like a big tax hike. It would reduce trade. it would interfere with the global supply chains and such. It would not be the end of the world if together with that Trump did a bunch of sensible things deregulation uh you know finding uh ways to uh improve innovation. I don't know. But if he did on balance it could be okay. They do raise revenue. What what's just been so weird about it is the randomness of it. Just you don't know what's coming.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 说实话，如果我们直接征收20%的关税，情况会非常糟糕，就像一次大规模增税。它会减少贸易，干扰全球供应链等等。但如果特朗普在征收关税的同时，做一系列明智的事情，比如放松管制、寻找提高创新的方法，那情况或许还不至于世界末日。关税确实能增加财政收入。这件事最奇怪的地方在于它的随机性，你根本不知道下一步会发生什么。

**Nicolai Tangen:** What will be the impact on inflation from the tariffs?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 关税对通货膨胀会有什么影响？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** So that is not a big deal. I mean uh it raises prices. is the United States is pretty closed and it raises prices there'll be a short-term effect that's I mean it won't be pleasant and I think some of it will be inflation some of it lower quality but the the problem is more uh innovation slowing growth over the longer run and uh the effect on American consumers well you know of course we pay the tariffs dollar for dollar. Every study shows that. It shows it on other examples. It shows it when he put in tariffs in 2018. And uh so you know this whole story, it's a little bit obviously like Mexico will pay for the wall. The American consumers will pay the tariffs both in terms of higher prices and I think lower quality.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 这影响不大。关税会推高物价。美国经济相对封闭，关税会抬高价格，产生短期效应。这当然不会是愉快的经历，我认为一部分体现为通胀，一部分体现为质量下降。但更严重的问题是，从长远来看，它会减缓创新和增长。对美国消费者的影响是，我们当然要一分不少地支付关税。每一项研究都表明了这一点，无论是其他案例，还是他2018年实施关税时的例子。所以，整个说法有点像“墨西哥会为边境墙买单”一样，最终是美国消费者通过更高的价格和更低的商品质量来为关税买单。

## 美元的霸权、中国的挑战与全球债务

**Nicolai Tangen:** let's move on to the dollar. um what's so what's your view now on on the US dollar's global role?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 让我们谈谈美元。你现在对美元的全球角色有什么看法？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** So I think uh and my book argues that we sort of reached the peak 10 years ago in terms of the dollar's footprint and dominance in the global economy and lots of different measures uh you know how many reserves people hold uh number of transactions in dollars what's priced in dollars and we won't need to go into detail. they all kind of tell the same story and I think there's this what I sort of portray there is there's this sense in which the dollar has been lucky at different stages the US has been good the US system's good but as the US has faced challenggers I think they've fallen short more than I would have guessed and it it doesn't mean we'd have the euro instead of the dollar but it is a surprise that the euro right now is a regional currency It's just basically not a central currency outside of Europe. And of course, the yen's hardly used at all. The renminbi even less. And I'm old enough, I don't know if you are, but I'm old enough to remember when Russia was considered much more seriously as an economic counterweight. And we've been been lucky. I I actually towards the end of the book quote the Danish Grandmaster Ben Larson uh and he was asked would you rather be lucky or good and he said I'd rather be lucky and good and I think Americans forget the lucky part we just beat ourselves on the chest we're the greatest country in the world everybody loves us so I think there are a lot of trends pushing towards the dollar still being at the top but not quite as much king of the hill as we were.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 我认为，正如我在书中所论述的，大约10年前，美元在全球经济中的足迹和主导地位达到了顶峰。从各国持有的储备量、美元交易数量、以美元计价的商品等多种指标来看，它们都指向同一个故事。我描绘的场景是，美元在不同阶段都很幸运。美国本身很强大，其体系也很好，但在面对挑战者时，我认为挑战者的表现比我预想的要差。这并不意味着欧元会取代美元，但令人惊讶的是，欧元目前基本上只是一种区域性货币，在欧洲之外并非核心货币。日元几乎不被使用，人民币（renminbi）就更少了。我年纪够大，还记得俄罗斯曾被更严肃地视为经济制衡力量的时代。我们一直很幸运。我在书的结尾引用了丹麦国际象棋特级大师本·拉尔森（Bent Larsen）的话，当被问及愿意幸运还是强大时，他说：“我既想幸运又想强大。”我认为美国人忘记了幸运的那部分，只是捶着胸膛说我们是世界上最伟大的国家，人人都爱我们。所以我认为，尽管有很多趋势推动美元仍处于顶端，但它已经不像过去那样是绝对的王者了。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Is there a scenario where the dollar uh loses its status as the world reserve currency in a bit more dramatic fashion? What what could what could cause that?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 是否存在一种情景，美元会以更戏剧性的方式失去其世界储备货币的地位？什么可能导致这种情况？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** It would be great for the sales of my book with Carmen Reinhart that you mentioned at the beginning to have a crisis of that magnitude. I mean, the the the the global currency normally changes slowly. you you know you had the Spanish peseta and it's like 100 years yeah like a hundred years and there's usually you know you die a slow death over time and the newcomer comes up and you're even for a while and I I would describe the dollar as late middle-aged at the moment uh you know there's no nobody's going to take over right now but for it to actually disappear you wouldn't have seen it but there's actually a movie uh last year something like called uh Civil War where it's a dystopian not so distant future where the dollars become worthless and everybody uses the Canadian dollar instead. I don't know you know but no I don't see it happen dramatic happening dramatically.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 如果发生那种规模的危机，对我与卡门·莱因哈特（Carmen Reinhart）合著的那本书的销量将大有裨益。但全球货币的更迭通常是缓慢的。比如西班牙比塞塔（peseta），它的兴衰持续了大约一百年。通常这是一个缓慢消亡的过程，新的货币崛起，两者甚至会共存一段时间。我将目前的美元描述为“晚期中年”。眼下没有谁能取而代之。至于它完全消失，我没预见到。不过去年有部电影叫《内战》(Civil War)，描绘了一个不太遥远的敌托邦未来，美元变得一文不值，人人都改用加元了。但我不认为戏剧性的转变会发生。

**Nicolai Tangen:** How do you assess other nations efforts to decouple from the dollar then?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 那么，你如何评估其他国家与美元脱钩的努力？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, there's the uh polemic stuff like when Lula says he doesn't want to use the dollar in Brazil and he he has no power. I mean, he's not able to do anything. But I think the Chinese take it very seriously of wanting it's it's not that they want to get everyone for everything to use the renminbi their Chinese currency instead. It's that they want to expand its footprint. more things priced in Chinese currency, more loans priced in Chinese currency. And they've got a couple reasons for this. First of all, they should have done that 20 years ago. But I think what's really scared the daylights out of them is watching what the US has tried to do to Russia with the sanctions. And you know, we don't know, but China is certainly thinking about uh, you know, provoking the ire of the United States at some point by trying to take over Taiwan and looking at the sanctions. And it it isn't just, you know, it isn't just the sanctions, it's the ability of the United States to see everything.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 有些是口头上的，比如巴西总统卢拉说他不想在巴西使用美元，但他并没有实权。而我认为中国人非常认真地对待这件事。他们并非想让所有人在所有事情上都改用人民币，而是想扩大人民币的足迹，让更多商品和贷款以人民币计价。他们这么做有几个原因。首先，他们20年前就该这么做了。但真正让他们感到恐惧的是看到美国试图用制裁来对付俄罗斯。我们不知道未来会怎样，但中国肯定在考虑，如果他们试图接管台湾，可能会在某个时刻激怒美国并招致制裁。这不仅仅是制裁本身，更是美国能够监视一切的能力。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So uh official Chinese GDP growth is around 5%. Some people think it's it's lower and you are quite skeptical when it comes to the official figure as well, right?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 中国官方的GDP增长率在5%左右。有些人认为实际数字更低，你对官方数据也持怀疑态度，对吗？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Yeah, absolutely. They're throwing people in in jail for questioning the figure. They're academics who said in uh too publicly that they thought the growth was overstated and they got in trouble. What are the global implications of a Chinese economic slowdown? Well, um it's very big on uh energy exporters and commodity exporters. I mean, if you if we were to turn around and tell you that China's growth's going to be 8% the next 2 or 3 years instead of I think it's going to be 2 or 3%. Uh probably that would be very good for inflows into the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. So that's one aspect. Another aspect is the fact that they're in trouble has uh panicked their savers. We were talking about the Democrats in the United States. People in China are they have no confidence in the regime. They have they have just lost confidence. So they're trying to get people to consume, but it's just collapsed. So they're forced to do a lot of artificial stuff to create the mirage of this figure of 5%. And uh that that loss of confidence has pushed interest rates down. They actually have deflation. And by the way, if your prices are going down continually and you're telling me you have 5% growth, I don't believe you.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 是的，绝对如此。他们甚至因为质疑数据而把人送进监狱。有些学者因为过于公开地表示认为增长被夸大了而惹上麻烦。中国经济放缓的全球影响是什么？嗯，这对能源和商品出口国影响巨大。如果我们告诉你，未来两三年中国的增长率将是8%，而不是我认为的2-3%，那可能对挪威主权财富基金的资金流入非常有利。这是一方面。另一方面，中国的困境让储户感到恐慌。就像我们之前谈到的美国民主党人一样，中国人对政权失去了信心。他们正试图刺激消费，但消费已经崩溃。所以他们被迫采取许多人为措施来制造5%增长的海市蜃楼。这种信心的丧失压低了利率，他们实际上出现了通货紧缩。顺便说一句，如果物价持续下跌，你却告诉我你有5%的增长，我是不相信的。

**Nicolai Tangen:** So, do we have a some kind of japanification in China now then?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 那么，我们现在是否在中国看到了某种程度的“日本化”？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Yes, we do. The question is a matter of degree. So we those of us who work on financial crisis look at Sweden on the one end is like the fastest recovery ever and the other end is Japan which by some measures took two decades. China's Sweden time is over. That's gone. They're having a longer crisis than that. Uh it looks to me like it'll be a few more years uh to I don't I don't I think that China has a lot of things going for it but they have this over centralization of power which you know may undermine their longer term growth but it's uh you know certainly the the the deflation the slow growth the housing problem the overbuilding in infrastructure and housing the similarities are are really quite remarkable.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 是的，确实如此。问题在于程度。我们这些研究金融危机的人，一端看瑞典，它是有史以来最快的复苏；另一端看日本，它在某些方面花了二十年。中国的“瑞典时刻”已经结束了。他们正在经历比那更长的危机。在我看来，这可能还会持续几年。我认为中国有很多优势，但他们权力的过度集中可能会损害其长期增长。但无疑，通缩、增长放缓、房地产问题、基础设施和住房的过度建设，这些相似之处确实非常惊人。

## 通胀、央行独立性与未来冲击

**Nicolai Tangen:** Moving on um to inflation. Um how has your uh view on inflation changed over the last 10 years?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 接下来谈谈通货膨胀。在过去十年里，你对通胀的看法有何变化？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** So I have always thought inflation was in remission and not dead. And my academic papers have made this case. My colleagues across all of academics, I think, became in somehow mesmerized, brainwashed by central banks saying there's never going to be inflation, nothing to worry about. That assumption of no inflation is hardwired into all the top journal papers that have been coming out. I think in fact the period where inflation was really low uh the central banks were good going back to Ben Larson but they were also lucky because globalization helped the rise of China helped. There was a general consensus away from populist policies more or less and that helped. They had the they had the wind at their backs. Now they don't. And not only did they have the wind at their backs in terms of these techno factors, but the politics were leave the central bank alone. And that has been thrown by the wayside in in many countries. So inflation doesn't have to be high. The central banks can control inflation. But e economists, prognosticators, opinion makers had just forgotten that inflation's a political economy problem. And if you don't really have central bank independence, that's the core of it, you're going to periodically run into trouble.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 我一直认为通胀只是暂时缓解，并未消亡。我的学术论文也阐述了这一点。我认为，整个学术界的同事们似乎都被中央银行“永远不会有通胀，无需担心”的说法给催眠了。这种“无通胀”的假设已经固化在所有顶级期刊的论文中。事实上，在通胀极低的时期，央行表现得很好，但他们也很幸运，因为全球化和中国的崛起都起到了帮助作用。当时，社会大体上达成了远离民粹主义政策的共识，这也很有帮助。他们是顺风而行。现在，风向变了。不仅在这些技术因素上他们不再顺风，政治上也从“别干预央行”的立场上倒退了。所以，通胀不一定会很高，央行能够控制它。但经济学家、预测者和意见领袖们都忘了，通胀是一个政治经济学问题。如果你没有真正的中央银行独立性——这是核心——你就会周期性地陷入麻烦。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Is 2% uh still a realistic target?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 2%的通胀目标还现实吗？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, I mean, I uh you're asking, are they going to ever get down to 2% again? I think what I think is they will but we will see in the next my book says 5 to seven years but that was the I did the page the final day of page proof was just the day after Trump got elected I might make that a little faster now than 5 to seven years there's going to be another big burst of inflation similar to what we saw in the uh after the pandemic what's going to cause that surge what's going to cause that will be another shock where the central banks are, you know, get put into a corner where they worry about recession, they worry about inflation, but the pressures are going to be towards worrying about having a recession and they're just not going to be able to stand up to the politics the way they might have say in 2008 and 2009.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 你是在问他们是否还能再次回到2%吗？我认为他们会的，但在未来几年内——我的书里写的是5到7年，但那是在特朗普当选后一天我才完成终稿校对，现在我可能会把这个时间缩短一点——将会出现另一轮大规模的通胀爆发，类似于我们在疫情后看到的那样。导致这一飙升的将是另一次冲击，届时中央银行将被逼入困境，既要担心衰退，又要担心通胀。但政治压力将迫使他们更担心衰退，他们将无法像2008年和2009年那样顶住政治压力。

**Nicolai Tangen:** What would be the most likely trigger?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 最可能的触发因素会是什么？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well let me throw out another pandemic because that's an easy one. But I also think the possibility of a say a cyber war is not far off. And uh and just explain to us why a so cyber war will drive inflation. Well, it cuts growth and then the government uh does stuff to try to hold up consumption by spending money. Uh a debt event debt doesn't just mechanically turn into inflation. That's wrong. It either turns into higher interest rates or inflation. And at some point, you know, I think there'll be pressures to, you know, they'll they'll pack the central bank with people who we call doves. It hasn't happened, but, you know, it could. Or obviously, we have Trump here and he has said he thinks he's smarter than the central bankers. He'd like a bigger voice. A thing a lot of people don't understand is the central this the Fed is not the Supreme Court. It does not have that kind of constitutional status that the ECB does have. And it it could disappear in a week. And by the way, it isn't just Trump that wants it to disappear. The left wants it to disappear, too. They have all these plans. They want to, you know, have it print money and give it away to people. So, there's there's a lot of pressures on on the Fed's independence coming from both sides of the spectrum.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 让我举一个简单的例子：另一场大流行病。但我也认为，一场网络战争的可能性并不遥远。网络战争之所以会推高通胀，是因为它会削减增长，然后政府会通过花钱来支撑消费。债务事件本身并不会机械地转化为通胀，这种看法是错误的。它要么转化为更高的利率，要么转化为通胀。在某个时刻，我认为会出现压力，他们会把我们所说的“鸽派”人物安插到中央银行。这种情况还没发生，但有可能。显然，我们还有特朗普，他曾说他比央行行长们更聪明，他想要更大的话语权。很多人不明白的一点是，美联储不是最高法院，它不像欧洲央行（ECB）那样拥有宪法地位。它可能在一周内消失。顺便说一句，不只是特朗普想让它消失，左翼也想。他们有各种各样的计划，想让它印钱然后分发给民众。所以，美联储的独立性正受到来自政治光谱两端的巨大压力。

## 对未来的展望：AI、债务与经济学家的反思

**Nicolai Tangen:** How likely are we to see that the Fed loses its independence?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 我们看到美联储失去独立性的可能性有多大？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, that's a strong statement of, you know, loses its independence. What I would say is near-term likely, and I'm going to come back to drawing parallels between Trump and Nixon, I think after he's done with all this pseudo cutting, which isn't going to lead to that much and finally gets to the big tax uh cuts and other stimulus. And maybe by creating a recession out of thin air, Trump will have provided political cover for him to do all this stimulus. We are going to start to get inflation pressures. Trump is not going to like it. Trump is not a person who sits back and quietly takes things when he doesn't like it. I I think, and this may sound really out there, I think we're going to see Nixon like price controls like we saw in the 1970s. Maybe, you know, other kinds of controls. uh we're going to see things like we uh Reinhardt and I label financial repression which we have to some degree now since the financial crisis where banks and financial firms are forced to hold more debt at ending up at lower returns than they'd like. So I think that you know kind of wilder stuff like that is coming to a theater near you soon. I don't think we're going to wait to the fourth year of the Trump presidency for that. That stuff doesn't work indefinitely. It works for a little while and then eventually, you know, things spin out of control.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** “失去独立性”是一个很强的表述。我想说的是，短期内很可能发生一些事情。回到特朗普和尼克松的类比，我认为当他完成所有那些不会有太大成效的伪削减，并最终开始大规模减税和其他刺激措施后——也许通过凭空制造一场衰退，特朗普能为自己实施这些刺激措施找到政治掩护——我们将开始面临通胀压力。特朗普不会喜欢这个局面。他不是那种会默默忍受自己不喜欢的事情的人。我认为——这听起来可能很离谱——我们将看到像70年代尼克松那样的价格管制，或者其他类型的管制。我们会看到莱因哈特和我称之为“金融抑制”（financial repression）的现象，即银行和金融公司被迫持有更多债务，并获得低于他们期望的回报。我认为这类更疯狂的事情很快就会上演，我们不必等到特朗普总统任期的第四年。这些措施不会永远有效，它们只能在短期内起作用，最终事情会失控。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Is there a um could it be that we potentially underestimate the deflationary effect of new technology including AI? What do you think?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 我们是否可能低估了包括AI在内的新技术带来的通缩效应？你怎么看？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Absolutely we could. Um so you know it's possible that technology will produce an effect like globalization did putting downward pressure on wages and putting downward uh pressure on prices. And that's a distinct possibility. But on the other hand, I think uh AI is also going to lead to a lot of uh political tensions, uh a lot of worker displacement. So yes, there's definitely a bright side to AI and I've been arguing that for for years. back when I did the debate with Peter Teal and Gary Kasparov uh just over a decade ago, they were arguing this idea there wouldn't be growth again. And I said, I'm a chess player. I see what's going on with AI. It looks to me like it's going to be good. What worries me is that it's going to be so fast. Humans, mankind, will not be able to adjust to it. And that's what worries me right now. the uh you know the potentially chaotic change that could happen with AI. We obviously see it in warfare but we may see it in the workplace as well.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 当然有可能。技术可能会产生类似全球化的效应，给工资和价格带来下行压力。这是一个明显的可能性。但另一方面，我认为AI也将导致大量的政治紧张和工人失业。所以，AI肯定有光明的一面，我多年来也一直在强调这一点。十多年前，当我和彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）、加里·卡斯帕罗夫（Garry Kasparov）辩论时，他们认为不会再有增长了。我说，我是一个棋手，我看到了AI的发展，我觉得它会带来好处。我担心的是，它的速度会太快，人类将无法适应。这就是我现在担心的，AI可能带来的潜在混乱变革。我们显然在战争中看到了这一点，但也可能在工作场所看到。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Where are you the most different from other economists in your views now you think?

**Nicolai Tangen:** 你认为你现在在哪些观点上与其他经济学家最不相同？

**Kenneth Rogoff:** Well, where I have been different uh for some uh in many places over the years, but right now where I've been different is I was sort of all alone in arguing that real interest rates weren't going to be low forever among academic economists. people write in opinion pages. Uh I was uh alone in saying when they rise debt which seems like a free lunch today uh is not going to be I would say I was also pretty isolated in saying China was not going to grow to the moon uh that it would have a financial crisis. I think to some extent you know though uh I'm I'm still fringe on saying those things believe it or not but less so. One thing I say in my book uh is that the dollar is not going to be what you're used to. That it reached its peak and it's coming down. That is way out of consensus. And uh I again I I I think we did see some of that in the Nixon era. I think we're going to see it again. But uh you know that that I I've sort of discussed over the the our time here some of the reasons I thought that was true. It's not just the dollar is going to come down in value. I think that too, but that its footprint's going to fall. We live in a dollar dominant world. The dollar is going to stay first, but gradually its place is going to come down.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 我在很多方面都曾与众不同。但目前最不同的是，在学术经济学家中，我几乎是唯一一个认为实际利率不会永远保持低位的人。我也独自指出，当利率上升时，今天看起来像免费午餐的债务将不再是免费的。此外，我在预测中国不会无限增长并将经历金融危机方面也相当孤立。信不信由你，在这些问题上，我在某种程度上仍处于边缘，但程度有所减轻。我在书中提出的一个观点是，美元将不再是你习以为常的样子。它已经达到顶峰，正在回落。这个观点远远超出了共识。我再次认为，我们在尼克松时代看到了类似的情况，未来还会再次看到。我之前已经讨论过我持此观点的部分原因。这不仅仅是美元会贬值——我也这么认为——更是它的影响力会下降。我们生活在一个美元主导的世界，美元仍将是第一，但它的地位会逐渐下降。

**Nicolai Tangen:** Well, Ken, it's uh been amazing uh tapping into your your insights and uh and visions. So, uh, big thank you for spending time with us and, uh, very much very much look forward to to keeping in touch and I'm just so happy I don't have to face you on the, you know, on the chessboard.

**Nicolai Tangen:** Ken，能聆听你的见解和远见，真是太棒了。非常感谢你花时间和我们在一起，非常期待与你保持联系。我真庆幸自己不用在棋盘上与你对弈。

**Kenneth Rogoff:** You do fine. I I I was It's been many decades, but I look forward to speaking to you again soon.

**Kenneth Rogoff:** 你会下得很好。虽然已经几十年没下了，但我期待很快能再次与你交谈。
