### 斯多葛主义的核心定义与角色伦理

今天你们将了解到斯多葛学派眼中的“好人”意味着什么。我们将学习如何更理性地生活，过一种基于理智的生活，并以最佳方式处理我们的情绪。我是 **Massimo Pigliucci**。我是一名演化生物学家和科学哲学家。我的新书名为**《Beyond Stoicism》**，是与 Greg Lopez 和 Meredith Kunz 合著的。

Today you're going to learn a little bit about what the Stoics mean by being a good human being. We'll learn to live more rationally, to conduct a life based on reason, and to deal with our emotions in the best way we can. I am Massimo Pigliucci. I am an evolutionary biologist and a philosopher of science. And my latest book is called "Beyond Stoicism," co-authored with Greg Lopez and Meredith Kunz.

斯多葛主义是一种生活哲学，它建议过好人类生活的最佳方式是问自己：人类究竟是哪种生物？斯多葛学派对这个问题的回答是：从根本上说，我们是高度社会化且具有理性能力的生物。我们就是如此智能。据此，他们认为美好的人生在于运用理性解决问题，并以合作、亲社会的方式行事。斯多葛学派的一个关键洞见是，正如古代斯多葛哲学家 **Epictetus**（爱比克泰德）所言，我们应该关注那些“取决于我们”的事物，并试着以平和的心态接受那些“不取决于我们”的事物。换句话说，要把注意力集中在你的**能动性**（Agency: 采取行动并产生影响的能力）活跃的地方，在你做事有效力的地方，然后接受随之而来的一切，因为你实际上别无选择。斯多葛学派对生活的态度极其现实。他们试图理解人类生活是如何运作的，并努力过上尽可能最好的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Stoicism is a philosophy of life that suggests that the best way to live a human life is to ask yourself what kind of a living organism human beings are. And the answer that the Stoics give to that question is that fundamentally we are highly social and capable of reason. We're that intelligent. It follows, according to them, that a good human life is one way you use reason in order to solve problems and you behave in a cooperative, pro-social fashion. One of the crucial insights of the Stoics is that we should focus on what is up to us, as the ancient Stoic Epictetus put it, and try to accept with equanimity what is not up to us. In other words, focus where your agency is active, where you are efficacious in doing things, and then accept whatever comes as it comes because you really don't have a choice. The Stoics are nothing if not realists about life. They try to understand how human life works and they try to live the best life possible.

</details>

我们从生物学和心理学中了解到的一件事是，我们用于做事的时间和精力是有限的，无论是体力还是情感能量。因此，如果我们坚持追求那些不太可能奏效的方法，或者那些无效的方法——即我们的能动性实际上无法产生任何影响——那么我们只是在让自己痛苦。事实上，我们这是在牺牲我们本该做的其他事情。**Epictetus** 在二世纪阐述的这种斯多葛主义流派的一个有趣方面是**角色伦理**（Role Ethics）的概念。我们在生活中都扮演着不同的角色，事实上是许多角色。如果我们思考一下，例如，我的一些角色包括作为某人的儿子、某人的父亲、某人的丈夫、朋友、老师、同事，以及特定国家和特定城市的公民等等。所有这些角色本质上都需要同时处理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the things that we do understand from biology, psychology, is that we have limited time and energy to do things, both physical energy and emotional energy. And so if we insist on pursuing approaches that are likely not to work or they're not efficacious, you know, our agency doesn't really have any effect on it, then we are only making our life miserable. And in fact, we're trading off with other things that we should be doing. One of the interesting aspects of the particular brand of Stoicism, so to speak, that Epictetus articulated in the second century is this notion of role ethics. We all play different roles in life, many roles, in fact. And if we reflect on it for a minute, for instance, some of my roles include being somebody's son, being somebody's father, being somebody's husband, being a friend, being a teacher, being a colleague, being a citizen of a particular nation and of a particular city, and so on and so forth. All of these roles need to be handled essentially simultaneously.

</details>

这并不是说我可以决定某一天我只做一个同事而别的什么都不做。也许在这一刻，当我在工作并与他人互动时，我是一个同事，但与此同时，我也是一个丈夫、父亲、朋友等等。这里的理念是，我需要保存体力、情感和精神能量，以便在需要采取行动时，我能在所有这些角色中做到最好。如果我在某件特定的事情上浪费了大量的精力和时间，尤其是那些我的努力实际上无效的事情，那么我实际上是在牺牲其他所有事情。比方说，如果我因为不断阅读那些无法采取行动的新闻、那些我无能为力的事情而感到沮丧，那么结果就是我对我的家人没有用处，我对我的朋友没有用处。事实上，我对整个社会甚至对我自己都没有用处。所以这关乎保存能量，设定优先级。这回到了 **Epictetus** 的第一项训练：欲望的训练，即设定目标。根据我们的价值观，我们设定目标和优先级。这样做至关重要，否则我们最终会浪费大量时间并为此后悔。通常，当你到了后悔的地步，尤其是接近生命尽头时，那就有点太晚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's not like I can decide one day I'm gonna be just a colleague and nothing else. I am a colleague perhaps in this particular moment when I'm at work and I'm interacting with other people, but I'm at the same time also a husband, a father, a friend, et cetera, et cetera. And the idea here is that I need to conserve both physical, and emotional, mental energy so that I can do my best in all of these roles whenever it is that I need to do something about it. If I'm going to waste a lot of energy and time on a particular thing, especially something that for which my efforts are in fact not efficacious, then I'm really trading off with everything else. I am getting depressed, let's say, by just constantly reading the news about things that are not actionable, about things that I cannot do anything about. Well, the result of that is then I'm not useful to my family, I'm not useful to my friends. I'm not in fact useful to society in general and even to myself. So it's about conserving energy, setting priorities. This goes back to the the first discipline of Epictetus, the discipline of desire, setting goals. Depending on our values, we set goals and we set priorities. And doing so is crucial because otherwise we end up wasting a lot of time and then regretting it. And usually, when you get to the point of regret, especially near the end of your life, it's a little too late.

</details>

### 尤代莫尼亚与世界主义

**Seneca**（塞内卡）在他写给朋友 Lucilius 的一封信中指出，太多人直到生命尽头才开始反思他们想做什么以及为什么做，那时已经太晚了，因为他们已经做完了大部分原本要做的事。斯多葛主义是在希腊化时期演变而来的希腊-罗马哲学之一，其目标是过一种 **Eudaemonic**（尤代莫尼亚式的）生活。**Eudaemonia** 是一个希腊词，大致意思是“值得过的生活”，一种当你走到尽头时会说：“是的，那没有浪费时间”的生活。不同的希腊化流派，如伊壁鸠鲁学派或怀疑论者，对什么构成 **Eudaemonic** 生活有不同的答案。根据斯多葛学派的观点，过这种生活意味着明智地、聪明地和社交地生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Seneca points out in one of his letters to his friend Lucilius that too many people start reflecting on what they want to do and why near the end of their lives, when it's too late, when they're already done most of what they were going to do. Stoicism is one of the Greco-Roman philosophies that evolved during the Hellenistic period, and the goal is to live a eudaemonic life. Eudaemonia is a word that in Greek means, roughly speaking, a life worth living, a kind of life that you get to the end of it and you say, "Yeah, that was not wasted time." Now, different Hellenistic schools, like the Epicureans, for instance, or the Skeptics, had different answers to what constitutes a eudaemonic life. According to the Stoics, living a eudaemonic life means living intelligently, smartly, and socially.

</details>

因为斯多葛主义的一个基本方面是我们应该过一种亲社会的生活，即一种我们与他人互动的生活，因为我们天生就是一种社会性生物，所以斯多葛学派非常强调人际关系、我们在社会中的角色，以及相对于他人而言什么是好事或坏事。事实上，他们甚至宣称自己是**世界主义者**（Cosmopolitan）。成为世界主义者意味着成为人类世界城邦（Cosmopolis）、即普遍人类城市的一员。根据斯多葛学派的观点，地球上的每个人都是我们的兄弟姐妹，我们应该据此对待他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Because one of the fundamental aspects of Stoicism is that we should live a pro-social life, that is, a life where we interact with other people, because we are naturally a social organism, then the Stoics put a lot of emphasis on relationships with people, on our roles in society, what is it that is a good thing or not thing to do with respect to other people. In fact, they went so far as declaring themselves cosmopolitan. Being a cosmopolitan means being a member of the human cosmopolite, the human city, the universal human city. According to the Stoics, every human being on Earth is our brother and sister, and we should treat them accordingly.

</details>

### 斯多葛主义的三大训练与课程体系

生活在二世纪初的古代斯多葛哲学家 **Epictetus** 提出了学习和实践斯多葛主义的三个基本训练。它们通常被称为：**欲望的训练**（Discipline of Desire）、**行动的训练**（Discipline of Action）和**认同的训练**（Discipline of Assent）。不过我要提醒你们，与原始希腊语相比，这些英文术语有点误导性。例如，“欲望”并不意味着我此刻想要什么。它意味着我的价值观以及我的反价值观，即我认为生活中重要和美好的事物，以及生活中不重要或糟糕的事物。欲望的训练教导我们要批判性地重新评估我们的价值观，根据良好的价值观重新定位自己，并就这些价值观是什么以及为什么是这些价值观做出深思熟虑的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The ancient Stoic Epictetus, who lived at the beginning of the second century, laid out three fundamental disciplines for the study and practice of Stoicism. They're referred to normally as the discipline of desire, the discipline of action, and the discipline of assent, although I should warn you that the English terms are a little bit misleading compared to the original Greek. Desire, for instance, doesn't mean whatever I fancy at the moment. It means my values and also my disvalues, that is, the kinds of things that I think are important and good in life and the kind of things that are not important or bad in life. The discipline of desire teaches us to reevaluate critically our values, to reorient ourselves according to good values, to make deliberate decisions about what those values are and why.

</details>

第二个训练，行动的训练，顾名思义，与对他人的行为有关。我们生活在一个社会中。我们不仅仅是认同某些价值观，每当我们做某事或说某事时，尤其是在对他人时，我们都在践行这些价值观。所以行动的训练是关于当我们在整个社会中与其他人类互动时，如何将我们的价值观付诸实践。最后是认同的训练。认同当然意味着同意。但对 **Epictetus** 来说，这意味着仔细且理性地思考前两个训练，关于价值观以及如何实施它们。所以从某种意义上说，认同的训练是关于让这一切流畅而顺滑地进行，以至于根据斯多葛学派的说法，我们实际上拥有了顺畅流动的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The second discipline, the discipline of action, has to do, as the name implies, with acting toward other people. We live in a society. We don't just subscribe to certain values, we enact those values every time that we do something or say something, especially to other people. So the discipline of action is about putting into practice our values when we interact in society at large with other human beings. Finally, the discipline of assent. Assent means of course agreement. But for Epictetus that means thinking carefully and rationally about the other two disciplines, about values and how to implement them. So the discipline of assent in a sense is about making all of this flow so nicely and so smoothly that we have in fact, according to the Stoics, a smoothly flowing life.

</details>

这三个训练是实践斯多葛主义的方法，但斯多葛主义当然是一种哲学，所以背后也有理论。为了理解斯多葛理论，我们需要参考任何斯多葛课程中典型的三个研究领域。如果你去一所斯多葛学校，比如 **Epictetus** 在二世纪希腊西北部开办的学校，在你接触到这些训练和如何生活之前，你实际上会先学习与这些训练相关的三个一般领域。在这里，英文名称也有点误导性。它们是**物理学**（Physics）、**伦理学**（Ethics）和**逻辑学**（Logic）。但它们的确切含义与现代英语略有不同，所以我们需要小心。例如，物理学来自 *physis*，意思是自然。所以当我说物理学时，不要想量子力学或广义相对论之类的东西，要想一般的科学，即对世界如何运作的良好理解。这与欲望的训练有关，即处理我们在生活中的目标和优先级的训练。为什么？因为我们在生活中的目标和优先级取决于我们是什么样的生物。如果我们是不同种类的生物，比如火星人、狗或狮子，我们会有不同的优先级。所以这是关于理解世界原本的运作方式。而理解世界本来面目的最好方法是通过科学。所以你学习科学是为了探究你自己的目标和优先级。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The three disciplines are a way to implement Stoicism in practice, but Stoicism of course is a philosophy, so there's also a theory behind it. And in order to understand Stoic theory, we need to refer to the three areas of study that were typical in any Stoic curriculum. If you went to a Stoic school, let's say the school that was run by Epictetus in Northwestern Greece in the second century, you would actually study, before you get to the disciplines and how to live your life, you would study the three general areas that are pertinent to those disciplines. Now, there too, the English names are a little bit misleading. They are physics, ethics, and logic. But what they mean exactly is something a little bit different from modern English, and so we need to be careful here. Physics, for instance, comes from physis, which means nature. So when I say physics, don't think quantum mechanics, or general relativity, or things like that, think science in general, so a good understanding of how the world works. That's connected to the discipline of desire, that is, to the discipline that deals with our goals and priorities in life. Why? Because our goals and priorities in life depend on what kind of living organism we are. If we were a different kind, you know, a martian, or a dog, or a lion, we would have different priorities. So it's about understanding the world as it works. And the best way to understand the world as it is is through science. So you study science in order to investigate into your own goals and priorities.

</details>

如今，伦理学主要意味着对正确和错误行为的研究。但对于斯多葛学派或一般的古希腊罗马人来说，伦理学有着更广泛的含义。它的字面意思是研究如何过你的生活。所以它不仅仅是关于某个特定行为是对还是错，它还关于你执行特定行为的动机。它们是好的动机还是不好的动机？它关于你生活中的优先级、你的目标、你与他人相处的方式等等。第二个行动的训练与伦理学有关。行动是关于与他人打交道，伦理学是关于如何生活。既然我们是社会动物，这两者密切相关。我们过着社会生活。我们不住在荒岛上。当我们独自一人时，我们过得并不好。在某些情况下，我们也许可以独自生存，但我们只有在社会中才能茁壮成长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

These days, ethics means mostly the study of right and wrong actions. But for the Stoics or for the ancient Greco-Romans in general, ethics had, again, a much broader meaning. It meant literally the study of how to live your life. So it's not just about whether a particular action is right or wrong, it's also about your motivations for carrying out a particular action. Are they good motivations or not good motivations? It's about your priorities in life, your goals, the way you relate to other people, and so on and so forth. The second discipline of action is connected with ethics. Action is about dealing with other people, ethics is about how to live a life. Since we're a social animal, the two are very closely related. We live a social life. We don't live on deserted islands. We don't do very well when we are on our own. We can survive perhaps on our own under certain circumstances, but we only thrive in a society.

</details>

当我说逻辑学时，大多数人开始想到逻辑谜题、悖论之类的东西。这没问题，那是其中的一部分。但根据斯多葛学派的观点，逻辑学总体上是对良好思维的研究。所以它也包括我们今天所说的认知科学，对认知偏差的理解，以及对人们的思维为何会以这样或那样的方式出错的理解。所以它比逻辑学的技术领域要广泛得多。认同（Assent）是关于完善我们对前两个训练的理解和实践。换句话说，它是关于运用良好的判断力，因此它是关于逻辑学的。它是关于理解人类推理是如何运作的，以及它是如何出错的，以便我们尽可能避免错误，并努力尽可能理性、合理地思考，然后将这种方法应用到日常生活中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

When I say logic, most people start thinking about logical puzzles, and paradoxes, and things like that. And that's fine, that is part of it. But logic according to the Stoics is in general the study of good thinking. So it includes also what we would today call cognitive science, the understanding of cognitive biases and the understanding of why people's thinking can go wrong one way or the other. So it's much broader than the technical field of logic. Assent. Assent is about refining our understanding and practice of the first two disciplines. In other words, it's about using good judgment, and therefore it's about logic. It's about understanding how human reasoning works and also how it can go wrong so that we avoid as much as possible mistakes and we're trying to think as much as we can in a rational, reasonable way, and then implement that kind of approach into daily life.

</details>

### 斯多葛主义有效吗？（与 CBT 的联系）

关于斯多葛主义的一个显而易见的问题是：它有效吗？如果你仔细想想，一方面，这是一个有点奇怪的问题，因为我们谈论的是一种哲学。我们不是在谈论像今天理解的那种科学的生活方法。例如，很少有人会问，基督教有效吗？或者佛教有效吗？然而，他们可能会问，祈祷有效吗？或者冥想有效吗？换句话说，是与某些宗教或哲学相关的技术。在这些情况下，问自己“它有效吗？”是有意义的。这是否是一种完全独立于哲学理论部分、实际上具有经验证据的东西？所以同样的问题也可以合理地问斯多葛主义。我们有一系列证据表明斯多葛技术、斯多葛式的良好生活方法确实有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the obvious questions that come up with Stoicism is does it work? Which, if you think about it, on the one hand, it's a little bit of a weird question because we're talking about a philosophy. We're not talking about, you know, a scientific approach to life as we understand it today. Very few people, for instance, would ask the question, well, does Christianity work or does Buddhism work? However, they might ask, do prayers work or does meditation work? In other words, the techniques associated with certain religions or philosophies. In those cases, it does make sense to ask yourself, well, does it work? Is it something that, quite independently of the theoretical part of the philosophy, does it actually have empirical evidence? So the same question can be asked reasonably about Stoicism. We have a series of lines of evidence that Stoic techniques, the Stoic approach to a good life, does in fact work.

</details>

第一点是，斯多葛主义在 1960 年代催生了现在被称为**认知行为疗法**（Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT）的疗法。在纽约，像 **Aaron Beck** 和 **Albert Ellis** 这样的作者开始实践这种类型的心理治疗，这也是今天证据最充分的心理治疗类型之一。他们是从斯多葛主义开始的。他们都读过 **Marcus Aurelius**（马可·奥勒留）、**Epictetus** 和其他斯多葛学派的著作，他们认为，哦，这些人发现了一些东西，有些东西是可以奏效的，非常实用，实际上可以帮助人们。当然，今天所知的 CBT 在过去的几十年里经历了一系列的变化和演变。CBT 是基于经验的，有大量的研究表明它确实有效。所以这并不等同于问斯多葛主义是否有效，但这非常接近于问斯多葛技术是否有效，因为古代斯多葛学派基于他们对人类心理和人性的直觉设计和开发的许多技术，事实证明实际上是有效的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The first one is that Stoicism originated what is now known as cognitive behavioral therapy back in the 1960s. In New York, authors like Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis started to practice this type of psychotherapy, which today is one of the best evidence-based type of psychotherapies. And they started from Stoicism. They both read Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and other Stoics, and they thought, oh, these people were onto something here, that there is something that can work, that is very practical, that can actually help people. Of course, CBT as is known today went then through a series of changes and evolution over the last several decades. CBT is empirically based, that there is lots of studies, empirical studies, that show that it does work. So it's not the same as asking whether Stoicism work, but it's pretty close to asking whether Stoic techniques work because a lot of the techniques that the ancient Stoics designed and developed on the basis of their intuition about human psychology and human nature, it turns out, are actually efficacious.

</details>

所以这是斯多葛主义在某种意义上有效的一条证据线索。还有越来越多的关于一般认知科学的论文，不仅仅是认知行为疗法，而是关于大脑如何运作、人类决策是如何进行的等等。我的理解是，大部分研究如果不是直接支持斯多葛技术，那肯定也是兼容的，高度兼容的。例如，现代心理学家和目前的科学家已经发展出一种关于理性与情绪关系的理论，这与斯多葛学派思考理性与情绪之间联系的方式非常相似。最后，现在开始有关于斯多葛技术功效的直接研究。斯多葛主义已经足够流行，以至于心理学家开始系统地研究具体的斯多葛技术是否有效。例如，我的同事 Tim Lebon，他是一名心理治疗师，最近刚刚发表了首批论文之一，至少显示了初步证据表明，是的，斯多葛技术似乎确实对行为和人们的思维方式产生了斯多葛学派认为应该产生的那种影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So that's one line of evidence that Stoicism in a sense works. There is also an increasing number of papers out there on cognitive science in general, not just cognitive behavioral therapy, but cognitive science in general, how the brain works, how human decision making is carried out, and so on and so forth. And my understanding is that much of that research is, if not in direct support of Stoic techniques, it certainly is compatible, highly compatible with it. For instance, modern psychologists and currently scientists have developed a theory of the relationship between reason and emotions that is very similar to the way in which the Stoics were thinking about the connection between reason and emotion. And then finally, there now begins to be direct studies about the efficacy of Stoic techniques. Stoicism is popular enough that psychologists have begun to look systematically into whether specifically Stoic techniques work or don't. For instance, one of my colleagues, Tim Lebon, who is a psychotherapist, has just published recently one of the first papers that shows at least preliminary evidence that, yes, indeed, Stoic techniques seem to have the kind of effects on behavior and on the way people think that the Stoics thought they should have.

</details>

### 建立个人生活哲学

斯多葛主义是一种生活哲学。如果你仔细想想，这是一个有趣的概念。首先什么是生活哲学？我们需要生活哲学吗？我遇到过一些人告诉我他们不需要生活哲学，他们只是过自己的生活。我指出，那就是一种生活哲学。没有哲学是无法生活的。这种哲学可能不是有意识的，它可能不是你自己深思熟虑的结果，你知道，关注你在做什么以及为什么做。但如果我观察你的行为，如果我看到你的选择、你的优先级、你的价值观等等，我可以把它们放在一起说：“好吧，这个人的生活哲学是这个。它是支撑他们选择、价值观、优先级和行为的结果。”所以我们都有生活哲学。如果这是真的，那么我们不妨意识到它，觉察到它，甚至可能至少偶尔问问自己，这是一种好的生活哲学吗？我需要改变什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Stoicism is a philosophy of life. And that, if you think about it, it's a interesting concept. What is a philosophy of life in the first place? Do we need a philosophy of life? I encounter people that tell me that they don't need a philosophy of life, they just live their life. And I point out that that is a philosophy of life. There is no way to live a life without a philosophy. That philosophy might not be conscious, it may not be the result of deliberations that you did with yourself, you know, paying attention to what you're doing and why. But if I observe your behavior, if I see what your choices are, your priorities, your values, and so on and so forth, I can put 'em all together and say, "Okay, this person's philosophy of life is this. It's the result or it's whatever underpins their choices, their values, their priorities, and their behavior." So we all have a philosophy of life. If that's true, well, we might as well then be conscious of it, and be aware of it, and possibly, even occasionally at least, ask ourselves, well, is this a good philosophy of life or not? Do I need to change something?

</details>

所以有人可能会被诱惑走向另一个极端，说：“哦，如果我需要一种生活哲学，我就从架子上拿一个。这是斯多葛主义，我听说它是个好东西。让我选斯多葛主义。从现在起，我就是斯多葛派，就这样，故事结束。”但这在某种意义上也是危险的，因为现在你在盲目地追随某人在 2000 年前或 2300 年前说的话，而不一定把事情想清楚，不问自己：“这东西真的有意义吗？它适合我想过的生活方式吗？如果不适合，为什么？”所以一方面，存在着没有意识到自己生活哲学的危险。另一方面也存在着相反的危险，即不加质疑地从架子上拿走某种东西，而不运用自己的批判性判断来判断那东西是否真的有意义、有用、有效等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So one might be tempted then to go to the opposite extreme and say, "Oh, if I need a philosophy of life, I'm gonna pick one off the shelf. Here's Stoicism, I heard that it's a good thing. Let me pick Stoicism. From now on, I'm a Stoic, and that's it, end of the of the story." But that is also dangerous in a sense because now you are blindly following what somebody said 2,000 years ago or 2,300 years ago without necessarily thinking things through, without asking yourself, "Well, does this thing actually make sense? Does it fit the way I want to live my life? And if not, why not?" So there is, on the one hand, a danger of not being aware of one's own philosophy of life. There's also the opposite danger of sort of taking something off the shelf without questioning, without exercising one's own critical judgment about whether that thing actually makes sense, it's useful, works, et cetera.

</details>

那么还有第三种选择。有些人说：“哦，我要用不同选择的碎片来建立我自己的生活哲学。我听说斯多葛主义有用，我要从斯多葛主义中取点东西。我听说伊壁鸠鲁主义有用，我要从中取点东西。我的一些朋友是佛教徒。也许我可以从佛教徒那里借点东西。”这当然是可以做到的。这通常被称为**折衷主义**（Eclecticism）。但这也有它自己的问题，因为你最终可能会得到一堆大杂烩，当它们放在一起时没有任何意义。这些哲学之所以内部连贯是有原因的，人们为了使它们内部连贯已经研究了数千年。例如，虽然斯多葛学派自己承认伊壁鸠鲁主义中有一些有用的东西，并且他们实际上将伊壁鸠鲁主义的某些方面纳入了他们的哲学，但归根结底，一个人不能同时既是斯多葛派又是伊壁鸠鲁派。为什么不呢？因为对于斯多葛派来说，最重要的价值是一个人的美德，即一个人的品格。快乐是次要的。对于伊壁鸠鲁派来说，最重要的价值是快乐。一个人的品格、一个人的美德实际上只是通往快乐生活的工具。所以归根结底，可能会有你必须做出选择的情况。是选择快乐还是选择品格？如果你选择一种方式，你就是伊壁鸠鲁派；如果你选择另一种方式，你就是斯多葛派，无论你是否意识到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, then there is a third option. Some people say, "Oh, I'm gonna build my own philosophy of life out of bits and pieces from different choices. So I heard that Stoicism is useful, I'm gonna take something from Stoicism. I heard that Epicureanism is useful, I'm gonna take something from that. Some of my friends are Buddhists. Perhaps I could borrow something from Buddhists." That is certainly something that can be done. It's usually referred to as Eclecticism. But yet it's also got its own problems because you might end up with a mishmash of things that don't make any sense when they're brought together. There is a reason why these philosophies are internally coherent, and people have worked on them for thousands of years in order to make them internally coherent. For instance, although the Stoics themselves acknowledged that there is something useful in Epicureanism, and they actually incorporated aspects of Epicureanism into their philosophy, at the end of the day, one cannot be simultaneously a Stoic and an Epicurean. Why not? Because the most important value for a Stoic is one's own virtue, meaning one's own character. Pleasure is secondary. The most important value for an Epicurean is pleasure. One's character, one's virtues, are actually only instrumental to a life of pleasure. So at the end of the day, there may be situations where you had to choose. Is it gonna be pleasure or is it gonna be character? And if you choose one way you're an Epicurean, and if you choose another way you're a Stoic, whether you're aware of it or not.

就我个人而言，我认为自己主要是一个斯多葛派，这意味着斯多葛哲学作为一个整体有许多我认为非常有价值的东西，它们经过了深思熟虑，我已经采纳它们作为至少一种临时的生活导航方式。但我也非常被另一种古希腊罗马哲学所吸引，即**怀疑论**（Skepticism），它与我们是易犯错的这一概念有关。我们不知道大写的真理（Truth）。充其量，我们可以对什么有效或无效、什么是真的和不是真的做出合理的猜测、概率性的猜测。因此，我们应该始终意识到，无论我们做什么，我们都可能错了。无论我们想什么，我们都可能错了。所以我用一点怀疑论来调和我的斯多葛主义。事实上，我用一点被称为**哲学悲观主义**（Philosophical Pessimism）的东西来调和我的斯多葛怀疑论。这是一种观念，即世界上可能没有宏大的叙事。没有普遍的计划。历史没有终结。无论是在我们的生活中还是作为整个社会，都没有必然的轨迹。一切都是关于此时此地发生的事情，它们没有韵律或理由。所以我把所有这些东西放在一起，形成了我认为相当连贯的哲学。这不是我的发明，但与此同时，这也不完全是你能在任何特定其他作者那里找到的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

In my own case, I think of myself as mostly a Stoic, meaning that there are a number of things in Stoic philosophy as a whole that I think are very valuable, they're very well thought out, and I have adopted them as at least a provisional way of navigating my own life. But I am also very much attracted by another ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Skepticism, which has to do with the notion that we're fallible. We don't know the truth with the capital T. At best, we can make reasonable guesses, probabilistic guesses, about what works or what doesn't work, what is true and what is not true. And we should therefore always be aware that no matter what we do, we may be mistaken. No matter what we think, we might be mistaken. So I temper my Stoicism with a little bit of Skepticism. And in fact, I temper my Stoic Skepticism with a little bit of something that is called philosophical pessimism. This is the notion that there are probably no grand narratives in the world. There is no universal plan. There is no end to history. There is no inevitable trajectory that we go either in our lives or as society as a whole. It's all about things happening here and now and there is no rhyme or reason to them. So I put all these things together into what to me feels like a reasonably coherent philosophy. It's not my invention, and yet at the same time, it's not exactly anything that you find specifically in any particular other author.

</details>

例如，我会建议的一件事是，一定要阅读原始文本。但这也没那么简单，因为有无数的译本。有时如果你阅读同一本书的不同译本，感觉就像是一本不同的书。**Marcus Aurelius** 的**《沉思录》**有些版本读起来真的感觉像是与其他译本不同的书。所以需要小心。较新的译本、更现代的译本通常更好。例如，我最喜欢的一些译本是由一位名叫 **Robin Waterfield** 的古典学者翻译的，他翻译了 **Marcus Aurelius** 和 **Epictetus**。芝加哥大学出版社出版了 **Seneca** 所有著作的宏大版本。花点钱。毕竟，如果我们谈论的是你想作为生活哲学来追求的东西，那么花几块钱去真正弄对它，或者尽可能弄对它是值得的。这些现代版本的一个优点是它们有很多注释，这些注释会帮助你，会引导你理解这些人到底在说什么，因为它们将这些概念置于其哲学和历史背景中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One thing that I would suggest, for instance, is certainly read the original texts. But even that is not that simple because there are countless translations. And sometimes if you read the same book in different translations, it almost feels like a different book. There are versions of Marcus Aurelius's "Meditations" that really feel like a different book from some other translations. So one needs to be careful. The more recent translations, the more modern translations, are better. Some of my favorite, for instance, are by a Classicist named Robin Waterfield, who has translated both Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. The University of Chicago Press has made a huge edition of all of the writings of Seneca. Invest a little bit of money. After all, if we're talking about something that you wanna pursue as a philosophy of life, it's worth investing a few bucks to actually get it right or as right as possible. One of the advantages of these modern editions is that they have a lot of notes, and the notes will help you, will guide you, through understanding what exactly these people are saying because they're putting those notions in their philosophical, as well as historical context.

</details>

但另一件事是，我经常听到人们说：“哦，我只读原始文本。忘掉所有这些现代作者吧，”包括在下，“他们写的关于斯多葛主义的东西。”我认为这是一个错误。我的意思是，这可能听起来像是一个自私的错误，因为正如我所说，我是这些作者之一。但尽管如此，我认为这是一个错误。我自己也利用了现代作者的著作，因为斯多葛主义是古老的。它有 2300 年，几乎 2400 年的历史。它需要解释，它需要更新。而这种解释、这些更新需要由真正知道自己在说什么的人仔细完成。所以，例如，我会拿起一本由我的朋友和同事 **Donald Robertson** 写的书。Robertson 是一名认知行为治疗师。那是他研究斯多葛主义的方法。**Bill Irvine** 是一名古典学者，**John Sellars** 也是。这些是你可以信任的一些最好的现代斯多葛作者。这些人真正知道自己在说什么。所有这些作者都写了非常非常通俗易懂的书，可以用来深入挖掘作为现代生活哲学的斯多葛主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But the other thing is, I hear often, people say, "Oh, I'm just going to read the story text. Forget all of these modern authors," including yours truly, "who are writing about Stoicism." I think that's a mistake. I mean, that may come across as a self-serving mistake since, as I said, I'm one of those authors. But nevertheless, I think it is a mistake. I myself took advantage of the writings of modern authors because again Stoicism is ancient. It's 2,300, almost 2,400 years old. It needs interpretation, it needs updates. And that interpretation, those updates, need to be done carefully by people who actually know what they're talking about. So, for instance, I would pick up a book by my friend and colleagues, Donald Robertson. Robertson is a cognitive behavioral therapist. That's his approach to Stoicism. Bill Irvine is a Classicist, and so is John Sellars. Those are some of the best modern Stoic authors that you can trust. These are people who actually know what they're talking about. And all of these authors have written very, very accessible books that can be used to dig deeper into Stoicism as a modern philosophy of life.

### 斯多葛工具箱：情绪与认知重构

我要试着教你们一些基本的斯多葛技术，希望能让你们的生活在长期内变得更好，甚至可能在非常短的时间内，因为许多斯多葛技术往往几乎立即见效。在练习几天或几周后，你自己就能看到不同。也许没有比从理性与情绪之间的联系开始更好的方式了。我们如何处理情绪？情绪当然是人类体验的一大部分。它们是不可避免的。即使我们想避免它们，我们也做不到。它们是我们生物学和心理学的内在组成部分。有时它们是有用的。例如，它们是警钟。它们提醒我们某些事情是对的还是错的。有时它们会欺骗我们，制造问题。它们推动我们以一种以后会后悔的方式做出反应。斯多葛学派对情绪思考了很多。所有主要的斯多葛作者都写过关于情绪的文章，也许没有人比生活在一世纪的罗马参议员 **Seneca** 写得更多。他写了一本我认为是有史以来关于情绪最好的书之一。它叫**《论愤怒》**（On Anger）。它专注于那种特定的情绪，因为它很重要。我们在不同的条件下都会经历愤怒。我们都会以一种由愤怒驱动的方式做出反应。有时我们会后悔自己的行为方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I'm gonna try to teach you a few basic Stoic techniques that hopefully are gonna make your life better in the long run, maybe even in the very short run because a lot of Stoic techniques tend to be efficacious almost immediately. You can see the difference yourself after a few days or a few weeks of practice. And perhaps there is no better way to start than with the connection between reason and emotions. How do we deal with emotions? Emotions are a big part, of course, of the human experience. They are inevitable. Even if we wanted to avoid them, we cannot. They are an intrinsic part of our biology and our psychology. Sometimes they're useful. They are alarm bells, for instance. They alert us to certain things going right or going wrong. Sometimes they deceive us and they create problems. They push us to react in ways that then we're later going to regret. The Stoics thought quite a bit about emotions. All of the major Stoic authors write about emotions, perhaps none more than Seneca, who was a Roman senator who lived in the first century. He wrote one of the best books on emotions, I think, ever written. It's called "On Anger." And it focuses on that particular emotion because it's important. We all experience anger under different conditions. We all react in a way that is driven by anger. And sometimes we regret the way we have acted.

</details>

所以让我们试着理解斯多葛学派实际上对此说了什么。基本的想法是，情绪实际上并不与理性截然不同或截然分开。很多人似乎认为理性是一回事，情绪是另一回事，它们有时会相互冲突。所以理性可能必须克服情绪，或者如果你是一个所谓的感性的人，你实际上更喜欢反过来。但实际上，这两者实际上是高度互联的。这是古代斯多葛学派的一个洞见，一个直觉，它得到了现代认知科学的明确证实。我们知道，许多人类情绪起源的解剖区域是杏仁核，它是大脑的基部。我们也知道，我们的推理能力主要驻留在大脑的额顶叶。但我们也知道，这两个区域是大规模互联的。实际上有数十亿条神经纤维在两者之间来回穿梭，因此不存在独立于你思考方式的情绪反应，也不存在独立于你情绪反应的思考。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So let's try to understand what the Stoics actually say about this. The fundamental idea is that emotions are not in fact distinct or sharply distinct from reason. A lot of people seem to think that reason is one thing and emotion's another thing, and they're sometimes in conflict with each other. So reason might have to overcome emotions or perhaps if you are a so-called emotional person, you actually prefer the other way around. But in reality, the two are actually highly interconnected. And this is one insight, one intuition of the ancient Stoics, that is definitely confirmed by modern cognitive science. We do know that the anatomical area from where human emotions, many human emotions, originate is the amygdala, which is the base of the brain. And we do know that our reasoning faculty resides mostly in the frontal parietal lobes of the brain. But we also know that those two areas are massively interconnected. There are literally billions of neuronal fibers that go back and forth between the two so that there is no such a thing as an emotional response independent of the way you think, and there is no such a thing as thinking independently of your emotional reactions.

</details>

好吧，如果那是真的，斯多葛学派说，这就是你与情绪建立更好关系的关键。你需要做的是一个两步或三步的过程，从认知开始。它始于在你进入任何可能情绪复杂的情况之前仔细思考你想做什么以及为什么。一旦你在思维方面做好了准备，你就试着按照那种特定的思维方式行事。如果你认为一件事是对的或错的，那么大概你会想根据那个判断行事。正是这种认知和行为的结合，一遍又一遍地重复，最终会影响你的情绪，渗透到情绪层面，实际上会改变你的情绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, if that's true, the Stoics say there is your key to a better relationship with your emotions. What you need to do is a two or three-step process that begins with cognition. It begins with thinking carefully before you get into any situation that might be emotionally complex about what you want to do and why. Once you set the stage in terms of thinking, then you try to behave accordingly to that particular way of thinking. If you think that one thing is right or wrong, then presumably you will want to behave according to that judgment. And it's this combination of cognition and behavior repeated over and over and over that eventually affects your emotions, sinks in at the emotional level, and in fact will alter your emotions.

</details>

让我给你举个例子。假设有人侮辱你。**Epictetus** 在他的著作中谈了很多关于侮辱以及处理侮辱的方法。我们大多数人会对侮辱感到不安，事实上我们可能会做出反应。我们开始升级事态。你感到肾上腺素激增，你变得愤怒。这家伙竟敢这样跟我说话。然后你开始提高嗓门，然后升级为对抗，甚至可能是肢体冲突。斯多葛学派会说，好吧，在所有这些之前，这样想一想。侮辱到底是什么？侮辱是某人张开嘴，说出某些词。这些词传到你的耳朵里。你以某种方式解释它们。因为那种解释，你做出了反应。换句话说，是你的思维，是你的认知作为第一步。如果你认为这是不可接受的，这是一种侮辱，那个人竟敢那样跟我说话，那么你的情绪就会随之而来。那么你现在就是在助长你的愤怒。你在助长你对这些话的攻击性反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Let me give you an example. Let's say that somebody insults you. Epictetus talks a lot in his writings about insults and ways to deal with insults. And most of us would get upset at an insult and in fact we would probably react. We start escalating things. You feel that rush of adrenaline, you're getting angry. How dare this person talk to me in this way. And then you start raising your voice and then it escalates into a confrontation, possibly even a physical confrontation. The Stoics would say, well, before all of that, think about it this way. What exactly is an insult? An insult is somebody opening their mouth, saying certain words. Those words arrive to your ears. You interpret them in a certain way. And because of that interpretation, you react. In other words, it's your thinking, it's your cognition that is the first step. If you think this is unacceptable, this is an insult, how dare the person talk to me like that, then your emotions will follow. Then you're now fueling your anger. You're fueling your aggressive reaction to those words.

</details>

但如果不那样走，你对自己说，侮辱什么都不是，它只是流动的空气。它实际上并没有触碰到我。它实际上没有对我做任何事。如果那个人在说一些关于我的侮辱性的话，那意味着什么？好吧，要么那个人是对的，也许他用一种笨拙的方式表达他的意见，但他实际上是对的，在这种情况下，我为什么要为此感到不安？如果有人是对的，并且他在纠正我，那么我接受那个建议，接受那个观察并为此做点什么是一件好事。或者那个人错了，在这种情况下，那是他的问题，不是我的。我不是那个错的人。他是那个错的人。他应该为此担心，而不是我。所以无论哪种方式，不做出反应都在我的能力范围内，因为向我自己重新构建这种情况并在想“这不是侮辱。这只是空气反弹，它实际上并没有触碰到我。它实际上并没有伤害我”是在我的能力范围内的。一旦你那样做，你现在就在降低你的情绪反应，因为你的情绪会做出反应，会跟随你对情况的思考方式。如果你认为你被冒犯了，你的情绪会升级。如果你认为，哦，这很有趣，这真的很荒谬。那个人不知道他在让自己难堪吗？那么你的情绪就会走向不同的方向。它会降级。你不会生气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But if instead of going that way, you say to yourself an insult is nothing, it's just air moving around. It doesn't actually touch me. It doesn't actually do anything to me. If that person is saying something about me that is insulting, what does that mean? Well, either that person is right, and maybe he's expressing his opinion in a clumsy way, but he's actually right, in which case, why am I going to be upset about it? If somebody is right and it's setting me right, then it's a good thing for me to accept that counsel, to accept that observation and do something about it. Or the person in question is wrong, in which case, that's his problem, not mine. I'm not the one in wrong. He is the one that is wrong. He should be concerned with it, not I. So either way, it is in my power not to react because it is in my power to reframe the situation to myself and think, this is not an insult. This is just air bouncing off and it doesn't actually touch me. It doesn't actually hurt me. Once you do that, you're now deescalating your emotional response because your emotions will react, will go along, with whatever way you're thinking about the situation. If you're thinking that you're being offended, your emotions will escalate. If you're thinking that, oh, this is funny, this is really ridiculous. Doesn't the person in question know that he's embarrassing himself? Then your emotions will go in a different direction. It will deescalate. You're not gonna get angry.

### 哲学日记与自我反思

当然，这说起来容易做起来难。这不会在你第一次尝试时就发生。但这里的关键是不断问自己，这里到底发生了什么，什么是好的反应？对正在发生的事情什么可能是一个好的反应？一旦你那样向自己重新构建了正在发生的事情，你的情绪最终会跟随。处理正在发生的情况的问题在于，之后我们没有做好心理准备。所以我们在当下做出反应，然后也许我们误判了情况，我们的情绪开始失控，然后我们后来后悔我们所做的或所说的。所以斯多葛学派有一个非常重要的技术来帮助我们为困难情况做好准备，处理困难情况。这种技术有很多名字。通常它被称为**哲学日记**（Philosophical Journaling）。我说哲学是因为这是一种特定类型的日记。这不是那种你只是写下“哦，今天我去做了这个或那个，很有趣”之类的日记。这是一本反思日记。也许斯多葛实践者可用的这种日记的最佳范本是 **Marcus Aurelius** 皇帝的**《沉思录》**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now, this is of course easier said than done. This is not gonna happen on your first try. But the key here is to constantly ask yourself, what exactly is going on here and what is a good reaction? What might be a good reaction to what is going on? Once you reframed whatever is happening to yourself that way, your emotions eventually will follow. The problem in dealing with situations as they're happening is that after we're not mentally prepared. And so we react in the moment, and then perhaps we misjudge the situation, our emotions start running away from us, and then we regret later on whatever we did or whatever we said. So the Stoics have a very important technique to help us prepare ourselves to difficult situations, to deal with difficult situations. That technique goes under a number of names. Often it's referred to as philosophical journaling. And I say philosophical because it's a particular type of journaling. This is not a diary where you just write down, oh, today I went and did this or did that and it was fun, that sort of stuff. It's a journal of reflection. And perhaps the best model of that journal available to Stoic practitioners is the "Meditations" of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

</details>

《沉思录》从未打算出版。事实上，它是皇帝的个人哲学日记。如果你读它，你会发现没有特定的结构。有 12 章，但这 12 章没有任何特定的副标题，没有特定的主题，因为 Marcus 正在经历他的生活，他在反思那一刻发生的任何事情，以及他是如何对发生的事情做出反应的。所以，通常人们读《沉思录》，例如，他们会产生这样一种观念，即它是重复的，有点说教。这两点都是真的。它是重复的，因为 Marcus 就像我们其他人一样，一遍又一遍地遇到同样的问题。例如，他有愤怒管理的问题。所以你会在《沉思录》中看到有几个地方 Marcus 对自己说：“你今天为什么为此感到不安？与其生气，有什么更好的方式来应对那种情况，对那种情况做出反应？”它是说教的，因为他在对自己说教。他不是在对观众说话，他是在对自己说话，他说：“看，你真的需要这样做，而不是那样做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The "Meditations" was never meant for publication. It is in fact the Emperor's personal philosophical journal. And if you read it, you'll see there is no particular structure. There are 12 chapters, but the 12 chapters don't have any particular subheadings, there is no particular topic, because Marcus is going through his life and he is reflecting on whatever was happening at that moment and how he was reacting to what was happening. And so, often, people read the "Meditations," for instance, and they come across with this notion that it's repetitive and it's a little preachy. Both of those things are true. It's repetitive because Marcus, just like the rest of us, kept running into the same problems over and over again. So for instance, he had an issue with anger management. And so you will see in the "Meditations" that there are several places where Marcus says to himself, "Why did you get upset about this today? What is a better way to answer that situation, to react to that situation instead of getting angry?" And it's preachy because he's preaching to himself. He's not talking to an audience, he's talking to himself, and he says, "Look, you really need to do things this way and not that way."

</details>

那么这在实践中是如何运作的呢？顺便说一句，这是另一件有来自现代认知行为疗法特别是，但也包括一般认知科学的非常好的证据的事情，即这种哲学日记、反思你的行为的技术确实有效。这是一个很好的自我提升工具，用于伦理自我提升。你可以用不同的方式做哲学日记。**Seneca** 和 **Epictetus** 实际上都给了你细节。在他们的著作中有一些片段，他们说：“这就是你要怎么做。”正如我所说，**Marcus Aurelius** 是一个很好的例子。那里有一整本书，你可以阅读它，看看它是如何完成的。我最喜欢的做法是在一天结束时，在你上床睡觉之前，当你不太累的时候，抽出一点时间，安静下来，打开你的日记，或者你的平板电脑，或者你喜欢的任何方式。它也不必是书面练习。你可以只是思考它。但最好作为书面练习来做，因为那样你就有了你一直在做和思考的事情的记录，最终经过几年时间，然后你可以回去检查你在某些领域是否有所改进，或者是否有某些问题对你来说特别成问题且反复出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So how does that work in practice? Incidentally, this is another thing where there is very good evidence from modern cognitive behavioral therapy in particular, but also cognitive science in general, that this technique of philosophical journaling, of reflection on your actions, actually does work. It's a very good tool for self-improvement, for ethical self-improvement. There are different ways in which you can do philosophical journaling. Both Seneca and Epictetus actually give you details. There are bits in their writings where they say, "This is how you do it." And as I said, Marcus Aurelius is a great example. There is a whole book there where you can read it and see how it is done. My favorite way of doing it is carving out a little bit of time at the end of the day, before you go to bed, when you're not too tired, quiet down, open up your journal, or your tablet, or however you prefer to do it. It doesn't have to be a written exercise either. You can just think about it. But it's better to be done as a written exercise because then you have a record of what you've been doing and thinking over eventually a period of years, and then you can go back and check if you have improved in certain areas or if there are certain issues that are particularly problematic and recurring for you.

</details>

你问自己，你挑选一天中发生的某件事的具体例子，例如，假设有人走过来试图侮辱我，你说了一些粗鲁或不恰当的话。我以某种方式做出了反应。所以我在日记中尽可能客观地向自己描述这种情况，不使用情绪化的语言，尽可能分析性地描述。因为重点不是重温经历，重点是分析经历并从中学习。事实上，如果你注意到，**Marcus Aurelius** 用第二人称写他的日记。他说：“你做了这个，你这样反应。”这听起来可能很奇怪，那样做可能会感觉有点尴尬，但同样，有来自现代研究的非常好的证据表明，这确实有助于与你的情绪反应保持距离，这实际上有助于试图从你所做的和你也许没做的事情中进行分析性学习。想象你只是在和一个朋友说话。你在给一个朋友写信。你说：“你做了这个，你怎么会这样或那样反应？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And you ask yourself, you pick a particular example of something that happened during the day, for instance, let's say somebody came up to me and trying to insult me, and you said something that is rude or uncalled for. And I reacted in a certain way. So I describe to myself in the journal the situation as objectively as I can without using emotional language, as analytically as I can. Because the point is not to relive the experience, the point is to analyze the experience and learn from it. In fact, if you notice, Marcus Aurelius writes his journal in the second person. He says, "You did this and you reacted this way." This may sound strange and it may feel a little awkward to do it that way, but again, there is very good evidence from modern studies that it does help keeping the distance from your emotional responses, which is in fact helpful in trying to learn analytically from what you did and what you perhaps didn't do. Imagine you're just talking to a friend. You're writing to a friend. You say, "You did this, how come you reacted this way or that way?"

</details>

所以你挑选一个特定的实例，发生的事情，一天中发生的事件，你简要地向你的朋友描述那个事件，然后你问自己三个问题。我做错了什么？我做对了什么？下次我可以做什么？为什么要问自己这些问题？第一个，我做错了什么？重点不是沉溺于某种后悔、自我鞭挞之类的东西，根据斯多葛学派的说法，那些都是无用的。无论你做了什么，都已经做了。你无法改变它。你无法回到过去改变它。然而，你可以从中学习。第二个问题是，好吧，我做对了什么？这本质上是同一个想法，只是硬币的反面，也就是说，你不只是想提醒自己你做错了什么样的事情，你也想设定你要一遍又一遍实现的目标。这是我下次不想去的地方，这是我下次想去的地方，或者这是我以后想少做的事情，这是我以后想多做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So you pick a particular instance, so something that happened, an incident that happened during the day, you briefly describe that incident to your friend, and then you ask yourself three questions. What did I do wrong? What did I do right? And what could I do next time? Why ask yourself those questions? The first one, what did I do wrong? The point is not to indulge in sort of regret, and self-flagellation, and things like, those are all useless according to the Stoics. Whatever you did, it's done. You cannot change it. You cannot go back in time and change it. However, you can learn from it. The second question is, well, what did I do right? It's essentially the same idea, only in the the flip side of that coin, that is, you don't just want to remind yourself the kinds of things that you do wrong, you also want to set goals that you're gonna achieve over and over. Here's where I don't wanna go the next time, here's where I do want to go the next time, or here's what I wanna do less and less moving forward, and here's what I want to do more and more moving forward.

</details>

第三个问题可以说是最关键的一个，我本可以做些什么不同的事情？同样，这不是关于后悔，因为你无法改变你所做的。但这关于这样一个事实，你知道，尽管我们认为我们的生活是无限迷人、不同、多样等等，实际上，大多数时候我们倾向于每天做几乎相同的事情。就斯多葛学派而言，这是一个优势，因为这意味着无论你今天没有妥善处理什么情况，很可能很快会再次发生。所以如果一个同事，例如，进来说了一些侮辱性的、粗鲁的或任何话，好吧，你知道，那个人很可能不会很快消失，他的行为也不一定会发生任何根本性的改变。所以你可以合理地预期，几天后，或下周，或下个月，接近那样的事情会再次发生。但现在你准备好了。今天发生时你可能没有准备好，这就是为什么你在你的哲学日记中做这种自我分析，但下次你会准备好的。你告诉自己：“好吧，如果这再次发生，这是一个更好的回应方式。”那样你就准备好了。**Seneca** 说，有准备的头脑能更好地处理困难，处理微妙的情况。也许不是完美地，但目标不一定是完美，而是更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The third question is arguably the most crucial one, what could I have done differently? Again, this is not about regret because you can't change what you did. But it's about the fact that, you know, as much as we think of our lives as endlessly fascinating, and different, and varied, and all that sort of stuff, in fact, most of the time we tend to do the same things pretty much every day. That's an advantage as far as the Stoics are concerned, because what that means is that whatever situation you did not handle properly today is likely going to happen again, possibly soon. So if a colleague, for instance, came in and said something insulting, or rude, or whatever, well, you know, that person isn't gonna go away very likely anytime soon, and his behavior is not gonna change necessarily in any radical fashion. So you can expect reasonably then, in a few days, or next week, or next month, something close to that will happen again. But now you're ready. You may not have been ready today when it happened, that's why you're doing this self-analysis in your philosophical journal, but you're gonna be ready next time. You're telling yourself, "Okay, well if this happens again, here is a better way to respond." That way you're prepared. And Seneca says a prepared mind handles difficulties, handles delicate situations much better. Perhaps not perfectly, but the goal is not perfection necessarily, but better.

### 宁静祷文与控制二分法

你可能听说过一种叫做**宁静祷文**（Serenity Prayer）的东西，当我们谈论斯多葛主义时，这并不完全是我们想到的同一件事。但请忍耐一下，这里有联系。宁静祷文通常在像匿名戒酒互助社这样的 12 步组织的会议开始时背诵，大致是这样的。它请求上帝赐予智慧来分辨我们能改变的和我们不能改变的，赐予勇气去改变我们能改变的，赐予宁静去接受我们不能改变的。那个概念，那个宁静祷文，是由一位美国神学家在 20 世纪初写的，但实际上它是对 **Epictetus** 在二世纪初的一个基本洞见的改写。这两者实际上在历史上是相连的，因为事实证明 **Epictetus** 的美好生活手册在中世纪一直被基督教僧侣用作精神锻炼的来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You may have heard of something called the Serenity Prayer, which is not exactly the same thing that comes to mind when we talk about Stoicism. But bear with me for a second, there is a connection. The Serenity Prayer, which is often recited at the beginning of meetings of 12-step organizations such as Alcoholic Anonymous goes something like this. It asks God to have the wisdom to tell the difference between what we can change and what we cannot change, the courage to change what we can, and the serenity to accept what we cannot. That notion, that Serenity Prayer, was written at the beginning of the 20th century by an American theologian, but in fact it's a rephrasing of a fundamental insight by the Stoic Epictetus that goes back to the beginning of the second century. The two are in fact connected historically because it turns out that Epictetus's manual for a good life was used throughout the middle ages by Christian monks as a source of spiritual exercises.

</details>

现在，**Epictetus** 并没有完全那样表述，但同样的想法成立，这是斯多葛主义中最有趣和最有用的想法之一。**Epictetus** 谈到有些事情取决于我们，有些事情不取决于我们，我们应该专注于那些取决于我们的事情并对它们采取行动，因为那是我们的能动性有效的地方，我们应该对那些不取决于我们的事情培养一种接受和平和的态度。现在，我们都生活在一个复杂的世界里，那里有各种各样的事情我们不一定能控制，无论是在宏观层面，比如政治变革、社会变革之类的事情，还是在个人层面。你知道，我们的生活中发生的事情，我们不一定有很多发言权或能做什么，因为它们取决于许多我们无法控制的因素。那么斯多葛学派如何处理那些不确定性以及那种归根结底我们都有的有限能动性呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now, Epictetus doesn't quite phrase it that way, but the same idea holds, and it's one of the most interesting and most useful ideas in Stoicism. Epictetus talks about some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us, and we should focus on the things that are up to us and act on them because that is where our agency is efficacious, and we should develop an attitude of acceptance and equanimity toward the things that are not up to us. Now, we all live in a complex world where there are all sorts of things that we don't necessarily control, both at a macroscopic level, let's say political change, social change, things like that, and at a personal level. You know, things happen in our life that we don't necessarily have much to say or do about because they depend on a number of factors that we do not control. So how do the Stoics deal with those kinds of uncertainties and that kind of limited agency that, at the end of the day, we all have.

让我们选一个例子，一个具体的例子。假设明天早上我要去参加一个工作面试。那是我真正想要的一份工作。在面试中表现出色对我来说很重要。**Epictetus** 会说，好吧，你能为那个挑战做的最好的准备是在前一天，比方说，问自己，在这种情况下什么是取决于我的，什么是不取决于我的？你可以通过列两个清单来做到这一点。你可以在脑海中做，或者更好的是，你可以写下一个表格。你可以画一个有两列的表格，写上“取决于我”，“不取决于我”。一旦你开始关注这个问题，你会惊讶地发现你实际上能列出多少事情。例如，实际上得到这份工作，不取决于我。这取决于竞争，取决于谁在面试以及他们那天的感觉，以及许多其他真的不在我控制之下的事情，这意味着，根据 **Epictetus** 的说法，我必须准备好接受事情不会按我的意愿发展的可能性，并以宁静、平和的心态接受这一点，因为这就是世界运作的方式。有时工作面试是成功的，有时则不然。我们是成年人。当事情不按我们的意愿发展时，我们不会发脾气。

Let's pick an example, a specific example. Let's say that tomorrow morning I'm going to have a job interview. And it's a job that I really want. It's important for me to do well in that interview,. Epictetus would say, well, the best way you can prepare yourself for that challenge is the day before, let's say, to ask yourself, what under these circumstances is up to me and what is not up to me? And you can do this literally by making two lists. You can do it in your mind, or better yet, you can write down a table. You can draw a table with two columns and say up to me, not up to me. It's surprising, once you start paying attention to the question, how many things you actually will be able to list. For instance, actually getting the job, not up to me. It depends on the competition, it depends on who's doing the interview and how they're feeling that day, and on a number of other things that are really not under my control, which means, according to Epictetus, that I have to be ready to accept the possibility that things will not go my way and accept that with serenity, with equanimity, because that's the way the world works. Sometimes job interviews are successful and other times they're not. And we're adults. We don't throw a tantrum when things don't go our way.

</details>

什么是取决于我的？好吧，显然是尽可能多地、尽可能仔细地为工作面试做准备。还有什么是取决于我的？好吧，试着睡个好觉，因为我们知道休息好等等有帮助。但请注意，我说的是试着睡个好觉，而不是实际上睡个好觉，因为有可能我的邻居，你知道，在隔壁公寓开派对直到深夜，我将无法睡我想睡的那么多小时，因为同样，有我控制之外的情况会干扰它，干扰我的意图。所以意图是我的，但结果不在我的控制之下。还有什么？好吧，准时参加工作面试肯定是个好主意。这意味着你在乎，你是专业的，等等。但同样，在那里，取决于我的是试着准时出现。我住在纽约。那不是保证。我可以上地铁，地铁突然在轨道中间停下来，不动了，或者我可能坐出租车，交通很拥堵，我实际上可能会迟到。所以试着有意图尽我所能准时到达是取决于我的，实际上准时到达不取决于我，等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What is up to me? Well, clearly to prepare myself as much as possible and as carefully as possible for the job interview. What else is up to me? Well, try to get a good night's sleep because we know that being rested and all that helps. But notice that I said to try to get a good night's sleep, not to actually get a good night's sleep, because it's possible that my neighbor, you know, in the next apartment is throwing a party into the late night and I will not be able to sleep as many hours as I should or want to because there are, again, circumstances that are outside of my control that are gonna interfere with it, with my intentions. So the intention is mine, but the outcome is not under my control. What else? Well, it's certainly a good idea to show up on time for the job interview. That means that you care, that you are a professional, and so on and so forth. But again, there, what is up to me is to try to show up on time. I live in New York. That's not a guarantee. I can get on the subway and the subway all of a sudden stops in the middle of the tracks and it's not gonna move, or I may take a taxi and there's a lot of traffic and I may actually get there late. So to try to have the intention to do my best in order to get there on time is up to me, actually getting there on time is not up to me, and so on and so forth.

</details>

所以我们可以列出这些实际上相当详细的清单。越详细越好。这个想法是，一旦你有了这些取决于我的事情和不取决于我的事情的清单，你就只关注左边的那一个，那些取决于我的事情。那些是我想要排练、仔细思考、尽可能做好准备的事情，因为我的能动性就在那个方向。所有其他的，我仍然可以意识到它们，我可以为它们会或不会按我喜欢的方向发展的可能性做好心理准备。但我能做的就只有这些了。结果是你做的事情更有效，因为你的能动性实际上在那里发挥作用。但也确实，你以一种保持冷静、安宁、宁静的方式接受事情。你不会因为那些坦率地说没必要生气的事情而让自己生气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So we can come up with these lists that are actually fairly detailed. The more detailed, the better. And the idea is that once you have these lists of things that are up to me and things that are not up to me, you focus only on the one to the left side, the things that are up to me. Those are the ones that I want to rehearse, think carefully about, be as prepared as possible because my agency lies in that direction. All of the other ones, I can still be aware of them and I can mentally prepare myself for the possibility that they are or they're not going to go in my preferred direction. But that's all I can do about it. The result is that you're much more efficacious in the things you do because your agency is in fact at play there. But it's also true that you accept things in a way that maintains calm, tranquility, serenity. You don't upset yourself over things for which frankly there is no point in getting upset.

### 决策与 Prohairesis（意志）

我确信你注意到了生活中的一件事是，有时我们必须做出艰难的决定。我们会事后怀疑自己。我们倾向于走一条路，然后想，也许我应该走另一条路。我们倾向于以二分法的方式思考。我们倾向于认为非黑即白，非此即彼。斯多葛学派对决策思考了很多。事实上，**Epictetus** 认为我们最重要的能力是他称之为 **Prohairesis** 的东西，这是希腊语，意为意志、决定，即实际达成判断和评估情况并试着对其采取行动、尽力对其采取行动的能力。问题当然在于生活有时很复杂。有多种选择。我们倾向于想要简化事情，追求那些鲜明、清晰、明显的东西。那只是世界运作的方式并非如此。根据斯多葛学派的观点，试着理解世界是如何运作的，然后据此行事，比试图将我们想要思考的方式或我们希望事情成为的方式强加给世界要好得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I'm sure you noticed that one of the things in life is that sometimes we have to make tough decisions. And we second guess ourselves. We tend to go one way and then think, maybe I should have gone the other way. We tend to think in a dichotomous fashion. We tend to think that it's either black or white, either this or that. The Stoics thought a lot about decision making. In fact, Epictetus thought that our most important faculty was something that he called prohairesis, which is Greek for will, the decision, the ability to actually arrive at a judgment and an assessment of a situation and then try to act on it, do your best to act on it. The problem is of course that life sometimes is complicated. There are multiple choices. We have a tendency to want to simplify things and go for something that it's stark, that it's clear, that it's obvious. That's just not the way the world works. And according to the Stoics, it's much better to try to understand how the world works and then act accordingly rather than trying to impose on the world the way we want to think or the way we prefer things to be.

</details>

在 **Epictetus** 的语录中有几段他与学生交谈，他提醒他们，以一种对你方便的方式设计世界并不取决于你。有一次，事实上，甚至变得很有趣。显然有一个学生抱怨感冒流鼻涕。**Epictetus** 看着他说：“所以你怎么想？宇宙应该重新安排自己，好让你不流鼻涕？你为什么不拿块手帕把它擦掉呢？”所以有时这是关于显而易见的事情，有时这是关于复杂的事情。没有确定的方法可以做出正确的决定。我们唯一能做的就是确保我们尽可能微调我们的 **Prohairesis**，即我们的判断能力。这就是 **Epictetus** 的第三项训练的内容，对吧？认同的训练。认同意味着同意某事。根据斯多葛学派的观点，我们不断受到印象的轰炸，他们称之为印象。印象本质上是感官体验和直接的、通常是本能的判断的结合。

<details>

There are several passages in Epictetus's discourses where he talks to his students and he reminds them, to design the world in a certain way that it's convenient for you is not up to you. At one point, in fact, it gets even pretty funny. One of the students apparently complained of having a cold and a running nose. And Epictetus looks at him and says, "So what do you think? The universe should rearrange yourself so that you don't have a running nose? Why don't you just get a handkerchief and wipe it off?" So sometimes it's about obvious things, sometimes it's about things that are complicated. And there is no sure way to make right decisions. The only thing that we can do is to make sure that we fine-tune as much as possible our prohairesis, that is, our faculty of judgment. That is what the third discipline of Epictetus is about, right? The discipline of assent. Assent means to agree to something. According to the Stoics, we are constantly bombarded by impressions, what they call impressions. An impression is essentially a combination of a sensorial experience and an immediate, usually instinctive judgment.

</details>

例如，我可能走在街上，我有这样的印象：去买并吃掉我刚刚看到展示的那个冰淇淋是件好事。因为它尝起来很好，看起来很好，很吸引人，我应该那样做。那是一个印象。这是一种结合，我看到了某样东西，我立即得出一个判断，即对那个物体做点什么是一件好事。**Epictetus** 说那是你想停下来思考的时候。问问你自己。事实上，和你的印象对话。说：“好吧，等一下，这真的是件好事吗？我真的应该去买冰淇淋现在就吃吗？嗯，也许不，因为我在去吃晚饭的路上。吃冰淇淋会破坏我的胃口。而且，坦率地说，我的腰围也不完全处于最佳状态，所以那也没什么帮助。不，再想一想，更好的决定是忽略冰淇淋，继续走路，回家。”那是一个简单的情况。但我们不断面临这种决策机会，可以说。我们也不断地事后怀疑自己。“哦，我应该做这个。我应该做另一件事。”斯多葛学派认为，取决于你的是你的意图，而不是那些意图的结果。所以你需要做的是致力于你为什么要尝试做某些事情，而不是致力于我会成功做这些事情吗？这可能会简化我们的决策问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

For instance, I might walk down the street and I have the impression that it's good to go buy and eat that gelato that I just saw displayed. Because it tastes good, it looks good, it's attractive, I should do it. That's an impression. It's a combination of, I am seeing something and I'm immediately arriving at a judgment that doing something about that object is a good thing. Epictetus says that's the time when you wanna stop and think. Ask yourself. In fact, talk to your impression. Say, "Well, wait a minute, is this really a good thing? Should I actually go on and get the gelato and eat it right now? Well, maybe not because I'm on my way to dinner. Eating a gelato will spoil my appetite. Also, frankly, my waistline is not exactly in the best shape possible, so that's not gonna help either. No, on second thought, a better decision is to ignore the gelato, keep walking, and go home. That's a simple situation. But we face constantly these kinds of decision making opportunities, so to speak. And we also constantly second guess ourselves. "Oh, I should have done this. I should have done this other thing." The Stoics think that what is up to you is your intentions, not the outcomes of those intentions. So what you need to do is to work on why are you trying to do certain things more than on, will I succeed in doing these things? And that might simplify our decision making problems.

### 顺应自然生活与希罗克勒斯的圆圈

斯多葛哲学的目标，斯多葛主义的目标，是让我们成为更好的人，成为那种过着值得过的生活的人。但这在实践中意味着什么？嗯，这意味着很多事情，但斯多葛学派回答这个问题（你知道，我们应该过什么样的生活）的一种方式是，他们说我们应该顺应自然生活。现在，顺应自然生活并不意味着赤身裸体跑进森林拥抱树木，尽管当然那本身并没有什么错。这意味着要看人类是哪种生物、哪种有机体，以及实际上是什么让这种有机体繁荣，让它做好的事情，更好的事情，拥有更幸福的生活，而不是那些阻碍人类繁荣的事情。这把伦理学（记住对于斯多葛学派来说，伦理学是研究如何过好生活的）本质上变成了一门经验学科，因为它是关于人性的。你必须观察什么让人类变得更好或更坏，什么让人类生活变得更好或更坏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The very goal of Stoic philosophy, of Stoicism, is to make us into better human beings, into the kind of human beings that lives a life that is worth living. But what does that mean in practice? Well, it means a number of things, but one way in which the Stoics answered that question, you know, what sort of life we should live, is that they say we should live according to nature. Now, to live according to nature doesn't mean running naked into the forest and hugging trees, although of course there is nothing wrong with that necessarily. It means to look at the kind of living being, of organism, that a human is and what actually makes that organism flourish, makes it do good things, better things, have a happier life, as opposed to the kinds of things that get in the way of human flourishing. This turns ethics, remember that for the Stoics, ethics is the study of how to live a good life, into essentially an empirical discipline, because it's about human nature. You have to observe things about what makes human beings better or worse, what makes a human life better or worse.

</details>

斯多葛学派做了一个有趣的类比。他们认为伦理学就像医学。你知道，医学当然关注身体，伦理学关注心灵，关注我们的精神。现在，有些事情，有些行为，对我们来说是自然的，但从医学角度来看并不好。例如，我们对糖和高脂肪食物有天然的吸引力。这可能是通过自然选择在人类进化时期进化而来的，那时周围没有很多食物。所以每当我们遇到脂肪或糖的来源时，我们最好利用它，对吧？但我们不再生活在那样的环境中。我们不再生活在更新世。我们生活在城市里，你可以每周七天、每天 24 小时找到食物。所以拥有这种对脂肪和糖的自然渴望（因为它是自然的）实际上对我们不好。它破坏了我们的身体健康。它导致各种问题，糖尿病等等，心脏病发作等等。所以医生会看着这个说：“看，这实际上是一种自然的渴望，但健康的做法是抵制那种渴望，将你的优先级重新定位到其他地方。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The Stoics drew an interesting analogy. They thought that ethics is like medicine. You know, medicine of course being concerned with the body, ethics being concerned with the mind, with our psyche. Now, there are some things, some behaviors, that are natural for us, but they're not good from a medical perspective. For instance, we have a natural attraction to sugar and to fatty foods. That probably evolved by natural selection in a period of human evolution where there wasn't a lot of food around. And so every time that we run into a source of fat or sugar, we were better served by actually taking advantage of it, right? But we don't live in that kind of environment anymore. We don't live in the Pleistocene anymore. We live in cities where you can find food 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And so having these natural craving, because it's natural, for fat and sugar is actually not good for us. It undermines our physical health. It causes all sorts of problems, diabetes and so on, heart attacks, et cetera. So a doctor will look at this and say, "Look, this is in fact a natural craving, but the healthy thing to do would be to resist that craving, to reorient your priorities elsewhere."

</details>

斯多葛学派在人类精神方面提出了完全相同的论点。有些事情对人类来说是自然的，就行为而言，例如愤怒。愤怒是对感知到的不公正的自然反应。但斯多葛学派认为愤怒是高脂肪食物或大量糖的心理等价物。它对你的精神不好。它不会导致美好的生活。那么在精神层面，在心理层面，什么对你有好处？两件事。通过理性解决你的问题，而不是强行推进事情或只是在当下做出反应，最重要的是，要社交，与他人合作，因为我们当然是社会动物，我们在社会中，在社会群体中茁壮成长。现在，从那里开始，意识到不仅仅是我的直接群体，不仅仅是我的家人、我的朋友，或者也许是住在我城市里的人，这一步并不遥远。与任何生活在任何地方的人类合作、向善、积极是有意义的，因为毕竟，我们生活在一个互联的世界里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The Stoics make exactly the same argument in terms of the human psyche. There are some things that come natural to human beings in terms of behavior, for instance, anger. Anger is a natural response to a perceived injustice. But the Stoics argue anger is the psychological equivalent of a fatty food or a lot of sugar. It's just not good for you mentally. It doesn't lead to a good life. Then what is good for you at a mental level, at a psychical level? Two things. To reason your way through your problems instead of bulldozing things or just reacting in the moment, and most importantly, to be social, to cooperate with other people, because we are, of course, social animals and we thrive in a society, in a social group. Now, from there, the step is not very far to realizing that it's not just my immediate group, it's not just my family, my friends, or perhaps the people that live in my city. It makes sense to cooperate, to be good, to be positive about any human being that lives anywhere because after all, we live in an interconnected world.

现在，那些早期的斯多葛学派之一，一个名叫 **Hierocles** 的人在二世纪写了一本书叫《伦理学原理》。**Hierocles** 说我们应该尝试做的是隐喻性地把人，所有的人，拉得离我们越来越近。想象你是你自己世界的中心。一旦你那样做，你立即意识到你依赖于其他人，例如你的父母，你的兄弟姐妹。然后最终你意识到你依赖于其他人，你开始称之为你的朋友。然后你依赖于更远更大的群体，外面，你知道，熟人，或者你不一定直接接触但间接影响你生活的人。好吧，**Hierocles** 说你需要做的是把所有这些圆圈，最终延伸到全人类，拉得离你自己越来越近。你应该把你的朋友当成你的家人。你应该把你的熟人当成你的朋友。你应该把陌生人当成你的熟人，等等。拉近他们。你的关注圈应该缩小，你的关注应该扩展到所有这些人。**Hierocles** 实际上甚至给出了如何做到的实用建议。这不仅仅是一种思考事物的方式，你实际上可以以一种世界主义的方式行事，因为那是斯多葛学派最终使用的词。你这样做的方式是，**Hierocles** 说只要四处走走，当你遇到陌生人时，称呼他们为兄弟姐妹，或者也许是叔叔阿姨，取决于他们的年龄和性别等等。换句话说，提醒你自己和他人，我们实际上都在同一条船上，我们相互依赖以实现良好的航行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now, one of those early Stoics, a guy named Hierocles, in the second century, wrote a book called "Principles of Ethics." Hierocles says what we should try to do is to metaphorically bring people, all the people, closer and closer to us. Imagine that you are the center of your own world. As soon as you do that, you immediately realize that you depend on other people, your parents, for instance, your siblings. And then eventually you realize that you depend on other people that you start calling your friends. And then you depend on further larger group of people, outside, you know, acquaintances, or people that you don't necessarily directly come in contact with but that indirectly affect your life. Well, what Hierocles said was what you need to do is to bring all those circles, which extend eventually all the way to the entirety of humanity, closer and closer to yourself. You should think of your friends as if they were your family. You should think of your acquaintances as if they were your friends. You should think of strangers as if they were your acquaintances, and so on and so forth. Bring them closer. Your circles of concern should shrink and your concern should expand to all of these people. And Hierocles actually goes so far as giving practical advice of how to do that. It's not just a way of thinking about stuff, you actually can behave in a way that is cosmopolitan, because that's ultimately the word that the Stoics used. And the way you do that is, Hierocles says just go around, and when you meet strangers, address them as brother and sister, or perhaps uncle and aunt, depending on their age, and their gender, and so on. In other words, remind yourself and others that we are in fact all on the same boat together and that we depend on each other for a good navigation.

### 误解与澄清：斯多葛主义不是什么

也许可以预见，关于斯多葛主义是什么和不是什么，有很多讨论甚至一点点困惑。如果你读一篇关于斯多葛主义的随机文章，或者听一个关于斯多葛主义的随机播客，你会听到这样的话：“哦，不要那样做，因为那不是真正的斯多葛主义。”事实上，在某种程度上，我也这样做过。我认为我有理由。我认为这些论点是基于对哲学的良好理解以及原始文本的。但我承认关于斯多葛主义的本质有不同的看法。这并不奇怪。我们在其他哲学和宗教中也看到了同样的事情。关于基督教是什么有不同的看法。关于佛教是什么有不同的看法。事实上，可以说，有不同的基督教和不同的佛教，这意味着有不同的方式来解释古代文本所说的内容，也有不同的方式将这些文本和这些哲学更新到 21 世纪。所以斯多葛主义也是如此。

<details>

Perhaps predictably, there is a lot of discussion and even a little bit of confusion about what Stoicism is and is not. If you read a random writing about Stoicism or you listen to a random podcast about Stoicism, you will hear things like, "Oh, don't go that way because that's not really Stoicism." In fact, to some extent, I've done this as well. I think I have arguments for it. These arguments, I think, are based on a good understanding of the philosophy, as well as on the original texts. But I admit there are different opinions about the nature of Stoicism. This is not surprising. We see the same thing in other philosophies and religion. There are different opinions about what Christianity is. There are different opinions about what Buddhism is. And in fact, arguably, there are different Christianities and different Buddhisms, meaning that there are different ways to interpret what the ancient texts say and also different ways to update those texts and those philosophies to the 21st century. So the same goes for Stoicism.

</details>

每当一种哲学或实际上甚至一种宗教变得流行时，不可避免地会有人以一种本质上是对原始思想的误解或对原始思想的重大扭曲的方式使用它。这并不奇怪，斯多葛主义也正在发生这种情况。有很多人，尤其是某些类型的年轻男性，他们被他们认为的斯多葛主义所吸引，因为它验证了他们的观念，即一个好人、一个强人，特别是一个强壮的男人，是一个沉默的人，控制自己情绪的人等等。但那是小写“s”的 stoicism（坚忍）。那是坚忍的态度，紧闭双唇，压抑情绪，Spock 式的生活方式，这实际上并不是真正的斯多葛主义（大写“S”，作为哲学的斯多葛主义）的内容。当然，像任何误解一样，有一点真理。例如，紧闭双唇来自于忍耐实际上是一种斯多葛价值这一事实。斯多葛学派会说：“看，如果有些事情发生在你身上，你对此无能为力，那么你唯一的选择真的，你唯一的理性选择就是忍受它。”你要做什么？你要么忍受它，要么忍受它然后抱怨它。抱怨真的没有任何帮助。它只会让你感觉更糟。所以就处理它。就忍受它。但这并不等同于紧闭双唇，因为它只是斯多葛哲学内容的一小部分。

Whenever a philosophy or in fact even a religion becomes popular, inevitably there are people who are going to use it in a way that essentially is a misunderstanding of the original idea or a significant distortion of the original idea. This is happening, not surprisingly, also with Stoicism. There's a number of people, especially certain kinds of young men who are attracted to what they think of as Stoicism because it validates their notion that a good person, a strong person, particularly a strong man, is somebody who is silent, who controls their emotions, and so on and so forth. But that's the stoicism with the little "s." It's the stoic attitude, the stiff upper lip, the suppression of emotion, the Spock approach to life, which is not in fact what real Stoicism with a capital "S," the Stoicism the philosophy, is about. Of course, like any misconception, there's a grain of truth. The stiff upper lip, for instance, comes from the fact that endurance is in fact a Stoic value. The Stoics would say, "Look, if something is going to happen to you that you cannot do anything about, then your only choice is really, your only rational choice is to endure it." What are you gonna do? You're either gonna endure it or you're gonna endure it and then complain about it. Complaining doesn't really add anything. It only makes you feel worse. So just deal with it. Just endure it. But that's not the same as a stiff upper lip because it's only a minor component of what Stoic philosophy is about.

</details>

斯多葛主义是关于压抑情绪的误导性观念也来自于对斯多葛哲学真实方面的扭曲。斯多葛学派非常重视与你的情绪对话、通过理性调节你的情绪的概念。例如，以一种不再是愤怒的方式处理你的愤怒，而是变成某种健康的、积极的东西。例如，那是你想追求的正义感，而不是破坏性的愤怒感。这也很容易被误解为压抑情绪。没有压抑情绪这回事。我们无法压抑情绪，因为情绪是我们大脑运作方式的重要组成部分。压抑情绪的唯一方法是字面上切断你大脑的一部分，那会把你变成精神病患者，或者有严重精神问题的人。你不想那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The misguiding notion that Stoicism is about suppressing the emotions also comes from a distortion of a real aspect of Stoic philosophy. The Stoics make a big deal about the notion of talking to your emotions, modulating your emotions through reason. For instance, dealing with your anger in a way that it's not anger anymore, but it becomes something healthy, something positive. For instance, it's a sense of justice that you want to pursue instead of a destructive sense of anger. That can also easily be misconstrued as suppressing emotion. There is no such thing as suppressing emotions. We cannot suppress emotions because emotions are part and parcel the way our brain works. The only way to suppress your emotions is to literally cut off a part of your brain, and that will turn you into a psychopath or otherwise somebody who has serious mental issues. You don't wanna do that.

然而，存在一种我有时称之为斯多葛主义的“兄弟化”（Broification）的危险，这种对斯多葛主义的解释倾向于事物的阴暗面，倾向于强调男子气概，倾向于强调这种几乎是神话般的男人的观点，即不对事物做出任何外部反应，只是承受，然后因此变得更强。这些人提出的论点之一是，例如，斯多葛主义是一种美德伦理学，而美德（Virtue）这个词来自拉丁语 *vir*，V-I-R，实际上意味着男人。所以你看，对吧？甚至词源学也告诉你这是关于做一个有男子气概的男人之类的东西。但那个论点忽略了一个重要的、关键的点，即 *vir* 这个词本身，拉丁语中的美德，实际上是原文的翻译。原文是希腊语，因为斯多葛主义归根结底是希腊哲学，而不是罗马哲学。希腊语中的原始词是 **Arete**，A-R-E-T-E，这只是意味着卓越（Excellence）。它不意味着任何有男子气概的东西。它只是意味着尽你所能做到最好。它是性别中立的。它根本不是一个阳性的词。所以即使在那个层面上，我们也看到了某种肤浅的理解。即使在词源学层面上，当然在历史层面上，我们也看到了肤浅的误解，这变成了我认为适得其反甚至可能危险的态度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

However, there is a danger of what I sometimes refer to as the broification, as in bro, of Stoicism, of this interpretation of Stoicism that tends to be on the darker side of things, tends to emphasize masculinity, tends to emphasize this view of, mythical view almost, of the man who doesn't really react in any external way to things and just takes it and then is stronger because of that. One of the arguments that these people make, for instance, is that Stoicism is a type of virtue ethics and that the word virtue comes from the Latin vir, V-I-R, which in fact means men. So there you go, right? Even the etymology tells you that it's about being a manly man and that sort of stuff. But that argument misses an important, crucial point, which is the word vir itself, virtue in Latin, is actually a translation of the original. The original was Greek, because Stoicism ultimately is a Greek philosophy, not a Roman one. And the original word in Greek is arete, A-R-E-T-E, which just means excellence. It doesn't mean manly anything. It just means do the best that you can. And it's gender neutral. It's not a masculine, you know, word at all. So even at that level, we see sort of a superficial understanding. Even at a etymological level and certainly at a historical level, we see a superficial misunderstanding, which turns into what I think is a counterproductive and potentially even dangerous kind of attitude.

对我来说，关于斯多葛主义的一个令人困惑的误解是，它把人变成了受气包（Doormats）。这是一种静寂主义哲学。它是关于不反应。它是关于不做事，只是试图退缩到你自己里面，某种程度上把自己与世界其他部分隔离开来。我不确定那个特定的误解到底是从哪里来的，如果不是再次作为斯多葛主义重视忍耐这一观念的副产品的话。但这显然被哲学的字面意思、被你从斯多葛学派自己那里读到的东西所反驳，也许更重要的是被我们知道那些哲学家在生活中实际采取的行动所反驳。在《语录》中，**Epictetus** 给了我们几个斯多葛学派的例子，用我们今天的话说，他们向权力说真话。事实上，在尼禄、韦斯巴芗和图密善皇帝统治期间，有一整群斯多葛哲学家和罗马参议员被称为斯多葛反对派。这些人实际上反对尼禄、图密善和韦斯巴芗的命令，因为他们视他们为暴君。而自由、独立，那些是真正的斯多葛价值。斯多葛派不能容忍暴君。所以这些人冒着生命危险。事实上，他们中的一些人因为直接反对暴政而失去了生命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One baffling misconception for me about Stoicism is that it turns people into doormats. It's a quietist philosophy. It's about not reacting. It's about not doing things, just trying to retreat into yourself and sort of isolate yourself from the rest of the world. I'm not sure exactly where that particular misconception come from, if not, again, as a byproduct of the notion that Stoicism values endurance. But it's clearly contradicted by both the letter of the philosophy, by what you read from the Stoics themselves, and more importantly perhaps by the actions that we know those philosophers actually took in their life. In "The Discourses," Epictetus gives us several examples of Stoics who, as we would put it today, spoke truth to power. In fact, there was a whole group of Stoic philosophers and Roman senators during the reigns of the Emperors Nero, Vespasian, and Domitian who were known as the Stoic Opposition. These were people who were actually going to object to the dictates of Nero, Domitian, and Vespasian because they saw them as tyrants. And liberty, freedom, independence, those are actual Stoic values. And a Stoic could not abide by a tyrant. So these people risked their lives. In fact, some of them lost their lives as a result of a direct opposition to tyranny.

还有其他的例子。**Seneca** 谈了很多关于一个叫小加图（**Cato the Younger**）的人，他是尤利乌斯·凯撒的同时代人。加图在参议院大厅反对凯撒。他们在政治生涯的某个阶段都是参议员。加图看到凯撒在他的行事方式中日益发展出某种暴虐的方面，所以他在参议院大厅反对了他很多年。然后在某个时刻，众所周知，尤利乌斯·凯撒拿起武器发动了反对罗马共和国的战争。他越过卢比孔河，名言是：“骰子已经掷下。”换句话说，我现在意识到这是一个不可逆转的行动。好吧，加图做了什么？他想，好吧，辩论的时间结束了。我也需要拿起武器。所以他组织了一支军队，他率领一支军队反对尤利乌斯·凯撒。所以尤利乌斯·凯撒和小加图都拿起了武器。这是一场内战。这是一件可怕的事情，没有任何文明可言。双方都有很多人死亡。最终，尤利乌斯·凯撒获胜。他是一位出色的将军。他击败了共和军。所以现在凯撒在追捕加图。他想活捉加图，因为他想利用他作为政治筹码。他想本质上通过说：“这是我的敌人。他实际上拿起武器反对我，但我对此没意见。我要原谅他”来展示他的宽宏大量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There are other examples as well. Seneca talks a lot about a guy named Cato the Younger, who was a contemporary of Julius Caesar. Cato opposed Caesar on the floor of the senate. They were both senators at one point in their political career. And Cato saw Caesar as increasingly developing sort of tyrannical aspects to his way of doing things, and so he opposed him on the senate floor for many years. Then at some point, famously, Julius Caesar picked up arms and moved to war against the Roman republic. He crossed the Rubicon River, famously saying, you know, "The die is cast." In other words, I am now cognizant of the fact that this is irreversible action. Well, what did Cato do? He thought, okay, the time of debate is over. I need to pick up arms as well. And so he organized an army and he led an army against Julius Caesar. So both Julius Caesar and Cato the Younger pick up arms. There is a civil war. It's a horrible thing and there's nothing civil about it. Lots of people died on both sides. Eventually, Julius Caesar prevails. He was an excellent general. And he defeats the republican army. So now Caesar is after Cato. He wants to capture Cato alive because he wants to use him as a political piece. He wants to essentially show his magnanimity by saying, "Here is my enemy. He actually picked up arms against me, but I'm okay with that. I'm gonna forgive him."

</details>

但加图是一个有原则的人，他不打算让凯撒那样利用这种情况。所以加图决定避免这种情况的唯一方法是结束自己的生命，自杀。斯多葛学派有关于自杀的整个文献。他们非常非常认真地对待这个问题。他们说这应该是最后的手段，只有在极端情况下。但加图发现自己在极端情况下处于最后的手段。所以他非常冷静地准备自己。他送走了他的朋友和亲人，拿起一本书。我们实际上知道他读了哪本书。他读了柏拉图关于灵魂本质的对话录之一。他的匕首就在旁边。他拿起匕首，像罗马人那样刺向自己的胃部。然而，他在战斗中受了伤，特别是他的手，他的手不够有力。所以他倒下了，因此发出了声音，所以每个人都从另一个房间冲进来。医生看到了正在发生的事情。他意识到即使周围一团糟，到处都是血，也没有重要器官被刺穿。所以医生试图缝合伤口，把东西放回去，然后试图挽救加图的生命。与此同时，加图醒了过来。他失去了知觉。他看到医生试图做什么，推开医生，用手伸进自己的内脏，把它们撕开，扔在地板上，就这样死了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But Cato was a man of principle and he was not about to let Caesar take advantage of the situation that way. So Cato decides that the only way to avoid that is to take his own life, to commit suicide. The Stoics have a whole literature about suicide. They take the issue very, very seriously. They say that it ought to be the last resort only under extreme circumstances. But Cato finds himself in the last resort under extreme circumstances. So he very calmly prepares himself. He sends away his friends and his loved ones, picks up a book. We know actually which book he read. He read one of Plato's dialogues about the nature of the soul. He has his dagger nearby. He picks up the dagger and he stabs himself, as the Roman did, in his stomach. However, he had been injured in battle, particularly in his hand, and his hand was not strong enough. So he falls down, makes noise therefore, and so everybody rushes in from the other room. And a doctor sees what's happening. He realizes that no vital organ has been punctured even though there is a mess around, the blood all over. And so the doctor tries to stitch the wound, to put back things, and then try to save Cato's life. Cato in the meantime comes back. He had lost consciousness. He sees what the doctor is trying to do, pushes the doctor away, reaches with his hand inside his own guts, tears them away, and throws them on the floor, thus dying.

</details>

做那种事情需要很大的勇气和决心。我的意思是，我认为即使是第一部分，手里拿着匕首刺向自己，那也需要勇气和决心。但在第二部分像加图那样走得那么远，意味着这是一个具有高度荣誉感、高度美德感和高度存在意义感的人。凯撒意识到发生了什么，他对此非常不安。他承认加图在这方面胜过了他。事实上，加图在随后的许多年里成为了共和事业的英雄。所以在这里我们有一个斯多葛派的例子，他实际上在战斗，最终因为理解什么是正确的事情而死，并想做正确的事情，不支持不公正，不退缩到被动的、不活跃的境地。所以这应该对现代斯多葛派有所启发，不一定是我们必须拿起武器，希望不是，反对任何人，但这肯定是关于大声疾呼。这肯定是关于捍卫自己的自由和他人的自由。这关于个人自主权和他人的自主权。每当你作为斯多葛派，作为斯多葛实践者，你看到那些东西受到威胁，你真的应该大声疾呼。这样做是你作为斯多葛实践者的责任。然后面对后果，这当然可能并不令人愉快。

It takes a lot of courage and determination to do that sort of thing. I mean, I think that even the first part, taking your dagger in your hand and stabbing yourself, that takes courage and determination. But going as far in the second bit as Cato did means that this was a man who had a high sense of honor, a high sense of his own virtue, and a high sense of the meaning of his existence. Caesar realized what had happened and he was really upset about it. He admitted that Cato had bested him at this. And in fact, Cato became a hero of the republican cause for many, many years afterwards. So here we have an example of a Stoic who actually was fighting and eventually died as a result of understanding what the right thing to do was and wanted to do the right thing, not endorsing injustice, not retreating into a passive, you know, inactive situation. So that should be inspiration to modern Stoics, not necessarily in the sense that we're gonna have to pick up weapons, hopefully, against anybody, but certainly it is about speaking out. Certainly it is about defending one's own liberty and other people's liberty. It's about personal autonomy and the autonomy of other people. And whenever you see, as a Stoic, as a Stoic practitioner, you see those things threatened, you really ought to speak out. It's your duty as a Stoic practitioner to do so. And then face the consequences, which may not be pleasant of course.

### 更新斯多葛主义：科学与形而上学

我发现斯多葛主义最吸引人的特点之一是，在这个系统中，内置了对新思想的开放性，以及在内部调整哲学以适应我们前进过程中可能发现的任何东西。事实上，古代斯多葛学派之一 **Seneca** 在某一点写道，看，在我们之前的人不是我们的主人，他们只是我们的老师。他们知道很多事情，其中一些事情非常有用，这就是为什么我们采纳它们。但这并不意味着他们发现了一切。这并不意味着没有新事物可被发现。如果我们确实找到了新的、更好的做事方式，**Seneca** 说唯一理性的做法是相应地调整我们的哲学并朝不同的方向发展。斯多葛主义当然是一种有 2000 多年历史的哲学。它始于公元前四世纪的雅典。你可能会预期我们在此期间学到的一些东西在那方面可能会有问题，也就是说，斯多葛学派并不知道科学甚至哲学在过去近两千五百年中取得的所有成就。这意味着如果你是 21 世纪今天的斯多葛主义实践者，你不能简单地接受古代斯多葛学派所说的一切并随之而去，就像今天没有人以两千或两千五百年前人们实践佛教或基督教的完全相同的方式实践佛教或基督教一样。

<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the features of Stoicism that I find most attractive is that built into the system, there is an openness to new ideas and to adjust the philosophy internally so that it adapts to whatever it is that we may discover moving forward. In fact, one of the ancient Stoics, Seneca, writes at one point that, look, the people that came before us are not our masters, they're just our teachers. They knew a lot of things, and some of those things were very useful and that's why we adopt them. But that doesn't mean that they discovered everything. That doesn't mean that there are no new things to be discovered. And if we do find new ways and better ways of doing things, Seneca says the only rational thing to do is to adjust our philosophy accordingly and move in a different direction. Stoicism of course is a philosophy that is over 2,000 years old. It started out in the fourth century BC in Athens. You might expect that some things that we've learned in the meantime might be problematic in that respect, that is, the Stoics didn't know everything that science and even philosophy have achieved over the intervening almost two and a half millennia. That means that if you're a practitioner of Stoicism today in the 21st century, you cannot simply take everything that the ancient Stoics said and go with it, pretty much in the same way in which nobody today is a practitioner of say Buddhism or Christianity in exactly the same way in which people were practicing Buddhism or Christianity two millennia or two and a half millennia ago.

例如，斯多葛学派关于**天意**（Providence）的历史概念一方面既有趣又美丽，但另一方面我认为存在严重缺陷，需要被拒绝。这将产生实际后果。让我退后一步，解释一下这是关于什么的。古代斯多葛学派是**泛神论者**（Pantheists），也就是说，他们相信上帝与宇宙是同一回事。它与宇宙重合。因此，他们认为宇宙本身是一个被赋予理性的生物体，对吧？宇宙就是上帝。自然就是上帝。上帝在思考。因此，宇宙中发生的一切都是上帝——即宇宙或自然——思考和作为的结果。现在，我觉得这是一个非常美丽的想法，只要我能相信它。作为一名现代生物学家和懂一点物理学的人，我不认为宇宙是一个生物体。我无法想象那种联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

For instance, the historic concept of providence is both interesting and beautiful on the one hand and yet I think deeply flawed and needs to be rejected on the other. And this is going to have practical consequences. Let me back up for a second and explain what this is about. The ancient Stoics were Pantheists, that is, they believed that God is the same thing as the universe. It's coincident with the universe. And therefore they thought of the universe itself as a living organism endowed with reason, right? The universe is God. Nature is God. God is thinking. And therefore, everything that happens in the universe is the result of the thinking and doing of God the cosmos or God the universe. Now, I find this a very beautiful idea, if only I could believe it. As a modern biologist and as somebody who does a little bit, knows a little bit about physics, I don't think of the cosmos as a living organism. I cannot imagine that sort of connection.

现在你可能会说：“好吧，那又怎样？这只是一个形而上学的争论，对吧？古代斯多葛学派那样看待上帝和宇宙。你不那样看。这在实践中有什么区别？”事实证明，这确实有很大的实际区别。在 **Epictetus** 的语录以及他的手册中有几段，他说了一些真正令人惊讶、真正有趣，同时又令人不安的话。他说，记住，当你去睡觉时，亲吻你的妻子和孩子道晚安，因为他们是凡人，明天早上可能就不在人世了。那样，你就不会感到不安。现在，我第一次读到那段话时，我想，这家伙是什么样的精神病患者？他告诉我应该意识到我的亲人是凡人。我对此没意见。是的，我们是，我们都是凡人。因此这意味着有一天，我或他们会死。但说我应该提醒自己这一点，这样我就不会感到不安，你在开玩笑吗？如果我的女儿或妻子死了，我当然会感到不安。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now you might say, "Well, so what? This is just a metaphysical dispute, right? The ancient Stoics thought about God and the universe that way. You don't think of it that way. What difference does that make in practice?" It turns out it does make a big practical difference. There are a few passages in the discourses of Epictetus, as well as in his manual, where he says something really surprising, really interesting, and at the same time disturbing. He says, remember, when you go to sleep, kiss goodnight to your wife and your child because they're mortal and they might not be alive tomorrow morning. That way, you will not be disturbed. Now, the first time I read that passage, I thought, what kind of a psychopath is this guy? He's telling me that I should realize that my loved ones are mortal. I'm okay with that. Yes, we are, we're all mortal. And therefore that means that someday, I or them will die. But to say that I should remind myself of this so that I'm not gonna be disturbed, are you kidding? Of course I'm gonna be disturbed if my daughter or my wife were to die.

</details>

但后来我明白了他的出发点。事实上，**Epictetus** 自己清楚地做了一个类比，一个有趣的类比，展示了他的出发点。他说，看，你就像是生物体的一部分——一只脚。假设生物体，身体，必须回家，为了回家，它必须穿过一条泥泞的小路。作为脚，踏入泥潭取决于你。现在，如果你只从脚的角度来思考，而不记得你与身体相连，那是恶心的。我为什么要踏入泥潭？这不是一件愉快的事。但如果你记得你与身体相连，事实上你生命的全部目的就是把那个身体带到它需要去的地方，包括踏入泥潭，那么你不仅会做，而且你会礼貌地做。你会拥抱，不仅仅是接受你的命运，可以说是拥抱你的命运。所以 **Epictetus** 在那里说的并不是像我们所说的那样是精神病态的。他只是在他理解世界的方式上是现实的。他说，看，我们实际上都是上帝宇宙的碎片。发生在我们身上的一切，包括不愉快的部分，实际上都是为了上帝宇宙的好。所以如果你那样理解事情，你不仅会接受发生的事情，你实际上会拥抱它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then I understood where he was coming from. In fact, Epictetus himself clearly makes an analogy, an interesting analogy, that shows where he's coming from. He says, look, you are like a foot that is part of an organism. Let's say that the organism, the body, has to get home, and in order to get home, it has to cross a muddy path. It is up to you as the foot to step into the mud. Now, if you think of that only from the point of view of a foot, without remembering that you're connected to a body, that's disgusting. Why would I wanna step into the mud? This is not a pleasant thing. But if you remembered that you are connected to a body and that in fact your entire purpose in life is to bring that body wherever it needs to go, including stepping into the mud, then not only you're going to do it, but you're gonna do it politely. You're gonna embrace, not just accept your fate, so to speak, but embrace your fate. So what Epictetus is saying there is not as being psychopathic, as far as we can tell. He's just being realistic in the way he understood the world. He said, look, we're all literally bits and pieces of the god universe. And whatever happens to us, including the unpleasant bits, is actually for the good of the god universe. So if you understand things that way, not only you're gonna accept what happens, you're actually gonna embrace it.

</details>

现在当他说，你知道，如果你的亲人死了，你不应该感到不安，你不应该感到困扰，因为你意识到，好吧，无论发生什么，即使你可能只看到那幅画的一小部分，但无论发生什么都是这个普遍宇宙计划的一部分，你应该对此感觉良好，而不是心烦意乱。这是一种看待生活的美丽方式。不幸的是，我不认为这是看待生活的正确方式。我希望我能让自己像古代斯多葛学派那样成为泛神论者。那肯定会在我或我的亲人发生坏事时给我提供很多安慰。但我不相信宇宙上帝，因此我认为发生在我们身上的一切都是中性力量的结果。宇宙不关心这样或那样。这意味着我不能利用斯多葛学派的天意概念。那么我用什么来代替它呢？好吧，接受仍然是其中的一部分，对吧？我必须接受事物的现实。我是一名生物学家。我明白人会死。事实上，我明白死亡是生命过程或地球上生命过程的自然组成部分。如果其他人没有死，我就不会在这里，因为我就不会出生。所以我的死亡，其他人的死亡，是自然的。因此，在理性层面上尽可能接受它是合理的。但在情感层面上，我仍然不会对此感到高兴，我认为不对此感到高兴是可以的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now it makes sense when he says, you know, if your loved ones die, you should not be upset, you should not be disturbed, because you realize that, well, whatever is happening, even though you may only get a small portion of that picture, but whatever is happening is part of this universal cosmic plan, and you should feel good about it, not distraught. It's a beautiful way of looking at life. Unfortunately, I don't think it's the right way to look at life. I wish I could bring myself to being a pantheist in the way in which the ancient Stoics were. That would definitely provide me with a lot of comfort whenever something bad happens to me or to my loved ones. But I don't believe in the cosmic god, and therefore I think that whatever happens to us is the result of neutral forces. The universe doesn't care one way or the other. That means that I cannot avail myself of the Stoic concept of providence. So what do I replace it with? Well, acceptance is still part of it, right? I have to accept the reality of things. I'm a biologist. I understand that people die. In fact, I understand that death is a natural part of the process of being alive or the process of life on Earth. If other people had not died, I would not be here because I would not have been born. And so my death, the death of other people, it's natural. And as such, it's reasonable to accept it as much as one can at a rational level. But at an emotional level, I'm still not gonna be happy about it, and I think that's okay, not to be happy about it.

所以这是一个例子，说明古代斯多葛学派在形而上学层面思考并在他们的日常生活、伦理学方面产生后果的事情，而现代斯多葛派必须修改，我认为，因为与此同时，哲学和科学都已经进步到了使原始观念站不住脚的地步。事实上，如果你还不相信，让我再给你一点证据，证明事情就像我刚才描述的那样运作。如果有人问：“好吧，**Epictetus** 认为宇宙是一个活着的上帝的论据是什么？”他确实为我们提供了一个论据。事实上，几个斯多葛学派都这样做了。**Seneca** 也是，还有一些其他早期的斯多葛学派。像 **Zeno** 这样首先创立斯多葛方法的人也做了同样的事情。他们都使用了设计论证。他们说，就像剑完美地适合剑鞘，这告诉你有人设计了这两个物体以功能性的方式、以一种有效的方式实际配合在一起，如果你环顾四周，你会看到宇宙是以同样的方式构建的。坦率地说，如果我生活在 2000 年前，我可能会接受那个论点。这是一个非常有说服力的论点。你环顾世界的复杂性，你会说：“是的，那有道理。”

So that's one example of something that the ancient Stoics thought at a metaphysical level and had consequences in terms of their day-to-day life, their ethics, and modern Stoics have to modify, I think, because in the meantime, both philosophy and science have progressed to a point that makes the original idea untenable. In fact, if you're still not convinced, let me give you one more bit of evidence that things work pretty much in the way I just described it. If one asks, "Well, what was Epictetus's argument for thinking that the universe is a living god?" He does actually provide us with an argument. In fact, several of the Stoics do. Seneca does as well and some of the other earlier Stoics. People like Zeno, who was the founder of the Stoic approach in the first place, does the same thing. They all use an argument from design. They say, just like the sword perfectly fits the scabbard, and that tells you that somebody designed both of those objects to actually fit together in a functional way, in a way that works, if you look around, you'll see that the universe is built in the same way. And frankly, if I lived 2,000 years ago, I would probably buy into that argument. It's a really cogent argument. You look around the complexity of the world and you say, "Yeah, that makes sense."

</details>

但我不是生活在 2000 年前，我生活在 21 世纪，这意味着我生活在对那种看待事物的方式、特别是对设计论证提出两个主要反对意见之后。18 世纪的哲学家 **David Hume**（大卫·休谟）在哲学逻辑基础上批评了设计论证，并表明它并不真正连贯。然后大约一个世纪后，生物学家 **Charles Darwin**（查尔斯·达尔文）实际上提出了另一种机制，我们称之为自然选择进化论，来解释为什么事物似乎是以某种方式设计的。鉴于这些知识，我必须拒绝设计论证，就像几乎每个生物学家所做的那样。如果我拒绝那个，那么我也拒绝斯多葛学派的泛神论观点。如果我拒绝那个，我必须修改我的伦理学和天意概念。所以我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明所有这些事情是如何协同工作的。科学进步会质疑我们的哲学观点，如果哲学观点能够适应新科学产生的结果，那是一件好事。当然，另一个世纪，或五个世纪，或十个世纪后的科学可能会告诉我们不同的东西。如果十个世纪后有斯多葛派，他们自己将面临同样的问题，并且必须以某种方式适应。我觉得这非常令人耳目一新，因为与其他往往更僵化、抵制变革的哲学或宗教体系不同，这种变革是我们在做斯多葛哲学的方式中固有的观念是非常有用的、非常合理的，也非常令人耳目一新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But I don't live 2,000 years ago, I live in the 21st century, which means that I live after two major objections were raised to that way of looking at things, to the design argument specifically. The philosopher David Hume in the 18th century criticized the design argument on philosophical-logical basis and showed that it's not really coherent. And then about a century later, Charles Darwin, a biologist, actually proposed an alternative mechanism, we call it evolution by natural selection, for why things seem to be designed in a certain way. Given that knowledge, I have to reject the argument from design, as pretty much every biologist does. And if I reject that, then I also reject the Stoic view of pantheism. And if I reject that, I have to revise my notions of ethics and providence. So this is a good example, I think, of how all of these things work together. Scientific advancements will question our philosophical views, and it's a good thing if the philosophical views are able to adapt to what comes out of the new science. Of course, science in another century, or five centuries, or 10 centuries may tell us something different. And if there are Stoics 10 centuries down the road, they will themselves face the same problem and have to adapt somehow. I find that very refreshing because unlike other philosophical or religious systems, which tend to be much more rigid, resistant to change, this notion that change is inherent in the way in which we do Stoic philosophy is very useful, very reasonable, and very refreshing.
