### 斯多葛主义：理性、社会性与可控性的人生哲学

斯多葛主义（Stoicism）作为一种古老的生活哲学，其核心在于引导人们通过理性思考和积极的社会行为，活出有价值的人生。斯多葛学派认为，人类作为一种高度社会化且具备理性能力的生物，其良好生活应建立在运用理性解决问题和以合作、亲社会的方式行事之上。这一哲学强调，我们应将精力集中在**可控之事**（what is up to us）上，即那些我们拥有主导权和影响力的事情，并以平静的心态接受**不可控之事**（what is not up to us）。这种现实主义的视角，旨在避免因追求无效目标而徒增痛苦，从而将有限的时间和精力投入到真正能够产生影响的领域。

斯多葛学派的**角色伦理**（Role Ethics）概念，由**爱比克泰德**（Epictetus）在公元二世纪提出，进一步阐释了这一思想。我们每个人在生活中扮演着多重角色，例如子女、父母、配偶、朋友、教师、公民等。这些角色需要同时兼顾，而非孤立存在。因此，明智地分配体力、情感和精神能量，确保在每个角色中都能尽力而为，至关重要。若将大量时间和精力浪费在无法改变的事情上，例如沉溺于无法采取行动的新闻，不仅会使自己陷入沮丧，还会影响对家庭、朋友乃至整个社会的贡献。因此，**爱比克泰德**强调，设定目标和优先事项，即其“欲望的训练”，是避免虚度光阴、临终悔恨的关键。

斯多葛主义的最终目标是实现**幸福生活**（Eudaemonia: 一种值得过的、没有虚度的人生）。不同于伊壁鸠鲁学派（Epicureanism）或怀疑论（Skepticism）对幸福的不同定义，斯多葛学派认为，幸福生活意味着智慧、明智且合群地生活。由于人类天生是社会性生物，斯多葛学派高度重视人际关系和社会角色，倡导**亲社会生活**（pro-social life），即与他人积极互动。他们甚至将自身定义为**世界公民**（cosmopolitan），认为地球上的每个人都是兄弟姐妹，应以相应的方式对待。

- Today you're going to learn
a little bit about what the Stoics mean
by being a good human being.
We'll learn to live more rationally,
to conduct a life based on reason,
and to deal with our emotions
in the best way we can.
I am Massimo Pigliucci.
I am an evolutionary biologist
and a philosopher of science.
And my latest book is
called "Beyond Stoicism,"
co-authored with Greg
Lopez and Meredith Kunz.
(dramatic music)
- [Narrator] Chapter 1: What is Stoicism?
- Stoicism is a philosophy of life
that suggests that the best
way to live a human life
is to ask yourself what
kind of a living organism
human beings are.
And the answer that the
Stoics give to that question
is that fundamentally we are highly social
and capable of reason.
We're that intelligent.
It follows, according to
them, that a good human life
is one way you use reason
in order to solve problems
and you behave in a
cooperative, pro-social fashion.
One of the crucial insights of the Stoics
is that we should focus
on what is up to us,
as the ancient Stoic Epictetus put it,
and try to accept with
equanimity what is not up to us.
In other words, focus where
your agency is active,
where you are efficacious in doing things,
and then accept whatever comes as it comes
because you really don't have a choice.
The Stoics are nothing if
not realists about life.
They try to understand
how human life works
and they try to live
the best life possible.
One of the things that we do understand
from biology, psychology,
is that we have limited time
and energy to do things,
both physical energy and emotional energy.
And so if we insist on pursuing approaches
that are likely not to work
or they're not efficacious,
you know, our agency doesn't
really have any effect on it,
then we are only making
our life miserable.
And in fact, we're trading off
with other things that we should be doing.
One of the interesting aspects
of the particular brand
of Stoicism, so to speak,
that Epictetus articulated
in the second century
is this notion of role ethics.
We all play different roles
in life, many roles, in fact.
And if we reflect on it for a minute,
for instance, some of my roles
include being somebody's son,
being somebody's father,
being somebody's husband,
being a friend, being a
teacher, being a colleague,
being a citizen of a particular nation
and of a particular city,
and so on and so forth.
All of these roles need to be handled
essentially simultaneously.
It's not like I can decide one day
I'm gonna be just a
colleague and nothing else.
I am a colleague perhaps
in this particular moment
when I'm at work and I'm
interacting with other people,
but I'm at the same time also a husband,
a father, a friend, et cetera, et cetera.
And the idea here is
that I need to conserve
both physical, and
emotional, mental energy
so that I can do my best
in all of these roles
whenever it is that I need
to do something about it.
If I'm going to waste a
lot of energy and time
on a particular thing,
especially something
that for which my efforts
are in fact not efficacious,
then I'm really trading
off with everything else.
I am getting depressed, let's say,
by just constantly reading the news
about things that are not actionable,
about things that I
cannot do anything about.
Well, the result of that
is then I'm not useful to my family,
I'm not useful to my friends.
I'm not in fact useful
to society in general
and even to myself.
So it's about conserving
energy, setting priorities.
This goes back to the the
first discipline of Epictetus,
the discipline of desire, setting goals.
Depending on our values, we set
goals and we set priorities.
And doing so is crucial
because otherwise we end
up wasting a lot of time
and then regretting it.
And usually, when you get
to the point of regret,
especially near the end of your life,
it's a little too late.
Seneca points out in one of his letters
to his friend Lucilius
that too many people
start reflecting on what
they want to do and why
near the end of their
lives, when it's too late,
when they're already done
most of what they were going to do.
Stoicism is one of the
Greco-Roman philosophies
that evolved during
the Hellenistic period,
and the goal is to live a eudaemonic life.
Eudaemonia is a word that in Greek means,
roughly speaking, a life worth living,
a kind of life that you
get to the end of it
and you say, "Yeah, that
was not wasted time."
Now, different Hellenistic schools,
like the Epicureans, for
instance, or the Skeptics,
had different answers to what
constitutes a eudaemonic life.
According to the Stoics,
living a eudaemonic life
means living intelligently,
smartly, and socially.
Because one of the fundamental
aspects of Stoicism
is that we should live a pro-social life,
that is, a life where we
interact with other people,
because we are naturally
a social organism,
then the Stoics put a lot of emphasis
on relationships with people,
on our roles in society,
what is it that is a good
thing or not thing to do
with respect to other people.
In fact, they went so far
as declaring themselves cosmopolitan.
Being a cosmopolitan
means being a member of
the human cosmopolite,
the human city, the universal human city.
According to the Stoics,
every human being on Earth
is our brother and sister,
and we should treat them accordingly.

### 斯多葛学派的三大训练与研究领域

为了实践斯多葛主义，**爱比克泰德**提出了三大基本训练：
1.  **欲望的训练**（Discipline of Desire）：这并非指随心所欲，而是批判性地重新评估我们的**价值观**（values）和**非价值观**（disvalues）。它教导我们审慎决定哪些在生命中是重要且美好的，哪些是不重要或有害的，并据此调整我们的方向。
2.  **行动的训练**（Discipline of Action）：顾名思义，这关乎我们如何与他人互动。我们生活在社会中，价值观不仅是内心认同，更体现在言行举止中。因此，行动的训练旨在指导我们在社会互动中实践自己的价值观。
3.  **认同的训练**（Discipline of Assent）：认同意味着同意。对**爱比克泰德**而言，这意味着审慎而理性地思考前两项训练——即价值观的设定与实践方式。认同的训练旨在使整个斯多葛实践流畅、和谐，从而实现一种“平稳流动的生活”。

这三大训练是斯多葛主义在实践层面的体现，而其背后则有深厚的理论支撑。斯多葛学派的课程通常涵盖三大研究领域：
1.  **物理学**（Physics）：此处的“物理学”源于希腊语“physis”，意指**自然**（nature）。它并非现代物理学，而是指对世界运作方式的全面理解，即广义的科学。通过理解我们作为何种生物，以及世界如何运作，我们可以更好地设定人生目标和优先事项。
2.  **伦理学**（Ethics）：在古希腊罗马时期，伦理学远不止于对是非行为的研究，它更广泛地指**如何生活**（how to live your life）。它不仅关注行为对错，更关注行为动机、人生优先事项以及如何与他人相处。由于人类是社会性动物，伦理学与行动的训练紧密相连，因为我们只有在社会中才能繁荣发展。
3.  **逻辑学**（Logic）：斯多葛学派的逻辑学是关于**良好思维**（good thinking）的研究，它包含了现代的**认知科学**（cognitive science），旨在理解认知偏差以及思维出错的原因。逻辑学与认同的训练相关，它帮助我们培养良好的判断力，避免错误，并以理性、合理的方式思考，将这种方法融入日常生活。

<summary>Original English Source</summary>

The ancient Stoic Epictetus,
who lived at the beginning
of the second century,
laid out three fundamental disciplines
for the study and practice of Stoicism.
They're referred to normally
as the discipline of desire,
the discipline of action,
and the discipline of assent,
although I should warn
you that the English terms
are a little bit misleading
compared to the original Greek.
Desire, for instance,
doesn't mean whatever
I fancy at the moment.
It means my values and also my disvalues,
that is, the kinds of things
that I think are important
and good in life
and the kind of things
that are not important
or bad in life.
The discipline of desire teaches us
to reevaluate critically our values,
to reorient ourselves
according to good values,
to make deliberate decisions
about what those values are and why.
The second discipline,
the discipline of action,
has to do, as the name implies,
with acting toward other people.
We live in a society.
We don't just subscribe to certain values,
we enact those values
every time that we do
something or say something,
especially to other people.
So the discipline of action
is about putting into practice
our values when we interact
in society at large
with other human beings.
Finally, the discipline of assent.
Assent means of course agreement.
But for Epictetus that
means thinking carefully
and rationally about the
other two disciplines,
about values and how to implement them.
So the discipline of assent in a sense
is about making all of this flow so nicely
and so smoothly that we have in fact,
according to the Stoics,
a smoothly flowing life.
The three disciplines
are a way to implement
Stoicism in practice,
but Stoicism of course is a philosophy,
so there's also a theory behind it.
And in order to understand Stoic theory,
we need to refer to the
three areas of study
that were typical in any Stoic curriculum.
If you went to a Stoic school,
let's say the school
that was run by Epictetus
in Northwestern Greece
in the second century,
you would actually study,
before you get to the disciplines
and how to live your life,
you would study the three general areas
that are pertinent to those disciplines.
Now, there too, the English names
are a little bit misleading.
They are physics, ethics, and logic.
But what they mean exactly
is something a little bit
different from modern English,
and so we need to be careful here.
Physics, for instance, comes from physis,
which means nature.
So when I say physics, don't
think quantum mechanics,
or general relativity,
or things like that,
think science in general,
so a good understanding
of how the world works.
That's connected to the
discipline of desire,
that is, to the discipline
that deals with our goals
and priorities in life.
Why?
Because our goals and priorities in life
depend on what kind of
living organism we are.
If we were a different
kind, you know, a martian,
or a dog, or a lion, we would
have different priorities.
So it's about understanding
the world as it works.
And the best way to
understand the world as it is
is through science.
So you study science
in order to investigate
into your own goals and priorities.
These days, ethics means mostly the study
of right and wrong actions.
But for the Stoics
or for the ancient
Greco-Romans in general,
ethics had, again, a much broader meaning.
It meant literally the study
of how to live your life.
So it's not just about
whether a particular action
is right or wrong, it's
also about your motivations
for carrying out a particular action.
Are they good motivations
or not good motivations?
It's about your priorities
in life, your goals,
the way you relate to other
people, and so on and so forth.
The second discipline of action
is connected with ethics.
Action is about dealing with other people,
ethics is about how to live a life.
Since we're a social animal,
the two are very closely related.
We live a social life.
We don't live on deserted islands.
We don't do very well
when we are on our own.
We can survive perhaps on our own
under certain circumstances,
but we only thrive in a society.
When I say logic, most
people start thinking
about logical puzzles, and
paradoxes, and things like that.
And that's fine, that is part of it.
But logic according to the Stoics
is in general the study of good thinking.
So it includes also
what we would today
call cognitive science,
the understanding of cognitive biases
and the understanding
of why people's thinking
can go wrong one way or the other.
So it's much broader than
the technical field of logic.
Assent.
Assent is about refining our
understanding and practice
of the first two disciplines.
In other words, it's
about using good judgment,
and therefore it's about logic.
It's about understanding
how human reasoning works
and also how it can go wrong
so that we avoid as much
as possible mistakes
and we're trying to
think as much as we can
in a rational, reasonable way,
and then implement that kind
of approach into daily life.

### 斯多葛实践的现代实证与认知行为疗法渊源

斯多葛主义是否有效？这是一个值得探讨的问题。尽管哲学并非现代意义上的科学方法，但与特定宗教或哲学相关的技术，其有效性是可以被经验证据验证的。就斯多葛主义而言，有充分证据表明其技术确实有效。

首先，斯多葛主义是**认知行为疗法**（Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT: 一种基于实证的心理疗法）的起源。早在20世纪60年代，**亚伦·贝克**（Aaron Beck）和**阿尔伯特·埃利斯**（Albert Ellis）等心理治疗师在纽约开始实践CBT，他们都曾研读**马可·奥勒留**（Marcus Aurelius）、**爱比克泰德**等斯多葛学者的著作，并从中汲取灵感。CBT作为当今最受推崇的循证心理疗法之一，其有效性已通过大量实证研究证实。虽然CBT并非完全等同于斯多葛主义，但其许多技术都源于古斯多葛学派对人类心理和本性的直觉洞察，并被证明是高效的。

其次，越来越多的认知科学研究，包括对大脑运作和人类决策过程的理解，都与斯多葛技术高度兼容。例如，现代心理学家和科学家对理性与情感关系的研究，与斯多葛学派的观点惊人地相似。他们认为，情感（主要源于**杏仁体**）和理性（主要位于**额顶叶**）并非截然分离，而是通过数十亿神经纤维紧密相连，相互影响。这意味着，不存在独立于思维的情绪反应，也不存在独立于情绪反应的思维。

最后，目前已有直接研究开始系统性地探讨斯多葛技术的有效性。例如，心理治疗师**蒂姆·勒邦**（Tim Lebon）最近发表的研究初步证据表明，斯多葛技术确实能对行为和思维方式产生斯多葛学派所预期的影响。这些证据共同表明，斯多葛主义不仅是一种哲学理念，更提供了一套经过时间考验且被现代科学支持的实用工具。

<summary>Original English Source</summary>

One of the obvious questions
that come up with
Stoicism is does it work?
Which, if you think about
it, on the one hand,
it's a little bit of a weird question
because we're talking about a philosophy.
We're not talking about,
you know, a scientific approach to life
as we understand it today.
Very few people, for instance,
would ask the question,
well, does Christianity
work or does Buddhism work?
However, they might ask, do prayers work
or does meditation work?
In other words, the techniques associated
with certain religions or philosophies.
In those cases, it does
make sense to ask yourself,
well, does it work?
Is it something that, quite independently
of the theoretical part of the philosophy,
does it actually have empirical evidence?
So the same question can be
asked reasonably about Stoicism.
We have a series of lines of
evidence that Stoic techniques,
the Stoic approach to a good
life, does in fact work.
The first one is that Stoicism originated
what is now known as
cognitive behavioral therapy
back in the 1960s.
In New York, authors like
Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis
started to practice this
type of psychotherapy,
which today is one of
the best evidence-based
type of psychotherapies.
And they started from Stoicism.
They both read Marcus Aurelius,
Epictetus, and other Stoics,
and they thought, oh, these
people were onto something here,
that there is something that can work,
that is very practical, that
can actually help people.
Of course, CBT as is known today
went then through a series of changes
and evolution over the
last several decades.
CBT is empirically based,
that there is lots of studies,
empirical studies, that
show that it does work.
So it's not the same as
asking whether Stoicism work,
but it's pretty close to asking
whether Stoic techniques work
because a lot of the techniques
that the ancient Stoics
designed and developed
on the basis of their intuition
about human psychology and human nature,
it turns out, are actually efficacious.
So that's one line of evidence
that Stoicism in a sense works.
There is also an increasing
number of papers out there
on cognitive science in general,
not just cognitive behavioral therapy,
but cognitive science in general,
how the brain works, how
human decision making
is carried out, and so on and so forth.
And my understanding is that
much of that research is,
if not in direct support
of Stoic techniques,
it certainly is compatible,
highly compatible with it.
For instance, modern psychologists
and currently scientists
have developed a theory
of the relationship
between reason and emotions
that is very similar to
the way in which the Stoics
were thinking about the connection
between reason and emotion.
And then finally, there now
begins to be direct studies
about the efficacy of Stoic techniques.
Stoicism is popular
enough that psychologists
have begun to look systematically
into whether specifically
Stoic techniques work or don't.
For instance, one of my
colleagues, Tim Lebon,
who is a psychotherapist,
has just published recently
one of the first papers
that shows at least preliminary evidence
that, yes, indeed, Stoic techniques
seem to have the kind
of effects on behavior
and on the way people think
that the Stoics thought they should have.

### 构建个人生活哲学：意识、批判与整合

每个人都有自己的生活哲学，即使是不自觉的。这种哲学体现在我们的选择、价值观、优先事项和行为中。因此，我们应该有意识地审视自己的生活哲学，并思考它是否足够好，是否需要改变。然而，构建生活哲学并非简单地“拿来主义”，这其中存在几种误区。

第一种误区是盲目采纳。例如，直接从书架上选择斯多葛主义，认为“从现在起我就是斯多葛主义者”。这种做法的危险在于，它可能导致我们不假思索地追随2000多年前的观点，而不去质疑这些理念是否真正有意义，是否符合我们想要的生活方式。

第二种误区是**折衷主义**（Eclecticism），即从不同哲学中选取片段来构建自己的生活哲学。虽然这听起来灵活，但问题在于，不同哲学体系内部往往具有严密的**内在一致性**（internally coherent）。简单拼凑可能导致思想上的混乱和不连贯。例如，斯多葛主义将**美德**（virtue）置于首位，而伊壁鸠鲁主义则将**快乐**（pleasure）视为最高价值。两者在某些情境下是无法兼容的，你无法同时成为一个纯粹的斯多葛主义者和一个纯粹的伊壁鸠鲁主义者。

因此，构建个人生活哲学需要批判性地参与。作者**马西莫·皮格里奇**（Massimo Pigliucci）分享了他从进化生物学家转向科学哲学家，并在中年危机中寻求哲学慰藉的经历。他系统性地研究了佛教、德性伦理（Virtue Ethics）等，最终被斯多葛主义中**爱比克泰德**的“判断力”（prohairesis）概念所吸引。这种判断力强调审慎和理性思考，而非财富或权力。

在实践斯多葛主义时，阅读原始文本固然重要，但现代诠释和更新也必不可少。古老的文本需要有深度的学者进行解读和语境化，例如**罗宾·沃特菲尔德**（Robin Waterfield）对**马可·奥勒留**和**爱比克泰德**的翻译，以及**塞内卡**（Seneca）著作的芝加哥大学出版社版本。同时，也应参考现代斯多葛学者的著作，如**唐纳德·罗伯逊**（Donald Robertson）、**比尔·欧文**（Bill Irvine）和**约翰·塞勒斯**（John Sellars），他们能将古老智慧与现代生活相结合，提供更具可操作性的指导。

<summary>Original English Source</summary>

Stoicism is a philosophy of life.
And that, if you think about
it, it's a interesting concept.
What is a philosophy of
life in the first place?
Do we need a philosophy of life?
I encounter people that tell me
that they don't need a philosophy of life,
they just live their life.
And I point out that that
is a philosophy of life.
There is no way to live a
life without a philosophy.
That philosophy might not be conscious,
it may not be the result of deliberations
that you did with yourself,
you know, paying attention
to what you're doing and why.
But if I observe your behavior,
if I see what your choices
are, your priorities,
your values, and so on and so forth,
I can put 'em all together and say,
"Okay, this person's
philosophy of life is this.
It's the result or it's whatever
underpins their choices,
their values, their priorities,
and their behavior."
So we all have a philosophy of life.
If that's true,
well, we might as well
then be conscious of it,
and be aware of it, and possibly,
even occasionally at least, ask ourselves,
well, is this a good
philosophy of life or not?
Do I need to change something?
So one might be tempted then
to go to the opposite extreme
and say, "Oh, if I need
a philosophy of life,
I'm gonna pick one off the shelf.
Here's Stoicism, I heard
that it's a good thing.
Let me pick Stoicism.
From now on, I'm a Stoic, and that's it,
end of the of the story."
But that is also dangerous in a sense
because now you are blindly following
what somebody said 2,000
years ago or 2,300 years ago
without necessarily
thinking things through,
without asking yourself,
"Well, does this thing
actually make sense?
Does it fit the way I
want to live my life?
And if not, why not?"
So there is, on the one hand, a danger
of not being aware of one's
own philosophy of life.
There's also the opposite danger
of sort of taking something off the shelf
without questioning,
without exercising one's
own critical judgment
about whether that thing
actually makes sense,
it's useful, works, et cetera.
Well, then there is a third option.
Some people say,
"Oh, I'm gonna build my
own philosophy of life
out of bits and pieces
from different choices.
So I heard that Stoicism is useful,
I'm gonna take something from Stoicism.
I heard that Epicureanism is useful,
I'm gonna take something from that.
Some of my friends are Buddhists.
Perhaps I could borrow
something from Buddhists."
That is certainly
something that can be done.
It's usually referred to as Eclecticism.
But yet it's also got its own problems
because you might end up
with a mishmash of things
that don't make any sense
when they're brought together.
There is a reason why these philosophies
are internally coherent,
and people have worked on
them for thousands of years
in order to make them internally coherent.
For instance, although the
Stoics themselves acknowledged
that there is something
useful in Epicureanism,
and they actually incorporated
aspects of Epicureanism
into their philosophy,
at the end of the day,
one cannot be simultaneously
a Stoic and an Epicurean.
Why not?
Because the most important
value for a Stoic
is one's own virtue,
meaning one's own character.
Pleasure is secondary.
The most important value for
an Epicurean is pleasure.
One's character, one's virtues,
are actually only instrumental
to a life of pleasure.
So at the end of the day,
there may be situations
where you had to choose.
Is it gonna be pleasure or
is it gonna be character?
And if you choose one
way you're an Epicurean,
and if you choose another
way you're a Stoic,
whether you're aware of it or not.
In my own case, I think of
myself as mostly a Stoic,
meaning that there are a number of things
in Stoic philosophy as a whole
that I think are very valuable,
they're very well thought out,
and I have adopted them as
at least a provisional way
of navigating my own life.
But I am also very much attracted
by another ancient Greco-Roman
philosophy, Skepticism,
which has to do with the
notion that we're fallible.
We don't know the truth
with the capital T.
At best, we can make reasonable guesses,
probabilistic guesses,
about what works or what doesn't work,
what is true and what is not true.
And we should therefore always be aware
that no matter what we
do, we may be mistaken.
No matter what we think,
we might be mistaken.
So I temper my Stoicism with
a little bit of Skepticism.
And in fact, I temper my Stoic Skepticism
with a little bit of something
that is called philosophical pessimism.
This is the notion
that there are probably no
grand narratives in the world.
There is no universal plan.
There is no end to history.
There is no inevitable
trajectory that we go
either in our lives or
as society as a whole.
It's all about things
happening here and now
and there is no rhyme or reason to them.
So I put all these things together
into what to me feels like a
reasonably coherent philosophy.
It's not my invention,
and yet at the same time,
it's not exactly anything
that you find specifically
in any particular other author.
One thing that I would
suggest, for instance,
is certainly read the original texts.
But even that is not that simple
because there are countless translations.
And sometimes if you read the same book
in different translations,
it almost feels like a different book.
There are versions of Marcus
Aurelius's "Meditations"
that really feel like a different book
from some other translations.
So one needs to be careful.
The more recent translations,
the more modern translations, are better.
Some of my favorite, for instance,
are by a Classicist
named Robin Waterfield,
who has translated both
Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.
The University of Chicago
Press has made a huge edition
of all of the writings of Seneca.
Invest a little bit of money.
After all, if we're
talking about something
that you wanna pursue
as a philosophy of life,
it's worth investing a few
bucks to actually get it right
or as right as possible.
One of the advantages
of these modern editions
is that they have a lot of notes,
and the notes will help
you, will guide you,
through understanding what
exactly these people are saying
because they're putting those notions
in their philosophical, as
well as historical context.
But the other thing is,
I hear often, people say,
"Oh, I'm just going to
read the story text.
Forget all of these modern
authors," including yours truly,
"who are writing about Stoicism."
I think that's a mistake.
I mean, that may come across
as a self-serving mistake since,
as I said, I'm one of those authors.
But nevertheless, I think it is a mistake.
I myself took advantage of
the writings of modern authors
because again Stoicism is ancient.
It's 2,300, almost 2,400 years old.
It needs interpretation, it needs updates.
And that interpretation, those updates,
need to be done carefully by people
who actually know what
they're talking about.
So, for instance, I would pick up a book
by my friend and colleagues,
Donald Robertson.
Robertson is a cognitive
behavioral therapist.
That's his approach to Stoicism.
Bill Irvine is a Classicist,
and so is John Sellars.
Those are some of the
best modern Stoic authors
that you can trust.
These are people who actually know
what they're talking about.
And all of these authors have written
very, very accessible
books that can be used
to dig deeper into Stoicism as
a modern philosophy of life.

### 情绪管理：认知重构与哲学日记的实践

斯多葛学派提供了一系列实用的技术来改善生活，其中最核心的是处理情绪。情绪是人类经验中不可避免的一部分，它们既可以是警报，提醒我们事态的正确或错误，也可能欺骗我们，导致我们做出后悔的反应。斯多葛学派认为，情绪并非与理性截然不同，两者高度互联。现代认知科学也证实了这一点：大脑中产生情绪的**杏仁体**（amygdala）和负责理性的**额顶叶**（frontal parietal lobes）之间存在着数十亿神经纤维的连接。

因此，改善与情绪关系的关键在于**认知重构**（cognitive reframing）。斯多葛学派提出一个两到三步的过程：
1.  **认知先行**：在面对任何可能引发情绪复杂性的情境前，仔细思考你想要做什么以及为什么。
2.  **行为跟随**：一旦思维定型，就按照这种思维方式行事。如果你认为某事是对或错，你的行为就应与此判断一致。
3.  **情绪调整**：通过反复的认知和行为结合，最终会影响并改变你的情绪。

以**侮辱**为例，**爱比克泰德**在《语录》（The Discourses）中多次讨论如何应对侮辱。当有人侮辱你时，你的第一反应可能是愤怒和升级冲突。但斯多葛学派会建议你重新思考：侮辱不过是对方说出某些词语，这些词语进入你的耳朵，你对其进行解读，并因此产生反应。关键在于你的解读。如果你认为这是不可接受的侮辱，你的情绪就会随之爆发；但如果你将其视为无关紧要的“空气波动”，或将其解读为对方的错误（与你无关）或正确的批评（值得学习），你的情绪就会缓和。这种**认知重构**能够有效降级情绪反应。

为了更好地应对突发情境，斯多葛学派提倡**哲学日记**（philosophical journaling）。这并非简单的日记，而是一种反思性记录，旨在分析而非重温经历。**马可·奥勒留**的《沉思录》（Meditations）就是这种日记的典范。他以第二人称（“你做了什么，你如何反应”）记录自己的生活和反应，这有助于与情绪保持距离，进行客观分析。

哲学日记的实践方法通常是在一天结束时，选择一个具体的事件进行反思，并提出三个问题：
1.  **我做错了什么？**（What did I do wrong?）：目的不是自责或后悔，而是从中学习。
2.  **我做对了什么？**（What did I do right?）：肯定积极行为，并设定目标以重复这些正确行为。
3.  **下次我能做些什么不同？**（What could I do next time?）：这是最关键的问题，因为许多情境会反复出现。通过预设更好的应对方式，可以在下一次面对类似挑战时做好准备。正如**塞内卡**（Seneca）所言，一个有准备的头脑能更好地应对困难。

- [Narrator] Chapter 2: The Stoic toolkit.
- I'm gonna try to teach you
a few basic Stoic techniques
that hopefully are gonna
make your life better
in the long run, maybe
even in the very short run
because a lot of Stoic techniques
tend to be efficacious almost immediately.
You can see the difference
yourself after a few days
or a few weeks of practice.
And perhaps there is
no better way to start
than with the connection
between reason and emotions.
How do we deal with emotions?
Emotions are a big part, of
course, of the human experience.
They are inevitable.
Even if we wanted to
avoid them, we cannot.
They are an intrinsic part
of our biology and our psychology.
Sometimes they're useful.
They are alarm bells, for instance.
They alert us to certain things
going right or going wrong.
Sometimes they deceive us
and they create problems.
They push us to react in ways
that then we're later going to regret.
The Stoics thought quite
a bit about emotions.
All of the major Stoic
authors write about emotions,
perhaps none more than Seneca,
who was a Roman senator who
lived in the first century.
He wrote one of the
best books on emotions,
I think, ever written.
It's called "On Anger."
And it focuses on that particular emotion
because it's important.
We all experience anger
under different conditions.
We all react in a way
that is driven by anger.
And sometimes we regret
the way we have acted.
So let's try to understand
what the Stoics actually say about this.
The fundamental idea is that emotions
are not in fact distinct or
sharply distinct from reason.
A lot of people seem to think
that reason is one thing
and emotion's another thing,
and they're sometimes in
conflict with each other.
So reason might have to overcome emotions
or perhaps if you are a
so-called emotional person,
you actually prefer the other way around.
But in reality, the two are
actually highly interconnected.
And this is one insight,
one intuition of the ancient Stoics,
that is definitely confirmed
by modern cognitive science.
We do know that the anatomical area
from where human emotions,
many human emotions, originate
is the amygdala, which
is the base of the brain.
And we do know that our reasoning faculty
resides mostly in the frontal
parietal lobes of the brain.
But we also know that those two areas
are massively interconnected.
There are literally
billions of neuronal fibers
that go back and forth between the two
so that there is no such a thing
as an emotional response
independent of the way you think,
and there is no such a thing
as thinking independently
of your emotional reactions.
Well, if that's true, the
Stoics say there is your key
to a better relationship
with your emotions.
What you need to do is a
two or three-step process
that begins with cognition.
It begins with thinking carefully
before you get into any situation
that might be emotionally complex
about what you want to do and why.
Once you set the stage
in terms of thinking,
then you try to behave accordingly
to that particular way of thinking.
If you think that one
thing is right or wrong,
then presumably you will want to behave
according to that judgment.
And it's this combination
of cognition and behavior
repeated over and over and over
that eventually affects your emotions,
sinks in at the emotional level,
and in fact will alter your emotions.
Let me give you an example.
Let's say that somebody insults you.
Epictetus talks a lot in
his writings about insults
and ways to deal with insults.
And most of us would
get upset at an insult
and in fact we would probably react.
We start escalating things.
You feel that rush of
adrenaline, you're getting angry.
How dare this person
talk to me in this way.
And then you start raising your voice
and then it escalates
into a confrontation,
possibly even a physical confrontation.
The Stoics would say,
well, before all of that,
think about it this way.
What exactly is an insult?
An insult is somebody opening their mouth,
saying certain words.
Those words arrive to your ears.
You interpret them in a certain way.
And because of that
interpretation, you react.
In other words, it's your thinking,
it's your cognition
that is the first step.
If you think this is
unacceptable, this is an insult,
how dare the person talk to me like that,
then your emotions will follow.
Then you're now fueling your anger.
You're fueling your aggressive
reaction to those words.
But if instead of going that
way, you say to yourself
an insult is nothing, it's
just air moving around.
It doesn't actually touch me.
It doesn't actually do anything to me.
If that person is saying something
about me that is insulting,
what does that mean?
Well, either that person is right,
and maybe he's expressing
his opinion in a clumsy way,
but he's actually right,
in which case, why am I
going to be upset about it?
If somebody is right and
it's setting me right,
then it's a good thing for
me to accept that counsel,
to accept that observation
and do something about it.
Or the person in question is wrong,
in which case, that's
his problem, not mine.
I'm not the one in wrong.
He is the one that is wrong.
He should be concerned with it, not I.
So either way, it is in
my power not to react
because it is in my power to
reframe the situation to myself
and think, this is not an insult.
This is just air bouncing off
and it doesn't actually touch me.
It doesn't actually hurt me.
Once you do that,
you're now deescalating
your emotional response
because your emotions
will react, will go along,
with whatever way you're
thinking about the situation.
If you're thinking that
you're being offended,
your emotions will escalate.
If you're thinking
that, oh, this is funny,
this is really ridiculous.
Doesn't the person in question know
that he's embarrassing himself?
Then your emotions will go
in a different direction.
It will deescalate.
You're not gonna get angry.
Now, this is of course
easier said than done.
This is not gonna happen
on your first try.
But the key here is to
constantly ask yourself,
what exactly is going on here
and what is a good reaction?
What might be a good
reaction to what is going on?
Once you reframed
whatever is happening
to yourself that way,
your emotions eventually will follow.
The problem in dealing with
situations as they're happening
is that after we're not mentally prepared.
And so we react in the moment,
and then perhaps we
misjudge the situation,
our emotions start running away from us,
and then we regret later on
whatever we did or whatever we said.
So the Stoics have a
very important technique
to help us prepare ourselves
to difficult situations,
to deal with difficult situations.
That technique goes
under a number of names.
Often it's referred to as
philosophical journaling.
And I say philosophical
because it's a particular
type of journaling.
This is not a diary where
you just write down,
oh, today I went and did this or did that
and it was fun, that sort of stuff.
It's a journal of reflection.
And perhaps the best model
of that journal available
to Stoic practitioners
is the "Meditations" of the
Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
The "Meditations" was never
meant for publication.
It is in fact the Emperor's
personal philosophical journal.
And if you read it,
you'll see there is no
particular structure.
There are 12 chapters, but the 12 chapters
don't have any particular subheadings,
there is no particular topic,
because Marcus is going through his life
and he is reflecting
on whatever was happening at that moment
and how he was reacting
to what was happening.
And so, often, people read the
"Meditations," for instance,
and they come across with this
notion that it's repetitive
and it's a little preachy.
Both of those things are true.
It's repetitive because Marcus,
just like the rest of us,
kept running into the same
problems over and over again.
So for instance, he had an
issue with anger management.
And so you will see in the "Meditations"
that there are several places
where Marcus says to himself,
"Why did you get upset about this today?
What is a better way to
answer that situation,
to react to that situation
instead of getting angry?"
And it's preachy because
he's preaching to himself.
He's not talking to an audience,
he's talking to himself,
and he says, "Look, you really
need to do things this way
and not that way."
So how does that work in practice?
Incidentally, this is another thing
where there is very good evidence
from modern cognitive behavioral
therapy in particular,
but also cognitive science in general,
that this technique of
philosophical journaling,
of reflection on your
actions, actually does work.
It's a very good tool
for self-improvement,
for ethical self-improvement.
There are different ways
in which you can do
philosophical journaling.
Both Seneca and Epictetus
actually give you details.
There are bits in their
writings where they say,
"This is how you do it."
And as I said, Marcus
Aurelius is a great example.
There is a whole book there
where you can read it
and see how it is done.
My favorite way of doing it
is carving out a little bit
of time at the end of the day,
before you go to bed,
when you're not too tired,
quiet down, open up your
journal, or your tablet,
or however you prefer to do it.
It doesn't have to be a
written exercise either.
You can just think about it.
But it's better to be
done as a written exercise
because then you have a record
of what you've been doing and thinking
over eventually a period of years,
and then you can go back and check
if you have improved in certain areas
or if there are certain issues
that are particularly problematic
and recurring for you.
And you ask yourself, you
pick a particular example
of something that happened during the day,
for instance, let's say
somebody came up to me
and trying to insult me,
and you said something that
is rude or uncalled for.
And I reacted in a certain way.
So I describe to myself in
the journal the situation
as objectively as I can without
using emotional language,
as analytically as I can.
Because the point is not
to relive the experience,
the point is to analyze the
experience and learn from it.
In fact, if you notice, Marcus
Aurelius writes his journal
in the second person.
He says, "You did this
and you reacted this way."
This may sound strange and
it may feel a little awkward
to do it that way,
but again, there is very good
evidence from modern studies
that it does help keeping the distance
from your emotional responses,
which is in fact helpful
in trying to learn analytically
from what you did and what
you perhaps didn't do.
Imagine you're just talking to a friend.
You're writing to a friend.
You say, "You did this,
how come you reacted
this way or that way?"
So you pick a particular instance,
so something that happened,
an incident that happened during the day,
you briefly describe that
incident to your friend,
and then you ask yourself three questions.
What did I do wrong?
What did I do right?
And what could I do next time?
Why ask yourself those questions?
The first one, what did I do wrong?
The point is not to
indulge in sort of regret,
and self-flagellation, and things like,
those are all useless
according to the Stoics.
Whatever you did, it's done.
You cannot change it.
You cannot go back in time and change it.
However, you can learn from it.
The second question is,
well, what did I do right?
It's essentially the same idea,
only in the the flip side of that coin,
that is, you don't just
want to remind yourself
the kinds of things that you do wrong,
you also want to set goals
that you're gonna achieve over and over.
Here's where I don't
wanna go the next time,
here's where I do want
to go the next time,
or here's what I wanna do
less and less moving forward,
and here's what I want to do
more and more moving forward.
The third question is
arguably the most crucial one,
what could I have done differently?
Again, this is not about regret
because you can't change what you did.
But it's about the fact that,
you know, as much as we think of our lives
as endlessly fascinating, and different,
and varied, and all that sort of stuff,
in fact, most of the time we
tend to do the same things
pretty much every day.
That's an advantage as far
as the Stoics are concerned,
because what that means
is that whatever situation
you did not handle properly today
is likely going to happen
again, possibly soon.
So if a colleague, for instance, came in
and said something insulting,
or rude, or whatever,
well, you know, that person
isn't gonna go away very
likely anytime soon,
and his behavior is not
gonna change necessarily
in any radical fashion.
So you can expect reasonably then,
in a few days, or next
week, or next month,
something close to that will happen again.
But now you're ready.
You may not have been ready
today when it happened,
that's why you're doing this self-analysis
in your philosophical journal,
but you're gonna be ready next time.
You're telling yourself, "Okay,
well if this happens again,
here is a better way to respond."
That way you're prepared.
And Seneca says a prepared
mind handles difficulties,
handles delicate situations much better.
Perhaps not perfectly,
but the goal is not perfection
necessarily, but better.

### 控制二分法：应对不确定性的斯多葛策略

斯多葛主义的核心洞察之一是**控制二分法**（Dichotomy of Control），即区分“我们能控制的事”和“我们不能控制的事”。这种思想与20世纪初美国神学家撰写的**宁静祷文**（Serenity Prayer）不谋而合：“愿上帝赐予我宁静，去接受我不能改变的；赐予我勇气，去改变我能改变的；赐予我智慧，去分辨两者的不同。”这实际上是**爱比克泰德**在公元二世纪提出的基本洞见的现代重述。

在复杂多变的世界中，我们面临宏观（如政治、社会变革）和个人层面的诸多不确定性。斯多葛学派通过以下方式应对这些不确定性和有限的能动性：
1.  **列出清单**：在面对挑战（例如求职面试）时，明确列出“我能控制的”和“我不能控制的”两类事项。
    *   **不可控事项**：例如，是否能得到这份工作取决于竞争、面试官的心情等外部因素。斯多葛学派认为，对于这些，我们应以平静和泰然的心态接受，因为世界本就如此，并非事事如愿。
    *   **可控事项**：例如，为面试做充分准备、保证充足睡眠（尽管结果可能受外部干扰）、准时到达（尽管交通可能出问题）。这里的重点是**意图**（intention）和**尽力而为**，而非最终结果。

通过这种方式，我们将注意力集中在可控的左侧清单上，并为此做好充分准备。对于不可控的右侧清单，我们只需意识到其可能性，并为可能发生的不利情况做好心理准备。这样做不仅能提高我们在可控领域的效率，还能帮助我们保持平静、安宁的心态，避免为无法改变的事情而烦恼。

这种方法不仅适用于个人层面，也适用于社会和政治层面。例如，面对气候变化等全球性挑战，虽然个人无法独自改变大局，但仍有许多可控的行动：获取信息、向相关组织捐款、投票、与他人交流、参与公共活动等。这些行动虽不能立即解决问题，但能为解决方案做出贡献，并在个人层面带来积极的感受。同时，也要接受气候变化问题最终解决与否，并非个人所能完全掌控，并为此做好心理准备。

You may have heard of something
called the Serenity Prayer,
which is not exactly the
same thing that comes to mind
when we talk about Stoicism.
But bear with me for a
second, there is a connection.
The Serenity Prayer,
which is often recited
at the beginning of meetings
of 12-step organizations
such as Alcoholic Anonymous
goes something like this.
It asks God to have the
wisdom to tell the difference
between what we can change
and what we cannot change,
the courage to change what we can,
and the serenity to accept what we cannot.
That notion, that Serenity Prayer,
was written at the beginning
of the 20th century
by an American theologian,
but in fact it's a rephrasing
of a fundamental insight
by the Stoic Epictetus
that goes back to the beginning
of the second century.
The two are in fact connected historically
because it turns out
that Epictetus's manual for a good life
was used throughout the
middle ages by Christian monks
as a source of spiritual exercises.
Now, Epictetus doesn't
quite phrase it that way,
but the same idea holds,
and it's one of the most interesting
and most useful ideas in Stoicism.
Epictetus talks about
some things are up to us,
and some things are not up to us,
and we should focus on the things
that are up to us and act on them
because that is where our
agency is efficacious,
and we should develop an
attitude of acceptance
and equanimity toward the
things that are not up to us.
Now, we all live in a complex world
where there are all sorts of things
that we don't necessarily control,
both at a macroscopic level,
let's say political change,
social change, things like that,
and at a personal level.
You know, things happen in our life
that we don't necessarily have much to say
or do about because they
depend on a number of factors
that we do not control.
So how do the Stoics deal with
those kinds of uncertainties
and that kind of limited agency
that, at the end of the day, we all have.
Let's pick an example, a specific example.
Let's say that tomorrow morning
I'm going to have a job interview.
And it's a job that I really want.
It's important for me to
do well in that interview,.
Epictetus would say,
well, the best way you
can prepare yourself
for that challenge is the
day before, let's say,
to ask yourself, what
under these circumstances
is up to me and what is not up to me?
And you can do this literally
by making two lists.
You can do it in your mind,
or better yet, you can write down a table.
You can draw a table with
two columns and say up to me,
not up to me.
It's surprising, once you
start paying attention
to the question,
how many things you actually
will be able to list.
For instance, actually
getting the job, not up to me.
It depends on the competition,
it depends on who's doing the interview
and how they're feeling that day,
and on a number of other things
that are really not under my control,
which means, according to Epictetus,
that I have to be ready
to accept the possibility
that things will not go my way
and accept that with
serenity, with equanimity,
because that's the way the world works.
Sometimes job interviews are successful
and other times they're not.
And we're adults.
We don't throw a tantrum
when things don't go our way.
What is up to me?
Well, clearly to prepare
myself as much as possible
and as carefully as possible
for the job interview.
What else is up to me?
Well, try to get a good night's sleep
because we know that being
rested and all that helps.
But notice that I said to try
to get a good night's sleep,
not to actually get a good night's sleep,
because it's possible that my neighbor,
you know, in the next
apartment is throwing a party
into the late night and I
will not be able to sleep
as many hours as I should or want to
because there are, again, circumstances
that are outside of my control
that are gonna interfere
with it, with my intentions.
So the intention is mine,
but the outcome is not under my control.
What else?
Well, it's certainly a good idea
to show up on time for the job interview.
That means that you care,
that you are a professional,
and so on and so forth.
But again, there, what is up to me
is to try to show up on time.
I live in New York.
That's not a guarantee.
I can get on the subway and the
subway all of a sudden stops
in the middle of the tracks
and it's not gonna move,
or I may take a taxi and
there's a lot of traffic
and I may actually get there late.
So to try to have the
intention to do my best
in order to get there on time is up to me,
actually getting there
on time is not up to me,
and so on and so forth.
So we can come up with these lists
that are actually fairly detailed.
The more detailed, the better.
And the idea is that
once you have these lists
of things that are up to me
and things that are not up to me,
you focus only on the
one to the left side,
the things that are up to me.
Those are the ones that
I want to rehearse,
think carefully about, be
as prepared as possible
because my agency lies in that direction.
All of the other ones, I
can still be aware of them
and I can mentally prepare myself
for the possibility that they are
or they're not going to go
in my preferred direction.
But that's all I can do about it.
The result is that you're
much more efficacious
in the things you do because your agency
is in fact at play there.
But it's also true that you accept things
in a way that maintains
calm, tranquility, serenity.
You don't upset yourself over things
for which frankly there is
no point in getting upset.
The same approach of focusing
on things that are up to us
and accepting with equanimity
things that are not up to us
can be applied to pretty
much every situation
and every challenge or potential
setback we might suffer,
not just at an individual
level, at a personal level,
but also at a societal
level or a political level.
And the Stoics themselves lived
in really turbulent times.
The Hellenistic period,
which went from the death
of Alexander the Great
and the collapse of the Macedonian Empire
to the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE,
which basically marked the
beginning of the Roman Empire,
was in fact a period of major turmoil
where things were changing very rapidly,
seemingly completely outside the control
of most individuals.
Well, we might live in
a similar situation.
We're facing major challenges
that all of us, most of us,
feel unprepared and not particularly able
to do anything about.
You know, there's political
change, there's social change,
we're facing the possibility
of climate catastrophe.
We are still facing the possibility
of, you know, a nuclear war, for instance,
and things like that.
How does a Stoic deal with
those kinds of situations?
It's exactly the same approach.
Again, you ask yourself,
what here is up to me
and what is not up to me?
You make the two lists,
you focus on the first one,
and then you try to do your best
to accept with serenity the second.
For instance, let's say
that I'm concerned about
climate change, as I should be.
Well, I can't change anything dramatically
at that level for that
kind of problem on my own.
And this is not an individual level.
Arguably, it's not even a problem
that can be solved by
an individual society.
It requires literally global actions.
But that doesn't mean that I
cannot do anything about it.
So if I start writing down
the things that are up to me,
I can come up, for instance,
with the following partial list.
Well, I can inform myself.
The first basis for rational
decisions is to get informed.
I can also donate to organizations
that actively work in that direction.
I can vote.
I can talk to people.
I can go in the streets
and join other people
that are vocal about these kind of things.
All of these approaches
are in fact up to me.
They're under my agency.
And doing them by themselves
of course will not solve the problem,
but it will contribute toward
the solution of the problem,
and just as importantly,
at a personal level,
will make me feel better
because I'm doing something about it.
But by the same token,
there's the second column,
the things that are not up to me.
Actually solving the
problem of climate change
is certainly not up to me.
Actually even getting
a particular politician
that might contribute
to the solution elected
is not up to me.
Actually achieving in fact
all of those things that I just mentioned
is not really up to me.
And therefore, although I hope
that things are gonna go
in a certain direction,
I have to be ready for the
possibility that they won't.
And that's okay because,
again, not everything in life
goes the way we prefer,
and we need to accept
as rational, reasonable adults
that we may not have a choice,
and we need to be okay with the notion
that we don't have a choice on everything.
We cannot act on everything.
We cannot solve everything.

### 决策与意图优先：斯多葛的判断力哲学

人生中常面临艰难抉择，我们倾向于简化问题，寻找非黑即白的答案，并常常事后质疑自己的决定。斯多葛学派对决策制定有深入思考，**爱比克泰德**认为我们最重要的能力是**判断力**（prohairesis: 希腊语，意指意志、决策，即对情境做出判断并尽力付诸行动的能力）。

斯多葛学派认为，世界并非总是简单明了，我们不应试图将自己的意愿强加于世界，而应努力理解世界的运作方式并据此行动。**爱比克泰德**曾提醒学生，宇宙不会为了你的便利而重新安排。面对复杂情境，没有万无一失的正确决策方法，唯一能做的就是尽可能地磨砺我们的判断力。这正是**爱比克泰德**第三项训练——**认同的训练**——的核心。

斯多葛学派认为，我们不断受到**印象**（impressions: 感官体验与本能判断的结合）的轰击。例如，看到美味的冰淇淋，会立即产生“应该去吃”的印象。**爱比克泰德**建议，此时应停下来思考，质疑这个印象是否真的好。通过理性分析，我们可以发现冲动行为可能带来的负面后果（如影响食欲或健康），从而做出更明智的决定。

斯多葛学派强调，**我们能控制的是意图，而非意图的结果**。因此，在决策时，我们应更多地关注“为什么要做某事”，而非“能否成功”。例如，去施粥所做志愿者，斯多葛学派会问：你的动机是**美德**（virtuous）吗？如果你真心想帮助他人，那么无论结果如何，这都是一种美德行为。但如果只是为了简历上好看，那这种行为就不具备美德，因为它利用他人作为达到个人目的的手段，损害了你的品格。将视角从结果转向意图和品格，往往能简化决策过程，因为“为什么做”的答案通常比“是否是好事”的答案更清晰。斯多葛哲学的最终目标是使我们成为更好的人，过上值得过的生活。

I'm sure you noticed that
one of the things in life
is that sometimes we have
to make tough decisions.
And we second guess ourselves.
We tend to go one way and then think,
maybe I should have gone the other way.
We tend to think in a dichotomous fashion.
We tend to think that it's
either black or white,
either this or that.
The Stoics thought a lot
about decision making.
In fact, Epictetus thought
that our most important faculty
was something that he called prohairesis,
which is Greek for will, the decision,
the ability to actually
arrive at a judgment
and an assessment of a situation
and then try to act on it,
do your best to act on it.
The problem is of course that
life sometimes is complicated.
There are multiple choices.
We have a tendency to
want to simplify things
and go for something that it's stark,
that it's clear, that it's obvious.
That's just not the way the world works.
And according to the
Stoics, it's much better
to try to understand how the world works
and then act accordingly
rather than trying to impose on the world
the way we want to think
or the way we prefer things to be.
There are several passages
in Epictetus's discourses
where he talks to his
students and he reminds them,
to design the world in a certain way
that it's convenient for
you is not up to you.
At one point, in fact, it
gets even pretty funny.
One of the students apparently complained
of having a cold and a running nose.
And Epictetus looks at him and says,
"So what do you think?
The universe should rearrange yourself
so that you don't have a running nose?
Why don't you just get a
handkerchief and wipe it off?"
So sometimes it's about obvious things,
sometimes it's about things
that are complicated.
And there is no sure way
to make right decisions.
The only thing that we
can do is to make sure
that we fine-tune as much
as possible our prohairesis,
that is, our faculty of judgment.
That is what the third discipline
of Epictetus is about, right?
The discipline of assent.
Assent means to agree to something.
According to the Stoics,
we are constantly
bombarded by impressions,
what they call impressions.
An impression is essentially a combination
of a sensorial experience
and an immediate, usually
instinctive judgment.
For instance, I might walk down the street
and I have the impression
that it's good to go buy
and eat that gelato that
I just saw displayed.
Because it tastes good, it looks good,
it's attractive, I should do it.
That's an impression.
It's a combination of,
I am seeing something
and I'm immediately arriving at a judgment
that doing something about
that object is a good thing.
Epictetus says that's the time
when you wanna stop and think.
Ask yourself.
In fact, talk to your impression.
Say, "Well, wait a minute,
is this really a good thing?
Should I actually go on and get the gelato
and eat it right now?
Well, maybe not because
I'm on my way to dinner.
Eating a gelato will spoil my appetite.
Also, frankly, my waistline
is not exactly in the best shape possible,
so that's not gonna help either.
No, on second thought, a better decision
is to ignore the gelato,
keep walking, and go home.
That's a simple situation.
But we face constantly these kinds
of decision making
opportunities, so to speak.
And we also constantly
second guess ourselves.
"Oh, I should have done this.
I should have done this other thing."
The Stoics think that what is
up to you is your intentions,
not the outcomes of those intentions.
So what you need to do is to work
on why are you trying to do certain things
more than on, will I succeed
in doing these things?
And that might simplify our
decision making problems.
For instance, let's say that I go
and volunteer in my soup kitchen
around the corner from my apartment.
Is this a good thing to do or
is it not a good thing to do?
Well, most people probably
would say it's a good thing
because I'm helping other people,
I'm spending my time in a way
that it's helpful to others,
and so on and so forth.
But a Stoic would actually
frame the question differently.
The question would be not necessarily,
is the action itself good or not,
but are your motivations virtues or not?
Why am I doing this?
If it turns out that I
generally want to help people,
then that is in fact a virtuous action,
whether I succeed or not.
However, it's also possible
that I decided to do that
because I need a new line on my resume
to look good the next time
that I apply for a job
so that I can show that I also
volunteer for social causes.
Well, that's not virtuous,
because now I'm using other
people as a means to an end,
to my own end, to self aggrandize,
to get my own benefit
out of this thing, right?
So it's not virtuous.
Even though it might
still be useful to others,
I might still be helpful to others,
this is not really the right thing to do
because it actually
undermines my character.
So to shift perspective from the outcome,
is this a good thing or a bad thing,
to my intentions and
therefore my character,
is this good for me,
does this make me a better person
or does it actually
undermine my character,
it makes me a worse person,
very often will simplify
our decision making
because it turns out that the
answer to why am I doing this
is often much simpler than the answer to,
is this really truly a good thing to do
or not a good thing to do?
The very goal of Stoic
philosophy, of Stoicism,
is to make us into better human beings,
into the kind of human beings that lives
a life that is worth living.

### 顺应自然：伦理与心理健康的经验性洞察

斯多葛学派认为，**顺应自然而活**（live according to nature）并非指回归原始生活，而是指理解人类作为一种生物的本质，以及什么能使其繁荣发展。这使得伦理学（即如何过上好生活的研究）成为一门**经验性学科**（empirical discipline），因为它需要观察什么能使人类变得更好或更糟。

斯多葛学派将伦理学比作**医学**（medicine）：医学关注身体健康，伦理学关注心灵健康（psyche）。正如人类对糖和脂肪有天然吸引力，但在现代社会过度摄入却有害健康一样，某些人类行为（如愤怒）虽然是自然的反应，但从心理健康角度看却是有害的。愤怒是对感知到的不公的自然反应，但斯多葛学派认为，愤怒在心理上等同于高脂肪或高糖食物，不利于过上好生活。

那么，在精神层面，什么对我们有益呢？斯多葛学派提出两点：
1.  **理性解决问题**：通过理性思考来解决问题，而非冲动行事或被动反应。
2.  **亲社会合作**：与他人合作，因为人类是社会性动物，在社会群体中才能茁壮成长。

这种亲社会理念进一步扩展到**世界公民**（cosmopolitan）的范畴。公元二世纪的斯多葛学者**希罗克勒斯**（Hierocles）在《伦理学原理》（Principles of Ethics）中提出“同心圆”理论：我们应将所有人的关切圈层，从家人、朋友、熟人，逐渐扩展到全人类，并努力将这些圈层拉近。他甚至建议，遇到陌生人时，可以称呼他们为“兄弟姐妹”或“叔叔阿姨”，以此提醒自己和他人，我们同舟共济，相互依存。

斯多葛主义的实践并非概念上的复杂，而是行动上的坚持。正如体育锻炼一样，理解举重动作很简单，但只有日复一日地练习，才能增强肌肉。同样，斯多葛的智慧在于其简单性，但真正的挑战在于每次面对困难时，都能坚持运用这些原则，专注于可控之事，并以平静的心态接受不可控之事。

Well, it means a number of things,
but one way in which the
Stoics answered that question,
you know, what sort of
life we should live,
is that they say we should
live according to nature.
Now, to live according to nature
doesn't mean running naked into the forest
and hugging trees, although of course
there is nothing wrong
with that necessarily.
It means to look at the
kind of living being,
of organism, that a human is
and what actually makes
that organism flourish,
makes it do good things, better
things, have a happier life,
as opposed to the kinds of things
that get in the way of human flourishing.
This turns ethics, remember
that for the Stoics,
ethics is the study of
how to live a good life,
into essentially an empirical discipline,
because it's about human nature.
You have to observe things
about what makes human
beings better or worse,
what makes a human life better or worse.
The Stoics drew an interesting analogy.
They thought that ethics is like medicine.
You know, medicine of course
being concerned with the body,
ethics being concerned with
the mind, with our psyche.
Now, there are some
things, some behaviors,
that are natural for us,
but they're not good from
a medical perspective.
For instance, we have a
natural attraction to sugar
and to fatty foods.
That probably evolved by natural selection
in a period of human evolution
where there wasn't a lot of food around.
And so every time that we run
into a source of fat or sugar,
we were better served
by actually taking advantage of it, right?
But we don't live in that
kind of environment anymore.
We don't live in the Pleistocene anymore.
We live in cities where you
can find food 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
And so having these natural
craving, because it's natural,
for fat and sugar is
actually not good for us.
It undermines our physical health.
It causes all sorts of
problems, diabetes and so on,
heart attacks, et cetera.
So a doctor will look at this and say,
"Look, this is in fact a natural craving,
but the healthy thing to do
would be to resist that craving,
to reorient your priorities elsewhere."
The Stoics make exactly the same argument
in terms of the human psyche.
There are some things that
come natural to human beings
in terms of behavior, for instance, anger.
Anger is a natural response
to a perceived injustice.
But the Stoics argue anger is
the psychological equivalent
of a fatty food or a lot of sugar.
It's just not good for you mentally.
It doesn't lead to a good life.
Then what is good for
you at a mental level,
at a psychical level?
Two things.
To reason your way through your problems
instead of bulldozing things
or just reacting in the moment,
and most importantly, to be social,
to cooperate with other people,
because we are, of course, social animals
and we thrive in a
society, in a social group.
Now, from there, the step is not very far
to realizing that it's not
just my immediate group,
it's not just my family, my friends,
or perhaps the people
that live in my city.
It makes sense to cooperate, to be good,
to be positive about any human
being that lives anywhere
because after all, we live
in an interconnected world.
Now, one of those early
Stoics, a guy named Hierocles,
in the second century, wrote a book
called "Principles of Ethics."
Hierocles says what we should try to do
is to metaphorically bring
people, all the people,
closer and closer to us.
Imagine that you are the
center of your own world.
As soon as you do that,
you immediately realize
that you depend on other people,
your parents, for instance, your siblings.
And then eventually you realize
that you depend on other people
that you start calling your friends.
And then you depend on further
larger group of people,
outside, you know, acquaintances,
or people that don't necessarily
directly come in contact with
but that indirectly affect your life.
Well, what Hierocles said
was what you need to do
is to bring all those circles,
which extend eventually
all the way to the entirety of humanity,
closer and closer to yourself.
You should think of your friends
as if they were your family.
You should think of your acquaintances
as if they were your friends.
You should think of strangers
as if they were your acquaintances,
and so on and so forth.
Bring them closer.
Your circles of concern should shrink
and your concern should
expand to all of these people.
And Hierocles actually goes so far
as giving practical
advice of how to do that.
It's not just a way of
thinking about stuff,
you actually can behave in
a way that is cosmopolitan,
because that's ultimately the
word that the Stoics used.
And the way you do that is,
Hierocles says just go around,
and when you meet strangers,
address them as brother and sister,
or perhaps uncle and aunt,
depending on their age, and
their gender, and so on.
In other words, remind yourself and others
that we are in fact all
on the same boat together
and that we depend on each
other for a good navigation.
Now, at this point, you
might be tempted to think,
this is just too simple.
Some things are up to me,
other things are not up to me.
Yeah, sure, everybody knows that.
So what?
How is that gonna make
a difference in my life?
Well, but the issue is not
that things are simple or not,
the issue is, are you going
to act on those things?
Are you actually going
to practice those things?
Ethics, after all, is not rocket science.
You're not gonna have to build
a rocket that goes to the moon.
You just have to improve
your life bit by bit,
action by action, thought by thought.
Here's an analogy that
the Stoics themselves
made very often with athletics.
They thought, well, you
know, if you go into a gym
and somebody's gonna show you,
a trainer is gonna show you
how to lift weights, for instance,
you might be tempted to say,
"Oh, is that all there is to it?"
It's a simple action.
I, you know, pick up the
weights in a certain way,
I make sure that my posture in a certain,
and then that's it, I'm done.
Yes, the action is conceptually simple,
but the difference is going to come only
if, every day or several times a week,
you come to the gym and you
actually do that action.
That's how you're gonna get your muscles.
That's how you're gonna get
your physical ability improved,
not by the fact that you understand
something that is simple to do,
but by the fact that
once you understood it,
you actually practice it
over and over and over.
The same goes for the kind of Stoic advice
that we've heard so far.
Yes, it's very simple to say that,
you know, some things are up to me
and other things are not up to me.
What is difficult is to
actually follow through.
Every time that you face a challenge,
every time that you face
a difficult situation,
you go through that exercise
and then you focus your
attention on what is up to you
and trying to develop a
good attitude of acceptance
and equanimity toward that
that is not up to you.
That is the difficult part.
It's not the conceptual understanding,
it's the actual practice.

### 斯多葛主义的现代复兴与常见误解辨析

斯多葛主义在过去10到15年间经历了显著的复兴，这并非偶然。我们所处的时代与斯多葛主义最初繁荣的希腊化时期（Hellenistic period）有诸多相似之处——政治和社会剧烈变革，人们寻求应对快速变化且难以理解的世界的方法。斯多葛主义作为一种强调**韧性**（resilience）和应对挑战的哲学，在当前不确定性高的时代显得尤为实用。

然而，斯多葛主义的流行也伴随着许多误解。一个常见的误解是，斯多葛主义只适用于应对挫折和挑战，例如在**新冠疫情**（COVID pandemic）期间，许多人寻求斯多葛智慧来处理困境。但斯多葛主义的核心是关于**决策制定**（decision making）的哲学，它在顺境和逆境中都同样有用。即使是积极的事件，如事业成功或获得财富，也需要明智的决策来管理和利用，以实现更好的生活。

另一个普遍的误解是将斯多葛主义等同于“小写s”的**斯多葛态度**（stoic attitude）——即“坚忍不拔”（stiff upper lip）、压抑情绪、像《星际迷航》中的**斯波克先生**（Mr. Spock）一样。这种观点认为，一个强大的人，尤其是男性，应该沉默寡言，控制情绪。但真正的“大写S”斯多葛主义并非如此。虽然**忍耐**（endurance）确实是斯多葛的价值观之一（对于无法改变的事情，唯一的理性选择是忍受），但这只是其哲学的一小部分。

斯多葛学派也并非主张**压抑情绪**（suppressing emotions）。情绪是人类大脑运作的固有部分，无法被真正压抑。斯多葛学派强调的是**通过理性来调节情绪**（modulating emotions through reason），例如将破坏性的愤怒转化为建设性的正义感。将斯多葛主义解读为强调**男性气质**（masculinity）的“兄弟化”（broification）倾向，也是一种肤浅的理解。这种观点常引用拉丁词“vir”（意为“男人”）来解释“virtue”（美德），但斯多葛主义源于希腊哲学，其对应的希腊词“arete”意为“卓越”，是性别中立的。事实上，古代斯多葛学者明确指出，女性与男性一样具有理性，同样有能力理解和实践哲学。斯多葛的**正义**（justice）美德要求不分性别、种族、国籍等，以尊严和尊重对待每一个人。

此外，将斯多葛主义简化为一系列**生活小窍门**（life hacks），而忽视其作为一个连贯哲学体系的整体性，也是一种误解。就像佛教中的冥想，虽然冥想本身有用，但它只是实践佛教哲学（如接受**四圣谛**或遵循**八正道**）的辅助工具。同样，斯多葛技术（如认知行为疗法中的技巧）即使脱离斯多葛哲学也很有用，但要成为真正的斯多葛主义者，必须努力以理性、亲社会的方式生活，并视地球上每个人为兄弟姐妹。

- [Narrator] Chapter 3:
Debunking misconceptions about Stoicism.
- Perhaps predictably,
there is a lot of discussion
and even a little bit of confusion
about what Stoicism is and is not.
If you read a random
writing about Stoicism
or you listen to a random
podcast about Stoicism,
you will hear things like,
"Oh, don't go that way
because that's not really Stoicism."
In fact, to some extent,
I've done this as well.
I think I have arguments for it.
These arguments, I think, are based
on a good understanding of the philosophy,
as well as on the original texts.
But I admit there are different opinions
about the nature of Stoicism.
This is not surprising.
We see the same thing in other
philosophies and religion.
There are different opinions
about what Christianity is.
There are different opinions
about what Buddhism is.
And in fact, arguably, there
are different Christianities
and different Buddhisms,
meaning that there are
different ways to interpret
what the ancient texts say
and also different ways
to update those texts
and those philosophies
to the 21st century.
So the same goes for Stoicism.
In fact, to some extent,
this has happened from the beginning.
One of the students of Zeno of Citium,
who was the originator of Stoicism,
he was the guy who
actually started the store.
One of his students is
on record disagreeing
about some of the things
that Zeno was saying
and starting his own thing.
And he went in a different direction,
and he started his own school.
So this has happened since the beginning.
Disagreement is the nature of philosophy
and possibly the nature
of the human condition.
Nevertheless, one needs to be
cautious about what we read
and how we think about things
because we need to make at least
a honest, concerted effort,
if we're interested in a
particular philosophy or religion,
to get to the bottom of what
the thing is actually about
and not what necessarily some
people claim it is about.
Stoicism at the moment is in resurgence.
It's very popular for number of years now.
You will easily find new
books, and new articles,
and new podcasts, and new essays
on Stoicism as a practical philosophy.
And one might ask reasonably,
why Stoicism all of a sudden?
Well, on the one hand, Stoicism
really never went away.
It is true that all of the
Hellenistic philosophies
gradually disappeared from view
between the third and the fourth century,
essentially contemporaneously
with the rise of Christianity.
And the two things are in
fact more or less related.
But it's also true that
a lot of Stoic ideas
were in fact incorporated
into Christianity,
and they were transmitted by the church,
the early church fathers,
into the Middle Ages.
Eventually, they reemerged as Stoic ideas
into the Renaissance and later
on into the enlightenment.
And so the fact that today
we are talking about Stoicism
and people are practicing Stoicism
isn't really that surprising.
On the other hand, it
is certainly the case
that the number of people who
are interested in Stoicism
has surged dramatically over
the last 10 to 15 years.
And so it makes sense to
ask ourselves, well, why?
Possibly one of the answers
is that we live in turbulent times,
which are essentially
the same kinds of times
that led to the initial
flourishing of Stoicism.
Stoicism flourished during
the Hellenistic period,
which was a major period,
lasting two or three centuries,
of political change, social change.
In fact, all of the so-called
Hellenistic philosophies,
not just Stoicism, but also Epicureanism,
to different forms of Skepticism,
and a number of others,
were very popular or arose at that time
precisely because people
were looking for answers.
People were looking for ways to navigate
a rapidly changing world
that was difficult to make sense of
and was even more difficult to cope with.
Today, arguably, since, I would say,
at least the 20th century
and then certainly into the 21st century,
we live in a similar world.
Last century, we went
through two world wars.
Then we developed enough nuclear weapons
to destroy the planet many times over.
Then, near the end of the 20th century
and beginning of the 21st,
we started being more aware of
yet another major challenge,
which we refer to as climate change.
Not to mention, of course,
more local, at a national level
or at a regional level,
political change, social change
that keeps happening at a very high pace.
And a lot of people
are distraught by this.
They don't know how to process this.
They don't know what their place
is going to be in a society
that looks very different
from not only the society of
their parents and grandparents,
but even the society that they experienced
as younger selves.
So it's no surprise that
Stoicism in particular,
which is a philosophy
after all of resilience
and of coping with potential challenges
and potential drawbacks,
is having a moment of resurgence.
I think it's perfectly reasonable.
And in fact, it's perfectly useful.
However, that does bring
people to a misunderstanding.
A lot of people seem to think
that's all that Stoicism is,
that is, that Stoicism
is good only as a remedy
toward setbacks and challenges.
For instance, during the
recent COVID pandemic,
I personally got a lot of calls
from people asking me
about Stoicism, and say,
you know, "Can I use Stoicism
to deal with the situation?"
And the answer was of course you can.
But you also don't wanna
forget that we make decisions
all the time in life,
throughout our lives,
whether it's good times or bad times.
Whether it's a challenge
or an opportunity,
it doesn't matter.
We still have to make the
best decisions we can.
And Stoicism, in a sense, is a philosophy
about decision making, about the best way
to approach decision making.
So it's just as useful in
good times, so to speak,
as it is in bad times.
It's just that people tend to reach for it
only when they're in distress,
and then they become sort
of a little bit relaxed,
probably inappropriately
relaxed, I should say,
when it comes to the good times.
We don't think that if we are
going through things that are positive,
let's say we come into,
we have a good moment in our career,
or we come into some money,
or something like that,
that those are problems.
But in fact, they are problems
because they also carry the
necessity of decision making.
If you came into some money,
what are you gonna do with that money?
How are you gonna invest it?
How is that gonna change
your life for the better?
The answer to those questions
may not be that obvious.
And so good decision
making is always useful
no matter what the situation,
positive or negative.
Whenever a philosophy
or in fact even a
religion becomes popular,
inevitably there are people who
are going to use it in a way
that essentially is a
misunderstanding of the original idea
or a significant distortion
of the original idea.
This is happening, not
surprisingly, also with Stoicism.
There's a number of people,
especially certain kinds of young men
who are attracted to what
they think of as Stoicism
because it validates their notion
that a good person, a strong person,
particularly a strong man,
is somebody who is silent,
who controls their emotions,
and so on and so forth.
But that's the stoicism
with the little "s."
It's the stoic attitude,
the stiff upper lip,
the suppression of emotion,
the Spock approach to life,
which is not in fact what real
Stoicism with a capital "S,"
the Stoicism the philosophy, is about.
Of course, like any misconception,
there's a grain of truth.
The stiff upper lip, for
instance, comes from the fact
that endurance is in fact a Stoic value.
The Stoics would say, "Look, if something
is going to happen to you that
you cannot do anything about,
then your only choice is really,
your only rational
choice is to endure it."
What are you gonna do?
You're either gonna endure it
or you're gonna endure it
and then complain about it.
Complaining doesn't really add anything.
It only makes you feel worse.
So just deal with it.
Just endure it.
But that's not the same
as a stiff upper lip
because it's only a minor component
of what Stoic philosophy is about.
The misguiding notion that Stoicism
is about suppressing the emotions
also comes from a distortion
of a real aspect of Stoic philosophy.
The Stoics make a big deal
about the notion of
talking to your emotions,
modulating your emotions through reason.
For instance, dealing with your anger
in a way that it's not anger anymore,
but it becomes something
healthy, something positive.
For instance, it's a sense of justice
that you want to pursue
instead of a destructive sense of anger.
That can also easily be
misconstrued as suppressing emotion.
There is no such thing
as suppressing emotions.
We cannot suppress
emotions because emotions
are part and parcel the
way our brain works.
The only way to suppress your emotions
is to literally cut off
a part of your brain,
and that will turn you into a psychopath
or otherwise somebody who
has serious mental issues.
You don't wanna do that.
However, there is a danger
of what I sometimes refer to
as the broification,
as in bro, of Stoicism,
of this interpretation of Stoicism
that tends to be on the
darker side of things,
tends to emphasize masculinity,
tends to emphasize this view of,
mythical view almost, of the
man who doesn't really react
in any external way to
things and just takes it
and then is stronger because of that.
One of the arguments that these
people make, for instance,
is that Stoicism is a
type of virtue ethics
and that the word virtue comes
from the Latin vir, V-I-R,
which in fact means men.
So there you go, right?
Even the etymology tells you
that it's about being a manly
man and that sort of stuff.
But that argument misses an
important, crucial point,
which is the word vir
itself, virtue in Latin,
is actually a translation of the original.
The original was Greek,
because Stoicism ultimately
is a Greek philosophy,
not a Roman one.
And the original word in
Greek is arete, A-R-E-T-E,
which just means excellence.
It doesn't mean manly anything.
It just means do the best that you can.
And it's gender neutral.
It's not a masculine,
you know, word at all.
So even at that level,
we see sort of a
superficial understanding.
Even at a etymological level
and certainly at a historical level,
we see a superficial misunderstanding,
which turns into what I
think is a counterproductive
and potentially even
dangerous kind of attitude.
Stoicism certainly does not condone
a manly man approach to things.
The ancient Stoics themselves
actually were unusual
among Greco-Roman philosophers
because they explicitly said in writing
that women are rational
human beings, just like men,
and they're just as capable
of understanding and
practicing philosophy.
It's right there in, you
know, black and white.
It's in the writings.
It doesn't need any interpretation.
Both Epictetus and Seneca
explicitly say that
in multiple points.
So to pretend that somehow
this is a manly thing
and that women need to
be treated differently
is just not Stoicism,
demonstrably not the case.
Also, if we're talking about virtue,
well, the Stoics try to
practice multiple virtues.
One of these is justice.
And justice is interpreted by the Stoics
as treating other
people, any other people,
regardless of gender, race, nationality,
ethnicity, religion, or
anything else, any other people,
with dignity, with respect,
in the way in which you yourself
will want to be treated.
So it's clearly nothing to do
with a manly approach to
things, whatever that means.
Perhaps not surprisingly,
many people approach Stoicism
in a way that oversimplifies
the philosophy.
They want immediate results.
They don't care about the
historical background.
They don't care as much
about the complexities
and the nuance of the philosophy.
They just want something to work.
And I understand that sort of need.
At the same time, however,
there's a danger in
oversimplifying things.
You may misconstrue things
and you might act in a way
that it's actually not at all in line
with the philosophy itself.
There are, for instance,
two ways, two common ways,
to misconstrue Stoicism.
One is to do Stoicism by quotations.
So you find all over the internet
snippets of Stoic quotes.
Sometimes they're misattributed.
They're actually not from a Stoic
but let's say from an Epicurean.
One of the most amusing mistakes
that you find on the
internet, for instance,
is that often people
quote the Stoic Epictetus,
but they accompany the quote
with a picture of Epicurus,
who was most definitely not a Stoic.
And Epictetus would've
been seriously disturbed
by being mistaken for Epicurus.
But these issue of quoting
things is problematic
because these quotation makes,
the Stoics are eminently
quotable, that is true.
There is a lot of memorable
phrases, sentences,
that you find in the Stoic text.
But when you abstract them
completely from the background,
they not only begin to make less sense,
they actually might lead
people to think in a way
that it's contrary to Stoic philosophy.
In fact, apparently this
was happening already
2,000 years ago.
Because the Stoic Seneca, who
lived in the first century,
warns one of his friends, Lucilius,
and he says don't fall into the temptation
of just quoting bits and
pieces of our authors
because that will lead you
to misunderstanding the philosophy.
You have to read the whole thing.
You have to read what Zeno was writing
or what Chrysippus was writing,
not just the bits and pieces,
because otherwise you're
not gonna understand
what's going on, and you
are therefore going to act
in a way that it's not in
alignment with the philosophy.
The other way to oversimplify Stoicism
is to approach it as
a series of life hacks
as opposed to a coherent
philosophy of life.
And perhaps one way to understand
what I'm getting at here
is to make an analogy
with another very famous
and useful philosophy of
life, which is Buddhism.
Most people associate
Buddhism with meditation.
And in fact, Buddhism does come
with a series of meditation.
There are different kinds of meditations
that you can do for different purposes
within Buddhist philosophy.
However, it turns out
that empirically speaking,
a lot of Buddhist practitioners
do not actually meditate.
And just because you meditate,
that doesn't make you a Buddhist.
What makes you a Buddhist
is, for instance,
to accept the Four Noble Truths
or to try to follow the
Eightfold Path to enlightenment.
That is the philosophy.
That is what makes you a Buddhist.
Whether you meditate or
not is a different thing.
Meditation is supposed to
be an aid, a technical aid,
for doing the things that the philosophy
says you should be doing.
But people can achieve the same result
without actually meditating.
Now that said, meditation is in fact,
a standalone meditation is in fact useful,
and we have empirical
evidence from modern medicine
and modern psychology that
meditation does certain things.
It allows you, for instance,
to deal better with chronic pain.
It certainly reduces your
anxiety and things like that
under certain conditions.
But those are not the goals
of Buddhism the philosophy.
Buddhism the philosophy is
not about anxiety or pain.
It's about how to live your life.
The same thing goes for Stoicism.
Stoic techniques are in fact very useful
even when they are abstracted
from Stoic philosophy.
And proof of that is that
cognitive behavioral therapy,
the most popular evidence-based
type of psychotherapy
that we use in the 21st century,
did originate from an
inspiration from Stoicism.
And it does use still today
a number of techniques
that are found in Stoic texts.
But cognitive behavioral therapy
is not a philosophy of life.
You can be a very efficient
practitioner of cognitive
behavioral therapy,
you can solve your day-to-day problems,
and still be a psychopath
or behave very badly
toward other people.
That would not make you a Stoic.
What makes you a Stoic is
if you try to live your life
in a reason-based, pro-social fashion,
if you try to remind yourself
that everybody on Earth,
every human being on Earth,
is your brother or sister.
That is what makes you a Stoic.
Whether you actually do
your evening meditation
in the way in which Marcus
Aurelius did or not,
that's a practical aspect of it,
it's a useful aspect of it,
but that isn't what makes you a Stoic.

### 斯多葛主义与快乐：优先次序的智慧

斯多葛主义常被误解为快乐的对立面，甚至被与伊壁鸠鲁主义（Epicureanism）对立起来，后者常被错误地描绘为追求“性、毒品和摇滚乐”的哲学。事实上，伊壁鸠鲁主义是一种**享乐主义哲学**（hedonistic philosophy），将快乐（尤其是减少痛苦）置于核心。而斯多葛主义则是一种**德性伦理哲学**（virtue ethics philosophy），以**品格**（character）为基础，旨在提升自我，成为更好的人。

然而，这并不意味着斯多葛主义排斥快乐。**塞内卡**曾言：“我并非愚蠢。我宁愿快乐而非痛苦，宁愿健康而非生病，甚至可能的话，宁愿富有而非贫穷。”但这些并非斯多葛主义的优先事项。对斯多葛主义者而言，生命的价值不取决于财富、健康，更不取决于感受快乐。最重要的是成为一个**正派的人**（decent human being），一个行为合理且亲社会的人。因此，那些将斯多葛主义与致富或成名挂钩的说法，是对其核心理念的误读。

财富、声誉乃至健康，在斯多葛学派看来，都是**优选的无差别事物**（preferred indifferents）。“无差别事物”（indifferent）在斯多葛语境中，并非指你不在乎的事物，而是指那些**对你的品格没有本质影响**的事物。**爱比克泰德**明确指出，富有与否并不能决定一个人的好坏。富有只是拥有更多金钱，这与一个人的品格完全无关。

另一个误解是斯多葛主义倡导对事物和人保持**超然态度**（detachment），类似于佛教。但斯多葛学派认为，关心事物和他人是人类的本性，这本身没有错。关键在于，这些事物和人不能定义你是谁，不能定义你的品格。**爱比克泰德**用**旅馆住宿**的比喻来解释这一点：你在旅馆房间里，房间、灯、床都是你的，但你不能过度依恋它们，因为你知道你只是过客，终将离开。离开时，你应该让这些物品保持原样，甚至更好。同样，生活中的人与事，我们应该享受它们，但也要随时准备好放手，因为最终我们都将离去。

**爱比克泰德**著名的“冬天的无花果”比喻也传达了类似的信息。当学生为朋友远行而悲伤时，**爱比克泰德**说这就像在冬天渴望无花果——那是不可能的。他教导我们，不仅要接受冬天的现实，更要学会珍惜在夏天享受无花果的时光。我们常常将身边的人和事视为理所当然，直到他们离去才追悔莫及。斯多葛主义提醒我们，要活在当下，珍惜与亲友相处的时光，因为“夏天终将过去，冬天终将到来”。通过这种方式，我们才能避免因错失机会而抱怨，从而获得内心的幸福。

One common assumption is that Stoicism
is the antithesis of pleasure.
In fact, often, if we're talking
about Greco-Roman philosophies,
Stoicism is opposed to Epicureanism.
Most people think of Epicureanism
as the sex, drugs, and rock
and roll of ancient philosophy
even though that description
definitely would've been surprising
to any ancient Epicurean.
It is true that Epicureanism
is a hedonistic philosophy,
that is, it's a philosophy
that puts pleasure
and specifically in fact reduction of pain
at the center of their philosophizing,
at the center of their life.
And it's true that Stoicism is
not a hedonistic philosophy,
it's a virtue ethics philosophy.
It's based on character.
The notion is to improve your character
to become a better human being.
However, the ancient
Stoic Seneca himself says,
I'm not stupid.
I prefer pleasure to pain.
I prefer to be healthy to sick.
I prefer even to be wealthy
to poor if possible.
It's just that those
are not my priorities,
that is, my life doesn't depend,
the worthiness of my life
does not depend on being rich,
it does not depend on being healthy even,
and it certainly doesn't
depend on feeling pleasure.
If I do have all of those things,
sure, I'll welcome them.
But those are not crucial.
The most important part
of life for a Stoic
is to be a decent human being,
a human being that acts
reasonably and pro-socially.
So, for instance, when
I see articles that say
such and such billionaire got
his success by being a Stoic,
I internally laugh or cringe
depending on the situation
because that's not what Stoicism is about.
It's not about becoming rich or famous.
Wealth, reputation, you know, even health
are what the Stoics call
preferred indifferents.
An indifferent isn't,
in the Stoic parlance,
something that you don't care about,
as in the modern English word.
It's something that literally
does not make a difference.
Does not make a difference to what?
To your character, to
who you are as a person.
Again, the Stoics are
very explicit about it.
Epictetus at some point
tells some of his students,
he says he is a non-sequitur.
A non-sequitur is something
that doesn't follow in logic, right?
He is a non-sequitur.
I am rich.
I am richer than you are.
Therefore, I'm a better
person than you are.
He says that doesn't follow.
What follows from the fact
that you're richer than I am
is that you have more
money, you have more wealth.
That's the definition of being richer.
It does not follow that
you're a better person
because being rich or being poor
doesn't make you a good
person or a bad person.
The two things are completely independent.
You know, the misconception about Stoicism
is that it's about cultivating an attitude
of detachment from things and people,
kind of like Buddhism.
Often, Stoicism is presented
as the Western alternative to Buddhism.
But there too, things are
not quite that simple.
For the Stoics, there is nothing wrong
with caring about things
and caring about people.
We're human beings.
That's what we do.
It's just that those things
do not define who you are,
which for a Stoic is the
most important thing.
In other words, they don't
actually define your character,
the way in which you behave.
The Stoic Epictetus puts it very nicely
in an analogy that he
uses with his students.
He says you should try to go through life
as if you were visiting an inn or a hotel.
While you are in the
inn, that's your room.
Nobody's gonna come in just
all of a sudden, barge in.
It's your room.
The lamp on the table is your lamp.
That's your table, that's your
bed, and so on and so forth.
So those things are in a sense yours.
But you don't wanna get attached to them,
too attached to them, because you know
that you are only passing through.
At some point, you will be checking out
and moving on to something else.
And when you do that, you wanna
leave all of those things,
the table, the bed, the lamp,
in as good a shape as you
found them, if not even better,
because somebody else
is gonna use them next.
The same goes with things
and people in life.
It's not that they're not
yours in that limited sense.
Absolutely, enjoy your
friends, your loved ones.
Enjoy the material
possessions that you have.
But the notion of not developing
too much of an attachment
is in that particular sense,
treat everybody and everything
as if you were passing through,
because you are passing through.
Absolutely, take
advantage of what's there,
but then be ready to let go
because at some point
you will have to let go,
and your only two choices
are you're gonna let go
graciously or ungraciously.
Those are your only choices.
Eventually, things are gonna
go because you are going to go.
One of my favorite metaphors by Epictetus
that is related to this concept
is the notion of figs in winter.
At some point, one of his
students is complaining
because a friend of that
student has just left,
he went overseas,
and so he's not gonna see
him possibly for years,
maybe ever, and he is
very sad and all that.
And Epictetus says, well, what
you're doing now is pining
for figs in winter.
You want, in other words,
something that is not possible
because it's not the right season.
And Epictetus says not
only you should accept
that right now it's winter
and therefore you're
not gonna have your fig,
but this should be a lesson to you
to cultivate the notion that
you should be enjoying the figs
during the proper season,
during the summer.
And that's a great lesson
because very often we don't pay attention.
We take people and things for
granted until they're gone.
I mean, this has happened to me as well.
You know, one of the things
that triggered my midlife crisis
that eventually brought me to Stoicism
was the death of my father.
And even though I knew that my father
was suffering from cancer,
in fact he had been suffering
from multiple cancers
over a period of years.
And as a biologist, I
understand what cancer is.
So I had a knowledge
of what was happening.
And yet, I still went on my life
as if my father was going
to be there forever.
And then something happened,
he died, and I was not there.
I was not present.
So I regret that, but
I learned the lesson.
And so I've lost other people since,
and I internalized the
figs in winter lesson,
and I've been making,
and I'm still making,
a concerted effort with
relatives and friends,
to actually be there and
to savor that experience,
to savor those fruits
of life, so to speak,
because I know that the
summer is gonna go eventually
and it's gonna turn into winter.
And that way, I will be happy.
I will not be complaining
about opportunities missed
because I will not have missed them.

### 斯多葛主义的积极行动：反抗暴政与捍卫自由

斯多葛主义绝非一种**消极主义哲学**（quietist philosophy），不主张退缩或不作为。这种误解可能源于其对“忍耐”的强调，但实际上，斯多葛学派鼓励积极行动，甚至反抗不公。**爱比克泰德**在《语录》中提供了许多斯多葛主义者“向权力说真话”（spoke truth to power）的例子。在罗马皇帝尼禄（Nero）、维斯帕先（Vespasian）和图密善（Domitian）统治时期，曾有一个由斯多葛哲学家和罗马元老组成的**斯多葛反对派**（Stoic Opposition），他们反对暴政，捍卫**自由**（liberty）、**独立**（freedom）和**自主**（independence），甚至为此献出生命。

一个著名的例子是**小加图**（Cato the Younger），他曾多年在元老院中反对**尤利乌斯·凯撒**（Julius Caesar）的专制倾向。当凯撒发动内战时，加图也组织军队反抗。最终，凯撒获胜，试图活捉加图以展示其宽宏。但加图为捍卫原则和个人尊严，选择了自杀。斯多葛学派对自杀持非常严肃的态度，认为它应是极端情况下的最后手段。加图平静地安排好一切，阅读**柏拉图**（Plato）关于灵魂的对话，然后用匕首刺向自己。即使在受伤后被医生救治，他仍毅然决然地撕裂伤口，以死明志。这展现了极大的勇气、决心和对美德的崇高追求。

这个故事表明，斯多葛主义者并非被动接受一切，而是会积极斗争，捍卫正义和自由。对于现代斯多葛主义者而言，这并非意味着拿起武器，而是要**敢于发声**（speaking out），捍卫自身和他人的自由与自主权。当这些价值观受到威胁时，作为斯多葛主义者，我们有责任站出来，并准备好面对可能不愉快的后果。

斯多葛主义最吸引人的特点之一是其**开放性**（openness to new ideas）和**内部调整能力**。**塞内卡**曾写道，前人并非我们的主人，而是我们的老师。他们发现了许多有用的东西，但并非全部真理。如果我们发现更好的做事方式，理性的选择就是相应地调整我们的哲学。

斯多葛主义已有2000多年的历史，自公元前四世纪在雅典兴起。在此期间，科学和哲学取得了巨大进步，这意味着现代斯多葛主义者不能全盘接受古人的所有观点。例如，古代斯多葛学派的**神意**（providence）概念，即他们相信宇宙是一个有理性的活生生的神（**泛神论**Pantheism），一切发生之事都是神性宇宙的思考和行动结果。这种观点在当时可能很美，但作为现代生物学家和物理学知识的了解者，作者无法相信宇宙是一个有生命的有机体。

这种形而上学的差异具有实际后果。**爱比克泰德**曾建议，睡前亲吻妻子和孩子，因为他们是凡人，明天可能不在。他认为这样可以避免痛苦。但作者认为，这听起来像精神病患者的言论。虽然接受亲人终有一死是理性的，但在情感上感到悲伤是正常的，也是可以接受的。**爱比克泰德**的“脚踩泥泞”的比喻解释了他的观点：脚作为身体的一部分，其目的是帮助身体回家，即使这意味着踩入泥泞。从脚的角度看，这令人厌恶；但从身体整体目的看，这是必须且应欣然接受的。他认为，我们是神性宇宙的碎片，发生在我们身上的一切，即使不愉快，也是为了神性宇宙的福祉。

然而，现代科学挑战了这种**设计论证**（argument from design）。18世纪的哲学家**大卫·休谟**（David Hume）从哲学逻辑上批判了设计论证的不连贯性；一个世纪后，生物学家**查尔斯·达尔文**（Charles Darwin）提出了**自然选择进化论**（evolution by natural selection），解释了事物看似被设计的原因。鉴于这些知识，现代斯多葛主义者必须拒绝设计论证和泛神论，并相应地修正其伦理和神意观念。这种对新思想的开放性和适应性，正是斯多葛主义与其他更僵化的哲学或宗教体系不同，并使其在21世纪仍具生命力的原因。

One baffling misconception
for me about Stoicism
is that it turns people into doormats.
It's a quietist philosophy.
It's about not reacting.
It's about not doing things,
just trying to retreat into yourself
and sort of isolate yourself
from the rest of the world.
I'm not sure exactly
where that particular
misconception come from,
if not, again, as a
byproduct of the notion
that Stoicism values endurance.
But it's clearly contradicted
by both the letter of the philosophy,
by what you read from
the Stoics themselves,
and more importantly perhaps
by the actions that we know
those philosophers actually took
in their life.
In "The Discourses," Epictetus
gives us several examples
of Stoics who, as we would put it today,
spoke truth to power.
In fact, there was a whole
group of Stoic philosophers
and Roman senators during the reigns
of the Emperors Nero,
Vespasian, and Domitian
who were known as the Stoic Opposition.
These were people who were
actually going to object
to the dictates of Nero,
Domitian, and Vespasian
because they saw them as tyrants.
And liberty, freedom, independence,
those are actual Stoic values.
And a Stoic could not abide by a tyrant.
So these people risked their lives.
In fact, some of them lost their lives
as a result of a direct
opposition to tyranny.
There are other examples as well.
Seneca talks a lot about a
guy named Cato the Younger,
who was a contemporary of Julius Caesar.
Cato opposed Caesar on
the floor of the senate.
They were both senators
at one point in their political career.
And Cato saw Caesar as
increasingly developing
sort of tyrannical aspects
to his way of doing things,
and so he opposed him on the
senate floor for many years.
Then at some point, famously,
Julius Caesar picked up arms
and moved to war against
the Roman republic.
He crossed the Rubicon
River, famously saying,
you know, "The die is cast."
In other words, I am now
cognizant of the fact
that this is irreversible action.
Well, what did Cato do?
He thought, okay, the
time of debate is over.
I need to pick up arms as well.
And so he organized an army
and he led an army against Julius Caesar.
So both Julius Caesar and
Cato the Younger pick up arms.
There is a civil war.
It's a horrible thing and
there's nothing civil about it.
Lots of people died on both sides.
Eventually, Julius Caesar prevails.
He was an excellent general.
And he defeats the republican army.
So now Caesar is after Cato.
He wants to capture Cato alive
because he wants to use
him as a political piece.
He wants to essentially
show his magnanimity
by saying, "Here is my enemy.
He actually picked up arms against me,
but I'm okay with that.
I'm gonna forgive him."
But Cato was a man of principle
and he was not about to let Caesar
take advantage of the situation that way.
So Cato decides that the
only way to avoid that
is to take his own
life, to commit suicide.
The Stoics have a whole
literature about suicide.
They take the issue very, very seriously.
They say that it ought
to be the last resort
only under extreme circumstances.
But Cato finds himself in the last resort
under extreme circumstances.
So he very calmly prepares himself.
He sends away his friends
and his loved ones,
picks up a book.
We know actually which book he read.
He read one of Plato's dialogues
about the nature of the soul.
He has his dagger nearby.
He picks up the dagger
and he stabs himself,
as the Roman did, in his stomach.
However, he had been injured in battle,
particularly in his hand,
and his hand was not strong enough.
So he falls down, makes noise therefore,
and so everybody rushes
in from the other room.
And a doctor sees what's happening.
He realizes that no vital
organ has been punctured
even though there is a mess
around, the blood all over.
And so the doctor tries
to stitch the wound,
to put back things, and then
try to save Cato's life.
Cato in the meantime comes back.
He had lost consciousness.
He sees what the doctor is trying to do,
pushes the doctor away,
reaches with his hand inside his own guts,
tears them away, and throws
them on the floor, thus dying.
It takes a lot of
courage and determination
to do that sort of thing.
I mean, I think that even the first part,
taking your dagger in your
hand and stabbing yourself,
that takes courage and determination.
But going as far in the
second bit as Cato did
means that this was a man who
had a high sense of honor,
a high sense of his own virtue,
and a high sense of the
meaning of his existence.
Caesar realized what had happened
and he was really upset about it.
He admitted that Cato
had bested him at this.
And in fact, Cato became a
hero of the republican cause
for many, many years afterwards.
So here we have an example of a Stoic
who actually was fighting
and eventually died
as a result of understanding
what the right thing to do was
and wanted to do the right
thing, not endorsing injustice,
not retreating into a passive,
you know, inactive situation.
So that should be
inspiration to modern Stoics,
not necessarily in the sense
that we're gonna have to
pick up weapons, hopefully,
against anybody, but certainly
it is about speaking out.
Certainly it is about
defending one's own liberty
and other people's liberty.
It's about personal autonomy
and the autonomy of other people.
And whenever you see, as a Stoic,
as a Stoic practitioner,
you see those things threatened,
you really ought to speak out.
It's your duty as a Stoic
practitioner to do so.
And then face the consequences,
which may not be pleasant of course.
One of the features of Stoicism
that I find most attractive
is that built into the system,
there is an openness to new ideas
and to adjust the philosophy internally
so that it adapts to whatever it is
that we may discover moving forward.
In fact, one of the
ancient Stoics, Seneca,
writes at one point that,
look, the people that came
before us are not our masters,
they're just our teachers.
They knew a lot of things,
and some of those things were very useful
and that's why we adopt them.
But that doesn't mean that
they discovered everything.
That doesn't mean that
there are no new things
to be discovered.
And if we do find new ways and
better ways of doing things,
Seneca says the only rational thing to do
is to adjust our philosophy accordingly
and move in a different direction.
Stoicism of course is a philosophy
that is over 2,000 years old.
It started out in the
fourth century BC in Athens.
You might expect that some things
that we've learned in the meantime
might be problematic in that respect,
that is, the Stoics didn't know everything
that science and even
philosophy have achieved
over the intervening almost
two and a half millennia.
That means that if you're a practitioner
of Stoicism today in the 21st century,
you cannot simply take everything
that the ancient Stoics
said and go with it,
pretty much in the same
way in which nobody today
is a practitioner of say
Buddhism or Christianity
in exactly the same way
in which people were practicing
Buddhism or Christianity
two millennia or two and
a half millennia ago.
For instance, the historic
concept of providence
is both interesting and
beautiful on the one hand
and yet I think deeply flawed
and needs to be rejected on the other.
And this is going to have
practical consequences.
Let me back up for a second
and explain what this is about.
The ancient Stoics were Pantheists,
that is, they believed that God
is the same thing as the universe.
It's coincident with the universe.
And therefore they thought
of the universe itself
as a living organism
endowed with reason, right?
The universe is God.
Nature is God.
God is thinking.
And therefore, everything
that happens in the universe
is the result of the thinking
and doing of God the cosmos
or God the universe.
Now, I find this a very beautiful idea,
if only I could believe it.
As a modern biologist
and as somebody who does a little bit,
knows a little bit about physics,
I don't think of the cosmos
as a living organism.
I cannot imagine that sort of connection.
Now you might say, "Well, so what?
This is just a metaphysical
dispute, right?
The ancient Stoics thought about God
and the universe that way.
You don't think of it that way.
What difference does
that make in practice?"
It turns out it does make
a big practical difference.
There are a few passages in
the discourses of Epictetus,
as well as in his manual,
where he says something really surprising,
really interesting, and at
the same time disturbing.
He says, remember, when you go to sleep,
kiss goodnight to your wife and your child
because they're mortal
and they might not be
alive tomorrow morning.
That way, you will not be disturbed.
Now, the first time I read
that passage, I thought,
what kind of a psychopath is this guy?
He's telling me that I should realize
that my loved ones are mortal.
I'm okay with that.
Yes, we are, we're all mortal.
And therefore that means that someday,
I or them will die.
But to say that I should
remind myself of this
so that I'm not gonna be
disturbed, are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna be disturbed
if my daughter or my wife were to die.
But then I understood
where he was coming from.
In fact, Epictetus himself
clearly makes an analogy,
an interesting analogy, that
shows where he's coming from.
He says, look, you are like a foot
that is part of an organism.
Let's say that the organism,
the body, has to get home,
and in order to get home, it
has to cross a muddy path.
It is up to you as the
foot to step into the mud.
Now, if you think of that
only from the point of view of a foot,
without remembering that
you're connected to a body,
that's disgusting.
Why would I wanna step into the mud?
This is not a pleasant thing.
But if you remembered that
you are connected to a body
and that in fact your
entire purpose in life
is to bring that body
wherever it needs to go,
including stepping into the mud,
then not only you're going to do it,
but you're gonna do it politely.
You're gonna embrace,
not just accept your fate, so to speak,
but embrace your fate.
So what Epictetus is saying there
is not as being psychopathic,
as far as we can tell.
He's just being realistic
in the way he understood the world.
He said, look, we're all
literally bits and pieces
of the god universe.
And whatever happens to us,
including the unpleasant bits,
is actually for the good
of the god universe.
So if you understand things that way,
not only you're gonna accept what happens,
you're actually gonna embrace it.
Now it makes sense when he says,
you know, if your loved ones
die, you should not be upset,
you should not be disturbed,
because you realize that,
well, whatever is happening,
even though you may only get
a small portion of that picture,
but whatever is happening is part
of this universal cosmic plan,
and you should feel good
about it, not distraught.
It's a beautiful way of looking at life.
Unfortunately, I don't
think it's the right way
to look at life.
I wish I could bring
myself to being a pantheist
in the way in which the
ancient Stoics were.
That would definitely provide
me with a lot of comfort
whenever something bad happens
to me or to my loved ones.
But I don't believe in the cosmic god,
and therefore I think that
whatever happens to us
is the result of neutral forces.
The universe doesn't care
one way or the other.
That means that I cannot avail myself
of the Stoic concept of providence.
So what do I replace it with?
Well, acceptance is
still part of it, right?
I have to accept the reality of things.
I'm a biologist.
I understand that people die.
In fact, I understand that death
is a natural part of the
process of being alive
or the process of life on Earth.
If other people had not died,
I would not be here because
I would not have been born.
And so my death, the death of
other people, it's natural.
And as such, it's reasonable to accept it
as much as one can at a rational level.
But at an emotional level,
I'm still not gonna be happy about it,
and I think that's okay,
not to be happy about it.
So that's one example of
something that the ancient Stoics
thought at a metaphysical
level and had consequences
in terms of their day-to-day
life, their ethics,
and modern Stoics have to modify, I think,
because in the meantime,
both philosophy and science
have progressed to a point
that makes the original idea untenable.
In fact, if you're still not convinced,
let me give you one more bit of evidence
that things work pretty much
in the way I just described it.
If one asks, "Well, what
was Epictetus's argument
for thinking that the
universe is a living god?"
He does actually provide
us with an argument.
In fact, several of the Stoics do.
Seneca does as well and some
of the other earlier Stoics.
People like Zeno, who was the
founder of the Stoic approach
in the first place, does the same thing.
They all use an argument from design.
They say, just like the sword
perfectly fits the scabbard,
and that tells you that somebody designed
both of those objects
to actually fit together
in a functional way, in a way that works,
if you look around, you'll
see that the universe
is built in the same way.
And frankly, if I lived 2,000 years ago,
I would probably buy into that argument.
It's a really cogent argument.
You look around the complexity
of the world and you say,
"Yeah, that makes sense."
But I don't live 2,000 years ago,
I live in the 21st century,
which means that I live
after two major objections
were raised to that way
of looking at things,
to the design argument specifically.
The philosopher David
Hume in the 18th century
criticized the design argument
on philosophical-logical basis
and showed that it's not really coherent.
And then about a century later,
Charles Darwin, a biologist,
actually proposed an
alternative mechanism,
we call it evolution by natural selection,
for why things seem to be
designed in a certain way.
Given that knowledge,
I have to reject the argument from design,
as pretty much every biologist does.
And if I reject that,
then I also reject the
Stoic view of pantheism.
And if I reject that,
I have to revise my notions
of ethics and providence.
So this is a good example, I think,
of how all of these things work together.
Scientific advancements will question
our philosophical views,
and it's a good thing if
the philosophical views
are able to adapt to what
comes out of the new science.
Of course, science in another
century, or five centuries,
or 10 centuries may tell
us something different.
And if there are Stoics 10
centuries down the road,
they will themselves face the same problem
and have to adapt somehow.
I find that very refreshing
because unlike other philosophical
or religious systems,
which tend to be much more
rigid, resistant to change,
this notion that change is inherent
in the way in which we do Stoic
philosophy is very useful,
very reasonable, and very refreshing.
