### 什么是斯多葛主义？

今天你将了解到斯多葛学派所谓的“好人”意味着什么。我们将学习如何更理性地生活，如何基于理性来引导生活，并以最佳方式处理我们的情绪。我是 **Massimo Pigliucci**，一名进化生物学家和科学哲学家。我的最新著作名为 **《Beyond Stoicism》**，是与 Greg Lopez 和 Meredith Kunz 合著的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Today you're going to learn a little bit about what the Stoics mean by being a good human being. We'll learn to live more rationally, to conduct a life based on reason, and to deal with our emotions in the best way we can. I am Massimo Pigliucci. I am an evolutionary biologist and a philosopher of science. And my latest book is called "Beyond Stoicism," co-authored with Greg Lopez and Meredith Kunz.

</details>

**斯多葛主义**（Stoicism: 古希腊罗马时期的哲学流派，强调理性、自控和顺应自然）是一种生活哲学，它建议过好人类生活的最佳方式是问自己：人类究竟是哪种生物？斯多葛学派对这个问题的回答是：从根本上说，我们是高度社会化且具备理性能力的生物。我们就是如此智能。据此，他们认为美好的人类生活就是利用理性来解决问题，并以合作、亲社会的方式行事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Stoicism is a philosophy of life that suggests that the best way to live a human life is to ask yourself what kind of a living organism human beings are. And the answer that the Stoics give to that question is that fundamentally we are highly social and capable of reason. We're that intelligent. It follows, according to them, that a good human life is one way you use reason in order to solve problems and you behave in a cooperative, pro-social fashion.

</details>

斯多葛学派的一个关键洞见是，正如古代斯多葛哲学家 **爱比克泰德**（Epictetus）所言，我们应该关注那些“取决于我们”的事情，并试着以平静的心态接受那些“不取决于我们”的事情。换句话说，要把注意力集中在你的能动性活跃的地方，在你做事有效力的地方，然后接受随之而来的一切，因为你实际上别无选择。斯多葛学派对生活是非常现实的。他们试图理解人类生活是如何运作的，并试图过上尽可能最好的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the crucial insights of the Stoics is that we should focus on what is up to us, as the ancient Stoic Epictetus put it, and try to accept with equanimity what is not up to us. In other words, focus where your agency is active, where you are efficacious in doing things, and then accept whatever comes as it comes because you really don't have a choice. The Stoics are nothing if not realists about life. They try to understand how human life works and they try to live the best life possible.

</details>

### 角色伦理与能量管理

我们从生物学和心理学中了解到的一件事是，我们做事的时间和精力是有限的，无论是体力还是情感能量。因此，如果我们坚持追求那些不太可能奏效或者没有效力的方法——即我们的能动性实际上没有任何影响——那么我们只会让自己的生活变得悲惨。事实上，我们是在牺牲那些我们本该做的事情。爱比克泰德在二世纪阐述的斯多葛主义这一特定流派中，有一个有趣的方面就是**角色伦理**（Role Ethics）的概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the things that we do understand from biology, psychology, is that we have limited time and energy to do things, both physical energy and emotional energy. And so if we insist on pursuing approaches that are likely not to work or they're not efficacious, you know, our agency doesn't really have any effect on it, then we are only making our life miserable. And in fact, we're trading off with other things that we should be doing. One of the interesting aspects of the particular brand of Stoicism, so to speak, that Epictetus articulated in the second century is this notion of role ethics.

</details>

我们在生活中都扮演着不同的角色，事实上是许多角色。如果我们稍微反思一下，例如，我的角色包括作为某人的儿子、某人的父亲、某人的丈夫、朋友、老师、同事，以及特定国家和城市的公民等等。所有这些角色本质上都需要同时处理。我不能决定某一天我只做一个同事而别的什么都不做。也许在这一刻，当我在工作并与他人互动时，我是一个同事，但同时我也是丈夫、父亲、朋友等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

We all play different roles in life, many roles, in fact. And if we reflect on it for a minute, for instance, some of my roles include being somebody's son, being somebody's father, being somebody's husband, being a friend, being a teacher, being a colleague, being a citizen of a particular nation and of a particular city, and so on and so forth. All of these roles need to be handled essentially simultaneously. It's not like I can decide one day I'm gonna be just a colleague and nothing else. I am a colleague perhaps in this particular moment when I'm at work and I'm interacting with other people, but I'm at the same time also a husband, a father, a friend, et cetera, et cetera.

</details>

这里的核心思想是，我需要保存体力和情感、心理能量，以便在我需要为此做些什么的时候，能在所有这些角色中做到最好。如果我在某件特定的事情上浪费了大量的精力和时间，尤其是那些我的努力实际上无效的事情，那么我实际上是在牺牲其他所有事情。比方说，如果我只是不断阅读那些不可操作的、我无能为力的新闻而感到沮丧，结果就是我对我的家人没用，对我的朋友没用，实际上对整个社会甚至对我自己都没用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And the idea here is that I need to conserve both physical, and emotional, mental energy so that I can do my best in all of these roles whenever it is that I need to do something about it. If I'm going to waste a lot of energy and time on a particular thing, especially something that for which my efforts are in fact not efficacious, then I'm really trading off with everything else. I am getting depressed, let's say, by just constantly reading the news about things that are not actionable, about things that I cannot do anything about. Well, the result of that is then I'm not useful to my family, I'm not useful to my friends. I'm not in fact useful to society in general and even to myself.

</details>

### 斯多葛的三大纪律

这回到了爱比克泰德的第一门纪律：**欲望的纪律**（Discipline of Desire），即设定目标。根据我们的价值观，我们设定目标和优先级。这样做至关重要，否则我们最终会浪费大量时间并为此后悔。通常，当你到了后悔的地步，尤其是接近生命尽头时，就有点太晚了。**塞内卡**（Seneca）在他写给朋友 Lucilius 的一封信中指出，太多人直到生命尽头才开始反思他们想做什么以及为什么，那时已经太晚了，因为他们已经完成了原本打算做的大部分事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So it's about conserving energy, setting priorities. This goes back to the the first discipline of Epictetus, the discipline of desire, setting goals. Depending on our values, we set goals and we set priorities. And doing so is crucial because otherwise we end up wasting a lot of time and then regretting it. And usually, when you get to the point of regret, especially near the end of your life, it's a little too late. Seneca points out in one of his letters to his friend Lucilius that too many people start reflecting on what they want to do and why near the end of their lives, when it's too late, when they're already done most of what they were going to do.

</details>

斯多葛主义的目标是过一种 **Eudaemonic**（幸福/繁荣）的生活。Eudaemonia 是一个希腊词，大致意思是值得过的生活，一种当你走到尽头时会说：“是的，那不是浪费时间”的生活。根据斯多葛学派，过这种生活意味着明智地、聪明地和社交地生活。因为斯多葛主义的一个基本方面是我们应该过一种亲社会的生活，即与他人互动的生活，因为我们天生就是社会性生物。事实上，他们甚至宣称自己是世界主义者（Cosmopolitan），意味着是人类宇宙城邦的成员。根据斯多葛学派，地球上的每个人都是我们的兄弟姐妹，我们应该据此对待他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Stoicism is one of the Greco-Roman philosophies that evolved during the Hellenistic period, and the goal is to live a eudaemonic life. Eudaemonia is a word that in Greek means, roughly speaking, a life worth living, a kind of life that you get to the end of it and you say, "Yeah, that was not wasted time." ... According to the Stoics, living a eudaemonic life means living intelligently, smartly, and socially. Because one of the fundamental aspects of Stoicism is that we should live a pro-social life, that is, a life where we interact with other people, because we are naturally a social organism... In fact, they went so far as declaring themselves cosmopolitan. Being a cosmopolitan means being a member of the human cosmopolite, the human city, the universal human city. According to the Stoics, every human being on Earth is our brother and sister, and we should treat them accordingly.

</details>

爱比克泰德提出了学习和实践斯多葛主义的三大基本纪律：欲望的纪律、**行动的纪律**（Discipline of Action）和 **认同的纪律**（Discipline of Assent）。欲望的纪律教导我们批判性地重新评估我们的价值观，根据好的价值观重新定位自己。行动的纪律与对他人采取行动有关，即在社会中与他人互动时实践我们的价值观。最后，认同的纪律意味着理性地思考前两门纪律，关于价值观以及如何实施它们。它是关于让这一切顺畅流动，从而拥有顺畅的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The ancient Stoic Epictetus... laid out three fundamental disciplines for the study and practice of Stoicism. They're referred to normally as the discipline of desire, the discipline of action, and the discipline of assent... The discipline of desire teaches us to reevaluate critically our values, to reorient ourselves according to good values, to make deliberate decisions about what those values are and why. The second discipline, the discipline of action, has to do, as the name implies, with acting toward other people... So the discipline of action is about putting into practice our values when we interact in society at large with other human beings. Finally, the discipline of assent... means thinking carefully and rationally about the other two disciplines, about values and how to implement them. So the discipline of assent in a sense is about making all of this flow so nicely and so smoothly that we have in fact, according to the Stoics, a smoothly flowing life.

</details>

### 物理学、伦理学与逻辑学

为了理解斯多葛理论，我们需要参考斯多葛课程中典型的三个研究领域：物理学、伦理学和逻辑学。但它们的含义与现代英语略有不同。**物理学**（Physics）来自 *physis*，意为自然。所以不要只想到量子力学，要想到广义的科学，即对世界如何运作的良好理解。这与欲望的纪律有关，因为我们的目标取决于我们是什么样的生物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And in order to understand Stoic theory, we need to refer to the three areas of study that were typical in any Stoic curriculum... They are physics, ethics, and logic. But what they mean exactly is something a little bit different from modern English... Physics, for instance, comes from physis, which means nature. So when I say physics, don't think quantum mechanics... think science in general, so a good understanding of how the world works. That's connected to the discipline of desire... Because our goals and priorities in life depend on what kind of living organism we are.

</details>

**伦理学**（Ethics）不仅仅是关于对错的研究，它字面上意味着研究如何过你的生活。这包括你的动机、优先级以及你与他人的关系。它与行动的纪律相连。**逻辑学**（Logic）不仅仅是逻辑谜题，它是对良好思维的研究，包括我们今天所说的认知科学——理解认知偏差以及人们的思维为何会出错。它与认同的纪律相连，即使用良好的判断力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

These days, ethics means mostly the study of right and wrong actions. But for the Stoics or for the ancient Greco-Romans in general, ethics had, again, a much broader meaning. It meant literally the study of how to live your life... The second discipline of action is connected with ethics... When I say logic, most people start thinking about logical puzzles... But logic according to the Stoics is in general the study of good thinking. So it includes also what we would today call cognitive science... Assent is about refining our understanding and practice of the first two disciplines. In other words, it's about using good judgment, and therefore it's about logic.

</details>

### 斯多葛主义有效吗？

斯多葛主义是否有效？这是一个合理的问题。我们有一系列证据表明斯多葛技术确实有效。首先，斯多葛主义在 20 世纪 60 年代催生了现在的 **认知行为疗法**（CBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy）。像 **Aaron Beck** 和 **Albert Ellis** 这样的作者开始实践这种心理疗法，他们都读过 **马可·奥勒留**（Marcus Aurelius）、爱比克泰德等人的著作，并认为这些非常实用。CBT 是基于实证的，既然它有效，且其许多技术源自斯多葛学派，这表明斯多葛技术也是有效的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the obvious questions that come up with Stoicism is does it work?... We have a series of lines of evidence that Stoic techniques, the Stoic approach to a good life, does in fact work. The first one is that Stoicism originated what is now known as cognitive behavioral therapy back in the 1960s. In New York, authors like Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis started to practice this type of psychotherapy... And they started from Stoicism. They both read Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and other Stoics... CBT is empirically based... So it's not the same as asking whether Stoicism work, but it's pretty close to asking whether Stoic techniques work because a lot of the techniques that the ancient Stoics designed and developed... it turns out, are actually efficacious.

</details>

### 斯多葛工具箱：处理情绪

斯多葛学派认为情绪实际上与理性并没有截然分开。现代认知科学证实了这一点：产生情绪的杏仁核与负责推理的额顶叶之间有着大量的神经连接。斯多葛学派说，这就是你改善与情绪关系的关键。你需要进行一个从认知开始的过程。如果你反复进行这种认知和行为的结合，最终会影响你的情绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The fundamental idea is that emotions are not in fact distinct or sharply distinct from reason... And this is one insight, one intuition of the ancient Stoics, that is definitely confirmed by modern cognitive science... We do know that the anatomical area from where human emotions... originate is the amygdala... And we do know that our reasoning faculty resides mostly in the frontal parietal lobes... But we also know that those two areas are massively interconnected... Well, if that's true, the Stoics say there is your key to a better relationship with your emotions. What you need to do is a two or three-step process that begins with cognition... And it's this combination of cognition and behavior repeated over and over and over that eventually affects your emotions...

</details>

举个例子，如果有人侮辱你。爱比克泰德谈了很多关于侮辱的事。通常我们会生气，肾上腺素飙升。但斯多葛学派会说，在此之前，这样想：侮辱到底是什么？它只是某人张嘴说出一些词，只是空气在移动。它实际上并没有触碰到我。如果那个人说的是对的，那我为什么要生气？我应该接受建议。如果那个人说错了，那是他的问题，不是我的。无论哪种方式，我都有能力不做出反应，因为我有能力重新构建这个情境。一旦你这样做了，你的情绪反应就会降级。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Let's say that somebody insults you... The Stoics would say, well, before all of that, think about it this way. What exactly is an insult? An insult is somebody opening their mouth, saying certain words... In other words, it's your thinking, it's your cognition that is the first step... But if instead of going that way, you say to yourself an insult is nothing, it's just air moving around. It doesn't actually touch me... If that person is saying something about me that is insulting, what does that mean? Well, either that person is right... in which case, why am I going to be upset about it?... Or the person in question is wrong, in which case, that's his problem, not mine... So either way, it is in my power not to react because it is in my power to reframe the situation to myself... Once you do that, you're now deescalating your emotional response...

</details>

### 哲学日记

斯多葛学派有一种重要的技术来帮助我们应对困难情况，通常被称为 **哲学日记**（Philosophical Journaling）。马可·奥勒留的 **《沉思录》** 就是最好的例子。这不是记录日常琐事的日记，而是反思的日记。马可·奥勒留用第二人称写作，对自己说：“你做了这个，你为什么这样反应？”这种与情绪反应保持距离的做法有助于分析性学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So the Stoics have a very important technique to help us prepare ourselves to difficult situations... Often it's referred to as philosophical journaling... And perhaps the best model of that journal available to Stoic practitioners is the "Meditations" of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius... In fact, if you notice, Marcus Aurelius writes his journal in the second person. He says, "You did this and you reacted this way." ... there is very good evidence from modern studies that it does help keeping the distance from your emotional responses, which is in fact helpful in trying to learn analytically from what you did and what you perhaps didn't do.

</details>

你可以挑选一天中发生的一件事，简要描述它，然后问自己三个问题：**我做错了什么？我做对了什么？下次我可以做什么不同的事？** 问“做错了什么”不是为了自责，而是为了学习。问“做对了什么”是为了设定目标。问“下次可以做什么”是最关键的，因为我们往往每天都在重复同样的事情。通过这种自我分析，下次同样的情况发生时，你就准备好了。正如塞内卡所说，有准备的头脑能更好地处理困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So you pick a particular instance... and then you ask yourself three questions. What did I do wrong? What did I do right? And what could I do next time? Why ask yourself those questions? The first one, what did I do wrong? The point is not to indulge in sort of regret... However, you can learn from it. The second question is, well, what did I do right?... you also want to set goals that you're gonna achieve over and over... The third question is arguably the most crucial one, what could I have done differently?... So you can expect reasonably then, in a few days, or next week, or next month, something close to that will happen again. But now you're ready... And Seneca says a prepared mind handles difficulties, handles delicate situations much better.

</details>

### 控制的二分法

你可能听说过“宁静祷文”（Serenity Prayer），这实际上是爱比克泰德一个基本洞见的重述：有些事情取决于我们，有些事情不取决于我们。我们应该关注那些取决于我们的事情，因为那是我们的能动性有效的地方；而对那些不取决于我们的事情，应培养一种接受和平静的态度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You may have heard of something called the Serenity Prayer... That notion... was written at the beginning of the 20th century by an American theologian, but in fact it's a rephrasing of a fundamental insight by the Stoic Epictetus... Epictetus talks about some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us, and we should focus on the things that are up to us and act on them because that is where our agency is efficacious, and we should develop an attitude of acceptance and equanimity toward the things that are not up to us.

</details>

以工作面试为例。爱比克泰德会建议你列两个清单。**不取决于我的**：真正得到这份工作（取决于竞争对手、面试官的心情等）。**取决于我的**：尽可能充分地准备，试图睡个好觉（注意是“试图”，因为邻居可能会开派对），试图准时到达（地铁可能会坏）。一旦你有了这两个清单，你就只关注左边那些取决于你的事情。结果是你做事更有效率，同时也保持了平静，因为你不会为那些无法控制的事情而烦恼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Let's pick an example... Let's say that tomorrow morning I'm going to have a job interview... And you can do this literally by making two lists... For instance, actually getting the job, not up to me... What is up to me? Well, clearly to prepare myself as much as possible... What else is up to me? Well, try to get a good night's sleep... But notice that I said to try to get a good night's sleep, not to actually get a good night's sleep... So the intention is mine, but the outcome is not under my control... And the idea is that once you have these lists... you focus only on the one to the left side, the things that are up to me... The result is that you're much more efficacious in the things you do... But it's also true that you accept things in a way that maintains calm, tranquility, serenity.

</details>

### 决策与意图

斯多葛学派认为我们最重要的能力是 **Prohairesis**（希腊语：意志/道德选择能力），即做出判断并采取行动的能力。爱比克泰德说，我们不断受到“印象”的轰炸。印象是感官体验和本能判断的结合。例如，看到冰淇淋觉得应该吃它。爱比克泰德说，这时你要停下来思考：这真的是好事吗？也许不是，因为我要去吃晚饭，或者为了健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

In fact, Epictetus thought that our most important faculty was something that he called prohairesis, which is Greek for will, the decision, the ability to actually arrive at a judgment and an assessment of a situation and then try to act on it... According to the Stoics, we are constantly bombarded by impressions... An impression is essentially a combination of a sensorial experience and an immediate, usually instinctive judgment. For instance, I might walk down the street and I have the impression that it's good to go buy and eat that gelato... Epictetus says that's the time when you wanna stop and think. Ask yourself... "Well, wait a minute, is this really a good thing?..."

</details>

斯多葛学派认为，取决于你的是你的意图，而不是结果。例如，我在施粥处做志愿者。这是好事吗？斯多葛主义者会问：你的动机是美德吗？如果我是为了帮助别人，那就是美德。如果我是为了简历好看，那就不是美德，因为我把别人当作手段。将视角从结果（这是好事还是坏事？）转移到意图和性格（这对我的性格有益吗？），通常会简化决策过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The Stoics think that what is up to you is your intentions, not the outcomes of those intentions. So what you need to do is to work on why are you trying to do certain things more than on, will I succeed in doing these things?... For instance, let's say that I go and volunteer in my soup kitchen... But a Stoic would actually frame the question differently. The question would be not necessarily, is the action itself good or not, but are your motivations virtues or not? Why am I doing this?... If it turns out that I decided to do that because I need a new line on my resume... Well, that's not virtuous, because now I'm using other people as a means to an end... So to shift perspective from the outcome... to my intentions and therefore my character... very often will simplify our decision making...

</details>

### 顺应自然与同心圆

斯多葛学派说我们应该“顺应自然生活”。这并不意味着裸奔拥抱大树，而是要审视人类是什么样的生物。我们是社会性动物，我们在社会中繁荣。二世纪的斯多葛哲学家 **Hierocles**（希耶罗克里斯）提出了一个同心圆的概念。你应该试着将所有的人拉近自己。把朋友当作家里人，把熟人当作朋友，把陌生人当作熟人。他甚至建议在称呼陌生人时使用“兄弟”、“姐妹”等称呼，以此提醒自己我们都在同一条船上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

...one way in which the Stoics answered that question... is that they say we should live according to nature. Now, to live according to nature doesn't mean running naked into the forest and hugging trees... It means to look at the kind of living being, of organism, that a human is... Now, one of those early Stoics, a guy named Hierocles, in the second century... says what we should try to do is to metaphorically bring people, all the people, closer and closer to us... You should think of your friends as if they were your family. You should think of your acquaintances as if they were your friends... And Hierocles actually goes so far as giving practical advice of how to do that... Hierocles says just go around, and when you meet strangers, address them as brother and sister... In other words, remind yourself and others that we are in fact all on the same boat together...

</details>

### 消除误解

关于斯多葛主义有很多误解。最常见的一个是“兄弟会式的斯多葛主义”（Bro-icism），即认为斯多葛主义就是压抑情绪、做个硬汉。这完全是对斯多葛哲学的曲解。斯多葛学派并不主张压抑情绪，而是主张通过理性调节情绪。压抑情绪在生理上是不可能的，除非切除部分大脑。此外，古代斯多葛学派明确指出女性和男性一样具有理性，一样有能力实践哲学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There is a danger of what I sometimes refer to as the broification, as in bro, of Stoicism, of this interpretation of Stoicism that tends to be on the darker side of things, tends to emphasize masculinity... The Stoics make a big deal about the notion of talking to your emotions, modulating your emotions through reason... That can also easily be misconstrued as suppressing emotion. There is no such thing as suppressing emotions... The ancient Stoics themselves actually were unusual among Greco-Roman philosophers because they explicitly said in writing that women are rational human beings, just like men, and they're just as capable of understanding and practicing philosophy.

</details>

另一个误解是斯多葛主义让人变成受气包（Doormat）。这被历史事实所反驳。许多斯多葛主义者是反抗暴政的斗士，如“斯多葛反对派”反抗尼禄皇帝，以及 **小加图**（Cato the Younger）反抗凯撒。小加图最终为了不让凯撒利用他作为政治筹码而选择自杀，这显示了他对自由和原则的坚持。斯多葛主义要求我们在看到不公义时挺身而出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One baffling misconception for me about Stoicism is that it turns people into doormats... But it's clearly contradicted by both the letter of the philosophy... and more importantly perhaps by the actions that we know those philosophers actually took in their life... In fact, there was a whole group of Stoic philosophers and Roman senators... who were known as the Stoic Opposition... Seneca talks a lot about a guy named Cato the Younger... Cato opposed Caesar on the floor of the senate... And whenever you see, as a Stoic, as a Stoic practitioner, you see those things threatened, you really ought to speak out. It's your duty as a Stoic practitioner to do so.

</details>

### 更新哲学

斯多葛主义的一个吸引人之处在于它对新思想的开放性。塞内卡说，前人是我们的老师，不是我们的主人。如果发现了更好的做事方式，我们应该调整哲学。例如，古代斯多葛学派是泛神论者，相信宇宙是一个有理性的生物（神），因此发生的一切都是为了宇宙的好（天意）。作为现代生物学家，我无法接受这种观点。我不相信宇宙有计划。因此，我必须修正“天意”的概念，但我仍然可以保留“接受”的部分——接受死亡是自然过程，接受现实的本来面目。这种适应性使得斯多葛主义在21世纪依然充满活力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the features of Stoicism that I find most attractive is that built into the system, there is an openness to new ideas and to adjust the philosophy internally so that it adapts to whatever it is that we may discover moving forward... For instance, the historic concept of providence is both interesting and beautiful on the one hand and yet I think deeply flawed and needs to be rejected on the other... The ancient Stoics were Pantheists... As a modern biologist... I don't think of the cosmos as a living organism... That means that I cannot avail myself of the Stoic concept of providence. So what do I replace it with? Well, acceptance is still part of it, right? I have to accept the reality of things... Scientific advancements will question our philosophical views, and it's a good thing if the philosophical views are able to adapt to what comes out of the new science.
