### 推测性小说定义

**主持人**: **Therese Maisonpierre**（选集《**As the Earth Dreams Black Canadian Speculative Stories**》的编辑）和 **Chinelo Onwualu**（她的故事《**The Hole in the Middle of the World**》收录于该选集）加入我们。你们今天怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Therese Maisonpierre, editor of the short fiction anthology *As the Earth Dreams Black Canadian Speculative Stories*, and Chinelo Onwualu, whose story *The Hole in the Middle of the World* appears in that anthology, and they both join us in studio. How are you guys both doing?

</details>

**Therese Maisonpierre & Chinelo Onwualu**: 很好。非常感谢。很棒。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Therese Maisonpierre & Chinelo Onwualu**: Good. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 我先问你一个问题，在我们深入探讨叙事之前，什么是推测性小说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm going to start with you before we dig into sort of the storytelling, what is speculative fiction.

</details>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: **推测性小说**（**speculative fiction**）是一个总称，涵盖了多种体裁，特别是奇幻、科幻、末世、恐怖、超级英雄、超自然，任何这类内容都属于推测性小说的范畴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: So speculative fiction is an umbrella term that describes a wide variety of genres, specifically fantasy, science fiction, apocalypse, horror, superhero, supernatural, anything like that all falls under the speculative fiction umbrella.

</details>

### 黑人作家与推测性小说

**主持人**: 好的。现在，**Chinelo**，请告诉我们一些关于推测性小说与**黑人作家**之间历史联系的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Now, Chinelo, tell us a little bit about the historical connection between speculative fiction and black authors.

</details>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: 我相信，只要有讲故事这回事，**黑人作家**就一直在讲述推测性故事。这与我们对自身解放的理解密不可分。看到我们在未来，尤其是在我们并不存在的未来情境中。所以问题出现了：我们发生了什么？因此，它非常重要，我认为黑人讲故事的历史悠久且充满推测性，从我们的民间故事到我们对未来的理解和未来主义，它都紧密交织在一起。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: For I believe that black authors have been telling speculative stories for as long as storytelling has been around. It's intricately intertwined with the understanding of our own liberation. Seeing ourselves in the future, especially in future scenarios in which we just don't exist. So the question happens what happened to us? And so it is very important, and I think there's been a long history of black storytelling that is speculative, from our folktales to our understandings of the future and futurisms, it's very much entwined. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 我有同样的想法吗？就其要求读者做什么，挑战读者做什么而言。当我们在谈论刻板印象时，当有人阅读这本选集中的作品时，推测性小说能做什么？你希望它能挑战读者做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do I have the same thing? ... In terms of what it requires, what it challenges readers to, do. What does speculative fiction do when we talk about perhaps stereotypes, when someone's reading some of the work in this anthology, what do you hoping that it challenges them to do?

</details>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: 是的。我认为，**推测性小说**对于打破障碍和拓宽读者的**想象力**非常重要，不仅是关于他们的未来可能是什么样子，或者我们所居住的星球的未来，也包括对周围人的不同视角，以及他们的生活在未来会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: Yeah. So speculative fiction, I feel, is really important for sort of breaking down barriers and widening readers imaginations not only of what their future could look like or the future of the planet we live on, but also different perspectives regarding the people around them and what they what their lives would be like in the future.

</details>

### 选集《As Earth Dreams》的创作

**主持人**: 现在，你承担了整理这本选集的重任，我很抱歉。请帮助我们理解，为了组建作者团队来完成这项工作，你考虑了哪些因素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, you had the challenge in honour of putting together this anthology... Help us understand what considerations did you have to take on to build the team of authors to put this together?

</details>

**Therese Maisonpierre**: 是的。我非常非常感激能有机会整理这样一本选集，尤其是汇集了这么多才华横溢的作家。这本选集的标题是《**As Earth Dreams**》。所以我当时在思考“梦想”。我在思考反思和深化视角，不仅是在加拿大，也包括黑人个体以及他们与社区和世界的关系。在寻找这些作者时，他们很多人都是我敬佩的作家，我喜爱他们的作品。所以能与他们合作对我来说是一份莫大的荣幸。他们的故事非常精彩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Therese Maisonpierre**: Yeah. So I'm really, really grateful to have the opportunity to put together a collection like this, especially with all of these really amazing and talented writers. The title of the anthology is *As Earth Dreams*. So I was thinking about dreaming. I was thinking about reflection and deepening perspectives, not only in Canada, but also for black people as individuals and their relationship with their communities and their world. In regards to finding these authors, a lot of them are writers that I admire whose work I love. So it was really a great privilege for me to work with them. And their stories are beautiful.

</details>

**主持人**: 请也告诉我一些关于他们的经历，因为其中有关于**移民**、**性别歧视**、**阶级歧视**的各种故事。还有，如果你能谈谈，你知道，有时人们会笼统地说，你知道，黑人群体是一个整体。有时我们在这里的演播室里讨论过，你知道，你标题中的黑人经历。它是“黑人加拿大”。有时我们说“非裔美国人”，我们就称之为一体。就这里的贡献而言，你为什么确保了叙事的多样性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Tell me a little bit about sort of their experiences as well, because there was a full range in terms of the stories of immigration, their stories of sexism, classism, and also, if you can speak to, you know, sometimes there's a broad stroke that, you know, the black community is a monolith. Sometimes we've had conversations here in this studio about, you know, the black experience in your title. It's black Canadian. And sometimes we say African American and we just call it just one. In terms of the contributions here, why did you make sure that there was a diverse cast of kind of storytelling?

</details>

**Therese Maisonpierre**: 是的，当我思考想在故事中展示什么时，就我给作者的指导而言，我想尽可能地广泛。我不会去设计让他们写关于自己哪一部分，或者我认为哪些部分是可发表的，或者哪些部分读者会觉得最吸引人。我想让它保持真实和真诚。就我们在选集中看到的**主题多样性**而言，我们涵盖了方方面面，正如你提到的，有**移民**、**阶级歧视**、**性别歧视**，还有**食物**。你知道，还有**记忆**、**童年**和**母性**，以及快乐和友谊。所有这些都包含了梦想以及革新和**想象力**的空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Therese Maisonpierre**: Yeah, when I thought about what I wanted to showcase in the in the stories, in terms of the direction I gave the, the authors, I wanted to keep it as broad as possible. I don't sort of design to tell them what parts of themselves they should write about, or what parts of their stories I think are publishable, or ones that readers would find most engaging. I wanted to keep it honest and authentic, and in terms of the diversity we see in themes in the anthology, we've got everything from, as you mentioned, immigration, classism, sexism, but also food. You know, also memory, childhood and motherhood, as well as joy and friendship. And all of these things kind of encompass dreaming and space for for reinvention and imagination.

</details>

### 作者故事的灵感与探索

**主持人**: 好的。现在我将朗读你故事《**The Hole in the Middle of the World**》中的一小段。它写道：“这不是我第一次被问及我的出生身份。这个国家富有的白人似乎再也无法自行生育婴儿了，所以他们开始在我们这些难民和移民中寻找代孕者。如今他们几乎无所不买，然而这个问题却在我内心深处的一个空洞处纠缠，一个我存在的核心处巨大的虚空。我想哭，却不知为何。我就是无法摆脱那种感觉，仿佛我忘记了极其重要的东西。”是什么启发了这篇精彩的作品？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. So I'm going to read a short passage from your story, *The Hole in the Middle of the World*. This it reads, this is not the first time I've been asked about my birth status. The rich white folk of this country can't seem to birth babies on their own anymore, so it looks like they've kicked up their search for surrogates among us refugees and immigrants. There's really nothing they won't buy there these days, though, the question snags at something in me a hole, a vast abyssal emptiness at the core of my being. I want to cry, but I don't know why. I just can't shake the feeling that I've forgotten something deeply important. What inspired this beautiful piece?

</details>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: 我是一位母亲，我的孩子今年五岁了。在她出生前不久，我经历了一些影响我**记忆**的健康并发症。基本上，我经历了一个过程，我真的忘记了自己的名字。我不得不查看我的手链来提醒自己。当 **Torres** 请我参与这个项目时，我一直在思考和困惑的一个问题是：**母性**会在你内心留下什么？当你经历这一切时，它从根本上改变了什么？因为我感觉，你知道，在外面，我生了孩子，我看起来不一样了，感觉不一样了，但我不知道这些变化是否会消失。我还会剩下什么？那段经历还会剩下什么？我当时也刚搬到这个国家几年。所以，围绕着**记忆**和**母性**，以及归属感（对自己和对他人）的意义，尤其是在搬到新地方打断了所有其他联系之后，这些主题在我脑海中盘旋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chinelo Onwualu**: So I'm a mother and my child is five years old this year, and just before her birth, I was dealing with some health complications that affected my memory. And essentially, I went through a process where I literally forgot my own name. I had to check my my bracelet to remember, and when Torres asked me to be part of this project, one of the things that I'd been really wrestling with and wondering around was, what does motherhood leave inside you? What does it change fundamentally when you go through it? Because it felt like, you know, outside I, you know, given birth, I looked different, I felt different, but I wondered if all these changes were to be taken away. What part would still be left of me, what part would still be left of that experience? And so I was also dealing with like having moved into this country like, you know, a couple of years before that. And so it was just this big swirl of themes around memory and motherhood and, and what it meant to belong to yourself and to someone else, especially when all these other, you know, bonds had been broken in the move to a new place.

</details>

**主持人**: 精彩的内容。你不仅承担了组织作者的挑战，自己也写了作品。我将朗读一段来自《**A Fair Assessment**》的小片段。“当然，灵魂不需要呼吸，但我能听到她本能的呼吸声，她试图让自己平静下来。我开始我的说辞。“我叫 Sarah Baptiste，”我说。“我是一名灵魂施法者。别担心，我不会耽误你太久。我知道这对你来说很不舒服。灵魂在我们的领域里常常会感到寒冷，也容易疲惫。至少我是这么被告知的。”我用空着的手在周围比划着。“这是 Zinnias 小姐，在加拿大**多伦多**的一家古董和复古商店。你能告诉我你的名字吗？”那个女人/女孩最后完成了她对房间的扫视。我看着她的目光停留在 Zinnias 小姐的许多大件物品上。“大厅，有些可能认得出来。”“我叫**Ruth**，”她终于说道。当我们谈论推测性小说的挑战，我们通常的思维方式时。你希望用这个故事挑战什么理念？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Beautiful stuff. Not only did you have the challenge of putting authors together, you also wrote something as well. I'm going to read a small snippet from *A Fair Assessment*. Spirits didn't need to breathe, of course, but I could hear her instinctive breaths as she tried to calm herself, I began my spiel. My name is Sarah Baptiste, I said. I'm a spirit caster. Don't worry, I won't keep you very long. I know this is uncomfortable for you. Spirits often got cold in our realm and tired easily. Or so I had been told. I gestured around me with my free hand. This is Miss Zinnias, antiques and vintage shop in Toronto, Canada. Can you tell me your name? The woman girl finished her visual sweep of the room. I watched her gaze settle on many of the large items of Miss Zinnias. Hall, some likely recognizable. My name is Ruth, she finally said as we talked about speculative fiction challenges, our typical way of thinking. What idea were you hoping to challenge with this story?

</details>

**Ruth**: 我想写一个关于**祖先**和**家庭**的故事，以及我们如何与先人联系的方式，即使我们已经失去了一些东西，或者故事没有流传下来。所以我对写一个有机会与**灵魂**对话、并弄清楚他们留下的物品的意义和价值的角色很感兴趣。我觉得，就这个故事而言，至少对我个人来说，它反映了我想要思考和探索自己**祖先**时所面临的一些挑战。比如我的家人来自**加勒比海**。他们在 90 年代搬到了**加拿大**，我父母的旅程一部分是，你知道，我们现在是加拿大人了，这就是我们正在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ruth**: I wanted to write a story about ancestry and and family, and the ways in which we could connect with the people who came before us, even if it was something that we had lost, or maybe stories hadn't been passed down. So I was interested in writing a character who got that opportunity, and whose kind of job it was, was to speak with spirits and and figure out the meaning and the value of the objects they left behind. And I feel like for for this story, for me personally at least, it kind of reflected some of the challenges that I had faced when I wanted to think about and explore my own ancestry. Like my family's from the Caribbean. They moved to Canada in the '90s, and part of my parents journey had been, you know, we're Canadian now, and that's kind of what we're doing.

</details>

**Ruth**: 我们不谈。关于它。我们？是的，不是我们不谈论它。更像是那已经是过去。你知道，现在我们着眼于未来。所以我从未真正有机会学到我想要的那么多。所以，我为这本选集写的故事，对我来说，至少是一种尝试去和解，并让自己足够勇敢去进行那种探索的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ruth**: We don't talk. About it. We? Yeah, it's not that we don't talk about it. It's more like that was the past. And you know, now we're looking forward to the future. So I never got really the opportunity to learn as much as I would have liked. So the story that I wrote for the anthology was, was, at least for me, a way to try to reconcile with that and try to make myself brave enough to do that kind of exploration myself.

### 对年轻黑人作家的寄语

**主持人**: 好的。通过展示**黑人加拿大作家**的作品并强调影响边缘化社区的主题，你希望安大略省有抱负的黑人作家能从这次对话中获得什么？**Janelle**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Through showcasing the work of Black Canadian authors and highlighting the themes that affect marginalised communities, what do you hope aspiring black writers in Ontario take away from this conversation? Janelle.

</details>

**Janelle**: 我希望他们记住，**想象力**是**抵抗**的重要工具。我们常常认为，你知道，反抗压迫是通过抗议和发声来实现的。这极其重要。但在你做这一切之前，你必须想象自己是自由的。这是我祖先被奴役，在难以置信的屈辱条件下时，他们唯一拥有的东西——他们的想象力，那种“总有一天，在某个地方，以某种方式，我们的孩子，我们子孙后代将获得自由”的想法。所以，**想象力**是我们拥有的宝贵资源，我真心希望作家们能记住这一点，不要觉得他们无能为力，因为他们拥有的只是笔。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janelle**: I think I would like them to remember that imagination is a vital tool of resistance. We often think of, you know, fighting against oppression as something that you do by, you know, protesting and, you know, speaking out. And that's incredibly important. But before you do any of that, you have to imagine yourself to be free. And that's something that when our ancestors were enslaved and in, you know, in, in these conditions of incredible degradation, the only thing they had was their imaginations, the idea that somehow, somewhere, some way, our children, our children's children will be free. And so imagination being this incredible resource that we have, I really want writers to remember that and not to feel that they are powerless because all they have is the pen.

</details>

**Torres**: **Torres**。是的，我将呼应 **Chinelo** 所提到的很多观点，但也想让人们知道，特别是**黑人作家**，年轻的**黑人作家**，他们的故事很重要。在这样的时代，人们常常会问：写作的意义是什么？讲故事的意义是什么？当我们可以走上街头举着标语时，但故事是我们表达自我、思考和想象更美好未来的工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Torres**: Torres. Yeah, I'm going to echo a lot of what Chinelo has mentioned, but also to let people know, particularly black writers, young black writers, that their stories matter. And in times like these, people often ask like, well, what is the point of writing? What is the point of telling stories when, you know, we could be out in the streets holding placards and things like that, but stories are the tools with which we not only express ourselves, but consider and imagine a better future.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们就先谈到这里。**Janella**，非常感谢你。精彩的写作。非常棒的内容。也感谢你的见解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We're going to have to leave it there. Janella, thank you so much. Beautiful writing. It was fantastic stuff. Thank you for your insights as well.

</details>

**Therese Maisonpierre, Chinelo Onwualu, Ruth, Torres**: 非常感谢。谢谢。
