### 沉默的代价与个人真相

在**马丁·路德·金**（Martin Luther King Jr.）1968年的一次演讲中，他反思民权运动时曾说：“最终，我们记住的不是敌人的言语，而是朋友的沉默。”作为一名教师，我深切体会到这句话的含义。我们每天都能看到沉默带来的后果，以歧视、暴力、种族灭绝和战争的形式显现。在课堂上，我鼓励学生通过诗歌探索自己生活中的“沉默地带”，共同努力去填补这些空白，认识并命名它们，理解它们并非羞耻的来源。为了在课堂上营造一个学生能够安全分享内心“沉默”的文化，我在教室前面的黑板上贴了四条核心原则，每位学生在学年开始时都会签署：批判性阅读，有意识地写作，清晰地表达，讲述你的真相。我经常思考最后一点——“讲述你的真相”。我意识到，如果我要求学生勇敢发声，那么我也必须讲述我的真相，并诚实地告诉他们我何时未能做到这一点。

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement states, "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." As a teacher, I've internalized this message. Every day all around us, we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination, violence, genocide, and war. In the classroom, I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces, to recognize them, to name them, to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences, I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class, which every student signs at the beginning of the year. Read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, tell your truth. I find myself thinking a lot about that last point, tell your truth. And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up, I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so.

### 历史、记忆与怀旧

我是**克里斯·达菲**（Chris Duffy），**TED**（TED: Technology, Entertainment, Design，一家致力于传播“值得分享的创意”的非营利组织）播客**《如何成为一个更好的人》**（How to be a better human）的主持人。每周，我都会与TED演讲者探讨他们的伟大思想以及如何在现实生活中应用这些思想。今天，我与作家**克林特·史密斯**（Clint Smith）讨论他的畅销书**《言语如何传承》**（How the Word is Passed）。我们探讨历史、诚实和正义，以及如何审视我们自己和我们的世界。克林特·史密斯是叙事非虚构作品《言语如何传承》以及两本诗集《地上》（Above Ground）和《计数下降》（Counting Descent）的作者，同时也是**《大西洋月刊》**（The Atlantic: 美国历史最悠久的文学与文化评论杂志之一）的特约撰稿人。他首先提出一个在《言语如何传承》中探讨的观点：历史、记忆和怀旧之间的区别。他解释说，这个思想三角关系源于他在**蒙蒂塞洛**（Monticello: 美国第三任总统托马斯·杰斐逊的故居和种植园）采访的一位名叫**大卫·索尔森**（David Thorson）的导游。大卫在蒙蒂塞洛担任导游多年，专注于讲述被奴役者的经历，而这在过去很长一段时间里是蒙蒂塞洛不愿提及的故事。

Hi, I'm Chris Duffy and I'm host of the TED podcast, How to be a better human. Every week on the show, I talk with TED speakers about their big ideas and how you can put those big ideas into place in your real life. Today on the show, I'm talking with the author Clint Smith about his best-selling book, How the Word is Passed. We're talking about history, honesty, and justice and what it means to reckon with ourselves and our world. Hi there, my name is Clint Smith. I am the author of How the Word is Passed, which is a work of narrative non-fiction, and two poetry collections, Above Ground and Counting Descent, and I'm a staff writer at The Atlantic magazine. I think the first thing that I'd like to talk to you about is there's an idea that you touch on in how the word is passed about the distinction between history, memory, and nostalgia. So, can we start by talking about the relationship between those three ideas? Yeah, you know, that sort of triangulation of ideas came from one of the folks that I spoke to at Montichello. He's a guy named David Thorson. He's a guide at Montichello Plantation. Which is, as many of us know, the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, one of the intellectual founding fathers of this country. And David has been a guide at Montichello for many years. and he focuses on the experience of the enslaved at Montichello, which was a story that people didn't tell at Montichello for a long time.

### 诚实面对历史的必要性

蒙蒂塞洛的迷人之处在于，它讲述自身故事的方式在几十年间发生了变化，甚至到了2025年，它仍在不断演变。大卫指出，许多来参观**托马斯·杰斐逊**（Thomas Jefferson: 美国第三任总统，独立宣言起草人之一）故居的人，在听到对杰斐逊作为哲学家、政治家、总统，同时也是奴隶主这一身份的诚实描述时，都感到惊讶。大卫提出了历史、记忆和怀旧的概念：**历史**（History）是实际发生过的事情；**怀旧**（Nostalgia: 对过去美好时光的向往，常带有理想化色彩）是我们希望发生的故事；而**记忆**（Memory）则介于两者之间。史密斯认为这非常贴切，因为我们的记忆正是这样形成的——它是我们从周围人、所爱之人、家人以及信息生态系统那里听来的故事的融合。其中一些与经验事实和现实相符，另一些则不然，但所有这些事实与虚构共同塑造了我们对过去的理解，进而塑造了我们对自身的理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Part of what's so fascinating about that place is the way that the story of how it tells the story of itself has changed in the sort of decades of its existence. And even now in 2025, how it tells the story of itself. And so David was making a point about how so many of the people that he speaks to who come on these tours to hear about Jefferson and are sort of surprised to encounter such an honest accounting for who Jefferson was as as not only a philosopher, a statesman, a politician, a president, but also as an enslaver. And so David has these ideas of history, memory, and nostalgia. With the idea that history is what happened. Nostalgia is the story of what we want to have happened and memory is the thing that kind of exists in between. And so I I thought that that was really apt because that's how our memories are formed. They're this kind of amalgam of of the stories we've been told by the people around us, by the people we love, by our families, by the sort of in information ecosystem that surround us. And some of those things are aligned with empirical fact and reality and some of them are not, but all of them sort of come together fact and fiction to shape our understanding of the past and and thus our understanding of ourselves.

### 诚实与社会不平等

史密斯认为，诚实作为一种美德至关重要。作为两个孩子的父亲，诚实是他育儿理念的核心，旨在培养善良、体贴、慷慨的人。在历史语境中，如果我们不诚实地面对过去发生的一切，我们最终会误解当今世界为何如此。他之所以写《言语如何传承》，是为了审视美国奴隶制的记忆，以及各地如何诚实或不诚实地对待这段记忆。他回忆起20世纪80年代和90年代在新奥尔良长大时，被大量关于黑人“问题”的信息所淹没，认为黑人健康、经济和社会状况不佳，机会不足，社区面貌落后，都是因为黑人自身做错了什么或未能做到什么。直到多年后，他才通过学术研究、写作、艺术和电影，获得了理解的语言和工具，认识到新奥尔良不同社区面貌差异的原因，并非社区居民本身，而是这些社区世世代代所遭受的剥夺和压榨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's interesting because so much of um your your books, but also so much of uh the the issues going on in the world today have this intersection between um the things that we want to be true about ourselves and the world and the things that are actually true. And it seems to me from reading your work that you're someone who really cares uh deeply about honesty as a as a principle, as a virtue, as something that we really need to strive for. Can you talk to me about why honesty is so important to you? Especially I mean generally as a virtue um I think it's I think it's incredibly important. I I'm a father of two young kids. Um and it is central to my sort of pedagogy of parenting and how I I try to create kind, thoughtful, generous human beings. Um and in the context of history, I think if we're not honest about what has transpired uh over the course of history, we end up misunderstanding the reason that our world looks the way that it does today. I mean the what what drove me to write How the word is passed which is a sort of examination of uh the memory of slavery in the United States and and places that are uh engaging with that memory honestly as we said uh and places that are engaging with it a little more dishonestly. Part of why I wanted to do that was because I remember growing up as a young person growing up in New Orleans um in the 80s and 90s and being inundated with all these messages about all the things that were wrong with black people. how uh the reason black people didn't have um the same health outcomes, the same economic outcomes, the same uh social outcomes, that we didn't have the same opportunities, why our communities look certain ways was somehow because of something black people had done wrong or something that black people had failed to do. Uh, and it wasn't until many years later that I discovered the scholarship and the writing and the art and the film uh, that that gave me the language, the toolkit, the information to help me understand that actually the reason one community in New Orleans looks one way and another community in New Orleans looks another way is not because of the people in those communities, but what has been done to those communities or extracted from those communities generation after generation after generation.

### 填补历史空白，认清真相

这种黑白不平等的根源，无论是在**新奥尔良**（New Orleans: 美国路易斯安那州最大的城市，历史上曾是国内奴隶贸易的中心）还是全国，都始于奴役。史密斯在新奥尔成长，那里曾是国内奴隶贸易的中心，他本人也是被奴役者的后代，他的曾祖父的祖父就是被奴役者。然而，他对奴隶制历史的理解，与它对这个国家造成的巨大影响和遗留问题完全不符。他的理解和教育中存在太多空白，而这本书正是为了填补这些空白。通过这样做，他能够以更清晰的视角审视这个国家，以一种让他不再被欺骗的洞察力，将自己和周围存在的不平等置于历史背景中，从而理解这种不平等为何存在。这与那些更阴险、最终不正确的叙事——认为这是某些人的过错而非政策的过错——形成了鲜明对比。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And and the origin of that in terms of black white inequality in New Orleans and across the country um begins with enslavement. And I am someone who grew up in New Orleans, which is the heart of the was the heart of the domestic slave trade. Uh and I am the descendant of enslaved people. Like my grandfather's grandfather was enslaved and I didn't understand the history of slavery in any way that was commensurate with the impact and legacy that it left on this country. And there were so many gaps in my own understanding, so many gaps in my own education. And this this book was an attempt to fill those gaps because in doing so it allowed me to look at the country with a different level of clarity uh with a sort of clearsightedness that made it so that I couldn't be lied to anymore. That made it so that um I was able to sort of more fully situate myself and um the inequality that existed around me um in a historical context that provided an understanding of why that inequality existed. um in r in ways that ran counter to these sort of uh more insidious um and ultimately incorrect narratives that it was somehow the fault of of certain people rather than of policy.

</details>

### 教育的平衡：讲述苦难与希望

史密斯在《言语如何传承》的致谢部分写道，他写这本书的主要动力和目标是希望他教过的学生会为这本书感到骄傲，并且这本书会是他们可以学习的那种书。他提到，无论是他自己的育儿方式，还是社会上关于“我们能和孩子谈论什么”的争议，都存在一种“保护孩子”的倾向。然而，任何真正与孩子打交道的人，尤其是老师，都知道孩子们远比我们想象的更能理解复杂的细微之处，更能倾听艰难的故事。事实上，如果你不告诉他们，他们仍然会感觉到有些不对劲，并会形成自己的版本。当谈到奴隶制的残酷以及美国乃至世界各地持续存在的不公时，这种诚实如何体现，即信任孩子能够利用这些信息来理解世界，而不是被其摧毁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

you you wrote in the um acknowledgements section of how the word is passed that uh one of the the main drivers for you in writing this book and and a goal that you hope to live up to is that the students who you taught when you were a teacher would um be proud of this book and that it would have been the kind of book that you could teach to them. Um, you also have talked about how, you know, both in in your own parenting and in the ways that there's this kind of like public push back around like what we can talk to kids about that that you have to kind of protect kids from stuff. And and yet I think anyone who has actually worked with kids, especially as a teacher, knows that kids are so much more capable of understanding complex nuance and and hearing really hard stories and and in fact that when you don't tell them, they still kind of know something is up and they they kind of figure out their own version of it. when it comes to these stories of like the brutality of slavery, of the ongoing injustices in the United States, but also around the world, how does that honesty play out in the in the sense of um I guess trusting kids that they can actually like use it to to make sense of the world rather than be destroyed by it.

</details>

### 赋能年轻人，超越历史暴力

史密斯指出，有一种不好的教育方式是，仅仅向年轻人灌输关于黑人过去400年所经历的所有可怕事情，这会让他们感到麻痹而非解放。他认为，糟糕的教学法，以及将这段历史视为定义黑人美国人经历的全部，确实会使黑人儿童感到麻痹和不知所措。因此，我们必须在两者之间取得微妙的平衡：一方面，要向年轻人诚实、清晰地传达黑人所遭受的几个世纪的暴力、压迫和奴役；另一方面，又不能陷入暗示或明示这便是黑人美国人经历的全部的陷阱，因为他们的经历远比这更广阔。我们必须理解我们从何而来，从何种暴力中走出来，才能理解我们今天作为一个社区、一个广义上的人民所处的位置。同时，我们也要为年轻人提供空间，让他们能够想象超越暴力、超越奴役和**吉姆·克劳法**（Jim Crow: 19世纪末至20世纪中期美国南部各州实行的种族隔离和歧视性法律）的未来可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There's a bad version of this where you are just inundating a young person with information about like all the terrible things that black people have experienced over the course of the last 400 years in this country in a way that that they experience as a sort of paralyzing force more than an emancipatory one. Um, and I think bad ped bad pedagogy um, and and and treating this history as if it is all that defines the black American experience can have the effect of of of again sort of paralyzing um, and overwhelming black children to be sure. And so I think what you have to do is strike this delicate balance of at once communicating to young people and being honest and being clear about the centuries of violence and oppression of and subjugation that black people have been subjected to while also not falling into the trap of implicitly or explicitly suggesting that that is all that defines the black American experience because it is so much more expansive than that you have to understand the history from which we come, the violence from which we have emerged in order to understand where we are as a community, as a people broadly defined today. And you have to also provide space for young people to imagine a set of possibilities for themselves that exist beyond the violence, that exists beyond um the subjugation, that exists beyond slavery and Jim Crow.

</details>

### 避免误解，理解系统性不公

史密斯认为，有时为了避免让黑人儿童或所有儿童感到不知所措，我们可能会回避、淡化或绕过这段历史，转而谈论黑人生活中更广阔、更快乐的元素。这固然非常重要，但如果我们不谈论历史的另一部分，那么结果可能就是他小时候经历的那种误解：当你环顾四周，看到不平等，看到种族不平等时，你可能会听到一些说法，比如“这个社区之所以这样，是因为这些人不够努力”，或者“这可能与生物或文化因素有关”。如果你没有给予一个人历史背景、相关信息和工具来理解这些说法是不正确的，那么他们很可能会陷入对某些社区的人为何如此的假设。史密斯写这本书，正是为了写一本他高中美国历史课上需要的那种书。他甚至将推出一个青少年读者版本，因为他想象着更年轻的自己会渴望接触这段历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Because I think sometimes what can happen is in an effort not to overwhelm like a good faith effort not to overwhelm black children or children in general, we can move away from this history or soften this history or sidestep this history and talk about, you know, the more expansive uh joyful elements of black life. And I think that that's deeply important, profoundly important. But if we don't talk about the other part, then what happens can be a version of the sort of misunderstanding that I grew up with where you you you look around and you see inequality, you see racial inequality and you you you hear certain things about oh well this community uh you know looks this way because these people don't work hard enough. Maybe there's a biological thing or a cultural thing. Um, and if you if you have not given someone the history and the context and the tools to understand that that's not correct, um, then it it's very human to sort of fall into the trap of making assumptions about why certain people in certain communities look the way that they do. And and I just I wrote this book because I wanted to write the sort of book that I felt like I needed in my high school American history class. Um, and I have a young reader edition of the book coming out because I wanted I imagined an even younger version of myself sort of uh wanting access to this history.

</details>

### 历史教育的解放力量

史密斯无法用言语形容，获得这些信息让他感到多么自由、解放和赋权，让他能够理解眼前的世界为何如此。这不仅适用于种族问题，也适用于年轻人所面临的各种问题。这就是为什么教授涵盖不同经历（种族、移民、LGBTQ+议题等）的历史如此重要。当我们解释压迫系统如何塑造了当今的不平等格局时，它消除了我们认为个人应对自身处境负全责的观念。这并不是说人们没有能动性，而是说我们的能动性存在于塑造它的更大历史力量的背景之下。史密斯认为这非常重要，因为人们不再因为那些超越他们自身、并非仅仅反映他们做过或未做过的事情的失败而责备自己或家人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Because I I can't begin to explain how liberating it was, how emancipatory it was, how um empowering it was to be given information that allowed me to make sense of why the world in front of me looked the way that it did. And that's in the context that can exist in the context of race, but that exists for the for young people in the context of of a range of things. That's why it is so important to teach history across a range of different experiences, race, immigration, LGBTQ issues, you know, the list goes on and on. Uh, and I I think that when we explain how systems of oppression have shaped the contemporary landscape of inequality, it disabuses us of the idea that individual people are singularly responsible for the circumstances they find themselves in. Which isn't to say that people don't have agency, but it is to say that our agency exists within the context of a set of larger historical forces that have shaped it. And I think that that's so important because suddenly people are not blaming themselves or their family for their um for failures that are reflective of something that exists beyond them and not just and are not just reflective of something they have or haven't done.

</details>

### 全球不平等与历史重写

史密斯很高兴主持人提到了更广阔的背景，因为虽然许多听众身处美国，生活在这段历史的遗迹中，但也有许多来自美国以外的国家和大陆的听众。他认为这是一种全球普遍存在的模式，也是理解真相和历史的重要组成部分。正如他所说，这些不平等系统持续存在，而我们往往只了解其中的一小部分。史密斯也谈到了对这种历史观点的抵触情绪。那些不想了解更准确历史的人，会说“你正在重写历史”，这很滑稽，因为我们并非在重写，而是在审视实际发生的事情。但对于像他这样“异性恋白人男性”来说，理解这些历史似乎会让他们感到不公平的糟糕或内疚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I I'm so glad you you put in that broader context too because you know this show obviously a lot of people who are listening are are in the United States and are living in the the remnants of this history but there's also a lot of people who are listening outside of the United States and other countries and in other continents and I think that this is a pattern that exists globally and a really important piece of understanding truth and history and like you said these systems of inequality continue to exist and we often only learn a small little piece of them. Um, I'm curious to to address a little bit of the like what feels to me like push back around this kind of idea for people who don't want to learn like this more accurate idea of history is people they they say some version of like you're rewriting history which is funny because right like you're not rewriting you're just exam examining the thing that actually happened but then there's also this sense for people like me who are I'm a straight white man that somehow understanding this is going to make me feel bad or guilty in a way that is unfair.

</details>

### 美国的认知失调与复杂性

史密斯一直觉得很奇怪，为什么同时接受多种真相或多种现实，会让人产生恐惧或内疚感。他举例说，**蒙蒂塞洛**之所以让他如此感兴趣，是因为他想研究**杰斐逊**以及他奴役他人的遗产是如何被铭记的。在他看来，杰斐逊在很多方面体现了美国的**认知失调**（Cognitive Dissonance: 指一个人同时持有两种或多种相互冲突的信念、思想或价值观时所体验到的心理不适感）。美国为一个国家，它为数百万代人提供了无与伦比、难以想象的机会，这是他们的祖先从未想象过的。但与此同时，它也直接以数百万被世代奴役和压迫的人为代价。这两者都是美国的故事，并非非此即彼。这两者对于理解美国过去和现在是什么样子都至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I've always found it strange that the idea that we would be asked to hold multiple truths or multiple realities at once and alongside one another is something that instills a sense of um fear or a sense of u guilt within people. And and so for example, you know, we talked briefly about Montichello, but Montichello is so interesting to me and I wanted to go and sort of examine Jefferson and how the legacy of of his enslavement is remembered because I think that Jefferson in so many ways embodies the cognitive dissonance of America, which is to say America is a place that has provided unparalleled, unimaginable opportunities for millions of people across generations in ways that their own ancestors could have never imagined. And it has also done so at the direct expense of millions and millions of other people who have been intergenerationally subjugated and oppressed. And both of those things are the story of America. It's not one over here and one over there. You get to talk about this one and not talk about that one. Both of those things are are central to understanding what America has been and continues to be.

</details>

### 杰斐逊的矛盾与美国的二元性

同样地，**杰斐逊**也再次体现了这种张力。他撰写了西方世界历史上最重要的文献之一，同时他一生中奴役了600多人，其中包括他的四个亲生孩子。他在**《独立宣言》**（Declaration of Independence: 美国独立战争期间发表的宣告美国脱离英国而独立的纲领性文件）中写道“人人生而平等”，却又在**《弗吉尼亚州札记》**（Notes on the State of Virginia: 托马斯·杰斐逊于1785年出版的一本书，探讨了弗吉尼亚州的自然历史、社会结构和政治制度，其中包含了他对黑人种族劣势的观点）中写道黑人在身体和心智上都天生劣于白人。史密斯只是要求我们正视美国的这种二元性、复杂性、矛盾性和认知失调。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

In the same way that Jefferson Jefferson is somebody who again sort of personifies that that tension. and he is someone who wrote one of the most important documents in the history of the western world and is also someone who enslaved over 600 people over the course of his lifetime including four of his own children. He's someone who wrote in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal and wrote in notes on the state of Virginia that black people are inherently inferior to whites in both endowments of body and mind. All I'm asking us to do is to sit with the duality and the complexity and the contradictions and the cognitive dissonance of what America is.

</details>

### 集体意愿与政治分歧

《言语如何传承》的最后一句话是：“在某个时刻，问题不再是我们能否学习这段历史，而是我们是否有集体的意愿去正视它。”史密斯认为，这正是核心问题。过去几年的集体社会和政治生活表明，这种经历是不均衡、不一致的，并且在地理、种族和政治上存在分歧。对一个人来说可能是诚实的反思，对另一个人来说可能被视为叛国或不爱国。史密斯在撰写《言语如何传承》的过程中学到，即使你不同意某个观点，甚至觉得某个观点令人憎恶，认真对待这些观点从何而来、为何存在仍然很重要。如果我们不这样做，只是将彼此简化为漫画形象，认为某些人之所以这样做是因为他们邪恶、没有灵魂，那么我们就会陷入政治裂痕中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The very last line of how the word is passed is at some point it is no longer a question of whether we can learn this history but whether we have the collective will to reckon with it. It is the question. Um, and I think that the last several years of our um, social and political lives collectively uh, demonstrate that it is that that experience is uneven. Um, that that experience is inconsistent. uh that that experience is geographically and racially uh and politically divergent. The the very thing that might uh look like an honest reckoning to one person may be felt as and experienced as um treasonous or or um unpatriotic um by another. Part of what I learned in writing how the word is passed, you know, I went to all sorts of places. I went to prison, you know, the largest maximum security prison in the country. I went to one of the largest Confederate cemeteries in the country. Uh I spent time with the descendants of uh enslavers, the descendants of the enslaved. Even when you do not agree um even when you find someone's views abhorrent I think it is important to take seriously where those views come from and why they exist because if we don't if we turn one another simply into caricatures and say that the reason certain people are doing this is because they're just they are evil and they they have no soul and I think the emotional impulse is one I understand and I also think that the it is important for us to take seriously the emotional texture that is animating beliefs that we find to be incredibly harmful um or incredibly frightening.

</details>

### 理解抵制背后的情感

史密斯指出，美国有数百万民众不愿谈论、思考、学习、让孩子学习或阅读、观看关于奴隶制的书籍和电影。他们不想与奴隶制有任何瓜葛，也不想与美国历史项目中的许多其他事情有任何瓜葛。他认为，这意味着我们必须继续努力理解这种抵制背后的动因。如果我们不理解这种抵制的原因，我们只会让人们各说各话，并陷入我们今天仍在经历的政治裂痕中。史密斯反思，面对当下国家发生的一些事情，他如何才能既清晰又坦率地说明其影响，说明这些行为的危险性、深刻的吝啬和邪恶，同时又不把人变成僵化、无可救药的漫画形象。他承认，有些时候他做得比其他时候好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so many millions of people in this country do not want to talk about slavery, think about slavery, be taught about slavery, have their children taught about slavery, read books about slavery, watch films about slavery. They don't want anything to do with it. As well as many other things that are part of the American Historical Project. And I think it does mean that we have to continue to try to make sense of what is animating such retrenchment. Because if we don't understand what's animating the retrenchment, then we're just going to have a bunch of folks talking past one another and we're going to be caught in the sort of political um fissures that that we continue to experience today. How do I I see some of the things happening in our country right now? How am I How can I be both clear and forthright about what the implications of this will be? How dangerous, how profoundly um ungenerous, how how evil the actions themselves are. without turning people into static, irredeemable caricatures, and some days I'm better at it than others. Well, Glenn Smith, thank you so much for being on the show. I cannot recommend more highly your books and your work, and I really appreciate you taking the time to be here. Absolutely. This is a pleasure.
