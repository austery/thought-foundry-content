title: Annaka Harris：意识的本质、幻觉与自由意志
summary: 本访谈中，**Annaka Harris**深入探讨了意识的本质及其在科学和哲学中的难题。她将意识定义为最基本的“感受体验”，并挑战了我们关于意识、自我和自由意志的直觉。通过植物行为、闭锁综合征和脑科学研究（如**默认模式网络**），Harris指出意识可能是一种更基本、更普遍的自然现象，而非仅限于复杂大脑的产物。她强调认识到“自我幻觉”和“自由意志幻觉”的心理益处，以及其对科学研究和伦理决策的深远影响。

### 意识的定义与研究

**Annaka Harris**: 我是**Annaka Harris**，我撰写关于意识科学与哲学的文章。我有一本书叫《**意识：心智基本奥秘的简要指南**》（*Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind*），还有一部纪录片系列名为《**亮灯**》（*Lights on*）。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: I'm Annaka Harris and I write about the science and philosophy of consciousness. I have a book called "Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind." And I have a docuseries titled "Lights on."

**Narrator**: **Annaka Harris**挑战意识的幻觉。第一部分：定义意识。您的意识研究工作主要涉及哪些方面？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Challenging the illusions of consciousness with Annaka Harris. Part one: Defining consciousness. What does your work in consciousness entail?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 我的工作重点在于，是什么让意识成为一个如此令人困惑和神秘的现象，为什么科学家们很难研究它。由于它在神经科学领域仍然是一个神秘的现象，我的部分工作也包括连接那些通常不进行对话的不同学科。在意识研究中，如果我们有兴趣探讨意识在自然界中是否比科学界先前假设的更深层，我们就会走出神经科学领域，涉足生物学、植物科学，并且根据我们想深入探究的程度，最终会进入物理学。因此，我的部分工作是帮助不同学科相互交流，以便它们都能了解我们在意识研究中面临的同类奥秘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: My work focuses on what makes consciousness such a deeply perplexing phenomenon and a mysterious phenomenon, why it's so difficult for scientists to study it, and because it's such a mysterious phenomenon still within neuroscience, part of my work has also been to connect different disciplines that aren't usually in dialogue. With consciousness studies, if we're interested in asking the question about whether consciousness goes deeper in nature than the sciences have previously assumed, we start to come out of neuroscience and meander into biology, plant sciences, and depending on how far down we wanna look, ultimately physics. And so part of my work is helping the different disciplines communicate with one another so that they're all informed about the same types of mystery that we're facing in consciousness studies.

**Narrator**: 您为什么写这本书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Why did you write your book?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 我写我的书《**意识**》的原因之一是，我注意到当我在晚宴上和朋友们讨论我的工作时，我发现所有与我交谈的人都变得非常感兴趣，并且有很多问题。这很合理，因为我们都有意识的体验，而且我们不仅都有这种体验，它还是我们所知和所关心的一切的核心。我们甚至无法完全理解没有它我们的生活会是什么样子。我们所关心的一切，我们所体验的一切，我们所知道的一切，都是通过我们对它的意识觉知来了解的，它是我们与宇宙、与现实其余部分的直接接触。你可以通过想象一些对你很重要的事情，甚至一些不重要的事情来理解这一点。今天发生在你身上的任何事情，你正在思考的任何事情，你正在尝试做出的任何决定。试着思考它，或者试着做出那个决定。然后想象一下，当你不清醒时做这些事情。你立刻就会意识到，这就是我们生活的舞台。从某种意义上说，这就是一切。我们的意识觉知就是一切。它对科学家和全人类来说仍然如此神秘，它仍然是未解之谜之一，这使得它成为每个人都可以为之兴奋，并能激发每个人敬畏之情的事物。敬畏是那种我们都喜欢沉浸其中的感觉。而这正是那些尚未解决的奥秘之一，因此它仍然能激发大多数开始思考它并发现它实际有多么神秘的人的敬畏之情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So one of the reasons I wrote my book "Conscious" was because I noticed that when I was discussing my work at dinner parties and with friends, I noticed that everyone I spoke to became very interested and had a lot of questions. And that makes sense because we all have an experience of consciousness and not only do we all have an experience of it, it is central to everything we know and care about. We can't even quite understand what it would mean to live our lives without it. Everything that we care about, everything we experience, everything we know, we know it through our conscious awareness of it, it is our immediate contact with the universe, with the rest of reality. And you can see this just by imagining you know something that's important to you or even something that's not important to you. Anything that happened to you today, anything you're thinking about, any decision you're trying to make. Okay, try to think about that or try to make that decision. And imagine doing that when you're not conscious. You immediately realize that this is where our lives play out. This is in some sense, this is everything. Our conscious awareness is everything. And the fact that it's still so mysterious to scientists and to all of humanity, the fact that it's still one of the great unsolved mysteries makes it something that everyone can be excited about and that inspires awe in everyone. And awe is this feeling that we all enjoy kind of basking in. And this is one of those mysteries that is still unsolved and so can still inspire awe in most people who start to think about it and discover how mysterious it actually is.

**Narrator**: 您如何定义意识？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: How do you define consciousness?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 意识的核心奥秘在于，当我使用“意识”这个词时，我指的不是高阶思维或复杂思想，也不是我们通常认为的人类意识，而是最根本意义上的意识，即“感受体验”这一赤裸裸的事实。所以，如果一条蠕虫有意识，如果作为一条蠕虫有某种感受，如果存在一种感受体验，如果存在与蠕虫相关的“感知能力”——尽管科学界对此没有共识——但如果作为一条蠕虫有某种感受，它显然不会计划它的一天，它不会有复杂的想法，也许它只是在泥土中移动时，皮肤感受到非常微妙的感觉。我们可以想象这是一种可能性。它可能有某种内在的欲望，想要靠近食物或远离危险。所以，当我在这个语境中使用“意识”这个词，并将其作为一个奥秘来谈论时，它实际上是指这种最基本的“感受体验”，我们知道它从我们自身的经验中在宇宙中产生，并可以从中推断。在我这里使用的最基本意义上，意识没有完美的定义。哲学家**Thomas Nagel**写了一篇著名的文章，题为《**作为一只蝙蝠是什么感觉？**》（*What Is It Like to Be a Bat?*）。我推荐这篇文章，我认为它在这里非常有用，因为它没有给出定义，而是描绘了一种与人类体验完全不同的体验。德语中有一个词叫“**umwelt**”，它描述的是某种生物所拥有的感受和感觉类型。例如，蝙蝠使用声纳而不是视觉，我们无法想象那是什么感觉。我们也许可以接近它或进行类比，但蝙蝠通过声纳在世界中移动，它发出声音，声音从墙壁、树木和世界中反弹回来，它以我们通过视觉感知外部世界的方式来感知它的外部世界。但你可以想象，那种实际的感受体验与我们使用视觉的体验非常不同。所以，当你思考某些体验是什么样子时，比如作为一只蝙蝠是什么感觉，作为一只蜜蜂是什么感觉，我认为这比某些语言更直接地触及我们对意识的直觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So the mystery at the heart of consciousness, and when I use the word consciousness, I'm not talking about higher order thinking or complex thought, or things that we think of in terms of human consciousness, but when I use the word consciousness, I'm talking about consciousness in the most fundamental sense, this bare fact of felt experience. So if a worm is conscious, if there's something that it's like to be a worm, if there's a felt experience, if there's sentience associated with a worm and there's no consensus on this, in the sciences, but if there is something it's like to be a worm, it obviously isn't planning it's day, it's not having complex thoughts, maybe it's experiencing very subtle sensation against its skin as it moves through the dirt. We can imagine that that is a possibility. It's possible there's some kind of internal desire to move toward food or away from danger. So when I use the word consciousness in this context, when talking about it as a mystery, it's really in this most basic sense as the fundamental felt experience that we know comes into being in the universe from our own experience and can extrapolate from that. There's no perfect definition for consciousness in the way that I'm using it here in the most fundamental sense. And so the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote a famous essay titled, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" And I recommend this article and I think it's extremely useful here because rather than give a definition, he illustrates a picture of a totally different type of experience than a human experience. There's a German term for this, "umwelt," and it's the, umwelt is the word for describing the types of feelings and sensations a certain type of organism has. So a bat uses sonar rather than vision, and we can't imagine what that's like. We can maybe get close to it or or draw analogies, but a bat is moving through the world using sonar, so it's making sounds, the sounds are bouncing off the walls and the trees and the world and it gets a picture of its external world in the same way that we get a picture of the external world through vision. But you can imagine that the actual felt experience of that is very different from our experience of using vision. And so when you think about what certain experiences are like, what it's like to be a bat, what it's like to be a bee, this gets at the, I think, I think this gets at our intuition for what consciousness is in a more direct way than some of the language does.

**Narrator**: 意识的**难题**是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: What is the hard problem of consciousness?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 意识的核心奥秘是，为什么在这个似乎充满非意识物质的宇宙中，有原子、电子、恒星、太阳系以及所有我们认为不包含内在感受体验或是非意识的事物，非意识物质如何以某种方式被配置，从而创造出一种突然从内部产生感受体验的情况？突然间，那种物质有了某种感受，这通常被称为**意识的难题**。这个术语来自哲学家**David Chalmers**，之所以被称为难题，从某种意义上说，这是一个玩笑。它是与所谓的“简单问题”相比而言的，这些问题在神经科学中并非真正简单，但“简单问题”更多地是关联哪些大脑状态与哪些感受状态相关联。**难题**则涉及为什么任何处理过程，甚至是任何大脑处理过程，都会产生感受体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So the mystery at the heart of consciousness is why in this universe that seems to be teeming with non-conscious matter, with atoms, and electrons, and stars, and solar systems, and all these things that we assume don't entail a felt experience from the inside or they're non-conscious, how non-conscious matter somehow gets configured in such a way as to create a situation where suddenly it's having a felt experience from the inside. Suddenly there's something that it's like to be that matter, and that is often referred to as the hard problem of consciousness. And that term comes from David Chalmers, the philosopher, and it's called the hard problem because in a sense, it's a joke. It's in comparison to what are the easy problems which aren't truly easy in neuroscience, but the easy problems are more associating which brain states are associated with which feeling states. The hard problem entails why there is a felt experience of any processing, even brain processing at all.

</details>

**Narrator**: 意识与思想不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Is consciousness different from thought?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 区分意识和思想很重要，因为我所感兴趣的意识，作为一种奥秘的意识，可以存在于没有思想的情况下。它可以存在于纯粹的感受体验中，它可以存在于一个无法思考的非常简单的生物中。但即使在我们人类的经验中，我们也知道可以有无思想的时刻，特别是如果你想到一个非常年幼的孩子或婴儿，他们感受到皮肤上的压力，听到房间里的声音，甚至在大脑能够区分声音并处理它们，理解它们背后的意义或它们可能代表什么之前。体验本身，比如铃声，看到绿色的体验，热或冷的体验，这些都是我们能想象到的最基本的体验。那里显然存在一种体验，那里显然存在意识，而且它不一定包含思想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: Making a distinction between consciousness and thought is important because consciousness in the sense that I'm interested in, in the sense that it's a mystery can exist without thought, it can exist in a pure felt experience, it could exist in a very simple organism that is not capable of thought. But even in our human experience, we know that there can be moments that are without thought, especially if you think of a very young child or an infant feeling pressure against the skin, hearing sounds in the room before the brain is even able to distinguish sounds and be able to process them and understand the meaning behind them or what they might represent. The experience itself, the sound of a bell, the experience of seeing green, the experience of heat or cold, those are experiences that are the most minimal ones we can imagine. And there's clearly an experience there. There's clearly consciousness there and it doesn't necessarily entail thought.

### 意识的普遍性

**Narrator**: 您最大的未解之谜是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: What is your biggest unanswered question?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 我想对我来说的问题，也是我写完书后留下的问题是：意识是否可能在自然界中是一种更基本的现象，并且本质上无处不在，因此更像**引力**？所以，这并不是说它不如我们想象的那么特殊，因为引力显然在我们的宇宙中非常特殊，但它影响着一切。我仍然非常感兴趣，并且可能永远都会感兴趣的问题是：意识在自然界中是否比科学界先前假设的更深层？也就是说，它是否可能不是从大脑中复杂的处理过程产生的，而是一种更基本的宇宙属性？因此，在比我们之前意识到的更多系统和生物中，都存在感受体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: I guess the question for me is, and this is the question that I was left with when I finished writing my book, is, is it possible that consciousness is a much more basic phenomenon in nature and is essentially pervading everything, so is much more like gravity and so not that it's less special than we assumed because gravity is something that's obviously very special in our universe, but it affects everything. And the question that I'm still very interested in and think I'll probably always be interested in is does consciousness go deeper in nature than the sciences have previously assumed? So rather than arising out of complex processing in brains, namely, is it possible that it's a much more basic property of the universe? And so there are felt experiences arising in more systems and organisms than we previously realized.

</details>

**Narrator**: 意识可以是基础性的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Could consciousness be fundamental?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 我们觉得需要意识的一个原因是我们做决策的过程。我们有一种感觉，认为一个坚实的“自我”在做决策，我们并没有真正感觉到这些决策本质上是自然界中发生的底层大脑过程。我最近对一些植物行为研究非常着迷。其中一项是关于**豌豆幼苗**的研究，在实验室里，他们把它种在一个Y形迷宫中。豌豆幼苗种在顶部，然后根需要向下生长，到某个点会分叉，所以根实际上需要决定向哪个方向生长，哪个方向对它更有益。他们进行了不同的情景实验。其中一个是在一根管子的末端放一盘水，另一根管子的末端什么也没有。根可以感觉到一端有水。所以在那个决策点，它感觉到水，然后它就做出一个决定，姑且这么说，向水移动。他们以许多有趣的方式进行这个实验。有一个实验是他们只播放流水的声音，根实际上会朝那个方向生长。所以植物，虽然比人类处理简单得多，但它们正在进行显著水平的处理，通过声音、湿度、化学物质感知其环境。所以，这只是一种简单的决策，决定根需要往哪个方向走。然后你可以再提升一个层次，以**菟丝子**为例，它是一种寄生藤蔓。如果你把菟丝子种在两棵植物之间，其中一棵比另一棵更有利于它的生长，它就会向更适合其需求的植物移动。所以菟丝子是一种寄生植物，需要缠绕在另一棵植物上才能生存。关于这一点，一件非常有趣的事情是，科学家们最近发现菟丝子正在检测穿过叶子的光波。所以当我们看一片叶子时，我们看到绿色，是因为绿色是叶子反射的频率，而其他光波则穿过叶子。因此，菟丝子实际上有一种方法可以测量从叶子另一侧出来的光的类型，并且可以测量和确定形状，与菟丝子的距离，并确定哪种植物更适合它，然后朝那个方向生长以到达那棵植物。所以如果你思考人类行为，它在几个层面上更复杂，但它非常相似，而且如果你愿意，它属于同一种决策类别。当然，大脑与植物、根以及这些其他系统是非常不同的系统。但是当你观察这些类型的行为时，并非不可能想象可能存在一种感受，无论多么基本，多么根本，比如感知光波，听到流水的声音，当然不是以我们人类的方式，但仍然以我们无法想象的方式，但仍然与感受体验相关联。因此，如果可能我们一直以错误的方式思考意识，认为它不是从复杂的处理过程中产生的，而是一种更基本的东西，类似于引力，更像一个场，一种无处不在的东西，那么我们就可以想象自然界中所有类型的处理过程都可能包含某种感受体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So one of the things we feel we need consciousness for is our decision-making process. And there's a sense in which we feel like a solid self making decisions and we don't really get the feeling that those decisions are essentially a bottom brain processes playing out in nature. And I recently became very fascinated by a couple of plant behavior studies. One was of a pea seedling, which in the lab they planted in a Y-maze. So the pea seedling is planted at the top and then the roots need to grow down and then at a certain point, it branches off, and so the root actually needs to decide which direction to grow, which will be more beneficial for it to grow in. And they run different scenarios. One is where they have a dish of water at the end of one tube and nothing at the end of the other. And the root can sense that there is water at one end. And so at that decision point, it senses the water and it kind of makes a decision, for lack of a better term, to move toward the water. And they do this experiment in many interesting ways. There's one where they actually just play the sound of running water and the root actually grows toward that. And so the plants are, while much simpler than human processing, the plants are running through a significant level of processing to perceive its environment through sound, through moisture, through chemicals. And so there's this kind of just simple decision of which way the roots need to go. And then you can go up one level with this example of the dodder vine, which is a parasitic vine. And if you plant a dodder vine between two plants, one which is more conducive to its thriving than the other, it will move toward the plant that is better suited for its needs. And so the dodder vine is a parasitic plant that needs to wrap itself around another plant in order to survive. One thing that's very interesting about this is scientists have recently discovered that the dodder vine is detecting the light waves that are traveling through the leaves. And so the reason we see green when we look at a leaf is because green is the frequency that is bouncing off of the leaf and the other light waves are traveling through. And so the dodder vine actually has a way to measure the type of light that is coming out on the other side of the leaves and can measure and determine the shape, the distance from the dodder vine and determine which plant it is better suited for and grow in that direction in order to get to that plant. And so if you think about human behavior, it's kind of a few levels more complicated, but it's very similar and it's part of the same category, if you will, of decision making. And of course the brain is a very different system from plants and from roots and these other systems. But when you look at these types of behaviors, it's not impossible to imagine that there might be a felt sense, however basic, however fundamental, of perceiving light waves, of hearing the sound of running water, of course not in our human way, but again in a way that we couldn't imagine but still has a felt experience associated with it. And so, if it's possible that we've been thinking about consciousness the wrong way, that it's not something that arises out of complex processing and it's something more basic, something analogous to gravity where it's more like a field, something that's pervasive, then we can imagine that all types of processing in nature could include some type of felt experience.

### 挑战对意识的直觉

**Narrator**: 第二部分：挑战我们对意识的直觉。什么是直觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Part two: Challenging our intuitions on consciousness. What are intuitions?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: **直觉**仅仅是一种强烈的感觉，认为某事是真的，但它可能准确地反映了世界，也可能不准确。我们有许多由进化塑造的直觉，它们非常有用。如果我们处于危险境地，我们可能会无意识地注意到各种线索，比如门没关严，物品放错了位置，或者我们亲近的人瞳孔是否放大，皮肤是否潮红。这些都可能是某人肾上腺素飙升，即将采取暴力行动的迹象。我们可能不会潜意识地注意到这些元素，我们可能只是留下这种直觉，觉得我们处于不安全的环境中，或者我们不应该信任站在我们旁边的人。这些都是我们一直使用的非常有用的工具，我们用它们来做决策。有研究表明，我们的**直觉**通常比深思熟虑的逻辑推理更能指导我们做出关于搬到哪个公寓、接受哪份工作的决定。但直觉也可能让我们失望，而且它们也一直让我们失望。因此，在科学领域有很多这样的例子，进化没有理由塑造出一种直觉，例如，关于地球是球形的直觉。这与我们的日常生活无关，我们感觉我们生活在一个扁平的地球上。所以，这就是我们的直觉让我们相信的。**爱因斯坦**的**广义相对论**和**狭义相对论**理论为我们提供了对宇宙结构全新的认识，即**时空**是一个可以被扭曲的场，而这种扭曲就是**引力**。所以，引力不再像其他力一样是一种力，它实际上是时空的扭曲。这些都是我们没有直觉的东西。当我们学习它们时，它们帮助我们形成对宇宙真实面貌更真实的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So an intuition is simply the strong feeling that something is true, but it may or may not represent something accurate about the world. And we have many intuitions that were sculpted by evolution that are extremely useful. If we're in a dangerous situation, we can notice all kinds of clues unconsciously that a door was left a jar, that an item is out of place, that someone we're close to who we don't know if their pupils are dilated, if their skin is flushed. These can be signs that someone is adrenalized and about to act violently. We may not notice any of these elements subconsciously, we just might be left with this intuition that we feel like we're in an unsafe situation or that we shouldn't trust the person who's standing next to us. And those are extremely useful tools that we use all the time, we use them in making decisions. There's studies that show that our gut instincts are often better guides to making decisions about which apartment to move into, which job to take, then deliberate logical reasoning. But also intuitions can fail us and they also fail us all the time. And so, in the sciences there are many examples of this where there's just no reason for evolution to have sculpted an intuition, again, for being on an Earth that is a sphere. It's not relevant to our everyday lives and we feel like we're on a flat Earth. And so, that's what our intuition leads us to believe. Einstein's theories of general relativity and special relativity gave us a whole new sense of the structure of the universe that space time is a field that can be warped and that warping is gravity. And so rather than gravity being a force like other forces, what it actually is is a warping of space time. And these are things we do not have intuitions for. And when we learn them, they help us form a truer view of what the universe actually is.

</details>

**Narrator**: 直觉如何影响我们对意识的理解？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: How do intuitions impact our grasp of consciousness?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 对意识的研究在很大程度上，如果不是完全的话，一直被归结为神经科学，这很有道理，因为我们在科学界和大多数现代人都曾假设，世界上有意识的生物，我们所知道的，并且我们能够确认有意识的生物，是那些与我们最相似的。我们是复杂的系统，大脑是我们所知的宇宙中最复杂的系统。因此，我们假设意识以某种方式从这种复杂的处理过程中产生。但是我们发现了一些事情，这些事情实际上颠覆了我们最初的假设。所以，我们基于直觉来理解意识的假设，其中一些我们赖以做出这个假设的直觉已经被现代神经科学推翻，并被证明是**幻觉**。因此，在许多情况下，我们被幻觉所引导。这是一件非常有趣的事情，并且尚未真正深入到更广泛的科学文化中。因此，如果我们想问这个问题，即意识在自然界中是否比我们之前假设的更深层，那么这可能涉及的科学领域，比如生物学，也许是植物行为学，尽管这听起来很疯狂，我们可能会发现植物的复杂行为中存在一些微小的感受体验，甚至更深层，这些其他科学，物理学、植物学和生物学需要更好地了解神经科学以及我们迄今为止对大脑的了解，以便它们能更好地理解某些幻觉可能误导它们的方式。因此，如果他们对意识有直觉，这在不久前还是一个真正禁忌的话题，但对于任何有兴趣以新的、创造性的、不同的方式研究意识，或者以不同的方式思考意识的科学家来说，了解一些支持这种观点的神经科学是很重要的，这可以给许多科学家充分的理由，开始以稍微不同的方式，以更具创造性的方式思考意识。这才是科学中范式转变真正发生的方式。事实是，这在几乎所有方面都是科学过程的巨大组成部分。当我们挑战我们的直觉时，是因为我们面临着与直觉相悖的新证据，这通常是常态，特别是正如我所说，对于这些**范式转变**，对于开创性的理论，它们让我们以一种显著不同的方式看待我们所生活的世界。所以如果你思考所有重大的科学突破，所有重大的范式转变，比如理解地球是球形的，而不是像我们直觉最初让我们相信的那样是扁平的。人们忘记了这一发现是多么反直觉，它是基于天体观测做出的，这就是科学的工作方式。所以我们得到了证据，表明它不是我们感觉或认为的那样，然后有一段时间我们与我们的直觉搏斗。这是科学过程的重要组成部分，因为我们的直觉通常是非常好的指导。所以我们不断检查，看看这些新信息是否真的准确，这是好事。然后当科学证据压倒一切时，我们就会进入一个转变直觉的过程，开始感觉到我们生活在一个绕太阳公转的球形太阳系中，而不是反过来。它开始改变我们对世界的感受方式，它改变了我们对日常经验的概念。但当然，它也塑造了未来的科学。所以，还有其他例子，比如发现微观世界和**疾病细菌理论**，理解我们没有直觉的微观事物，我们无法以任何方式触摸、品尝、感觉或体验它们，但我们现在发现它们是真实的，它们会导致疾病，它们可以杀死你。这在证据开始出现时，对人们来说再次是高度反直觉的，并且长期受到抵制，然后有一个转变直觉、接受新证据和新数据的时期，最终形成对我们所生活的世界全新的看法。所以我认为我们现在正处于意识研究的这样一个时刻。所以我认为现代神经科学中发生了很多事情，表明我们对意识的直觉是错误的，它们为我们提供了动摇直觉的工具，并围绕这个问题进行探讨，即驱动我们对意识假设的直觉是否完全准确，以及我们是否需要花更多时间转变直觉和挑战直觉，以便更具创造性地思考，并可能提出一些关于意识可能是什么以及它在自然界中可能深入到何种程度的新理论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So the study of consciousness has largely, if not entirely been relegated to neuroscience, which makes a lot of sense because we have assumed in the sciences and most modern people have assumed that the organisms in the world that are conscious, that we are aware of, and that we can kind of confirm are conscious are the ones that are most like us. And we are complex systems, the brain is the most complex system in the universe that we know of. And so we assume that consciousness arises somehow out of that complex processing. But we have discovered a few things that have actually flipped upside down the assumptions that we began with. So our assumption that we understand what consciousness is based on our intuitions, some of these intuitions that we're relying on to make that assumption have been overturned by modern neuroscience and have been shown to be illusions. And so in many cases, we're being led by illusions. And this is something that's very interesting and that has not yet really sunk into the larger scientific culture. And so, if we want to ask this question about whether consciousness goes deeper in nature than we have previously assumed, the sciences that this will pertain to to biology perhaps, perhaps plant behavior, even though that sounds crazy, we may find that there are some minimal felt experiences in the complex behavior of plants, or even deeper, these other sciences, the science of physics and botany and biology need to be better informed of the neuroscience and what we've learned about the brain so far so that they can have a better grasp of the way certain illusions might be misleading them. And so that if they have intuitions about consciousness, this is something that was really taboo to think about or talk about not that long ago, but it's useful for any scientist who is interested in studying consciousness in a new and creative and different way or thinking about consciousness in a different way, it's important for them to be aware of some of the neuroscience that helps support that view and that can give many scientists good reason to start thinking a little bit differently about consciousness, a little more creatively about consciousness. And this is really how paradigm shifts happen in science. And the truth is this is a huge part of the scientific process in almost every regard. When we challenge our intuitions, because we're facing new evidence that is counterintuitive, which is most often the case, especially, as I said, for these paradigm shifts, for groundbreaking theories, they get us to see the world that we live in in a significantly different way. So if you think about all of the major scientific breakthroughs, all of the major paradigm shifts, so understanding that the Earth is a sphere and not flat as our intuitions originally led us to believe. People forget how counterintuitive this discovery was and it was made based on celestial observations and this is kind of, this is how science works. So we get this evidence that it's not the way we felt it was or the way we thought it was, and then there's a period of time where we're wrestling with our intuitions. And this is an important part of the scientific process because our intuitions are often very good guides. And so it's good that we keep checking to see, is this new information actually accurate? And then when the scientific evidence is overwhelming, we're then in a process of shifting our intuitions, of starting to feel that we live on a sphere in a solar system orbiting the sun rather than the other way around. And it starts to shift the way we feel in the world, it shifts our concepts of our everyday experience. But then of course it also then shapes the science that is to come. So, and there are other examples of this, discovering the microscopic world and the germ theory of disease, understanding that microscopic things that we have no intuition for, we can't touch or taste or feel or experience them in any way, but we've now discovered they're real and they cause disease and they can kill you. This was, again, highly counterintuitive to people when the evidence started to arrive and it was resisted for a long time, and there's this period of shifting intuitions and accepting new evidence and new data and then eventually forming an entirely new view of the world that we live in. And so I think we're at a point like that in consciousness studies right now. And so I think there's a lot that's happened in modern neuroscience that suggests that our intuitions about consciousness are wrong and they give us tools for shaking our intuitions and playing around with this question of whether are the intuitions that have driven our assumptions about consciousness, whether they're not entirely accurate, and whether we need to spend more time shifting intuitions and challenging intuitions in order to think more creatively and maybe come up with some new theories about what consciousness might be and how far down in nature it might go.

**Annaka Harris**: 所以，当我们试图更清晰、更有创造性地思考意识时，为了开始挑战一些可能是幻觉或我们已知是幻觉的直觉，我总是喜欢从这两个问题开始，我认为这两个问题真正触及了这些直觉误导我们的核心。第一，我们能否从一个生物体或一个系统之外找到任何证据，能够确凿地告诉我们该生物体包含意识体验？我们能否指出任何东西，能够明确地说，是的，那个生物体是有意识的？第二个问题与之相关且相似，但它从一个稍微不同的角度来审视这种直觉。第二个问题是，意识在做什么？它是否具有某种功能？它是否像我们感觉的那样驱动着我们的行为？我们对这两个问题的直觉回答都是响亮的“是”。我想如果我去机场接我多年未见的朋友，我看到她兴奋地朝我跑来，所有这些对我来说似乎都是确凿的证据，表明她当然是有意识的。至于第二个问题，显然我们的意识体验正在影响事物。似乎即使为了决定早餐吃什么，我也必须咨询我的意识欲望，而且是我想要什么的感觉驱动了决策。所以我们对这两个问题的直觉回答都是响亮的“是”，但令人惊讶的是，要刺破或动摇这些直觉比你想象的要容易。

**Annaka Harris**: So when we're trying to think more clearly and more creatively about consciousness, in order to start to challenge some of these intuitions that could be illusions or ones that we know to be illusions, I always like to start with these two questions and there are two questions that I think really get at the heart of where these intuitions are misleading us. Number one, is there any evidence we can find from outside an organism or outside a system that will conclusively tell us that that organism entails conscious experiences? Is there anything we can point to where we can definitively say, yes, that organism is conscious? And the second question is related and similar, but it comes at this intuition from a slightly different angle. And the second question is, is consciousness doing something? Does it serve a function? Is it driving our behavior in the way that we feel it is? And our intuitive answer to both of these questions is a resounding yes. I think if I go to pick up my friend at the airport who I haven't seen in years and I see her running toward me looking excited, those all seem like conclusive evidence to me that consciousness is, that she's conscious of course. And regarding the second question is that obviously of course our conscious experiences are affecting things. It seems that even in order to decide what I want for breakfast, I have to consult my conscious desires and that it's the feeling of what I want that then drives the decision. So our intuitive answer to both of these questions is a resounding yes, but surprisingly it's easier to puncture these intuitions or to shake them up than you might think.

**Narrator**: 意识可以在没有物理迹象的情况下存在吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Can consciousness exist without physical signs?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 需要指出的一点是，我们知道，当存在完整的人类意识体验时，一个系统可能没有任何行为表现，从外部也检测不到任何东西。这已经开始改变我们的直觉了，这可以在两种情况下看到。一种是**闭锁综合征**（*locked-in syndrome*），另一种是**麻醉意识**（*anesthesia awareness*）。它们在意识方面本质上是相同的状态。所以，**闭锁综合征**是由于中风或身体损伤导致大脑受伤的人所发生的情况，他们完全瘫痪，无法移动身体的任何部位，但他们仍然拥有完整的意识体验。他们能看、能听、能思考。有一个关于**闭锁综合征**患者的有趣而著名的例子。他是法国《**ELLE**》杂志的作家，名叫**Jean-Dominique Bauby**，他处于这种状态，尽管他很幸运，他有一个可以移动的点，他能够移动他的左眼睑。他的看护人不知何故注意到他似乎在尝试移动他的左眼睑。随着时间的推移，他们开发了一种技术，让他通过特定的眨眼模式拼写单词。他最终写了一本优美的回忆录，题为《**潜水钟与蝴蝶**》（*The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly*）。这是一个很好的例子，说明一个人、一个生物体、一个自然系统，拥有如此完整的意识体验，就像我现在一样完整，能够写作和体验世界，但却无法移动或交流，也无法表现出任何能告诉我们这个人有意识的行为。所以我们可以想知道，自然界中是否可能存在其他系统，它们只是无法交流或表现出能让我们相信它们存在意识的行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: One thing that's important to point out is that we know it's possible for there to be no behavior coming out of a system, nothing to detect from the outside when there's a full human conscious experience present. So already this starts to shift our intuitions and this can be seen in two conditions. One is called locked-in syndrome and the other is anesthesia awareness. And they're essentially the same state relative to consciousness. So locked-in syndrome is something that happens to someone whose brain has become injured due to a stroke or physical injury and they have become completely paralyzed so they can no longer move any part of their body, yet they still have a full conscious experience. They can see, they can hear, they can think. And there's an interesting and famous example of someone with locked-in syndrome. He was a writer for French "Elle," his name was Jean-Dominique Bauby and he was in this state, although he was lucky, he had one point of mobility, he was able to move his left eyelid and somehow his caretakers were able to notice that he seemed to be trying to move his left eyelid. And over time they developed this technique for him spelling out words with certain patterns of blinks. And he ended up writing a beautiful memoir titled "The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly." It's a great example of a person, an organism, a system in nature that is having such a full conscious experience, as full as I am having right now with the ability to write and experience the world, but with no ability to move or communicate or exhibit any behavior that would tell us that this person is conscious. And so we can wonder if it's possible that there are other systems in nature that simply aren't able to communicate or exhibit behavior that convinces us that consciousness is present in them.

</details>

**Narrator**: 意识对行为是必需的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Is consciousness necessary for behavior?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 那么第二个问题是，意识是否在我们行为的背后，是否驱动着我们的行为，是否具有因果关系。这里我们可以用**恐惧**的例子。恐惧反应是我们强烈直觉认为有用且为某种目的而进化的东西。我们想象，如果我们在野外遇到熊或狮子，恐惧的感觉会让我们迅速躲开，迅速行动，以保住性命。但我们现在对大脑的理解是，感受恐惧的体验实际上发生在处理序列的末端，我们的身体对危险情况的反应和移动速度远快于我们意识到它。因此，我们对这类情绪的意识体验实际上滞后于物理世界。所以，绑定过程接收我们所有的感知，所有通过眼睛、耳朵、触觉进入的信息，并给我们一个当下时刻的体验。我经常举弹钢琴的例子。当你按下琴键时，你会同时感觉到琴键下沉，同时看到琴键下沉，同时听到音调，而实际上所有这些信号在世界中以不同的速度移动，它们到达大脑所需的时间不同，它们各自被大脑处理所需的时间也不同。所以大脑所做的就是将所有这些信号编织在一起。而你的意识体验就是所有这些事情在同一时刻发生，而实际上它们发生在不同的时间。因此，那些认为意识驱动着那种行为的直觉，我们现在知道是不正确的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So the second question is whether consciousness is behind our behavior, is driving our behavior, is causal. And here we can use the example of fear. So the fear response is something that we really have a strong intuition is something that is useful and evolved for a purpose. We imagine that if we encounter a bear or a lion in the wild, that the feeling of fear is the thing that gets us to move so quickly out of the way, to act quickly, to save our lives. But what we now understand about the brain is that the experience of feeling fear is actually something that happens at the tail end of a sequence of processing and that our bodies begin responding and moving to a dangerous situation much more quickly than we become aware of it. And so our conscious experience of those types of emotions actually lag behind the physical world. So binding processes take in all of our perceptions, all of the information that comes in through our eyes and ears through touch, and give us an experience of a present moment. So I often give the example of playing the piano. So if you press down on a piano key, you'll have the experience of feeling the key move down, at the same moment that you see the key move down, and in the same moment that you hear the tone, when in actuality all of these signals actually move through the world at different rates, they take different amounts of time to get to your brain, they each take different amounts of time to be processed by the brain. And so what the brain does then is weave all of these signals together. And what your conscious experience is is of all of these things happening in the same moment when in actuality they're happening at different times. And so those intuitions that consciousness is driving that type of behavior, we now know to be incorrect.

**Narrator**: 如果我们对意识的理解有误，会揭示出什么？

**Narrator**: What might be revealed if we're wrong about consciousness?

**Annaka Harris**: 因此，如果那些引导我们假设意识产生于复杂处理过程，即大脑中的处理过程的直觉误导了我们，那么我们真正只有两个起点选择。当我们审视宇宙中所有的生物体和结构，并问自己这些物质集合中哪些包含意识体验或产生意识体验时，从最基本的意义上说，因为我们还不知道，从最基本的意义上说，答案必须是“全部”或“部分”。我们知道答案不是“无”，因为我们有自己意识体验的证据，我们知道它们至少在时空中的某一点产生。所以科学界迄今为止一直假设答案是“部分”，而且它们很可能只在与我们非常相似的系统，并且很可能只在有大脑的系统中产生。我很高兴我们确实从这个假设开始，这对我来说也一直是我的假设。我认为鉴于我们迄今为止所掌握的知识，这是最富有成效的前进道路。但是鉴于我们现在知道其中一些直觉正在误导我们，如果我们从另一个假设开始，即所有这些系统都有意识，意识是基础性的，那意味着什么？我们会问什么样的问题？我们又如何才能科学地研究这样的事物呢？所以，有几个问题浮现在我脑海中，它们将是非常有趣的研究方向。一个问题是，哪些类型的系统会遭受痛苦？这是我们想知道的。在伦理方面，这是我们显然非常关心的事情，不仅在人与人之间，而且正如我们已经了解到其他动物也有意识一样，将我们的伦理直觉扩展到它们身上也很重要。我们现在知道，当狗因疼痛而哭叫时，它们感受到的与我们感受到的非常相似。所以了解其他类型的系统可能经历疼痛或痛苦会很有趣。我认为另一个有趣的研究途径是，是否有可能分享意识体验，以及我们是否能通过这种方式了解更多关于宇宙的信息？所以，在某个难以想象的未来科学中，如果有一种方法可以编码另一个系统的记忆并将其植入我的大脑，使其成为我记忆流的一部分，我就可以拥有作为另一个系统的记忆，也许是一个我们想了解更多或知道更多的系统。我经常想，如果科学家能够分享他们的直觉，他们那些非常有洞察力的直觉，那将是多么有影响力。如果你想想**阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦**，他拥有其他人类所没有的**时空**直觉，他花了十多年时间才通过数学和语言解释这种直觉，并能够将他所谈论的内容传达给其他科学家，更不用说开始用它取得科学进展了。从他产生直觉的那一刻到他能够分享它，过去了许多年。我经常想，未来是否存在某种科学，你也许能够真正分享那种直觉？所以我称这种潜在的未来科学为“**体验科学**”，我认为这是我们可能走向的一个方向，无论现在听起来多么疯狂，如果我们发现或有充分的理由相信意识实际上比我们想象的更普遍。所以，就像其他**范式转变**一样，如果我们能够证明意识确实在自然界中更深层，人类很难想象未来会是什么样子，但毫无疑问，它将改变我们对世界的感受方式。最近我在做植物研究时，我在一条远足小径上慢跑，我实际上为自己做了一个小小的思想实验，想象小径上的所有植物都不是植物，而是生物，是小昆虫和小动物。我这样做只是为了看看我是否能改变我对什么可能包含意识体验的直觉。所以我在慢跑时，本质上是想象植物不存在，但我看到的所有这些植物都是某种生物，感受着世界，在世界中移动。而这个小小的练习让我感受到，如果我们理解我们周围有比我们意识到的更多有意识的系统，我们对世界的感受会多么不同。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: So if the intuitions that led us to assume that consciousness arises out of complex processing, namely in brains are misleading us, we really have only two options for a starting place. So when we look out at all of the organisms and structures in the universe and we ask ourselves which of these collections of matter contain conscious experiences or give rise to conscious experiences, in the most basic sense because we don't yet know, in the most basic sense the answer has to be all or some. We know the answer isn't none because we have evidence of our own conscious experiences, we know they arise at least one point in space and time. And so the sciences have assumed so far that the answer is some and that it's very likely that they only arise in systems that are very similar to ours and very likely only in systems with brains. And I'm very glad that we did start with that assumption and it's always been my assumption as well. I think it was the most fruitful path forward, given the knowledge that we have so far. But given the fact that some of these intuitions we now know are misleading us, if we start with this other assumption that all of these systems are conscious, that consciousness is fundamental, what would that mean? And what kinds of questions would we ask and how could we even study something like this scientifically? So there are a few questions that come to mind for me that would be so interesting to move forward with. One is, which types of systems entail suffering? That's something we would wanna know. In terms of ethics, this is something we obviously care a lot about between human beings and also as we have learned that other animals are conscious, it's important for us to extend our ethical intuitions toward them. We know now that when dogs cry out in pain, they're feeling something very similar to what we feel. And so it'd be interesting to learn what other types of systems might experience pain or suffering. I think another interesting avenue of research is would it be possible to share conscious experiences and would we be able to learn more about the universe that way? So in some future science that is very hard to imagine, if there would be some way to encode a memory of another system and place it in my brain so that it becomes part of my stream of memory, I could have a memory of being another system and maybe a system that we want to learn more about or know more about. I've often thought how impactful it would be if scientists could share their intuitions, their very insightful intuitions. If you think about Albert Einstein and the fact that he had intuitions for space time that no other human being had, and it took him more than a decade to explain this intuition through mathematics and language and to be able to communicate what he was talking about to other scientists, let alone start to make scientific progress with it. From the moment he had that intuition to the moment he was able to share it was many, many years. And I often wonder, is there some future science where you might be able to actually share that intuition? And so I call this potential future science, experiential science, and I think it's one of the places we might go, however crazy it sounds now, if we discover or have good enough reason to believe that consciousness is actually much more pervasive than we thought it was. So like other paradigm shifts, if we could prove that consciousness does in fact run deeper in nature, it's hard to imagine, human beings have a hard time imagining what the future will look like, but no doubt it will change the way we feel in the world. Recently when I was doing plant research, I went for a jog on this hiking trail and I actually ran this little thought experiment for myself imagining that all the plants along the trail were not plants but were creatures, so were small insects and small animals. And I was just doing this to see if I could change my intuition about what might entail conscious experiences. And so I was going on this jog essentially imagining that plants don't exist, but that all these plants I was seeing were some type of creature feeling the world, moving through the world. And just that little exercise gave me a sense of how different we might feel in the world if we understood that there were many more conscious systems around us than we realized.

### 揭示自我幻觉

**Narrator**: 第三部分：揭穿**自我幻觉**。什么是**自我幻觉**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Part three: Debunking the illusion of self. What is the illusion of self?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 人们常认为**幻觉**是为了其有用性而进化的，但事实是，我们经历的大多数幻觉实际上都是故障。它们是大脑运作的方式，以便我们能够准确地驾驭我们所生活的世界。所以，当我谈论**自我幻觉**时，这通常让人们很难理解那到底意味着什么。我显然是这边的一个人，你是那边的一个人，我们总是谈论自己，我们做什么，我们如何度过我们的日子，我们的历史和我们的未来。所以，我首先想非常清楚地说明，当我谈论**自我幻觉**时，我不是在谈论什么。我刚才提到的所有这些事情显然都可以被称为一个自我，我们可以谈论我们的自传历史，我们可以谈论我们倾向于做的事情，我们的喜好和厌恶，所有这些都在对自我的描述中，这完全合理，而这部分并不是幻觉。所以我们可以像谈论猫是自然界中的另一种生物一样谈论我们自己，或者我们可以将波浪标记为自然界中的一个系统。事实是，作为自我的体验实际上更类似于**海浪**，而不是自然界中像**岩石**那样静态的东西。所以这开始触及我谈论**自我幻觉**时所指的含义。因此，就像海浪是自然界中的一个过程一样，它是动态的，不断变化的，即使我们可以称它为波浪，我们可以谈它波浪的各种行为，我们都明白波浪在自然界中不是一个静态的东西，它是一个过程。我们的大脑也是如此，它们是自然界中不断变化、不断进化的过程。所以我们所有的体验都跨越时间发生，并不断产生，以至于如果我失去意识，或者我的大脑发生了一些事情，我的体验会立即改变。事实是，我们的体验每时每刻都在变化，我们实际上也每时每刻都在与外部世界对话。所以，我们是一个坚实的实体，一个不变的实体，存在于我们身体的某个地方，并拥有我们的身体，甚至拥有我们的大脑，而不是与我们的大脑完全相同（我们知道事实如此），这就是幻觉所在。这种幻觉在许多不同层面上混淆了我们对自己在自然界中的位置和现实状态的认识。所以在一个层面上，它使我们看不清我们与外部世界不断交流的事实，以及我们与世界之间、我们彼此之间的界限并不像它们看起来或感觉到的那样坚实和牢固，特别是当我们感觉自己是一个静态的自我时。我常常希望这些连接能以视觉方式呈现给我们。我想如果我们真的能看到某些事物，我们就能更好地理解我们如何在世界中存在。所以如果你能看到声波从我的嘴巴传到你的耳膜，以及它对你的耳膜产生的影响，然后是你大脑中随后的处理，以及这让你感觉如何。如果我们能看到空气分子进出我的嘴巴，如果你在一个满是人的房间里，你能看到房间里每个人都在共享空气和微生物，我们相互连接以及我们融入自然的方式有如此多的层面，这将给我们一种直观的感觉，即我们实际上并非被嵌入自然，而是我们就是自然，我们是这个我们称之为宇宙的一部分。我们没有与它分离。所以，有很多理由说明注意到这种幻觉是有用的。有一些心理上的原因，人类更了解我们是自然界中不断与外部世界交流和互动的过程（无论是通过空气、水、食物、化学物质，还是通过彼此的思想）有心理上的益处。如果现在有人走进工作室说：“我们都必须离开这里，着火了！”仅仅是这些词语，仅仅是声波撞击我的耳膜，然后是我大脑中随后的处理，我的身体就会立即发生生理变化，仅仅听到这些词语，甚至在我有意识地处理他们所说的话之前，我可能就已经从椅子上站起来了，甚至还没有真正处理这些词语的完整含义。所以，理解这种**自我幻觉**在某种程度上具有心理益处，因为**自我幻觉**常常导致我们感到与世界分离，与彼此分离，感到非常孤立。它对于思考意识也很有用，因为我们的直觉告诉我们，这种坚实的自我感觉等同于意识本身。而这无疑是一个误导我们的幻觉。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Annaka Harris**: People often think that illusions are evolved for their usefulness, but the truth is that most illusions that we experience are actually glitches. They're ways the brain works so that we can accurately navigate the world we live in. So when I talk about the illusion of self, this is often very hard for people to grasp what that could even mean. I'm obviously a person over here and you're a person over there and we talk about ourselves all the time and what we do and how we spend our days and our histories and our futures. And so I first like to just be very clear about what I'm not talking about when I talk about the illusion of self. And all of those things that I just included are obviously things we can call a self, we can talk about our autobiographical histories, we can talk about things we tend to do, our likes and dislikes, and all of that is in the description of a self, and that makes perfect sense and that piece of it is not an illusion. And so we can talk about ourselves in the same way that we can talk about a cat as another organism in nature, or we can label a wave as a system in nature. And the truth is that the experience of being a self is actually much more analogous to an ocean wave than to something static in nature like a rock. And so this starts to get at what I am talking about when I talk about the illusion of self. And so in the same way that an ocean wave is a process in nature, it's dynamic, it's ever changing, even though we can label it a wave and we can call it a wave and talk about the types of things waves do, we all understand that a wave is not a static thing in nature, it's a process. And our brains are very much the same thing, they are processes in nature that are ever changing, ever evolving. And so all of our experiences take place across time and are continually arising so that if I became unconscious or if something happened to my brain, immediately my experiences would change. And the truth is that our experiences are changing all the time in every moment and we're in fact in dialogue with the external world in every moment too. So the sense that we are a solid entity, an unchanging entity that exists someplace in our body and takes ownership of our body and even ownership of our brain rather than being identical to our brain, which we know to be the case, that is where the illusion lies. And this illusion confuses us about our place in nature and the state of reality on many different levels. And so on one level it blinds us to the fact that we are in constant communication with the external world and that the boundaries between ourselves and the world and ourselves and each other are not as solid and firm as they appear to us or that they feel to us to be, especially when we feel like a static self. And I often wish that these connections were made visual to us. I think we'd have a better sense of how we exist in the world if we could actually see certain things. So if you could see the sound waves moving from my mouth to your eardrum and the effect that was having on your eardrum and then the subsequent processing in your brain and how that was making you feel. If we could see the air molecules going in and out of my mouth, if when you're in a room full of people, you could see the air being shared by everyone in the room and the microorganisms, and there's so many levels to our interconnection into the ways that we're embedded in nature that would give us a visceral sense that we aren't actually embedded in nature, but we are nature, we are a part of this thing we call the universe. We're not separate from it. And so there are many reasons why it's useful to notice this illusion. There's some psychological reasons, there's psychological benefits to human beings being more in touch with the way in which we are processes in nature constantly communicating and interacting with the outside world, whether that's through air, water, food, chemicals, or whether that's through ideas with each other. If someone came into the studio right now and said, "We all have to get out of here, there's a fire," just those words, just the sound waves against my eardrum and then the subsequent processing in my brain, there would be an instantaneous physiological change in my body just hearing those words, likely even before I consciously process what they were saying, I would probably be moving out of my chair before I even really processed the whole meaning of what those words meant. And so there's a way in which there's a psychological benefit to understanding this illusion of self because the illusion of self often contributes to our feelings separate from the world, separate from each other, feeling very isolated. And it's also useful for thinking about consciousness because our intuitions tell us that this feeling of being a solid self is equivalent to consciousness itself. And this is certainly an illusion that's misleading us.

**Narrator**: What brain processes create the illusion of self?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 神经科学仍处于起步阶段，但我们正在越来越多地了解这种**自我幻觉**是如何产生的。神经科学家**Anil Seth**写了一本书叫《**成为你**》（*Being You*），它对这种自我体验是如何产生的给出了精彩而详尽的描述。其中一部分与一种叫做“**变化盲视**”（*change blindness*）的现象有关，我们在视觉中知道这一点，我们的视野中有一个盲点，我们没有意识到，也没有检测到。神经科学家现在才开始理解，我们的经验会随着时间发生**变化盲视**，以至于我们没有注意到我们每时每刻的每个体验与其他体验有多么不同。这增加了我们是一个穿越时间不变的坚实实体的幻觉。我们还在更多地了解神经科学家所说的**默认模式网络**（*Default Mode Network*）。我们知道，当**默认模式网络**活跃时，我们高度意识到这种**自我幻觉**，而当人们体验到所谓的“**心流状态**”（*flow state*）时，它往往会安静下来。所以当我们非常投入工作时，或者非常投入某项运动时，我们就不那么意识到自我与他人或自我与世界的区别。我们还通过一些使用**fMRI**（功能性磁共振成像）机器的研究了解到，当人们使用各种冥想技术来使**默认模式网络**安静下来时，他们报告说感觉与宇宙更加融为一体。他们报告说不再感觉自己是一个自我，不再感觉自己与世界其他部分之间的界限。当人们受到某些**迷幻物质**影响时，也会发生这种情况。在**fMRI**机器中，我们可以看到**默认模式网络**已经安静下来，人们报告了非常相似的体验。所以当**默认模式网络**安静下来，人们放弃了作为坚实自我的体验时，这种体验实际上更符合我们所知的潜在现实，即一个不断波动的过程，它产生了我们所经历的每一个新的当下时刻，并且更类似于自然界中的**海浪**现象，而不是一个静态的事物。我们还知道，**记忆**在创造这种自我体验中也起着作用。从某种意义上说，我们随着时间能够访问的所有记忆都是由同一个主体，同一个自我所经历的。你可以想象，如果你的记忆没有串联起来，你的体验只是每一个当下时刻，那么你对一个穿越时间的自我的感觉就会少得多。在像冥想这样的练习中也会发生类似的事情，人们专注于当下时刻产生的体验，一个接一个，而不会迷失在对未来或过去的思考中。我们现在也从对冥想者的研究中得知，当一个人处于专注的冥想状态，试图保持专注于当下时刻时，这也会使**默认模式网络**安静下来，人们经常报告说放弃了这种**自我幻觉**。

**Annaka Harris**: So the neuroscience is really still in its infancy, but we're starting to learn more and more about how this illusion of self gets created. The neuroscientist Anil Seth wrote a book called "Being You," which gives a wonderful and thorough description of how this experience of self gets created. Part of it has to do with something called change blindness, which we know about in vision, we have a blind spot in our visual field that we are not conscious of, that we don't detect. And neuroscientists are just now starting to understand that there is a change blindness with respect to our experience over time so that we don't notice how different each of our experiences in every moment are from every other. And so that adds to this illusion of being a solid entity that moves through time unchanged. We're also learning a little bit more about what neuroscientists refer to as the Default Mode Network. So we know that when the Default Mode Network is active, we are highly aware of this illusion of self and it tends to quiet down when we're experiencing what people talk about as a flow state. So when we're very immersed in our work, if we're very immersed in a sport. When we are not so aware of self versus other or self versus world. We also know through some studies using fMRI, functional MRI machines, when people are using various meditation techniques that quiet down the Default Mode Network, they report experiences of feeling more at one with the universe. They report experiences of no longer feeling like a self, no longer feeling the boundary between themselves and the rest of the world. This is also something that happens when people are under the influence of some psychedelic substances. In an fMRI machine we can see that the Default Mode Network has quieted down and people report very similar experiences. So this experience that people have when the Default Mode Network is quieted down and they've dropped this experience of being a solid self is actually much more in line with what we know the underlying reality to be, which is an endlessly fluctuating process that gives rise to each new present moment we experience and is much more analogous to an ocean wave as a phenomenon in nature rather than a static thing. And we also know that memory plays a role in creating this experience of self as well. There's a sense in which all of the memories that we have access to over time were being experienced by the same subject, by the same self. And you can imagine if your memories weren't strung together and your experience was just of each present moment, there'd be much less of a sense of a self moving through time. And something similar happens in a practice like meditation where one is focusing on experiences arising in the present moment, one after the other without getting lost in thoughts about the future or thoughts about the past. And we now know also from studies of meditators that have been put in fMRI machines that when someone is in a concentrated state of meditation attempting to stay focused on the present moment, this also quiets the default mode network and people regularly report dropping this illusion of self.

**Annaka Harris**: 所以有些人觉得自我是一种幻觉这个想法有点令人不安或困惑，我完全理解，但事实是，确实有一种积极的方式来看待它。更多地感受到我们的相互关联性是其中一种可以以非常积极的方式来构建，并能给人带来真正的幸福感。另一件需要记住的事情是，意识到幻觉肯定有其不同程度的用处。我喜欢举的一个例子是地球是球形的。我们或多或少地带着地球是扁平的幻觉生活，我们表现得好像地球是扁平的，这是我们日常生活中最好的方式。如果我们不断提醒自己地球是球形的，并且必须记住这一点，并且无论走到哪里都必须有这种感觉，那只会是一种恼人的干扰，会妨碍各种活动，并且没有帮助。**自我幻觉**也是如此。在我们的日常生活中，在大多数日常活动中，试图记住这种体验是一种幻觉，这真的只是一种干扰，完全没有必要。但如果我们想更清晰地思考意识，它就非常有用。特别是当我们通过科学研究意识时，这是一个需要牢记的重要幻觉。如果我们试图更多地接触事物的相互关联性，或者如果我们正在练习冥想之类的东西，意识到这种幻觉就非常有用了。

And feeling more in touch with our interconnectedness is one way that it can be framed in a very positive sense and that give people a true sense of wellbeing. And the other thing to keep in mind is that there are certainly levels of usefulness for being aware of illusions. So one example I like to give is that the Earth is a sphere. We more or less walk around with the illusion that the Earth is flat and we act as though the earth is flat, and that's the best way to go about our everyday lives. If we constantly reminded ourselves that the Earth is a sphere and had to keep that in mind and had to feel that way everywhere we went, it would just be an annoying distraction and would get in the way of all kinds of activities and would not be helpful. And the same is true of the illusion of self. Throughout our day in most of our daily activities, trying to remember that this experience is an illusion, is really just a distraction and completely unnecessary. But if we wanna think more clearly about consciousness, it's very useful. And especially when we're studying consciousness through science, this is an important illusion to keep in mind. And if we're trying to be more in touch with the interconnected nature of things or if we're practicing something like meditation, it's extremely useful to be aware of this illusion.

### 自由意志的幻觉

**Narrator**: 第四部分：**自由意志**的幻觉。您如何定义**自由意志**？

**Narrator**: Part four: The illusion of free will. How do you define free will?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 我认为**自由意志**在很大程度上是一种幻觉。但当我谈论**自由意志**时，我喜欢区分**意识意志**和**自由意志**，因为幻觉实际上包含在“意识就是意志”这种感觉中。所以我用**自由意志**这个词来指代自然界中的决策过程，这些过程显然存在，我很乐意称之为**自由意志**，尽管最终我不确定这些过程有多自由。但人类在非常复杂的层面上体验这种决策过程。你也可以在自然界中看到这种过程的更简单版本。例如，如果你观察**豌豆卷须**，当它感觉到附近有可以缠绕的树枝时，它会开始更快地朝那个方向生长，然后改变生长方式，使其缠绕在树枝上。这个过程中存在一种非常简单的决策形式。**豌豆卷须**需要感知附近的树枝，它还需要在光照下才能进行这个过程。所以在这个时刻有很多元素，**豌豆卷须**决定朝某个方向移动，开始更快地生长并开始盘绕。我们大多数人不会认为那是一个自由的决策过程。它是一个在自然界中发生的因果过程。当你从大脑的复杂性上升到人类大脑的层面时，涉及的因素如此之多，以至于我们不可能全部追踪。所以大脑在任何给定时刻的状态，与外部世界的互动，大脑所拥有的一系列信念，这个清单可以一直列下去。如果你谈论一个复杂的决定，比如是否拿起一杯水，是否改变你在椅子上的姿势，或者一个更复杂的关于你得到的工作机会，你正在努力决定是否接受它。在这个自然过程中有如此多的元素正在发生，以至于不可能追踪，但它是一个过程，它是大脑与外部世界互动并测量不同可能未来的不同结果，然后最终做出决策的过程。我认为我们可以将这称为**自由意志**，这也是许多人所指的**自由意志**。标题中带有“自由”的问题在于，它不像我们感觉的那样自由。这就是幻觉的来源。所以我们从这种**自我幻觉**开始，认为自己是一个坚实的具体实体，存在于头部的某个地方。即使我们知道得更清楚，它仍然感觉自己与物理世界是分离的，并且这个自我可以突然介入并改变历史进程，或者以某种方式做出不受我们所嵌入的物理世界束缚的决定。我认为这显然是一种幻觉。我称之为**意识意志**，因为这种感觉就是我的意识体验是这个自我，并且拥有这种自由。

**Annaka Harris**: So I think that free will for the most part is an illusion. But when I talk about free will, I like to distinguish between conscious will and free will because the illusion is really contained in this feeling that it's the consciousness that is the will. So I use the term free will to talk about decision-making processes in nature, which there clearly are and I'm happy to call that free will, although in the end I'm not sure how free those processes are. But there's this decision-making process that humans experience at a very complex level. But you can see simpler versions of this in nature as well. So if you look at something like a pea tendril, when it senses that it's close to a branch that it can wrap itself around, it starts growing more quickly in that direction and then it changes the growth so that it wraps itself around a branch. There is a very simple form of decision-making that goes into that process. The pea tendril needs to sense the branch nearby, it also needs to be in the light for this process to take place. So there are many elements to this moment where the pea tendril decides to move in a certain direction to start growing more quickly and to start coiling. Most of us wouldn't consider that to be a free decision-making process. It's a cause and effect process that occurs in nature. And as you move up in complexity to the level of brains and then human brains, the number of factors that come into play are so expansive that it would be impossible for us to track them all. So the state of the brain at any given moment, the interaction with the outside world, the set of beliefs that brain has, I mean this list goes on and on and on. And if you're talking about a complex decision, you know, there could be a simple decision whether to pick up a glass of water or not, whether to change your position in your chair or something much more complex about a job you've been offered and you're trying to figure out whether to take it or not. There are so many elements that are taking place in this process in nature that it would be impossible to track, but it is a process and it's a process by which the brain is interacting with the exterior world and measuring the different outcomes of the different possible futures and then ultimately making a decision. This is something that I think we can refer to as free will and that what many people mean by free will. The problem with having free in the title is that it's not free in the way we feel it is. And this is where the illusion comes in. And so we begin with this illusion of self, of being this solid concrete entity that lives somewhere in the head. And even though we know better, feels as though it's separate from the physical world and that this self can kind of swoop in and change the course of history or somehow make decisions that are free of the physical world that we're embedded in. And that I think is clearly an illusion. And I call that conscious will because it is this feeling that my conscious experience is this self and is the thing that has this freedom.

**Narrator**: 如何挑战**自由意志**的幻觉？

**Narrator**: How can the illusion of free will be challenged?

**Annaka Harris**: 2013年进行了一项非常有趣的研究，他们让参与者进入**fMRI**机器，给他们看一个屏幕，屏幕上显示两个数字，他们可以选择将这两个数字相加或相减，同时扫描参与者大脑的活动。这项研究的结果是，根据**MRI**的信息，实验者可以提前四秒钟预测，不仅这个人何时会做出决定，还会预测他们是决定相加还是相减。还有其他类似的研究也很有趣，但在我看来，这些研究实际上并非证明这一点的必要条件。根据我们目前拥有的神经科学知识，我们应该期望得到越来越多这样的结果，但即使没有，如果你密切关注你每时每刻的体验，你不需要是冥想者，但观察心智做出决定，你会直观地感觉到幕后并没有一个自我或**自由意志**在做决定。但在你的意识体验中，一个决定确实会产生。所以你可以做这个简单的练习，给自己一个选择，是移动你的大脚趾还是移动你的食指，在接下来的30秒内决定是移动你的脚趾还是食指。如果你专注于你的意识体验，你会注意到那个决定只是简单地出现在你的意识觉知中。没有一个自我正在决定做出这个决定。

**Annaka Harris**: There was a very interesting study done in 2013 in which they put participants in an fMRI machine and showed them a screen and presented two numbers on that screen and they gave them the option of either adding or subtracting these two numbers and they were scanning the activity of these participants' brains while they were doing this calculation. And the result of this study was that based on the information from the MRI, the experimenters could tell up to four seconds not only when this person was going to make the decision, but whether they decided to add or subtract. So there've been other studies like this that are also interesting, but in my view, these studies aren't actually necessary to prove the point. Based on the neuroscience we currently have, we should expect to get more and more results like this, but even if we didn't, if you pay close attention to your moment-to-moment experience and you don't have to be a meditator, but watching the mind make a decision, you get the sense viscerally that there's no self or free will making decisions behind the scenes. But that in terms of your conscious experience, a decision really arises. And so you can do this simple exercise, just give yourself the option of moving your big toe or moving your pointer finger and, you know, in the next 30 seconds decide to either move your toe or your pointer finger. And if you kind of rest in your conscious experience, you will notice that that decision simply arises in your conscious awareness. There's no self who's deciding to make the decision.

**Narrator**: 认识到**自由意志**的幻觉有益吗？

**Narrator**: Is recognizing the illusion of free will beneficial?

</details>

**Annaka Harris**: 所以，很多人觉得这个认识相当令人不安，这是可以理解的。我认为解决这个问题的一种方法是考虑其有用性的层次。绝大多数时候，认识到某种幻觉正在发生并没有用处或帮助。但在某些地方它是有用的，它显然对科学和神经科学有用，但它在某些情况下在心理上也是有用的。同样，这不是你每时每刻都想提醒自己的事情，但在某些时刻，认识到**意识意志**的体验正在发生，可能会相当解放。这里有几个例子。一个例子是，许多人陷入对自己的心理状态负责的感觉中。而以某种方式，仅仅是与你正在经历的任何不舒服的情绪（无论是悲伤、沮丧还是愤怒）共处，并意识到这些过程正在发生，与它们共处，而不是相信你在控制它们，这对于心理健康来说可能非常有益。我们也可以将这一点应用于我们与他人的关系中。我有时会谈到你永远不会对龙卷风生气，这并不意味着愤怒在社会和文化中没有立足之地，但有时愤怒会压倒我们，并以一种极其无益和不健康的方式主宰我们的生活。而且，认识到每个人都没有一个坚实的自我，以某种方式是邪恶的或值得责备的，在某些情况下也可能是一种解放。这种认识当然不意味着人们不应该对自己的行为负责，但它实际上可能为处理暴力行为者或造成伤害的人提供更明智的方法。我有时会将其类比为**人工智能**或**自动驾驶汽车**。如果一辆**自动驾驶汽车**意外撞到人，我们会想了解其机制。我们会想了解软件或编程是否出了问题。所以我认为在社会和我们的人际关系中，指责、愤怒和惩罚不一定有用。因此，意识到这一点可能会为更明智的政策制定提供信息。

**Annaka Harris**: So, many people find this realization to be quite disconcerting, which is understandable. And I think one way to address that is levels of usefulness. And the vast majority of the time it is not useful or helpful to realize that there's an illusion of sorts taking place. There are places where it's useful, it's useful obviously for the sciences and for neuroscience, but it actually can also be useful psychologically in certain circumstances. And again, this isn't something you wanna remind yourself of in every moment, but there are moments where realizing that there's an experience of conscious will taking place can be quite liberating. And there are a few examples here. So one is many people get stuck in feeling responsible for their psychological state. And there's a way in which simply being with whatever uncomfortable emotions you're experiencing, whether it's sadness or frustration or anger, and being aware that those processes are playing out and being with them rather than believing that you are controlling them can be extremely beneficial for psychological wellbeing. There are also ways that we can apply this in our relationships with other people. I sometimes talk about the fact that you would never get angry at a tornado and that doesn't mean anger doesn't have a place in society and culture, but there are times when anger can overcome us and start to rule our lives in a way that is incredibly unhelpful and unhealthy. And there isn't a solid self to every person that is somehow evil or worthy of blame can also be liberating to notice in certain circumstances. This realization certainly doesn't mean that people shouldn't be held responsible for their actions, but it might actually inform wiser ways of dealing with people who act violently or people who cause harm. And sometimes I draw the analogy to AI or something like a self-driving car. If a self-driving car hit someone accidentally, we would want to understand the mechanics of that. We would want to understand whether something had gone wrong with the software or the programming. And so I think there are places in society and in our relationships where blame and anger and punishment aren't necessarily useful. And so being aware of this could potentially inform wiser policy-making.
