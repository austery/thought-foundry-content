### 美联储利率政策与劳动力市场

好的，我们直接开始吧。上周我们得到的就业报告，以您作为美联储官员的视角来看，下一次会议是否有可能降息50个**基点**（Basis Point: 金融领域衡量利率或收益率变动的单位，1个基点等于0.01%）？我认为降息50个基点仍然不太可能。在过去几个月里，我们一直认为就业市场疲软。这份最新的报告略显疲软。话虽如此，之所以降息25个基点比50个基点更有可能，是因为就业市场并未“断崖式下跌”。我们没有出现萎缩，而且通胀率仍在2.75%到3%之间运行，高于目标。因此，这给降息超过25个基点带来了一些阻力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's uh just kick it straight off. That jobs report that we got last week, in your view with your Fed hat on, maybe is a is a 50 basis point rate cut in play for the next meeting? I think 50 basis points is still unlikely. I think we've been of of the view for the last few months the job market was weak. This latest report was a little weaker. Having said that, the reason 25 is more likely than 50 is it wasn't the jobs market is not falling off a cliff. We didn't get shrinkage and inflation is running at 2 and 3/4 to 3% above target. And so it sort of puts a little bit of a headwind on doing more than 25 basis points.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我理解您的观点，但这份报告仍然是一个巨大的意外。因此，如果当时您在新闻编辑室，当那个数字——仅增加2.2万个就业岗位——出来时，会有一阵集体惊呼，因为它远低于该月预期的整个范围。如果您在美联储，看到这样的数字，2.2万个就业岗位实际上告诉您什么？或者您会坐在那里想：“嗯，也许我应该等到修正数据出来再真正下决定。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I take your point, but the report was still a huge surprise. So if you were in the newsroom when that number came out, just 22,000 jobs added, there was a sort of collective gasp because it was way below basically the entire range of expectations for that particular month. If you're at the Fed and you see a number like that, what does 22,000 actually tell you? or are you sitting there going, "Well, maybe I'll wait for the revision until I really make up my mind."</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我不认为就业市场的疲软对美联储来说是一个大惊喜。他们不知道具体数字会是多少，但他们预计会是**疲软**的。失业率之所以保持在低位，是因为我们已经停止了**无证移民**，但尚未增加**合法移民**。而且，您很清楚，我们正在驱逐一定数量的工人，并让1000万到1500万在劳动力市场中的无证移民感到寒心，其中一部分人将不再工作。因此，劳动力供应不足。过去几个月我们一直认为招聘速度停滞不前。您应该假设，如果**GDP增长**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一个国家经济活动的指标）率为1.25%到1.5%，那么招聘就会疲软。所以，我们可以争论这个数字，但我不认为它疲软是一个很大的冲击。而且，如果下一个数字也表现**迟缓**，我也不会感到惊讶。那么，为什么我们没有“断崖式下跌”呢？我们仍然有大量赤字。我们有税收优惠即将到来。正如您在上一场会议中听到的，我们正处于**AI数据中心电力热潮**之中。我认为这仍在支撑经济。那么，让我从特蕾西问题的另一面来谈，因为，好吧，也许抛开担忧的原因不谈，另一方面，正如您所提到的，通胀率按大多数衡量标准来看仍高于目标。股市，我实际上不知道它今天表现如何，但无论如何，它非常接近历史高点。各种各样的人都在南加州的沙滩上玩得很开心。目前有什么证据表明美联储的政策实际上是**限制性**的（货币政策：指旨在减缓经济增长和抑制通胀的政策）？显然，**联邦公开市场委员会**（Federal Open Market Committee: 美联储内部负责制定货币政策的机构，简称FOMC）已经接受了降息的观点。降息似乎已成定局，但您不必再持有FOMC的观点了。比如，现在是否明显需要降息？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know that the weakness in the jobs market was a big surprise to the Fed. They didn't know exactly what the number would be, but they expected to be anemic. The the reason uh that the unemployment rate has stayed low is we are not we've shut down undocumented immigration. We have not ramped up legal immigration. And as you well know, we are deporting some number of workers and chilling 10 to 15 million undocumented immigrants who are in the workforce and some percentage of them are not going to work. And so supply is anemic. We've thought for the last few months that hiring was kind of we said at stall speed. You should assume if GDP growth is one and a quarter one and a half% hiring is going to be anemic. So, we could debate the number, but I I don't think it was a big shock that it was weak. And I think it wouldn't surprise me to see the next number also lethargic. Uh so why aren't we falling off a cliff? Uh we still are running a large deficit. We have tax incentives coming. We're in the middle of an AI data center power boom as you just heard about in the previous session. And I think that's still bolstering the economy. Well, then let me take the flip side of Tracy's question because okay, maybe setting aside reasons for concern, the flip side, as you mentioned, inflation still running above target by most measures. The stock market, I haven't actually I don't know what it's doing today, but it's very close to all-time highs regardless of what it's doing today. All kinds of people are having a really nice time on the beach in Southern California. What is the evidence that as currently standing that Fed policy is actually restrictive? Clearly the FOMC has come around to this view of cuts. It seems like cuts are locked in, but you don't have to have the FOMC view anymore. Like is it obvious that cuts are needed at this point?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 是的，我认为如果不是劳动力市场出现我们所见的疲软，美联储会希望保持不变，因为通胀高于目标是一回事。我们并没有朝着通胀目标迈进，对吧？我们正在横盘整理甚至倒退，但考虑到劳动力市场的疲软，我认为这使得降息变得必要。那么，**中性利率**（Neutral Rate: 既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的理论利率水平）是多少呢？我认为今天的中性利率，嗯，您有2.75%的通胀率，75个基点的**实际联邦基金利率**（Real Fed Funds Rate: 联邦基金利率减去通胀率后的实际利率）意味着对我来说中性利率大约是3.5%。我们没有太多降息空间来达到中性，但我认为您有75到100个基点。我认为美联储的目标将是在9月降息，保持限制性，如果劳动力市场保持疲软，就继续降息。如果它稳定下来，那么您就有选择暂停。嗯，我认为他们会这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I think if it were not for the weakness that we've seen in the labor market, the Fed would want to stand, Pat, because we are it's one thing to be above your inflation target. We're not moving toward the inflation target, right? We're going sideways to backing up, but with this weak labor market, I think it brings the fact you need to cut into play. Now, what's the neutral rate? I think the neutral rate today, uh, you got a 2 and 3/4% inflation rate, 75 basis point real Fed funds rate means the neutral rate to me is around 3.5%. We don't have a lot of space to cut to get to neutral, but I think you've got 75 to 100 base points. I think the goal of the Fed will be cut in September, stay restrictive, and if the labor market stays weak, keep going. If it stabilizes, then then you have the option to to hold off. Um, and and I think that's what they'll do.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 嗯，回到**金融状况**和股市处于历史高点的问题。我的意思是，如果美联储在当前关头降息，你知道，称之为“保险性降息”或其他什么，但如果经济在此之后重新加速，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, just going back to financial conditions and stock markets at all-time highs. I mean, if the Fed cuts at this current juncture, you know, call it an insurance cut or whatever, but if the economy reacelerates after that,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 这有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which it may.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 是的。这有可能，您会担心这种结果吗？考虑到正如您所说，通胀压力似乎正在横盘整理，甚至可能上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Which it may, would you be worried about that side of the outcome given that, as you said, inflationary pressures seem to be going sideways to possibly up.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 是的。所以，很多人看待金融状况，并将其视为美联储不应采取行动的理由。我实际上是从不同的角度来看待它的。经济统计数据反映的是现在正在发生的事情。实际上，甚至更多的是已经发生的事情，而不是现在正在发生的事情。股市和其他金融市场是对未来3到5年将发生什么的一种评估。正如我们所知，我们正处于AI数据中心电力热潮的早期阶段。我认为它尚未在很多**生产力**方面显现出来，但我认为一两年后它会显现。股市，无论对错，我认为正在下这个赌注。它赌的是生产力将提高。企业盈利将变得更好。您在当前经济中尚未看到它的显现。美联储的工作是关注金融状况，但要根据当前经济调整政策，而不是市场对未来两三年所下的赌注。我很高兴您提到了AI热潮、电力、数据中心热潮等等，以及它尚未在生产力方面显现，但它可能正在给电网带来更大的压力。它可能正在给某些必要的电气设备带来更大的压力，这些设备多年来一直供不应求，所有制造商都面临短缺。没错。截至2025年9月，我们能否说，如果说有什么影响的话，AI热潮正在产生一种**挤出效应**（Crowding Out Effect: 政府或特定行业活动增加导致私人投资或消费减少的现象）或轻微的通胀效应，即目前仅从静态角度来看，抛开赌注不谈，成本有点拖累？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, a lot of people look at financial conditions and see see it as a reason the Fed shouldn't act. I actually come at it from someplace different. The economic statistics are reflective of what's going on right now. In fact, even more than that, what has gone on, not even what's going on right now. The stock market and other financial markets are a assessment of what's going to happen for the next 3 to 5 years. We, as we know, we're in the middle and the early innings of an AI data center power boom. I don't think it's showing up yet in product in a lot of productivity, but I think a year or two from now it will. The stock market, rightly or wrongly, I think is making that bet. It's betting that productivity is going to improve. Corporate earnings are going to get better. You you're not seeing it show up in the current economy. The Fed's job is to look at financial conditions, but but adjust policy based on the current economy, uh, not the bet the market's making for two or three years. I'm glad you brought that up about uh the AI boom, the power, the data center boom and so forth and that it's not showing up yet in productivity, but it may be showing up in greater strain on the grid. It may be showing up in greater strain on um certain electrical gear that's necessary that's been in shortage for all manufacturers for years now. That's right. As of right now in September 2025, could we say that if anything the AI boom is like sort of having a crowding out effect or slightly inflationary where the costs right now just on a static extent setting aside the bet are a bit of a drag.</p>
</details>

### AI热潮与基础设施挑战

Robert Kaplan: 本届政府正在推行两项重大的结构性举措。一项是**监管审查和监管放松**，因为他们希望加快AI的采用速度并提供更多可用资本。但第二项是正在对电网进行广泛的重新审查。我们在拥有足够电力来支持AI爆炸式增长方面落后于中国。我们必须在**地热能**、**模块化核能**方面投入更多。我们需要让炼油厂运营更便捷，让**输电**更便捷。我认为您会发现将会有巨大的努力，因为我们落后了。在一些州，正如您所指出的，存在挤出效应。我认为人们担心在某些州，领导人害怕接受更多数据中心，因为担心这会挤出个人。所以，这是一项重大的结构性举措，虽然没有得到太多媒体关注，但它是我国正在进行的一项重大举措。这是一个巨大的变化，而且是必需的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are two big structural initiatives that are being pursued by this administration. One is regulatory review and regulatory relief because they want to ease the speeding to adoption of AI and get more capital available. But the second thing is there's an extensive re-review of the power grid. We are behind China in having enough power to fund the AI explosion. We've got to invest more in geothermal, more modular nuclear. We need to make it easier to run a refinery, make it easier to do transmission. And I think you're going to find there's going to be enormous efforts because we are behind. And in some states, to your point, there is a crowding out. And I think people are afraid at some state states, the leaders are afraid to take more data centers for fear it's going to crowd out individuals. So this is a big structural initiative that isn't getting in the press a lot, but it's a big initiative going on in this country. That's a dramatic change and it's needed.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 这对美联储的政策实际上意味着什么？因为如果我想到这种挤出效应以及对数据库和为其供电的事物的巨大需求，我们已经看到电价开始上涨。我知道美联储首选的通胀衡量指标不包括能源和食品价格。但另一方面，电价会影响几乎所有东西的成本。而且，这似乎也不是我们能在未来两三年甚至十年内解决的瓶颈，坦率地说。如果您现在在美联储，看到电价上涨，您会如何考虑这种压力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does that actually mean for Fed policy? Because if I think about this crowding out idea and all the demand for databases and the things that power them, we have seen electricity prices start to go up. I know the Fed the Fed's preferred inflation measure is X energy and food prices. But on the other hand, electricity prices feed into the cost of pretty much everything. And also, this doesn't seem like a bottleneck that we're going to be solving, you know, within the next two or three years or even 10 years to be frank. If you're at the Fed right now and you see electricity prices going up, how are you thinking through that pressure?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以，让我把它放在上下文中。存在**交叉趋势**，我的意思是真正的交叉趋势。您刚才提到了一个。一方面，政府正试图减少政府主导的支出，并用更多的激励措施、税收优惠来取代。显然，**关税**已经到位。这些措施正在减缓增长，并有提高成本的趋势。它们可能在劳动力方面是一次性的。正如我刚才提到的，由于移民政策，我们实际上正在减缓和减少劳动力增长。这实际上正在帮助我们实现充分就业，美联储也注意到了这一点，但这也使得物价和工资更具**粘性**（指价格或工资对市场变化反应迟缓的现象）。与此同时，您刚才说AI和电网正在蓬勃发展，而且我们缺乏劳动力，我们需要更多的电力，这实际上给物价带来了压力。所以，当您在美联储，当您遇到这种混乱时，我认为这就是他们今年迄今为止没有采取任何行动的原因之一。但我认为劳动力市场正在迫使他们采取行动，如果它变得更弱，他们真的不希望那样。这就是他们正在采取行动的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let me put it in context. There are crossurrens, uh, I mean real crossurrens. You just mentioned one. On the one hand, you've got the government is trying to reduce government directed spending and replace it with more incentives, tax incentives. Obviously, the tariffs have been put in place. Those are slowing growth and they have a tendency to raise costs. They might be one time on the labor force. As I just mentioned, we are actually uh decelerating and reducing labor force growth because of immigration policy. That's actually helping us be at full employment and the Fed's been taken by that, but also makes prices stickier, wages stickier. At the same time, you just said you've got these booms in AI and the grid, and you've got uh uh we don't we need more labor, we need more power, and that actually stresses prices. So, when you're at the Fed, when you've got this kind of confusion, I think that's one reason why they've done nothing so far this year. But I think the labor market is forcing their hand where if it gets even weaker, they really don't want that. And that's why they're acting.</p>
</details>

### 全球化与中美AI应用差异

Joe Weisenthal: 让我们再多谈谈AI和中国。您提到了电力因素，很多人都对美国电网的限制感到焦虑，以及所有这些庞大的资本支出数字，电网是否能够支持这些。除了电力部分，还有什么不同？因为我们采访过的一些人谈到，对于技术**扩散**，特别是来自中国或通过中国运行的供应链，态度非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about AI and China a little bit more. You mentioned the power element and there are a lot of people anxious about the constraints on the US grid and you all these big capex numbers and can the grid even support that. What else is different besides the electricity component? Because some people we've talked to talk about there's a very different attitude towards the tech diffusion particularly out of China or supply chains that run through China.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以，嗯，我刚从亚洲回来，上周我在中国。当我们谈论AI时，我们倾向于关注**超大规模企业**（Hyperscalers: 指拥有庞大计算和存储基础设施的大型科技公司）。这些大型巨头公司在**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 由标准普尔公司编制的美国500家大型上市公司股票指数）中占据了不成比例的份额，他们正在花费数千亿美元。他们赚了很多钱。当我在中国谈论AI时，他们谈论的是您使用的“扩散”这个词。他们谈论的是普通企业，比如中国的麦当劳、中国的**瑞幸咖啡**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh and I just got back from Asia and I was in China last week. When we talk about AI, we tend to look at the hyperscalers. These big giant companies that make up a disproportionate share of the S&P 500 and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. They're making a lot of money. When I'm in China and we talk about about AI, they talk about the word you use diffusion. They talk about regular businesses, the McDonald's of China, Luke and Coffee in China, regular.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我们现在在纽约市就有它们，我尝过一个，味道非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have them in New York City right now and I tried one and it's very good actually.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 是的。但这些公司正在积极利用AI来降低成本。那么，为什么会发生这种情况呢？我想说我们走得更远。中国比我们走得更远。为什么？他们的**利润率**更低。他们是出于必要而这样做。美国公司的利润率更高，所以他们降低成本和进行AI实验的压力没有那么大。在中国，他们别无选择。竞争如此激烈。他们需要降低成本。但让我印象深刻的是，我们可以从中国正在做的事情中学到很多。通常，如果我们更**全球一体化**一些，我们就会学习这些东西，并将这些经验带回美国。这让我想起全球化并未消亡。美国正在选择在其中扮演不同的角色，并正在退缩。但我必须告诉您，我在那里看到的另一件事是，中国与其他积极寻求建立新伙伴关系的国家之间存在更多的**耦合**。加拿大在尝试建立新伙伴关系方面更加积极。所以我认为全球化和AI故事是相辅相成的。我必须告诉您，全球化不会消失，美国在未来几年将不得不选择我们希望在参与其中扮演多大角色。但无论有没有我们，它都会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. But they those companies are actively using AI to lower costs. And you got So why is that happening? I'd say we're further along. China's further along than we are. Why? Their margins are lower. They're doing it out of necessity. Our margins in the US and our companies are higher and so they're not as much pressure to lower costs and make AI experiments. In China, they don't have a choice. It's so competitive. They need to lower costs. But the thing that struck me, there's a lot to learn from what they're doing in China. Normally, if we were a little more globally integrated, we would learn those things and bring those those learnings back to the United States. And it reminded me that globalization is not dead. United States is is choosing to play a different role in it and stepping back. But I got to tell you the other thing I saw there is there's more coupling going on between China uh and other countries that are aggressively. Canada is much more aggressive in trying to form new partnerships. So I think globalization and the AI story go together. And I got to tell you, globalization not going away and the US is going to have a choice in the years to come how much of a role we want to play in participating. But it's going to happen with us or without us.</p>
</details>

### 关税政策与美国制造业回流

Tracy Alloway: 所以我们可以坐在这里问您在中国看到了什么，以及您对中国的看法。但我非常清楚，当您进行那种旅行时，您会有中国客户向您询问您对美国的看法以及这里正在发生什么。您目前从中国客户那里得到了哪些类型的问题？他们对什么感兴趣？我认为讨论的最大焦点是，嗯，我职业生涯的早期部分是在亚洲度过的，我在韩国、台湾、中国很大程度上发现，他们所有的努力都是从**低附加值制造业**转向**高附加值制造业**，他们试图摆脱低附加值制造业。有什么例子呢？T恤和运动鞋以前在中国制造。今天它们在越南制造。为什么？中国希望提升**价值链**。因为他们的感觉是，他们将通过高附加值制造业来提高生活水平。我在那里有时会遇到的问题是，如果您要**回流**到美国，您真的会回流木材、铝以及其他一些低附加值制造业吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we can sit here and ask you what you saw in China and what your thoughts were about China. But I am very aware that when you go on that type of trip, you have Chinese clients who are asking you your thoughts on the US and what's going on here. What are the type of questions that you're getting from Chinese clients at the moment? What are they interested in? So the biggest item I'd say of discussion is uh and and I used to be in Asia for the first part of my career and what I found in Korea, Taiwan, China to a large extent their whole effort was to go from low value added manufacturing to high value added manufacturing and they tried to wean off of lower value added manu manufacturing. What's an example? T-shirts and sneakers used to be made in China. Today they're made in Vietnam. Why China wants to move up the value chain? Because their feeling is they're going to raise the standard of living to higher value added manufacturing. The the question sometimes I get when I'm over there is if you're going to reshore to the United States, are you going to really reshore lumber, aluminum, uh some of these other lower value added manufacturing?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 嗯，巩固与加拿大和墨西哥的关系难道没有意义吗？在那里您可以从加拿大获得廉价的自然资源，从墨西哥获得廉价劳动力，并巩固北美。所以我想说他们不是在批评我们，但他们有点挠头，说：“战略理由是什么？”因为您在劳动力方面受限。您通常希望提升价值链。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, wouldn't solidifying the relationship with Canada and Mexico make sense where you can get cheap natural resources from Canada, cheap labor from Mexico, and solidify North America? And so I'd say they're not critical of us, but they're scratching their heads a little bit to say, "What's the strategic rationale?" Because you you're tied on labor. You you normally want to move up the value chain.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我认为他们意识到其中一些关税也旨在帮助创收和减少赤字。他们理解这一点。他们只是质疑其战略性如何。那么，让我问您一个关于我们将在美国带回什么（如果有的话）的问题，就您在高盛的职位而言，您是否看到有任何私人资金流入美国进行全新的，我不知道，**绿地资本投资**（Greenfield Capital Investment: 指企业在一个全新地点从零开始建设新设施的投资），无论是低利润率还是高利润率的，因为恐怖分子改变了计算方式，使这项投资变得经济可行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think they realize that some of these tariffs are also intended to help generate revenue and reduce the deficit. They understand that. They're just questioning how strategic it is. Well, let me ask you a question of the on the question of what are we going to bring back in the United States, if anything, just from your perch at Goldman, do you see any private money that's come into the US for fresh sort of I don't know green field capital investment either in something low margin or high margin because the terrorists have changed the math and made that investment economical.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以我会说，是的，答案是肯定的。我认为有一些美国公司会在这里进行更多的边际制造。我与海外公司谈过，包括，嗯，我不会提及一家中国合同制造商的名字。他们正在美国建造更多设施。所以问题是，我不知道这需要多长时间，规模会有多大。嗯，但它确实正在发生。另一方面，美国有许多公司受益于获得低成本商品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I will say there yes is the answer. Uh I I think there are US companies that will do more on the margin manufacturing here. I've talked to overseas companies including uh I won't mention the name of one contract manufacturer in China. They are building more in the United States. And so the the thing is I don't know how long it will take what the magnitude will be. Uh but it yes it is happening. The the flip side of that is there are many companies in the US that benefited from access to lowerc cost goods.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我不会提及他们的名字，但您知道其中一些公司，他们的利润率正在受到挤压。然后我与一些小型企业谈过，他们没有能力应对这些关税，其中一些企业实际上将在年底前倒闭或正在考虑倒闭。这是一个有点不公平的问题，但我还是要问。如果您现在必须选择一个，您会说关税在将制造业带回美国方面更有效，还是在人们担心赤字的时候为美国政府增加收入方面更有效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I won't mention their name but you can you know some of them and they are their margins are being squeezed and then I talked to a number of small businesses that don't have the leverage to manage these tariffs and some of them will actually go out of business or considering it by the end of the year. This is a little bit of an unfair question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. If you had to if you had to choose one right now, would you say that tariffs are more effective at bringing back manufacturing to the US or more effective at raising income for the US government at a time when people are worried about the deficit?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我想我们从第二部分开始。嗯，关税会增加收入，但它们会减缓增长。因此，对于每一美元的关税收入，您都必须接受您可能会损失一些，并且增长会略低。我认为这种权衡非常值得。嗯，如果您带回的是高附加值制造业，我不知道如果您正在推动带回低附加值制造业，这种权衡是否如此划算。我认为本届政府知道这一点，我认为他们会更具战略性。我认为您可以两者兼顾。我认为您可以创造公平的竞争环境，获得更多的关税收入或一定水平的关税收入。嗯，我们当时认为它们会更接近10%而不是20%。您的意思是，高十几的百分比比我们预期的要高一点。而且您也可以在**半导体**和其他战略领域**迁回本国**。我认为问题是您确定要走木材和铝这条路吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think we'll start with the second part. Uh tariffs uh raise revenue, but they slow growth. And so for every dollar of tariff revenue, you have to you have to accept you may give some back and a little bit lower growth. I think that trade is very much worth it. Uh if you're bringing back high value added manufacturing, I don't know if it's such a good trade if you are pushing to bring back lower value added. I think this administration knows that and I think they'll be more strategic. I think you can do both. I I think you could level the playing field, get get a more tariff revenue or some level of tariff revenue. Uh I think we were thinking they were going to be closer to 10% than 20%. You mean the high teens is a little higher than we expected. And you can also yes on semiconductors and other strategic areas you can redomicile those. I think the question is you sure you want to go down the road of lumber and aluminum,</p>

Joe Weisenthal: 对吗？或者您想让加拿大来做？这是一个好的战略权衡吗？我，我，我不确定。

### 中性利率与通胀粘性

Tracy Alloway: 既然您提到了，为什么中性利率，就我们能做出一些有根据的猜测而言，为什么它比2019年高那么多呢？在您看来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since you mentioned it, why is the neutral rate of interest to the extent that we can form some educated guess as to what it is, why is it so much higher than it was in say 2019 in your view?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以，嗯，事实是，我认为如果您追溯到远古的2019年，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um the the fact of the matter is I think if you go way back in the stone age to 2019,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 感觉就像是很久以前的事了。确实如此。我想如果我们没有经历**新冠疫情**，我想在新冠疫情爆发前，**10年期国债**收益率可能在1.75%到2%左右。**联邦基金利率**（Fed Funds Rate: 银行间隔夜拆借的利率，是美联储货币政策的关键工具）在1.5%左右。我想我们会稍微向上爬升一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it does seem like forever ago. It does. I think if we had not had CO I think at the right before COVID hit the 10-year Treasury, I think it was in the neighborhood of maybe 1 and 3/4 to two. The Fed funds rate was in the mid ones. I think we would have inched our way up a little higher.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 我们当时不知道我们有多好。所有那些人都在抱怨，哦，收益率太低了。然后现在他们都希望能够回到那个时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We didn't know how good we had it. All those people were complaining, oh, yields are so low. And then now they all wish they could go back there.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 是的。嗯，听着，今天的通胀率更具粘性。回到2019年，它可能在1.5%到1.75%之间。我仍然认为即使在那时，中性实际利率也是0.75%。所以当时的中性联邦基金利率我认为大约是2.5%。嗯，今天它更接近3.5%。但这只有一个原因。通胀率更高了。如果通胀率回到2%，我认为您会看到中性利率回到2.75%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh uh listen the inflation rate today is stickier. Back in 19 it was probably one and a half one and three/4ers. I still think even then the neutral rate real rate was 3/4 of 1%. So the neutral fed funds rate back then I think was 2 1/2ish. Uh today it's closer to 3 and 1/2. But there's only one reason for that. The inflation rate's higher. If inflation got back down to two, I think you'd see the neutral rate back down to 2 and 3/4.</p>
</details>

### 美联储独立性与市场反应

Tracy Alloway: 既然您提到了粘性通胀，还有一件事目前似乎是人们最关心的，那就是美联储的独立性。嗯，我们应该谈谈这个，但我想我们可以稍后听听您对那个具体想法的看法。但到目前为止，令人惊讶的一件事是，我们正在讨论美联储会发生什么，在似乎更积极的特朗普政府下，它似乎希望在货币政策中拥有更大的影响力。我们还没有真正看到市场有什么反应。如果您看长期债券市场，似乎没有很大的风险溢价正在形成。发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since you mentioned sticky inflation, there's one other thing that seems to be top of mind at the moment, which is Federal Reserve independence. Um, and we should talk about that, but I guess we can get your thoughts on, you know, that specific idea in a second. But one thing that seems surprising so far is that we're having this debate about what happens to the Federal Reserve with what seems to be a more activist Trump administration that seems to want to have a heavier hand in monetary policy. We haven't really seen much much uh response from the market. If you look at the long end, it doesn't seem like there's a big risk premium building there. What's going on?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以让我做两点评论。关于政治独立性，让我先确保我把它框定好。美联储的监管政策并非内在的政治独立。多年来一直如此。我这是什么意思？新总统上任。他们会挑选一位新的监管负责人，而且多年来，它一直受到在任者的极大影响。我认为**资产负债表**（Fed: 指美联储的资产负债表，反映其持有的资产和负债）可能在设定联邦基金利率方面处于灰色地带。然而，美联储在政治上是独立的。您说市场对此没有更多反应，这是为什么？我的意思是，现实是股市喜欢低利率的想法。我认为市场并非没有反应。股市喜欢它。所以它现在开始考虑您所说的实际加速更有可能发生。黄金市场对此非常关注，黄金今年迄今上涨了超过35%，我看到今天又上涨了1%。所以它确实如此，我实际上认为长期债券的久期，虽然10年期国债因增长放缓而上涨，但我仍然认为我们有一个问题。我们有37万亿美元的债务要出售，最终将达到40万亿美元。我认为债券市场可能在长期方面会关注当前局势如何演变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's make two comments. So regarding uh uh political independence, let me just make sure I I I uh frame this. Regulatory policy at the Fed is not underlying not politically independent. It hasn't been for a number of years. What do I mean by that? You get a new president. They pick a new head of supervision and it's very much has been influenced for the last many years by whoever's in office. The balance sheet I would argue is maybe a little bit in the gray area on setting the Fed funds rate though. The Fed has been politically independent. Why is the market you said not reacting more to this? I mean the reality is the stock market likes the idea of lower rates. I think the thing it's not that the markets aren't reacting. The stock market likes it. So it's it's starting now to take into account makes the real acceleration you talked about more likely. The gold market is very much taken note of it and gold is up more than 35% year to date and I see it's up another 1% today. So it has and I actually think duration on the long bond while while the tenure is rallied because of slow growth I still think we have an issue. We've got 37 trillion of debt to sell on our way to 40 trillion. I I think that the bond market may pay at the long end will pay attention to how this uh current situation works out.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 发生了什么？嗯，现在关于黄金的讨论比几年前多了多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is going on? Uh how much more gold talk is there these days than there were a few years ago?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 嗯，我实际上回顾了过去50年。上一次黄金出现这样的涨势是什么时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I actually I've gone back over looked back over the last 50 years. When's the last time we got a rally in gold like this?</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 是的。我认为在大衰退之后，还记得在大衰退中，美联储将其资产负债表从8000亿美元增加到4万亿美元，对吗？然后停止了，我们开始稍微缩减它。为了应对**新冠疫情**，我们从4万亿美元增加到9万亿美元，并且在一个27万亿美元的经济体中授权了6万亿美元的额外支出。GDP的**净债务占GDP比重**从70%中期上升到100%以上。当美国以及在某种程度上发达世界的杠杆率因疫情而大幅上升时，人们就开始关注黄金、**比特币**以及其他纸币替代品，因为他们担心这种杠杆化会一直持续下去。所以这是可以理解的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think a in the aftermath of the great recession, remember in the great recession the Fed took its balance sheet from 800 uh billion to 4 trillion, okay? And stopped and we started to run it down a little bit. In response to COVID, we went from 4 trillion to 9 trillion and we authorized $6 trillion of extraordinary spending in a 27 trillion economy. and the GDP uh the net debt to GDP went from mid70s to over 100%. When you've got leverage in the United States and to some some extent in the developed world getting much higher in response to co that's where people start to look at gold, Bitcoin, other alternatives to paper currency because they're worried that this leveraging is just keeping going on and on and on. And so it it's understandable.</p>
</details>

### 美国经济对股市的依赖

Joe Weisenthal: 等等，真的是这样吗？因为我们当前市场状况的一个奇怪的矛盾是，美国股市处于历史高点，但黄金几乎每周都在创下新纪录。感觉这两件事是不兼容的，至少从长远来看是这样。嗯，你知道，也许我们可以维持几周或几个月，但总有人是错的。我花了很多时间与大型机构讨论**资产配置**。我认为，这也是我们的观点。嗯，我们认为2026年可能会出现重新加速。我们认为AI热潮是真实的。我们认为我们将从AI中获得大量的生产力。好的，这是一个有利于企业盈利和股市的环境。我们不知道的是，我们在扭转**债务占GDP比重**曲线方面会有多成功。即使有关税，我们还会出现2万亿美元的赤字吗？它会更高吗？在这方面，我认为人们可以购买股票和黄金，并且非常谨慎地购买10年期和30年期国债。我认为我们现在看到的就是这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Wait, is it though? Because one of the weird tensions of our current market situation is we have US stocks at all-time highs, but also gold making new records almost every week. It feels like those two things are incompatible, at least in the long run. Um, you know, maybe we could do it for a few weeks or a few months, but someone's got to be wrong here. I I spent a lot of time talking to big institutions and about asset allocation. I think and this is our view also. Uh we think there could be a reaceleration into 26. We think the AI boom is for real. We think we're going to get a lot of productivity out of AI. Okay, that is a good environment for corporate earnings and for stocks. What we don't know is how successful we're going to be on bending the curve of debt to GDP. Are we going to run another $2 trillion deficit even with tariffs? Is it going to be higher? And in that regard, I think people can buy stocks and buy gold and be very careful about buying the 10-year and the 30-year Treasury. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 实际上，我想回到您关于全球化无论有没有我们都在发生的那一点。中国对AI扩散采取的方法与美国不同。但是当您环游世界时，美国的科技供应商，无论是**云计算技术**还是**微软**等等，即使美国不参与那波全球化浪潮，它们还会赢吗？美国科技还会是这个故事的一部分吗？因为如此多的东西都依赖于七家公司持续的盈利能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually, I want to go back to your point about sort of uh globalization is happening with us or without us. There's a different approach to AI diffusion out of China than there is in the US. But when you go around the world, are the American providers of tech, whether it's cloud tech or whether it's Microsoft etc. are they still are they going to win even if the US isn't part of that globalization wave? Will US tech still be part of the story because so much is riding on the ongoing earnings power of seven companies?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以我将对美国公司做一般性评论。一家经营全球公司的典型美国首席执行官，在其职业生涯中可能去过欧洲75次或更多，去过亚洲75次，去过中国多次，并多年来一直在建立关系。嗯，我认为这对于科技公司来说也是如此，毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'll make a general comp comment about US companies generally. A typical CEO in the United States that runs a global company has probably been to Europe in their careers 75 times or more and has been to Asia 75 times, has been to China multiple times, has built relationships and has been doing it for years. Um, and I think that's true of tech, no doubt.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 嗯，您看到的许多科技领袖定期在海外。我们的政治领袖以及一些政府职位上的领袖，嗯，可能没有去过中国或海外那么多，这就是为什么您会看到在这样的时期，企业界仍在继续努力，在全球范围内建立关系，尽管在国家层面我们正在重新定位并试图，嗯，将更多带回美国，实际上是**去全球化**。所以我们有一种**二元对立**，它显得非常突出。这与八年前我们退出**巴黎气候协定**（Paris Climate Accord: 一项旨在应对气候变化的国际协议）的方式相同，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, many of the tech leaders you see are overseas regularly. our political leaders and and some of our leaders in certain governmental positions uh maybe have not been to China or overseas quite as much and that's why you see during periods like this the corporate world is continuing to chug along and build relationships globally even though at at national level we're sort of reorienting and trying to um bring more to the United States and in effect deglobalize. So we've got a kind of a dichotomy and it it it stands in sharp relief. This is the same way even 8 years ago where we withdrew from the Paris climate accord,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 然而，在我看来，美国的那些公司在努力建造**LEED认证建筑**（LEED Certified Buildings: 获得能源与环境设计先锋认证的建筑）并专注于**温室气体排放**和**可持续性**方面丝毫没有放慢脚步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yet companies in the United States from my to my eye did not slow down at all in trying to build lead certified buildings and focus on greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway: 您早些时候谈到了中国和美国在企业层面实际使用AI的方式之间的差异。当您审视美国并寻找AI实际上对美国生产力产生明确的、**关键性影响**的迹象时，您在寻找什么？这里的迹象是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talked earlier about the difference between how China and the US um the corporate sphere is actually using AI. When you're looking at the US and you're looking for signs that AI is actually having a definitive, you know, needlemoving impact on US productivity, what are you looking for here? What are the signs?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我正在寻找在广泛行业中的**采用**，因为它是这样运作的。首先，您的公司让您尝试它。好的。然后您采用它。第二件事是您尝试基于该采用的各种**应用场景**。然后第三件事是您找出哪些应用场景有效，哪些无效。我们现在在美国正处于这个阶段。当我说中国稍微领先时，我认为他们已经在更多行业中尝试并验证了一些应用场景。我们也会达到那个阶段。但是当我们在十年后回顾时，您就会知道。我猜可能不会像世界其他地区那么快。我们将经历所有这些。我们将知道哪些应用场景有效，哪些无效。我们将采用它们。我们将获得更多的效率。可能会有同样多或更多的就业机会，但它们会发生转变，我们将不得不重新部署人员到有空缺的岗位，但我们必须经历整个周期。我想说我们还处于早期阶段。我们还处于早期阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm looking for adoption in a broad set of industries because here's here's how this works. First, your company gets you to try it. Okay. And you adopt it. Second thing you try is various use cases based on that adoption. And then third thing you figure out which use cases work and which use cases don't work. We're kind of in that phase right now in the United States. When I say China's a little farther ahead, I think they've already tried and proven some of the use cases in more industry. We'll get there too. But but you'll know when we look back 10 years from now. My guess is maybe not as fast as other parts of the world. We will have gone through all that. We'll know which use cases work, which don't. We'll adopt them. We're going to get a lot more efficiencies. There may be as many or more jobs, but they're going to shift and we're going to have to redeploy people to where the open jobs are, but we have to go through that whole cycle. And I would say we're early. We're early in that.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我们只剩下几分钟了。最近我一直在思考一件事，我想听听您的看法。实际的美国经济对股市的杠杆作用有多大？当您环顾四周时，感觉事情在多大程度上依赖于这些公司年复一年地持续交付以及积极的资产回报？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We just have a couple minutes left. Here's something that's been on my mind a little bit lately that I would like your take on. How levered to the stock market is the real US economy? How much when you look around does it feel like things are dependent on these companies continuing to deliver year after year and positive asset returns?</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 所以这是一个很好的问题。我想说美国是75%的**服务型经济**。它是一个非常依赖**消费驱动型经济**。这使得我们的经济与世界上许多国家不同。如果您在这里分解消费者，这个国家一半的工人，我们假设8000万到8500万人，每年赚5万美元，不太可能拥有金融资产，已经失去了超过25%的**购买力**，并且正在努力维持生计。他们把赚到的每一分钱都花掉了。但如果您是为他们服务的企业，您会看到他们非常谨慎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's a great question. So I would say the US is 75% a service economy. It is a very heavily consumer-driven economy. This which makes our economy different from many in the world. And if you break down the consumer here, half the workers in this country, let's take it 8085 million, make $50,000 a year, are unlikely to have financial assets, have lost 25% plus purchasing power, and are struggling to make ends meet. They're spending every dollar they make. But if you're a business that serves them, you're seeing they're being very careful.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 是的。还有另外8000万到8500万消费者，他们往往是，我夸张地说，泛指55岁及以上，拥有自己的房屋，拥有金融资产，而且正如您所说，他们在市场上赚了很多钱，他们正在消费，因为他们变得更富裕了，我们有两类消费者群体。我认为本届政府，我相信，正在努力做的一部分是帮助提升第一类群体，使他们能够更富裕，做得更好，因为现在我们非常严重地依赖于基于股市的第二类引擎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. There's another 80 85 million consumers tend to be I'm exagger I'm generalizing 55 and older own their home have financial assets and and they've made a lot of money in the markets to your point and they're spending because they're getting wealthier and we've got a tale of two consumer groups. I think part of what this administration, I believe, is trying to do is help lift up this first group so that they can be uh more affluent and do better because right now we're very heavily dependent on this second engine based on the stock market.</p>
</details>

### 未来利率周期展望

Tracy Alloway: 好的，我再插问一个问题，回到我们对话的起点，那就是降息。我知道您说50个基点可能不在考虑之列，但您的直觉是，这会是一个持续到明年，即2026年的**降息周期**的开始，还是说这可能只是一次降息，或者两次降息，但不会持续太久？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, I'm going to sneak in one more question and go back to where we started this conversation, which is on rate cuts. I know you said uh 50 basis point probably not on the table, but your your gut instinct, is this going to be the start of a rate cycle, a rate cut cycle that goes into the next year, 2026, or is this something that, you know, maybe you get one rate cut, maybe you get two rate cuts, but it's not going to go on for much longer than that.</p>
</details>

Robert Kaplan: 我认为如果它是一个周期，那将是一个停滞不前的周期。我这是什么意思？9月降息25个基点。我认为这会发生。接下来的六周，一切归零。美联储每六周开会一次。一切归零。确保您仍然确信劳动力市场疲软。检查通胀。如果它继续疲软且通胀至少是温和的，您可能会再降息一次。嗯，我指出问题是，我认为我们没有超过75到100个基点的空间来达到中性。那么我们今年可能会降息两到三次吗？也许吧。我们会降息150到200个基点吗？这意味着您将不得不决定，而我看不出有理由实施非常**刺激性货币政策**。我认为美联储目前配置的机构将非常不情愿地低于限制性或适度限制性，只要通胀率高于目标。罗布·卡普兰，非常感谢您现场参与。未来有很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it will be, if it's a cycle, it's going to be a halting cycle. What do I mean by that? Cut 25 in September. I think that's going to happen. Wipe the slate clean for the next 6 weeks. Fed meets every 6 weeks. Wipe the slate clean. Make sure that you're convinced still the labor market is weak. Check inflation. If it's continued to be weak and inflation is at least moderate, you may do another one. Uh the issue I'm pointing out is I don't think we have more room to get to neutral than 75 to 100 basis points. So might we wind up doing two or three this year? Maybe. Are we going to wind up doing 150 200 base points? It means you would want you would have to decide which I don't see a justification for running a very stimulative monetary policy. And I think the Fed as it's currently configured will be enormously reluctant to to be below restrictive or modestly restrictive as long as inflation's running above target. Rob Kaplan, thank you so much for doing this live. Lots of future.</p>
