### 派对开场与嘉宾登场

主持人宣布这是他们有史以来最有趣的圣诞派对，并隆重介绍了特邀嘉宾——**Tony Hinchcliffe**。Tony一上台就以其标志性的辛辣风格开场，调侃在场的“书呆子们”。随后，主持人介绍了今晚的活动安排，包括备受期待的“**Bestie Awards**”颁奖典礼和一场特别的“**Kill Tony**”脱口秀对决。遗憾的是，**Chamath Palihapitiya**未能出席，但他们表示有很棒的替代者。在简短地感谢了包括**Google Cloud**、**Circle**、**OKX**、**Grock**和**Sonic Flights**在内的赞助商后，主持人再次请出Tony，他被戏称为**Chamath**的“永久替代者”，并以其独特的喜剧魅力点燃了全场气氛。

### Tony Hinchcliffe的辛辣吐槽

**Tony Hinchcliffe**继续以其尖锐的幽默感，对**旧金山**这座城市进行了无情的嘲讽，称其为“粪坑”，并回忆起它曾经的美好。他接着调侃在场的观众，指出他们花费500美元来听亿万富翁聊天，而加州却有最多的无家可归者。他甚至开玩笑说，亿万富翁要假装喜欢自己的孩子有多难。Tony还提到了**All-In播客**的成功，该播客在疫情初期迅速崛起，他讽刺道，四个风险投资家玩高风险扑克牌的内容，对孤立的人们来说“多么有共鸣”。他指出，四位主持人总净资产超过30亿美元，根本不需要做播客。

Oh my god, look at this star power. [ __ ] yeah. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. What the [ __ ] up you goddamn nerds? How about a hand for the All-In podcast Christmas party? We're here in San Francisco. Make some noise. You guys live here in San Francisco? What a [ __ ] hole. It's actually worse than a [ __ ] hole. You could actually use a [ __ ] hole here to put the [ __ ] into that's on the streets. A [ __ ] hole would be an actual upgrade. It used to be so beautiful here. You guys remember remember the intro to full house? That house is still full because 23 Somalians live in it now. Yeah, put your phones away, you [ __ ] You can watch this on video form later, you [ __ ] dorks. Everybody wants their own exclusive. I'm going to make it tonight. I'm going to have a I'm going to My YouTube channel is going to get extra hits. California, more homeless people than any other state. People are struggling and you [ __ ] paid 500 bucks to watch billionaires talk to each other. God bless America. Yeah. Look, billionaires don't have it easy. Do you have any idea how hard it is for a billionaire to pretend like they like their kids? I had to research these guys and it was the most exhausting thing I've ever done. Absolute dorks. But then I watched Mountain Head on the plane and then Big Bang Theory and Succession and then Brokeback Mountain and I think I figured it out. As many of you know, these gentlemen started the All-In podcast at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. It saw massive success very quickly, which makes sense. People were isolated and looking for relatable content. And what's more relatable than four venture capitalists playing highstakes poker? Their combined net worth of the four hosts is over $3 billion. You guys realize you don't have to do a podcast, right? Jake does. Whenever anyone is asked what they would do if they had a billion dollars, I've never heard the answer, attend weekly Zoom calls.

### 讽刺**Elon Musk**与政治立场

**Tony Hinchcliffe**继续他的吐槽，他将自己的节目与**All-In播客**进行对比，指出前者是关于**Elon Musk**模仿者嘲讽脑瘫喜剧演员，而后者是专家讨论经济和科技。他接着拿**Elon Musk**开涮，提到**Elon**今年早些时候被指控行纳粹礼，他解释说是“罗马礼”，Tony认为这比承认是“笨拙的挥手”更糟。他还建议**Elon**利用火箭解决移民问题，例如26秒将非法移民送回墨西哥，然后装满牛油果回来。Tony还讽刺了**All-In播客**的左翼批评者，称其为“回音室”，并用粗俗的笑话影射了**Marjorie Taylor Green**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I do love the current landscape of podcasts, though. Like, how is my show even considered on the same playing field as what you guys do? It's crazy, right? You can listen to four experts educated on economics and technology and within seconds you can switch over to my show and listen to an Elon Musk impersonator roasting an aspiring comedian with cerebral pausy. These guys are all actual friends with Elon Musk. They told me that backstage and then they told me their names. Our friend Elon, of course, got some criticism from the left at the beginning of this year when he was accused of doing a Nazi salute. He said he didn't do a Nazi salute, but that it was a Roman salute. He could have just said it was an awkward wave and people would have accepted that. I don't know if Roman salute is the best alternative. He went with behind the Nazis, the group who has killed the most Jews, including Jesus himself. That's like being accused of visiting Epstein's Island and having an alibi that you were touring Thailand with Bill Gates. Yeah. Can you guys tell Elon to use his rockets for something positive like immigration? Do you have any idea how fast you can get illegal immigrants back to where they came from on a [ __ ] rocket? I looked into this. It's 26 seconds from here to Tijana, Mexico. It's simple. You take the rocket, you fill it with illegal immigrants, you blast that [ __ ] up in the air, right? You let Elon do his fancy little parallel parking thing that he likes to do. You empty the illegal immigrants, you fill it with avocados. Yes, no tariffs on these avocados. These are the ideas. There are some critics on the left that say the hosts of Allin are all too conservative, calling it an echo chamber. An echo chamber is also how Marjgerie Taylor Green's ex-husband refers to her [ __ ]

</details>

### 吐槽**JCal**、**Chamath**和**David Sacks**

**Tony Hinchcliffe**继续对**All-In播客**的主持人进行“吐槽”。他指出**Jason Calacanis**（JCal）的净资产为6000万美元，在播客中被称为“穷鬼”，并讽刺他作为**Uber**的早期投资者，现在离成为司机不远了。Tony还提到**JCal**自称是“世界上最伟大的播客主持人”，并用尖锐的言辞反击。接着，他转向缺席的**Chamath Palihapitiya**，开玩笑说他身家15亿美元，却像医生一样有耐心，并讽刺他曾主导**Facebook**的失败项目，如**Facebook Phone**和**Facebook Beacon**，称其履历“地狱般糟糕”。最后，Tony对**David Sacks**进行了“恭维式”的嘲讽，称赞他是“爱国者”，为国家贡献才智，但随后又暗示他与**Michael Saylor**和**AOC**（Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez）有联系，并调侃他为“加密沙皇”。

<summary>Original English</summary>

We may have to edit that one out. Immigrant jokes are okay, but big [ __ ] jokes aren't. What kind of party are you running here? But seriously, it is an honor to be here at the Christmas party. Remember everyone, Santa is watching to see who's naughty or nice, and you don't want to end up on his naughty list. Then again, that would be the second worst list JCAL ended up on. Jcal, his net worth is $60 million. So on this podcast, he's known as the brokeass [ __ ] He was an early investor in Uber and out of everyone up here, he's the closest one to having to be one of the drivers. He refers to himself as the greatest podcast moderator in the world. These are the people cheering are the people that have not seen my show. If you get to call yourself the greatest podcast moderator in the world, then I get to say that I'm a virtue signaling angel investor liberal cuck. That's what you are. Oh my god. Fun fact, Candace Owens thinks that the leader of France's wife has a bigger dick than JC. [ __ ] His angel list flex is the startup equivalent of that guy who won't stop talking about his high school football championship. Oh, okay. Lost you on the angel investor joke. All right, that's surprising. Puerto Rico. Very good, sir. Thank you. We're trying to forget about that. Jay Cal and I don't have much in common. I'm a centrist, slightly right-leaning person, and he's a full-on liberal. The only thing we have in common is that liberals don't like us. Chamoth couldn't make it, which is completely disappointing. And I'm still, if it's all right with you guys, I'm going to do my Chamath jokes. Yes. Yes. I might do a couple extra ones that I thought were too mean. Now that he's not here, I had to show up for this thing. He works hard. $1.5 billion. He works hard 24711. Wow. He bought into the Golden State Warriors because he heard they had Curry over there. Yes. How these nerds like sports jokes more than angel investor jokes? This doesn't even make any sense. He's got vindalute Indian food jokes. Anyone? He's got a lot of bread. It's a non-issue. Okay, here we go. He's the best poker player out of the bunch. He has the most patience because he looks like a doctor. Somebody told me that Chamath has a very hot wife. I wonder what she sees in him. Perhaps the hairy feet. All right. Okie dokie. Jamaat at one point was a senior executive at Facebook where he spearheaded several projects like Facebook phone, Facebook home, and Facebook beacon. If none of those ring a bell, it's because they were all completely scrapped by Facebook. Hell of a resume. Chimoth, did you also pitch the logo ideas to Cracker Barrel? How about a hand for David Sachs? Ladies and gentlemen, let me just say I am a huge fan of yours. I I just think you're truly so cool. For a genius like you to take a break from wildly successful businesses to be a patriot and share your brilliant mind for the better of our great nation is unbelievable. Agreed. Agreed. David Friedberg is here. It didn't get the laugh I expected. I was supposed to be funny that I just was nice to David Saxs and then moved on. Oh, and to Sax the Cryptozar, Michael Sailor asked me to say hello. And if you can do anything, anything at all, that would be great. I don't really know what he's talking about, but a truly admirable feat. I'm excited to watch Jay Cal follow in your footsteps in 2028 as AOC's special adviser for plugging your own [ __ ] on air.

</details>

### 吐槽**David Friedberg**与**All-In**团队

**Tony Hinchcliffe**继续对**All-In播客**的主持人进行无情吐槽。他提到**David Friedberg**在节目中有一个名为“科学角”的环节，而**David Sacks**则称之为“该走了”。Tony开玩笑说，在一个有四个人的播客中，**Friedberg**竟然能成为“第三者”，这简直不可思议。他还用讽刺的口吻感谢**David**和**David**（指**Sacks**和**Friedberg**）提升了美国亿万富翁中非裔美国人的代表性，暗示财富不平等问题被“外包”给了更优秀的非洲人。最后，Tony向**All-In团队**表达了敬意，感谢他们促进了跨文化、科技和政治的健康对话，并称赞他们所建立的一切超越了党派之争，但又不忘开玩笑地问能否借点钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

David Freriededberg. He has a a segment on the show called Science Corner is or is Sax calls it or as Sax calls it, Time to Go. I didn't think it was possible to be the third wheel on a podcast with four guys. You guys Oh my god. cracking yourself up. David and David, I would like to personally thank you for both elevating the representation of African-Americans among the billionaire class. You know, they say we have wealth inequality in this country. Well, turns out we fixed it. We just outsourced it to better Africans. Yeah, that's America. That's America, baby. You see a kid from Johannesburg with a laptop and he's a billionaire in 10 years. You see a brother from the southside with a laptop and he stole your laptop. It's true. The only blackmail on the podcast is whatever the Israeli government has on these guys. Blackmail. Yes. All right. But seriously, to the All-In squad, thanks for all you do to promote healthy discourse and share perspectives across culture, tech, and politics. what you all have built is special and transcends partisanship. I'm honored to be here tonight and I'm very proud to now call each of you my friends. Also, can I borrow some money? Thank you very much.

### **Kill Tony**播客的成功之路

在一段精彩的脱口秀之后，主持人向**Tony Hinchcliffe**询问了他的播客“**Kill Tony**”是如何取得“12年一夜成名”的成功。Tony解释说，他只是打造了一个自己想做的节目。早年在**喜剧商店**（The Comedy Store）主持开放麦克风（Open Mic）时，他会在每位喜剧演员表演三分钟后上台调侃他们，并偶尔提供一些建议。他和朋友们在后台观看这些表演时，经常会私下里互相开玩笑，觉得这些悄悄话非常有趣。在所有人都在做播客的时代，Tony想到为什么不把开放麦克风的疯狂和他们私下里的笑料分享给大众。尽管当时的联合主持人**Redband**质疑谁会想看开放麦克风，但Tony相信大家会喜欢。事实证明，他的想法非常成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Awesome. Oh my god, man. That was easier than I thought. Wow. Yo, that was fun. Tell me a little bit about the just unbelievable 12-year overnight success that is Kill Tony. Yeah, it's uh I just built the show that I wanted to do. You know, I always was um I was very lucky early on at the comedy store to uh get to host the open mics there, which are three minute long sets on Sundays and Mondays with 40 comedians in a row doing 3 minutes. 3 minutes, 3 minutes, 3 minutes. And I would go up after each comedian did three minutes and make fun of them. And every once in a while afterwards go up to them personally and say, "Hey, you know, if you took a breath sometimes or, you know, used pauses or sped up or used got the mic closer to your mouth, little advice here and there." And uh me and my friends would always have so much fun sitting in the back of the room watching these open mics. And the things that we would whisper into each other's ears, I thought were so funny. We'd be in the back of the room. Sometimes we'd be the only people laughing at the open mic cuz of what we're saying to each other. And I thought to myself during this time in which everyone was saying, Tony, you have to do a podcast. You got to do a podcast. Everyone has a podcast. You know, it was un completely unheard of at the time. But I thought, why not show how crazy an open mic can be and the ideas that me and whatever comedian buddies were sitting next to me. If we shared what we were laughing about with the people, I think it could be a hit. And even the co-host Redband at the time goes, "Wait, what? Who the [ __ ] is going to want to watch an open mic?" And uh and I kind of thought everybody would. So no. Yeah, it turns out worked out pretty well.

### 从贫困到成功：喜剧之路的磨砺

**Tony Hinchcliffe**分享了他从洛杉矶奋斗到在**麦迪逊广场花园**（Madison Square Garden: 纽约市著名的多功能体育馆和娱乐场所）表演的艰辛历程。他回忆起18年前，他曾以每月400美元的价格租住在客厅的沙发上，与四位喜剧演员合租。尽管每天从早上11点工作到晚上7点，然后在**喜剧商店**工作到凌晨2点半，他仍然难以支付房租。后来，他甚至因为付不起400美元的房租，降级到每月300美元租一个豆袋沙发，而洗手间还在别人的卧室里。最终，他选择睡在车里。Tony表示，正是这些挣扎的岁月，让他如今在奥斯汀拥有成功时，更加珍惜和回忆。他提到，在**麦迪逊广场花园**为**特朗普**竞选活动表演并成为全球新闻，让他感觉一次又一次地“成功了”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah, it's um it's pretty amazing. When I moved to Austin 2 years ago and the first thing people say when they land in Austin is, "Have you been to Kill Tony? Can you get me tickets to Kill Tony?" And you were so nice. You gave me your phone number. You said, "Anytime you want, you know, come in." And then I texted you and you ghosted me. And really, did that really happen? No, I just wanted to see if the joke would last. It would have happened if you did text me. That's why I deleted your number, but um yeah. No, I didn't. Uh but it is a phenomenon. It the show is selling out. I don't know how many weeks you put out at a time, but my office is over there by Dirty Sixth Street and sometimes I'll walk and get a coffee and there's two 300 people lined up on the street. They just go to Joe Rogan's mothership just to see where it happens. What what's it like in terms of the number of tickets and then this incredible scale? You've now sold out MSG how many times? Yeah, three Kill Tonies and once just for my standup the standup show and the most recent Kill Tony was all after my famous MSG performance heard. You spoke at the Nuremberg Rally. Yeah. So that that was even more special cuz it was already my favorite arena. In fact, the only reason I really did that event was because I was just excited to feel the magic of Madison Square Garden again. Had it been at at uh you know what's the one in Jersey or whatever? Brendan Burn. No, a different arena. It's uh it doesn't matter. But it's in Jersey. It doesn't matter. Yeah. My point is is if it if had it even been anywhere else, I don't even know if I would have done it. But the magic of MSG mixed with the opportunity to perhaps, you know, get a few people, maybe younger people or whoever that was on that were on the fence to vote what I thought was the right way. Can I ask how did that whole MSG um thing come about for the Trump campaign? Cuz I remember when they asked me to help and I just threw a dinner and when you did it, you you know delivered a killer set that almost like burned the campaign down. But um uh fake news 20% Puerto Rican increase in the state of Pennsylvania. An uptick because they have an unbelievable sense of humor. Puerto Ricans do. You know, when you do this every night and all the time, you get a really good feel for what you can and can't get away with, what exactly where is the actual line. And I think and I'm I think in retrospect a lot of people think that the mainstream media trying to make it appear like a comedian. I don't think any of these journalists did their research. With a simple Google, you see that I have the most diverse comedy show in the world and that I am in I push the limits on the whether it be the Tom Brady roast or the Snoop Dog roast and all the roasts that I've written on like the last 13 Comedy Central roast.

### 奥斯汀：言论自由的喜剧新中心

**Tony Hinchcliffe**强调，他的喜剧表演始终秉持“机会均等”的原则，无论是**Tom Brady**还是**Snoop Dogg**的吐槽，他都一视同仁。他认为主流媒体试图将他描绘成一个“坏喜剧演员”，但任何有幽默感的人都能理解他的表演。Tony指出，**奥斯汀**现在是喜剧的最佳城市，吸引了**Joe Rogan**、**Elon Musk**、**Tim Ferriss**、**Shane Gillis**等众多知名人士。他解释说，他和他的团队之所以从洛杉矶搬到奥斯汀，是因为**加州**在疫情期间处理不当，以及**乔治·弗洛伊德**（George Floyd）骚乱期间对警察的打击。他认为，奥斯汀提供了一个自由的环境，让他们能够继续在喜剧中突破界限，而不会像洛杉矶和纽约那样受到限制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's equal opportunity. Basically, with a simple Google of my name, you can find out that I was just doing what I did. And I think they weren't gambling on the fact because I'm not mainstream, right? I'm not Jimmy Fallon or any of these darlings of theirs. Uh I think that they thought that it was going to make everything look bad. But meanwhile, I I think anybody with a sense of humor at all saw it and goes, I think this is the party with a sense of humor. Yes. Meanwhile, they have the other side had Glorilla shaking her ass and like everyone's pretending like that's cool, but that that's not cool. And Tony, can we can we go back to your your because I thought what was so interesting was your story getting here because there's a lot of entrepreneurs, people that have built businesses in this room. One of the defining characteristics of building a business is you have to have grit because nothing goes as planned if you're doing something for the first time. Yeah. And you get your ass kicked. And if you can deal with that, you can deal with it again and you deal with it again, you can eventually get somewhere. You started out in LA. Can you just talk about not just the idea, but then what the process was like going from the idea to having yourself on stage with the future president at Madison Square Garden giving this like what was that experience like and how hard was that iteration that build and the struggle to get to where you got to? Oh, it was insane. I I I actually uh just mentioned this. I was on Rogan this week with John Cena and it came up, but I had this uh moment a few weeks ago where I Venmoed a buddy because I thought that I owed him rent from 18 and a half years ago. I was sleeping. I had I was renting the couch in a living room with four comedians total. I was one of them. One had a bedroom with a bathroom. Another one had a bedroom with a bathroom and me and there was a little love seat. The guy was renting the love seat and I had to pay $400 a month rent. And I literally, even though I was working all the hours from literally 11:00 a.m. on the phones to 700 p.m. at night and then I would put on the Comedy Store t-shirt and work the door from 8:00 p.m. till 2:30 in the morning and then do it again the next day. And uh because the comedy store didn't have comedy hadn't had its second huge boom yet, which was a few years away, um uh they would cut your hours at the comedy store. They just wouldn't not only would you not get overtime. You wouldn't even get the hours that you actually did work or really anything at all. I couldn't make the 400 a month rent. So anyway, a few weeks ago, I said to one of the other buddies that had a room, I go, "Hey, I think I owe I still think I owe the main guy a few hundred bucks, rent." He goes, "You do? He mentioned it last time I saw him." Wow. And so I went to Venmo and I just Venmoed him a,000 bucks straight up. And in the caption, Yeah. exactly in the caption I go, "Rent money 2007." But Tony, was there a period during that time when you were going to quit where you said it's not working? No, these were my favorite times. In fact, after that, after the 400 rent, which by the way, because I couldn't make the 400 rent, I got downgraded. Not only was there someone else on the love seat, someone else moved in that could afford the 400 rent. So, I paid 300 rent for a bean bag on the ground. And let me remind you, the bathrooms were in the other guy's bedroom. So you had to tiptoe if you had to pee in the middle of the night through somebody else's bedroom. So it was after that actually after basically the first year was that I decided to just start sleeping in the backseat of my car behind the comedy store where I wasn't you weren't even allowed to park there. It's a tiny parking lot. So, I would be up on one of the hills in the Hollywood Hills and after at 2:30 or 3:00 a.m. when you're done, I would walk up a hill and get my car and drive it back into the empty comedy store parking lot, pull into the back. Juan Carlos, the maintenance man there that would show up at like 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., was nice enough to wait a few hours to try to let me get a few extra hours of sleep before he would start nailing [ __ ] and fixing everything. And it's literally the times now that I have a touch of success. Um, it's the times that I think about all the time now. Every single time I find myself looking at the skyline of Austin from my beautiful [ __ ] home with a crazy outdoor terrace and everything the way that I want it. I think about those times. The struggle all the time. Was there a moment where you said, "I made it." Uh yeah, I mean it happens quite a bit. It the I made it thing happens a lot. every MSG and even I mean again, you know, to go back to it, the Trump thing at MSG being global news was so insane that not only did I make it, I I feel every time like I'm kind of making it again, you know, cuz it just seemed at the time there was a couple weeks there where it's literally, you know, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people saying or thinking that that could be it, that it's all over. What's the best city for comedy right now? Is it Austin? Is it still LA? What do you There's no question about it. It's Austin, Texas. Austin. Really? Absolutely. Honestly, you guys are You guys are making it sound really fun. You got You're there. Jake's there. Rogan's there. Who else is there? Elon, Tim Ferris, let's go shopping. Shane Gillis. All of his entire crew is there. Matt McCusker, Tom Sigura, came and saw you a few months ago when we did that event in Austin. What was that? March or something? March. Right. It was incredible. I mean, the crowd. Yeah. So, we got hooked up with your guy, got us some tickets, and I was with some buddies and they said, "Let's go see Kill Tony." We got in touch with your guy, got into the show, and I think I had forgotten what standup comedy was supposed to be like from like the late 90s, early 2000s, even into the 2010s because over the last couple of years, we've talked a lot about guys getting their heads chopped off when they said something wrong. Chappelle, and everyone got so guarded in comedy. And I went to your show and I was like, "What the fuck?" Like, "Oh my god." Like this was tame tonight, but like what went on on your stage? And then you did a bit where you really tried to push the limits. It was a a really interesting show to watch cuz this was like we were sitting next to each other and we were like, "Oh my god, he's really trying to see how far he could go." And there were moments where it was like everyone was just like, but it was so different. And you've you've really like given everyone permission to find the limits, to find real humor, to find, you know, what what's sort of been taken away without a doubt. And that's what we always did. Some, you know, some comedians when they're trying to promote their specials or whatever now from LA and New York will say things like, "Oh, Austin." So that they can get hits on their clip. You have to talk [ __ ] about Austin. It's been a thing the last couple years. and uh and they go, you know, oh, they're just edge lords and this and that and they're just pushing limits. They don't and it's like we are the we were the comedy store guys in the middle of the lineup. When I go to New York, I can perform at any club there. When I go to LA, I can perform at any club there. So, it's we just live there. It's an amazing place to live. It's an amazing place to go out and drink and eat and listen to music and hang out with people. Now, your guys are going mainstream. Your one guy's on SNL now. Yeah. Cam, right? And so much is happening. But my point is is we're doing the exact We're not like, "Let's go to Austin and get even crazier. We're the exact same people that were in the middle of the lineup at the comedy store." And it wouldn't have changed. We would still be in LA if the if California didn't completely mishandle the pandemic and uh and let police take such a terrible hit during the George Floyd riots. Uh it was it was that's why you moved. Yeah. It's when we all decided to move. It was an absolute disaster. The pandemic hit. You guys saw how the pandemic things got so bad at one point that when we were doing our show, which you weren't allowed to have a live audience, we were still doing Kill Tony's. You want to talk about plowing through when times are rough? Everybody else's podcasts during the pandemic skyrocketed like that. us. The only show with a live audience was done. But we didn't stop. We had people we had to I had to improvise. So we had people send in from home a video of themselves doing a one minute set which was horrendous. I mean absolutely terrible. worse than doing roast jokes and killing and have one guy going ooh after each and every joke into a microphone attached to his cheek. But it was dead silence. Nothing was funny to us, by the way. We lacked [ __ ] vitamin D. We were used to having the instant gratification of a crowd every single week. So, we're watching these horrific one minute sets and then we we would zoom with the people. And by the way, don't don't even get me started on all the technical issues. Playing a video, ending the video, starting the Zoom call with somebody that probably doesn't have the best Wi-Fi. No great comedian knows how to work a computer or this or that or anything anyway.

### 言论自由与内容审查的挑战

**Tony Hinchcliffe**谈到了疫情期间**Kill Tony**节目在没有现场观众的情况下如何坚持下来，通过**Zoom**和观众互动，尽管技术问题和缺乏即时反馈让节目变得艰难。他接着讨论了**欧洲**对言论的压制，并对**加州州长**（Gavin Newsom）否决了一项“仇恨言论”法案表示感谢，认为喜剧是言论自由最重要的试金石。Tony还透露，**YouTube**对内容审查的规则每周都在变化，导致节目经常被“去货币化”或“年龄限制”，这严重影响了节目的传播。他指出，这些“守门人”控制着分发渠道，使得创作者面临巨大挑战。

So, we were doing this and then at one point we were so excited because they allowed the fact that you could have tables outside of the comedy store 6 ft apart in the parking lot. The parking lot was empty of cars. Social distancing. Oh my god. The dumbest [ __ ] era of humanity that's ever existed. I know this is San France, so you're like, "Oh, he's the devil. What's he talking about?" I think we all safety. You got tricked, [ __ ] Let me ask about Europe. Uh have you followed any what's going on in Europe with uh speech suppression and Oh. Oh, it's insane. It's insane. Oh, we talk about it in our green room all the time. Yeah, it's crazy. I get weekly updates. And do we worry about that? You know, we had this bill in California called SB771 and I got to give a shout out to Gavin Newsome for vetoing it. All the things you want to say about Gavin, but he vetoed it, thank God. And this was this um hate speech bill that you can't say speech that's deemed hate by the administrators in the government. But those bills are finding and it made it all the way through in California except Gavin vetoed it. those sorts of bills are showing up that were in the EU and throughout Europe. I mean, do we worry about that here in this country? Because I've always viewed comedy to be the most important test of free speech and it really does define what we're being given permission to do. It's so interesting because I uh work directly and and and I'm insanely in touch with these things on a weekly basis with YouTube, which uh you know is I do believe the biggest streaming platform right now. And what's insane is that Netflix and Ted Sarandos literally is like, "Do whatever you want. Go as hard as you want. Push it to the limit. Let's go. And meanwhile, YouTube, every week, something's different. Uh, a black guy right now is only allowed to say the n-word. A black comedian can only say the n-word two or three times per minute, but they're not very clear. I mean, you don't even notice when these guys do it, by the way. It's obviously different than a white guy saying the n word. That's about Freeberg's average, right? Exactly. It's not even funny. Tony, don't laugh at a joke. Thank you, Tony. We're in this together. Oh, but uh but yes, the um the interesting thing is that you can say certain words on YouTube, but you can't say they have them ranked and the rules change all the time. And you don't find out that the rules at YouTube have changed until your producer goes, they just demonetized the episode. and it's been out for an hour and a half, which is when everybody's going to see the episode or the age restriction is a killer because yeah, we got hit with that restricted content. Almost everyone that watches the show is over 18. However, who the hell wants to log in to their stuff? I mean, you dorks do, but real people don't want to. You know, they just like going to YouTube, typing in the show, and there it is. It aired an hour ago. Here we go. And then if it says age restriction just to check to see if you're 18, which what a [ __ ] joke cuz every kid can also access anything anyway. And um we got age restricted. Yeah, we got restricted content. But I guess your point Tony is that there are gatekeepers that control the distribution channel, in this case YouTube.

### **Elon Musk**收购**Twitter**与欧洲巡演的挑战

**Tony Hinchcliffe**认为，**Elon Musk**收购**Twitter**是言论自由领域的一个重要转折点，扭转了之前内容审查日益收紧的趋势。然而，**欧盟**（EU）正在对**Elon**施加压力，最近对他处以1.2亿欧元的罚款，这表明欧洲在言论自由方面仍未“开窍”。Tony还分享了**Kill Tony**节目在**欧洲**巡演的糟糕经历，称那是他们有史以来最差的表演，因为当地的喜剧演员水平太差，伦敦的氛围也“阴郁”，食物更是“糟糕透顶”。他开玩笑说，除非能去**白金汉宫**（Buckingham Palace），否则他们可能不会再去欧洲了。Tony感叹，当喜剧在中东比在伦敦更受欢迎时，这确实反映了社会的一些问题。

Without a doubt. And I'll say this again, you know, without I don't want to keep getting political, but there was a time there towards the end of that last Biden administration in which we were seeing things go the wrong way on wrong way on almost a weekly basis. Like why' this one get demonetized? How did this one get demonetized? cuz we would have to and you have to do a lot of digging cuz they are just robots over there until you finally get big enough to get a human contact at YouTube which is like a big deal for um it was definitely going the wrong way and it felt like every week there's some new category of thought and expression that you couldn't say and they were banning new things and then frankly Elon bought Twitter and that was the first event that shifted the momentum. No, there's no doubt. And now now the EU is coming after him. They find him 120 million euro yesterday. It's like Europe never got the memo. You know, it's over. Will you guys tour in Europe or is it like not working? We did. We just did in June and we unless they basically give us Buckingham uh Palace, we'll probably never go there again. It was the worst Kill Tony in the history of our existence. Um, the comedians were just terrible. And we've done quite a few in England and Ireland and stuff. Just the comedians were terrible. The vibes there are rough. There's just this neverending gloom in London. Yes. Uh, there the food is beyond all horrible. They used to be funny though over there, right? Like we were going I'm sorry. We were going to the locals like, "Please, anything. Where can we get a steak? Where can they overcook us a steak?" Oh, it was [ __ ] crazy, man. And I mean, everything. It became a running joke cuz we got there a few days early to settle in and kind of, you know, ease into it. So that's, you know, three meals a day. Even if it's just three days, that's nine terrible meals in a row. You're very we have the best food in the country in Austin. It's unbelievable. We have we have hundreds of restaurants better than anything we tried of the fanciest crap in London. And they open seven new ones a week. I mean, it does say something about society when comedy is appreciated more in the Middle East than it is in London. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty crazy. It really was.

**David Sacks**在“**Kill Tony**”对决中继续对**Chamath**进行攻击，称他是“无限移民不符合美国利益”的典型例子，并开玩笑说**Chamath**来自**斯里兰卡**，所以**Tony**对**波多黎各**的吐槽让他感到“思乡”。**Sacks**还提到**Chamath**激怒了许多投资者，以至于“SPAC”（Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司）现在代表“Seriously Pissed At Chamath”（对Chamath非常愤怒）。接着，**Sacks**转向**David Friedberg**，讽刺他像“看油漆变干”一样无聊，并把他比作“**Beyond Burger**”（Beyond Burger: 一种植物性肉类替代品），称他是一个“超越朋友”，暗示他虽然是菜单上的一个选项，但并不令人满意。最后上场的是**David Friedberg**，他一上来就吐槽**旧金山**的街道“像**Chamath**一样充满了[脏话]”。他还开玩笑说**Tony Hinchcliffe**是“转基因”（GMO），并继续拿**JCal**的体重和**Epstein**的飞机开涮，甚至讽刺**Sacks**在**特朗普**政府期间的“遮掩”。

All right, Tony. Thank you so much for being here. I loved your roast of Puerto Rico. You went so hard after a Latino island. And I'm shocked President Trump didn't appoint you Secretary of War. Jal, I've been following your feed this week. I really appreciate your support for All in Tequila. I know you love it because you finally get to take a shot that's not ompic. It It was only a matter of time before JC got in the beverage business because I've never met anyone more thirsty than JCL. He spent his entire life dreaming of the day he would see his name mentioned alongside the world's most influential people. Congratulations, Jason. You finally did it. You're in Epstein's black book. I knew the Epstein files were a hoax as soon as I saw that JL was in them. Couldn't want to blackmail a loser. All right, let's talk about Jimoth. Chamath is a prime example of why unlimited immigration is not in America's interest. Jamas is from Sri Lanka. Tony's description of Puerto Rico didn't offend him and made him homesick. Do I have time? Can I keep going? All right. Yeah. Chamath has angered so many investors. Spack now stands for seriously pissed at Chimoth and Freeberg are sold into science. So, what can I say about Freeberg that hasn't already been said about watching paint dry? Freeberg lives life as a vegan, and that's exactly what it feels like to hang out with him. You know, there are more satisfying options on the menu, but you made a decision and now you're stuck with it. You've all tried those tasteless Beyond Burgers. Well, free is our beyond friend. All right. Thank you everyone. David S, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Unbelievable. Oh, okay. You're good. Saxs, you're good. I got to tell you, man, that was unfucking unbelievable. I wasn't expecting to have to do this tonight, but I think I just found a new golden ticket winner. Have you ever done Have you ever done stuff on stage before in a non-b businessiness like sense? Well, we we've done a couple of roast among our friends at birthday parties before. We did a JCAL roast. We did a Phil Helmouth roast. There's a lot of material in both of those cases. Yes. So, we've done, you know, we've done some friendly roast, but your 50th roast. Yeah, my my 50th birthday, we actually did a big roast. These guys were all part of it. So, we had a little bit of roast experience. Amazing. It shows, saxs, that was absolutely incredible. How about one more time for David Saxs, everybody? Did he get his $15,000 in money worth the comedians he hired or no? Is that how much he spent all in or do you pay for them out of pocket? That was incredible. That was amazing. Are we going to have Freeberg do his set? We want to hear Freeberg. Let's do it. Tony, Tony, hype me up. Let's go. Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for your final comedian of the night, David Freeberg. Everybody, so great to be in San Francisco. The streets are like Chimamoth. They're totally full of [ __ ] Thanks for being here, Tony Hinchcliffe. I love the show. I've worked in agriculture for years, so I'm used to working with genetically modified fruits. Tony uh Tony Henchcliff's actually a GMO, a gay man. Obviously, Jamal couldn't be here tonight because he's feeding the hungry. Uh just kidding. That's below his line. Speaking of hungry, Jal, you're looking great, buddy. Thank you. Now you only have to buy one seat on Epstein's plane. Jal, your weight goes up and down more than Chimat's back portfolio. In fact, you look so skinny now I confused you for Chimat's legs. Chimat's legs are so thin he wears socks, leggings, and thermals. He covers up more than Sax does for the Trump administration. Sax, congrats on all the success, but the stress is clearly getting to you. You look like someone microwaved John Love it.

### **Kill Tony**的独特机制与造星能力

**David Friedberg**在脱口秀中自称是“科学人”，研究黑洞，而**Chamath**则投资黑洞。他承认自己的笑话可能有些刻薄，但认为世界已经“燃烧”，不如“烧掉一些桥梁”。在**Kill Tony**对决结束后，主持人讨论了**Kill Tony**节目独特的造星能力。**Tony Hinchcliffe**解释说，整个行业都在关注**Kill Tony**，节目中的“桶”是第一道防线，**Howie Mandel**每周都会观看，并根据表演者的表现将他们预订到《**美国达人秀**》（America's Got Talent）。他提到了一位名叫**Dedric Flynn**的喜剧演员，他在节目中表现出色，仅用四周就从“桶”中被选中成为常驻演员，甚至开始说唱自己已经变得多么富有。

We were playing some music and then I just I kind of did them, you know, we did this for Saxes and I went a little burnt earth scorched earth for his 50th. Do you remember that? Yeah, I definitely remember. I think everybody remembers that with a lot of pent up anger. Freeberg gave a set that it was so bad. It was No, it wasn't bad. It was just mean. It was mean. Yeah, it was lines. I just said the mean [ __ ] and I didn't. It was like [ __ ] strength like applied to roast. Yeah. Like it was so it was so mean you didn't realize it. It stopped being funny, you know. Let me ask you this, David. Do you remember uh one of your favorite or one of the bigger one of the crazier jokes from the Sachs roast? I don't. No, I'll pull it up later. There's nothing. That was my 50th birthday, so it was like 20 years ago. Oh, hey. Oh, that little self-deprecating. I see. That's amazing. But you didn't film that or anything. I don't Do we have a copy of that? We might have a copy of that one. Yeah. That's what Epstein would do. Is that We We did some amazing birthday party roast. Jay Cal had one. I had one. Like we went to Phil with We never recorded them, which was We were kind of afraid. We were very afraid of like being We were afraid of getting cancelled. That is correct. Yeah. But now we're uncanced on both. I love that. Perfect. We don't give a [ __ ] Yeah. Freedberg, did you did that go how it felt like it was going to go for you? Was there more or less? What was different? People that haven't tried comedy or written something? I my cadence is a little off. I got to, you know, go one or two more rounds and I think I can get the cadence down. I liked it. I think, you know, I had some other material I pulled out. I would like to try that at some point, but I thought I thought there was some A+ material in there. A+. Yeah, it was great. David Freedberg. Ladies and gentlemen, you guys are good. All right. Respectable. That's what we wanted to do. Hey, um, you know, we have a tradition. We give some bestie awards.

### **Bestie Awards**：年度商业赢家

在“**Kill Tony**”对决之后，派对进入了“**Bestie Awards**”环节，颁发年度最佳奖项。首先是“年度最大商业赢家”。**David Friedberg**选择了**Alphabet**（Google的母公司），指出其市值从2万亿美元增长到4万亿美元，每天增加100亿美元的价值，这得益于其在**AI**领域的转型、风险承担、**Google Cloud** 40%的增长以及**YouTube**成为全球第一媒体公司。**David Sacks**则选择了与**数据中心**（Data Center: 存放计算机服务器和网络设备的物理设施）繁荣相关的**建筑工人**，他们的工资上涨了25%到30%，这表明**AI**的繁荣不仅限于科技公司，也带动了整个国家的经济增长。**Jason Calacanis**也选择了**Alphabet**和**Google**，因为一年前大家还认为**ChatGPT**会击垮**Google**，但现在**Google**通过将**AI**整合到搜索中，成功反击并超越了**ChatGPT**。

That makes sense. San Francisco. Callie. Hey guys. All right. First up, keep her on. What do you say? Keep her on. Take it easy. She said between the two of you. Um, all right. So, first up on the bestie awards is our biggest business winner. Our biggest business winner. Who did you have for biggest business winner? Oh, Sultan of science alphabet. Okay. Alphabet went from listen to how crazy the year was for Alphabet. From two trillion market cap to 4 trillion market cap this year. That's 170 billion gain. 10 billion market cap gain every day. They added 10 billion of value every day for the entire year. The pivot in AI, risktaking, cloud's growing 40%, YouTube's the number one media company in the world. It's all under one roof. I think they just crushed it. All cylinders. Business of the earth. Amazing. Saxs, who did you have as your biggest business winner? I said construction workers related to the data center boom. They're seeing their wages go up 25 to 30%. We're talking about plumbers, electricians, drywall hangers, concrete pores. It's not just tech companies. We're seeing a larger boom throughout the country because of AI. Didn't Jim say there's like electricians that make 500 grand a year or something? Master electricians? That's crazy. Unbelievable. Pretty incredible. And a and a great White House talking point for the midterms. I too had Alphabet and Google. We were sitting here a year ago. Everybody thought they would uh absolutely get killed by ChatGpt and now we're having a discussion. Hey, ChatGpt is probably going to get killed by Google. Uh so, oh, go Google Cloud, right? Is that who that is? Yeah. Uh all right. Biggest just just out of curiosity because I don't know how any of this works. What happened to Chat GPT or what did Alphabet do this year to surprise you guys other than the results? like how did they how did they get them? What did they do? Do you know they well they put AI in into search. So now when you go to search there's like an AI interface that pops up and so that's how they drove people to their AI product cuz they've got the biggest consumer product in the world, google.com and then they had a good product and so they put the two together and suddenly they're crushing chat GPT.

### **Kill Tony**：年度商业赢家与喜剧输家

**Tony Hinchcliffe**将“年度最大商业赢家”颁给了他自己的节目“**Kill Tony**”，因为它在**Netflix**上获得了四部特别节目的合同，并且在**YouTube**上排名第二，仅次于**Joe Rogan**的播客。**Jason Calacanis**也表示，自从看了**Kill Tony**的现场表演后，他已经观看了大约一百集，认为其内容“永恒”。接着，他们讨论了“年度最大商业输家”。**David Sacks**选择了**大学**（Universities），因为现在只有-30%的美国人认为大学物有所值。**David Friedberg**选择了**华纳兄弟**（Warner Brothers），认为其管理不善，未能从其内容中获取价值。**Jason Calacanis**则选择了**苹果公司**（Apple），认为其拥有无限的分发渠道和资本，但在过去十年中，除了更薄的**iPhone**外，没有做出任何令人印象深刻的创新。**Tony Hinchcliffe**将“喜剧界最大输家”归咎于那些仍然“美德信号”且不敢冒险的**大型电影制片厂**。

Yeah. Sometimes the first company up the hill takes the arrows like Netscape, the browser, eventually wound up losing. Um, but I think they were also underestimated and they probably were very conservative in how they released products and then they kind of got permission when Sergey came back to work full-time at Google, the founder. They kind of took more chances and yeah, the the search franchise grew this year. Everybody thought it would go down. It grew. My big business winner is uh the show Kill Tony. I don't know if you guys have heard about it. Uh a four special deal on Netflix, which is unprecedented by any show. And also we ranked number two at the end of the year on YouTube only behind my very best friend Joe Rogan. So that's pretty crazy. Oh, that is number two podcast on YouTube. YouTube's the number one podcast platform. Pretty incredible. But by the way, Tony, can I tell you something? I I didn't tell you this before. When I came and saw your show in Austin, I hadn't seen a Kill Tony show before. So, someone I was with said, "You should go check this out." And that's how we ended up going. And then I came back and I'm like, "I should watch Kill Tony." I would say I've watched maybe a hundred episodes since I've come back. It's so big. It's so And it's it's timeless the content. And so every night when I'm like ready for bed, I'll put on YouTube and I'll watch a Kill Tony episode. It is literally like my goto media now. The live is the gateway. I highly recommend checking one out live because you can feel while it's funny to watch online when when it's live, you can feel the opportunity of failure that they have. You can you're like they're right there. Anything can happen. This could go terribly wrong. It feels dangerous. It feels and then it's so great. You're wait it's almost like waiting for the big game moment to happen. Like you're waiting for that big champion to show up like that guy you had a couple of weeks ago who you made up. Dedric Flynn. That guy was insane. And I think it's amazing. In just four weeks, he was made a regular randomly. Pulled him out of the bucket. Saw him. The interview so likable. I skipped golden ticket and made him the first appointed regular that we we maybe get one of those every two years. Cut to four weeks later last on this past Monday, he literally did a rap about how rich he is already. Like he did a whole rap performance about quit next week. He's like, "I'm out of here. I'm going to do you get a piece of it or does your agent just snipe these people?" No. Well, I mean actually that's an interesting question because now they the entire industry is watching Kill Tony to see what's actually next. I am the first uh that bucket is the first line of defense. Howie Mandel watches every episode and they get booked on America's Got Talent based on if they're unbelievable on Kel Tony. You should offer them a show on your channel. That would be the ultimate move. Remember like Johnny Carson used to be the thing where a stand up would go on Johnny Carson and if Johnny invited them to sit down then they had a career and you've kind of become the new but he's kept it fair. What's crazy is that guy um Dedric Dedric. Yeah. Dedric. Dedric. He he's so black you don't you can't even say his name. Absolutely. He put his name Dedric. Don't use that generic word that you used. do it. He put his name in the bucket for 2 years to get called. So, he moved to Austin 39 weeks in a row and he was just about to stop trying and then he got pulled and then he and so unlike all these other guys where there's control systems in Hollywood with agents and producers and they're like, "Here's the guy that's going to be the winner." These guys all have a democratic shot. They have an open shot at getting in that bucket and getting pulled, which is what I love about it. You never know what you're going to get and it's like everyone has a shot. So, it's not like this control thing. You know what you should do is if they agree to do it, you should say just as a thank you, we want the option for you to come do one Kill Tony special a year for the next two years. Like not something crazy, but just You should You should take business advice from JKL. Absolutely. Hey, I built the number one podcast of the world. It's It's not just you. He gives me advice. He gives the president advice. I gave the president great advice and he said even Jason has good advice. All right. Even JCO. Even Jake, biggest business loser. Who's your biggest business loser? David Saxs, who's the biggest loser? I said universities. The margin of Americans who now believe that college is worth the cost has gone from plus 13 a decade ago to -30. Minus30. Wow. So no one believes that college is worth the cost anymore. Amazing. Great. Great poll. What do you think Freedber discovery? I think the fact that the M&A deal is being done at three times the value that this thing's been trading at for the last couple years really shows how they undermanaged the business. The content itself is worth so much more. They were never able to get value out of it, which speaks to what a terrible, you know, kind of management they've they've had there. And yeah, which company did you say? Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers that just got beat. Yeah. You owned the stock, didn't you, in your thing? I cleared it. I was like, I these guys are going you missed the outcome. I did miss the outcome. Yeah, it was it was a rare miss for me. Um, I went with Apple. Wait, hold on a second. They didn't listen to your advice. I mean, the problem was I had all these other things that had won and I had a bunch of gains and I needed to sell my losers. He put all his stock trades on the internet, Tony. But then I called it J trading and it went up 5x and 3x. But he bought a whole bunch of Warner Brothers. He's like, "This is the next big thing." And I thought Disney and Warner Brothers would figure it out. Neither of them have. Uh, my biggest business loser was Apple. Um, this company has unlimited distribution and uh unlimited capital and the most impressive thing they've done in the last 10 years is a thin iPhone. Uh, what a missed opportunity and uh yeah, I mean maybe the best thing they've done recently is Pluribabus. I don't know if you guys are watching that, but Oh, people like it. Yeah, it's a pretty great show. Literally, if I'm thinking their, you know, streaming show is the best thing, they've got a problem. Um, who's the biggest loser in comedy? uh the biggest loser in comedy right now. And you know, I love here's the thing is that entertainment, right? Well, you know, the biggest loser really are these are these giant movie studios which still are virtue signaling and afraid to take any chances whatsoever. The last movie with any edge at all in a theater I think was The Hangover which I think was 2006 2005 and it made a billion dollars that franchise.

接下来是“年度政治赢家”。**Jason Calacanis**选择了**美国民主社会主义者**（Democratic Socialists of America）。**David Sacks**则认为**加密货币**（Cryptocurrency）是赢家，因为一年前它还面临“战争”，现在却通过了立法，获得了政府的公平对待。**Jason**将“年度政治赢家”颁给了**David Sacks**，因为他“兼职”进入政府，使**加密货币**合法化并建立了框架，确保美国在**AI竞赛**中保持竞争力。**Tony Hinchcliffe**则选择了**特朗普**总统，因为他敢于讲“亲特朗普”的笑话，这在喜剧界是独一无二的。在“年度突破”方面，**David Friedberg**提到了**NASA**对**小行星Bennu**的探测，发现了核酸、氨基酸和糖等生命构成要素，这可能证明生命并非地球独有。**Jason Calacanis**选择了**人形机器人**（Humanoid Robots），认为我们低估了它们的进步。**David Sacks**则选择了**星链**（Starlink）在商业航班上的应用，因为它让人们在飞机上也能真正使用互联网。

Yeah, exactly. Are they coming to you asking you to do one? I would think that would be a very natural play but there's no studio who would do it. So maybe like A24 or one of the smaller ones. We are working on something and really Yeah. And it's going to be it's going to be You heard it here first. definitely the answer to that and it's all happening and it's going to Well, they let you do what you want. Yes, we already we we went and got independent uh financing for it, my amazing team over at UTA. Uh wonderful. What um what uh there anything that would be analogous or inspirational for you? Are there films that informed this one? Are you a Tropic Thunder film fan? Are you like Easy Money, Rodney Dangerfield from back in the day? What do you What comedians in films did you love? Um, I mean, without a doubt, and it's an odd pick because it's not the one everybody thinks that I'm going to say, but Kingpin with Woody Harelson and Bill Murray, I think, is the best Fairly Brothers film. I think it's the funniest thing Bill Murray's ever done. I think it's the funniest thing Woody Harrelson's ever done. And if you haven't watched it in the past few years, go back, watch it one more time. It's unbelievable. Seems like it's a movie about bowling, but it's not at all. It's just hysterical. I had a bunch of seven and eight-year-olds over for my daughter's uh birthday party and we did a film. So, I said, "Oh, you guys should watch Bill Murray and What About Bob?" And uh this was like a loved film, PG. I thought this would be fine. They're 8 years old. And in the film, they use all these, you know, dick breath idiot, you know, they just do this thing. And then I went to school the next day and three parents cornered me here in the Bay Area. Can we talk to you about your film selection? My daughter came home and she said, "Dick breath." And I was like, "Have you seen What about Bob?" And the parent was like, "No." I was like, "You should watch it. It's incredible." Like our daughters are never coming over your house again. Right. Meanwhile, that same San Fran parents probably like, "Do you know there wasn't a single trans character in that movie?" And she said dick breath, but I think uh they should actually have dick breath because they should have dick breath because there's nothing that's off limits. Jason, we got uh two minutes to get through. Two minutes lightning round. Go. Okay. Biggest political winner is the Democratic Socialist of America. Okay. Sadly, biggest political winner. Well, this may be a talking point, but I'm going to say crypto. A year ago, there was a war on crypto. Okay. They were worried about going to jail. Now, we've passed legislation. We're getting a fair shake from the government. It's total change. Yeah. Incredible. You know, I had your pick, uh, Zoron, uh, Mani Socialism. I also had the America First movement that's, uh, burgeoning. But I gave it some thought and I thought, my lord, there's one individual who part time went to the government and took crypto and made it legal and created a framework for it. They made sure that America would be absolutely competitive in the AI race, the most important race of our lifetime and in fact in humanities. So hands down, my biggest political winner of 2025 is Mr. David Saxs. Okay. Political winner for you. You don't give a [ __ ] What do you think? Uh, a political winner for me, you know? I mean, I really, again, I'm just a big fan of this president. People can say that I'm I kiss ass and that and that comedians shouldn't. There's this thing that I've been hearing where people are like, you know, comedians should be punching up, not punching down. You're supposed to make fun of the big thing. Well, if nobody if everybody is making fun of that one thing, then I think it's kind of funny to go the other way and to push it up. So, I literally have in my standup set pro Trump jokes, which nobody's [ __ ] doing. Which one lands the most? I make fun of his autograph. If I say he has the most obnoxiously cool autograph in the world. It looks like Lizo's heart rate. And he actually does. My biggest political loser sacks, by the way, he does have the best sense of humor. Must be of any president we've ever had. Hysterical. Oh, I anyone who spent time with him is just blown away at just how funny he is all. All the best comedians talk about how he might be the funniest human being on planet Earth. This is a conversation I've had. I'm not going to name their names, but you can put it together in your head. I'm talking about the actual best comedians in the world. All of them. I believe all of them. Michael Richards. Um, no, I'm kidding. You know, you know, you know who the best are. And yes, they all agree. I mean, there's just there's funny is funny. It's undeniable. Literally. God damn it. I'm blanking out. This week he did something so [ __ ] Oh, the Somali thing. Yeah, it's a it's a hell hole. They come over here and they [ __ ] and complain. Like it's it's just common sense and that's the funniest. I still love when Zoran visited him and he says it's okay, you can say. I'm [ __ ] It's easier if you just tell them tell them, "Okay, yes." Okay, let's go. Come on. Let's keep going. Okay. Biggest political loser, Saxs.

My biggest political loser is Europe. M it's a civilization that's in decline. They're losing economically, geopolitically, socially, culturally, and they can't seem to reverse that trend. It's very sad. Political loser Freeberg, the founding fathers. Wow. Because I feel like free speech, property seizure rights, you know, we read this this excerpt from these two Thomas Jefferson letters, and you can read a lot of these. Just ask Gemini to tell you about some of the things that the founding fathers wrote. And if you spend time with them and translate them into modern English because they do write in a very poetic frilly way, there is so much of the principles and the founding fathers that are lost in how we are kind of devolving into this organizational system where the government is everything in our lives, everything in our country. The individual liberties are being taken from us. And and I don't mean taken from us in a sense that they're being seized. We're voting for a government that dictates our lives, that controls what we eat, how we eat, how we live, how we get paid, our checks. I think the majority of Americans today live on checks from the government through the government. And I think that the founding fathers would have been really um saddened at the state. I went with uh Well, well said. Well said. I went with um Steven Miller. I felt his performative cruelty uh was a detraction for the 47th administration. Um, what? And that was a uh that's a shame because I loved his band. Yeah. This is Biggest Political Loser. Yeah. Mine's Gavin Newsome. Yes. Yes. I mean, the hair is great. Yeah. Great hair. That's enough for you liberals to be impressed by. Absolutely. Oh, he's got hair. [ __ ] amazing. Uh, let's go with breakthrough of the year. Freeberg, what's your breakthrough of the year? Okay, we haven't talked about it on the show. This definitely deserves a science corner, but asteroid Bennu, NASA sent a probe. They pulled a bunch of samples up. 2020, they landed back on Earth 2023. 2 days ago, they showed that on asteroid Bennu, there is nucleic acids. There are amino acids, there are sugars, all of the building blocks of life were found on this asteroid floating through space. Wow. Can I can I ask you a question? Yeah. Did the asteroid make it to Uranus? Free, this is great, but you're putting the audience I honestly think just for a brief moment before we make the jokes, this is going to end up being one of the most like amazing discoveries of our lifetime because it really does show that life is not necessarily unique to planet Earth. This was a asteroid that's been floating around for 4 and a half billion years and it's got all the components of life on it. It's pretty incredible discovery. It's amazing. And it is made out of sugar. It's got sugar on it. It's got glucose on it. Freeberg, how many times have you masturbated to this asteroid so far? Um, all right. Uh my thank you. My breakthrough of the year is uh three or four humanoid robots. I think uh we're just underestimating the the progress these will have. Um everybody's going to get their own C3PO/Freeberg. So we won't be the only ones with a robot in our lives. Saxs, what was your biggest? I just said uh being able to use Starlink on commercial flights. I mean it's like you can actually use the internet now. Hold on a second. I'm calling [ __ ] You haven't been on a commercial flight since since Clinton was in office. Oh, that's that's true. I was I was doing it for you guys. I mean, honestly, when were when were you last on Last time you flew commercial? For you, Jake Ellis. For you. Thank you. Was Was it Is it more Is it more I'm on the people. I was thinking about you. Is it more than 10 years? More than 10 years since you've been on a commercial. I set the over under at 15 years. I haven't been on a commercial flight since um 2012. 2012. I don't know how to be real. I mean, what do you do like it? Jake, what's the Wi-Fi password on the Lolita Express? Apparently, it's one, two, three. Oh, is that two? Is that a strike? Really? Wait. Sorry. Sorry. Come back. Okay. I just We'll cut that. They said people see. By the way, why is it that all the liberal guests that you bring on the pod are like regular visitors to Little St. James, that's you're talking about what? All of your liberal buddies that you bring on the guy. Okay. But um he he did get some good um dating advice apparently. Um Oh, come on. CE CEO of the year, not named Elon Musk. We all consensus have to pick Jensen Wine. 33 years in the making. Built a flywheel, had the vision, stuck through it. ups and downs. For whatever people said every generation of the last 33 years, he kept building and this flywheel finally took off. And here's a crazy statistic. Nvidia 4.5 trillion market cap. That's up from 300 billion 36 months ago. So this is a company that in 36 months created $4.2 of market value. That's hundred billion every month for 3 years straight. It's incredible. I think it's insane. Max, who is your CEO of the year, not named Elon Musk? Well, that was a great one, but I'm going to go with Alex Karp because if you heard him, if you heard him speak at all in Summit, I think he brought down the house. He out Tucker Tucker. I mean, so in addition to Palanteer being a monster of the last year, I went with uh Nvidia, Trump's favorite company, and Jensen Wang as well. Let me just say again, even this isn't even though this isn't my territory, I want to give a shout out to a couple badass [ __ ] Nick Khan and Paul Le over at the WWE have taken on this massive historical company while you know and and and put it on have made so many huge deals with so many different networks to bring in so many big. Are you a WWE or a UFC guy? I'm both. You're both. If you had to only go to one. In fact, since this is the only place that it would be interesting to ever mention, I it was the only TKO is the only ever stock that I ever told my guy, my golf buddy who actually after years of insisting I should give him money to put in stocks, which I never believed in cuz I'm an Italian poor kid from Youngstown, Ohio. I believe before that just have cash in a shoe box is like the way to have money. But then the only heid was TKO because I Dana White knows how to put on a hell of a show and I know that obviously the WWE is always amazing and always growing. So it's the only one I ever told him to get. And we've seen, you know, whatever. And in my little world, did you buy the Nvidia? Yeah. Wild wild success. Yeah. So unlike Jal, you held the stock. Yeah. Yeah. Great. And by the way, we had Paul Le Triple H speak at the All-In Summit. So, nice. He's a big wrestler. I'm a big fan. Oh, I love that. I was just with him. I hung out with them just last night. Smackdown was in Austin. All right. Now, each host gets to pick their disclad of the year. The most disgraceful moment, person, company, or trend. Disgraciad of the year. Desraad. He was the best guy around. What about the people he murdered? You can act like a man. What did I do? He's just killed little [ __ ] man. You insulted him a little [ __ ] I'M SMART AND I WANT TO SPIT. WHAT'S WRONG with you? Your hair was in the toilet water. Disgusting. I had to suffocate you. You little It's a disgrace. Disgraciad. All right, discretzia.com. Tony, whenever you're ready, you can give us yours. But Freeberg, who's your discretzia? The crackdown on speech in Europe. Um 3,000 plus arrests in the UK for malicious communication, mostly fines, but also incarcerations, including recently calling a convicted rapist a pig and landed someone in jail. 84,000 politically motivated communications crimes in Germany. 6,000 defined hate crimes based on speech in France. across Europe. Uh this has become a major issue. Again, I'll reflect on Gavin Newsome vetoing SB771 in this state, but we were very close and I think it's very important that we pay attention to it. Saxs, that's a really good one. It's a good one. Well, I I would agree with that one, but the one I me I would choose is that at Stanford they said that if you're disabled, you get more time on tests and you can kind of be unproctored and kind of accommodations, right? So now 50% of students at Stanford say they're disabled. And you had a case to make yourself and you never pulled the Asberger's card. I never pulled that card. But anyway, but no, this is all part of a piece with grades. Basically, there's no grades anymore and everyone sort of claims to be disabled in order to get special advantages. Disgraciad. Disgraciad. My disclassiad uh was very good. Was socialism in New York, my hometown, uh absolutely disgraceful. Um and the actual true New Yorkers didn't vote for it, but the people who've been there for under 10 years did overwhelmingly discretion for me. Tony, who's your discretion for 2025?

Uh, I'd have to say the people that just cheered that people won't be leaving California next year in this crowd is the Disgracion. You guys realize there's other places, right? I was guilty of it, too. I lived in LA happily for almost 20 years. I loved it. I never I really never thought I would move to another place. as a touring comedian, you know, you go visit places and you would go back to LA. That was just the headquarters. It took so much chaos for me to even try to f to go to another place and fall in love with it. But um when you do try other places, you find that it's better than this and it's definitely better than this cuz LA is better than this and this is just the worst. And the world, and by the way, the world is laughing at you. And some of you are booing, but you're clearly not the ones making the money off the app that shows you where the [ __ ] on the sidewalks is in this hot [ __ ] dump that you call home. So anyway, you're the Discratia. I love it. Bringing the heat. See, I'm a real wrestling fan. I'll do a heel turn way to win the audience.

Listen, this has been absolutely amazing. Let's give it up for the one, the only Tony Hench. Your friend is unbelievable. I need to thank Tony. Tony, thank you for what you do. People don't have to agree with your speech. I feel it's really important that comedians um act as the flag bearers. Uh to keep freedom of speech alive, for all the the the jokes we can make about the things you say and the way you you offend people, I think that pushing the limits is so important. Um and for that, I appreciate what you do and love your work. Yeah. And then mostly we say honestly I think this is like the most fun uh Christmas party we've had ever ever and probably the most fun event we've ever had is because of Tony here. No question about it.
