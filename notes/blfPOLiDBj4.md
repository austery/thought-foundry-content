### 橄榄球与文化写作

**Gilbert Cruz**: 大家好，我是《**纽约时报书评**》的编辑**Gilbert Cruz**，这里是书评播客。现在是一月中旬，这意味着一些重要的橄榄球赛事正在进行。本周是**NCAA全国冠军赛**。本期节目发布时，**NFL联合会冠军赛**即将举行。而重头戏，**第60届超级碗**，将于2月8日举行。像我许多波多黎各家人一样，我几乎完全是为了**Bad Bunny**的中场秀才看的。那是因为我其实不怎么看橄榄球，这让本周的采访成为一个非常有趣的挑战。我正在与作家、评论家**Chuck Klosterman**交谈，他创作了十几本非虚构和虚构类书籍，也是新近出版的、标题非常直接的《**Football**》一书的作者。查克，我不太关心橄榄球，或者说任何运动，但我关心你、你的书以及你的思维方式，这就是为什么我很高兴本周能邀请你来，也是我读这本书的原因。欢迎来到书评播客。

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm **Gilbert Cruz**, editor of the **New York Times Book Review**, and this is the book review podcast. It's the middle of January, which means there is some major football happening. This week was the **NCAA National Championship** game. The weekend this episode is publishing. The **NFL Conference Championship** games are going to be taking place. And the big one, **Super Bowl 60**, is happening on February 8th. And like many members of my Puerto Rican family, I'm going to be watching almost entirely for **Bad Bunny**'s Hattime Show. And that's because I don't really watch football, which is going to make this week's interview a very fun challenge. I'm speaking with author, critic, the man behind a dozen books of non-fiction and fiction, and author of the newly released and very directly titled **Football**. Chuck, I don't care much about football or really any sport, but I do care about you and your books and the way you think, which is why I'm excited to have you on this week, which is why I read this book. Welcome to the book review podcast.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 谢谢你邀请我，也很感谢你在对橄榄球兴趣不大的情况下阅读了这本书。我确实发现我正在尝试穿针引线，处理一个非常奇怪、非常具体的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Thanks for having me on, and I appreciate you reading this book without having much interest in football. I do find that I am trying to thread sort of a strange very specific needle.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我认为当你写一本关于体育的书时，就会有这样的想法：这本书是写给那些痴迷于体育的人看的，还是写给那些对体育有某种审美距离，或者只是知道有这么回事的人看的？比如，如果我写一本关于树的书，没有人会说：“哦，你必须是个伐木工人才能喜欢这本书。”这种情况不会发生。所以，我试图兼顾这两种情况，我认识到其中的复杂性。所以，我最初对这次对话的想法是，我们将用一整集的时间让查克试图说服我关心体育。但我意识到一个人不能太自我中心。所以我们不会那样做。然而，我不得不想象，你关于这本书的许多采访都会是和那些对橄榄球投入感情的人进行的，因为橄榄球在美国确实是最大的事情。然而，正如你在新书开头所写：“我的目标市场是未出生的人，紧随其后的是最近出生的人，再紧随其后的是少数当下可能对我所写内容不感兴趣的成年人。那就是我。”你的书本质上是一系列散文。你论证了史上最伟大的球员，你探讨了加拿大橄榄球的奇特之处，对此我一无所知。你还论证了橄榄球最终可能如何失去人气。你关心橄榄球已经很长时间了。你是如何知道或决定现在是时候全身心投入写一本关于它的书了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I think when you write a book about a sport, there is this idea that well is this for people who are obsessed with it or is it for a person who has some aesthetic distance from this or just knows that it's going on. Like if I wrote a book about trees, no one would be like, well, you got to be a lumberjack to enjoy this. That doesn't really happen. So, I'm I'm trying to do both of those things and I recognize the complexity in that. So, my initial idea for this conversation was we're going to have an entire episode in which Chuck tries to convince me to care about sports. But I realized one can only be so self-involved. So, we're not going to do that. I have to imagine, however, that many of the interviews that you are going to do about this book are going to be with people who are invested in football given that it literally is the biggest thing in America. And yet, as you write at the beginning of your new book, quote, "My target market is the unborn, closely followed by the recently born, closely followed by a handful of present- day adults who likely have no interest in what I'm writing about. That's me." Your book is essentially a series of essays. You have an argument for the greatest player of all time. You have a look at the oddities of Canadian football, which I knew nothing about. An argument for how football might eventually die out in popularity. You've cared about football for a very long time. How did you know or decide that this was the moment to devote an entire book to it?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我想我一生中大部分时间，四十多年来，都在潜意识里思考着橄榄球。大概是二三十年前，我决定总有一天要写一本关于体育的书。我总是在我写的文化评论或流行文化评论中偶尔提及体育，但我想写一本真正的体育书籍。最初，我的想法是写篮球，但随着时间的推移，我越来越清楚，出于各种原因，它必须是关于橄榄球的。首先，它对整个文化的意义。我意识到，尽管我可能更喜欢篮球这项运动，但橄榄球在我生活中的作用是完全不成比例的，它完全超越了我对体育的兴趣以及观看和消费它的所有其他方面。所以，似乎如果你要写一本体育书籍，特别是与社会相关的，那么在美国只有一个选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I think I've unconsciously been thinking about football for most of my life, 40ome years or whatever. It was probably 20 years ago or 15 years ago where I decided at some point I do want to write a book about sports. You know, I've always mentioned sports here and there in the culture writing I had done or the kind of conventional pop culture writing I had done, but I wanted to do a like a real sports book. And I think initially my idea was it would be about basketball, but over time it became very clear to me it has to be about football for a variety of reasons. One, it's meaning to the culture at large. and my realization that even though I may love basketball as a game more, the role football plays in my life is completely outsized and completely dwarfs everything else in terms of my interest in sports and watching and consuming it. So, it seemed as though if you're going to do a sports book, particularly as it relates to society, there is only one choice in the United States.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你说你一生中大部分时间都是体育迷，正如你在书中写的那样，你从小就是个“橄榄球迷”。你喜欢**达拉斯牛仔队**。你在高中时踢橄榄球。据我所知，你进入新闻界的方式是你在大学时开始写体育报道。这件事情一直萦绕在你心头。然而，你最出名的是作为一名文化作家，一位出色的文化作家，喜欢思考我们消费文化和思考文化的复杂方式。橄榄球就是文化。你希望通过这本书实现什么？它是一系列散文。你试图解决什么问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And when you say you have been a sports fan for much of your life, as you write in this book, you from the time you were a child were football pill. You love the **Dallas Cowboys**. You played football in high school. The way that you got into journalism, as I understand it, is you started to write about sports in college. That is something that has been in your mind this entire time. Yet you are most well known for being a culture writer, a wonderful culture writer who loves to think through the naughty ways in which we consume culture and think about culture. Football is culture. What did you want to do with this book? It's a series of essays. Were there problems that you were trying to solve?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我不知道我是不是那样工作的。我总是用这个比喻：我觉得在我脑海里，我所有关于橄榄球的想法、感受、信念和思考，都像一团毛线，而写作的过程就是把线拉出来，把它理顺。所以我知道我想写一本关于橄榄球的书。它的意义，它如何强加于文化与文化渴望融入它的奇特结合。是什么让它与其他运动如此不同，特别是考虑到我确实设想在遥远的未来，橄榄球可能不会完全消失，但肯定会从文化中退去，那时的人们会试图解释发生了什么，它是什么，以及哪里出了问题，因为事情总是这样运作的。当你回顾曾经占据主导地位但现在不再占据主导地位的事物时，评估就变成了“是什么让它失败了？”我认为这些尝试通常是错误的。我们谈论爵士乐的意义以及为什么爵士乐不再是音乐文化的中心，这并不重要。我认为现在试图做出这类判断的人，并不能真正与实际发生的事情或真实感受保持一致。我认为他们会将现在投射到过去。所以我认为我要写一本书，在橄榄球处于巅峰时期，它就是如此。书中的数据是，2023年美国收视率最高的100个电视节目中，有93个是**NFL**比赛，还有三四个是大学比赛。它不可能比现在更受欢迎了。它是单一文化的终结。就像它和**泰勒·斯威夫特**就是全部。我想我现在就要写这本书。这是一个奇怪的设想，因为显然我正在做这个播客，我正在推广这本书，我试图把它卖给活着的人，但在我心里，我正在想象有人在读这本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I don't know if I work in that way. I the kind of the the analogy I always use about this is I feel like in my mind everything I've ever thought or felt or believed or considered about football is like a ball of yarn and then the process of writing is just pulling the string and straightening it all out. So I knew I wanted to write a book about football. The meaning of it, the strange combination of how it is imposed on culture and culture's desire to steer into it. what makes it so different from other sports and particularly since I do envision a time in a distant future when football maybe doesn't disappear entirely but definitely recedes from the culture and then there's going to be this attempt by people of that time to explain what happened what it was and what went wrong because this is always the way it works that you know you look back on something that was once dominant and is no longer dominant so the assessment has to be like well what made it fail and I think those attempts are usually wrong. I it doesn't really matter what if we're talking about like why what did jazz mean and why is jazz no longer the center of musical culture. I think people working now trying to make those kind of judgments would not really be in lock step with what really did happen or how it really did feel. I think they would be projecting the present onto the past. So I thought I'm going to write a book where when football is at its apex where it is and like the stats in the book are like in 2023 of the hundred most watched broadcasts on television in the United States 93 were **NFL** games and then three or four more were college games. Like it couldn't be really any more popular than it is. It is the end of the monoculture. Like that and **Taylor Swift** are it. And I thought I'm going to write this book now. It's a strange conceit because obviously I'm doing this podcast. I'm promoting this book. I'm trying to sell it to people who are alive, but in my mind, [laughter] I'm imagining someone reading this book.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 75年后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 75 years from now.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 然后他们会说：“哦，这就是当时发生的事情，这里有人试图解释它当时意味着什么。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And being like, "Oh, this was this thing that was happening, and here's someone trying to explain what it meant while it was going on."

</details>

### 橄榄球在美国社会中的主导地位

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在你与橄榄球的漫长关系中，是否有那么一个时刻，你突然意识到：“就是它了！这就是我认识的每个人，以及美国大多数人，都非常关心的事情。”有没有一场比赛？有没有一个时刻？有没有一个转折点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Was there a moment in the long arc of your relationship to football when you just realized this is this is it? This is the thing that everyone that I know that most people, many people in America care about as much as anything. Was there a game? Was there a moment? Was there a pivot point?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 没有。因为我确实认为在某些方面它是渐进的，是那种直到变得显而易见才被察觉的事情。在1970年代，橄榄球已经是美国最受欢迎的运动。当时几乎没有办法不把它看作是主导运动。但它并没有那样被讨论。它仍然被认为是“棒球是国球”，几乎是说我们仍然将这项运动视为定义国家的标志，而橄榄球只是受欢迎而已。但随着时间的推移，现在非常明显，棒球在很多方面只是一个巨大的小众兴趣。除了橄榄球，美国的所有运动在某种程度上都是小众兴趣。现在，**NBA**非常庞大，**NBA**球员的知名度也非常高，但作为一项运动，它的平衡几乎完全失调，坦白说，这说不通。在欧洲、南美洲和许多国家，足球几乎是唯一一项普遍受到喜爱的运动。然而，它并没有橄榄球在美国社会中那种主导地位，那种心理上的主导地位。它并没有渗透到方方面面。即使对于美国那些积极不喜欢它的人来说，它也仍然是一个影响他们生活的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: No. Because I do think in some ways it was gradual and one of those things that is invisible until it's obvious. In the 1970s, football was already the most popular sport in America. There was there really wasn't any way to view it as anything but the kind of the dominant sport. But it wasn't discussed that way. It was still seen as well baseball is the national pastime and it was almost that that we are still going to perceive this other sport as the thing that defines the country and the this football is just popular. But as time has moved on, it's now very palpable that baseball is in many ways just a huge niche interest. Every sport in the United States except football to some level is a niche interest. Now, the **NBA** is huge and **NBA** players are incredibly high-profile, but as a sport, it's almost completely out of balance in a way that that doesn't make sense to be honest. In Europe and in South America and many countries, it's like soccer is like the only sport that is universally beloved. And yet, it doesn't have the dominance, the psychological dominance that football has on American society. It doesn't imbue sort of everything. Even for people in the United States, it is even, I think, a factor in the lives of people who actively dislike it.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。那么，告诉我橄榄球是如何主宰我的生活的，尽管我刻意不参与其中。是因为我投入了一些情感，说我不是一个橄榄球爱好者，或者我不是一个关心橄榄球的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah. So, tell me how football rules my life even though I make it a point not to engage with football at all. Is it because I've invested some emotion into saying I am not a football guy or I'm not someone who cares about football?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我想最明显的答案就是我们正在做这个播客，对吧？这个话题在你心里并不是你生活的核心，但你几乎有一种无意识的理解，认为“我知道这很重要，我知道这比几乎任何事情都重要。”有时它只是很小的一部分，但我经常想到**Jay McInerney**的《**Bright Lights, Big City**》中的几段话，他走进一家酒吧，电视上正在播放体育赛事，我甚至不记得是不是橄榄球，我想可能是冰球，但他问了一个关于现在是第几节或第几局的问题，酒吧里的人说他错了，他提到他感觉自己“一生都将被排除在世界上最大的兄弟会之外”之类的。我记得我当时想到了这一点，因为我年轻时读过那本书，我从未想过人们会对他们认为不重要的事情产生焦虑和强烈的感觉，但他们理解它对其他人很重要，这让他们有点尴尬。橄榄球的语言中就有“政治橄榄球”这个说法，就像我们把它作为词汇的一部分，许多体育术语也是如此，但橄榄球有所不同。普遍的共识是橄榄球本质上是保守的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I guess the obvious answer is we're doing this podcast, right? like you you're this is a subject that within your mind it's not really central to how you live but yet there's almost an unconscious understanding like well I know this is big though I know this is bigger than almost anything I sometimes it's a very small part but I often think of this there's a couple paragraphs in **Jay McAernney**'s **Bright Lights, Big City** where he walks into a bar and there's like some sporting event on television I don't even think it's football I think it might be hockey in the book I can't remember that but he he asks a question about what quarter is it or what period is it and the guy at the bars he has it wrong and he mentions how he just feels like I'll live my whole life cut out of the world's biggest fraternity or whatever and I [snorts] I I remember thinking about that because that I read that book when I was relatively young and it had never occurred to me that people could have an anxiety and a strong feeling about something that they think really is unimportant but they're understanding that it matters to other people makes them it's like they're a bit awkward the language of Football has just the idea of a political football like the way we use it as part of the lexicon and many terms from sports do that but with football it is different. the fact that there is a universal understanding that football is fundamentally conservative coded.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 而且，如果你试图描绘一个抽象的橄榄球迷或抽象的橄榄球教练，即使没有个性，它也有其意义，那种术语本身以及随之而来的辅助观念，我认为确实具有凝聚力和具体性。作为一名热爱橄榄球并一直观看橄榄球的人，我曾有过只思考场上发生的事情的冲动。这本书中有些部分我确实谈到了场上具体发生的事情。但也有很多想法是关于观众的，以及橄榄球的几乎是漫画式的形象，以及它如何与其他人联系在一起。我完全明白你提到**Jay McInerney**书中那段简短文字时的意思。那种被排除在一个巨大兄弟会之外的感觉。我有一种负面影响的焦虑，也就是说，由于我对橄榄球，或者说对体育运动普遍缺乏投入，我实际上不知道如何与这个国家的大多数人互动，因为对他们来说，橄榄球和体育是一种通用语，无论你遇到谁，你都可以谈论一支球队，谈论最近发生的事情。你有一个有趣的故事，说你的妻子说：“我们要和一对你不怎么认识的夫妇出去吃饭。”你心里想：“天哪，我只希望这家伙是个体育迷。不然，我不知道该和他说些什么。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: and that the idea if you're trying to picture the abstract football fan or the abstract football coach it has a meaning even without personality that the sort of the the that term alone in what is assumed to be the ancillary ideas that go with that I just think are are really galvanizing concrete. I as someone who loves football and watches football all the time, there was this temptation to to just think about just what's on the field. And then there's some in this book where I talk about things that happen specifically on the field. But then there's a lot of ideas that are about, well, this is really about the audience and almost the caricature of what football is and how that is involved with other people. I know exactly what you're talking about when you reference that brief passage in **Jacob McEnney**'s book. The idea that there is this giant fraternity that you just are being left out of. I have the anxiety of negative influence which is the idea that yes I as a result of my lack of investment in football or maybe sports in general. I actually do not know how to interact with a large number of people in this country for whom football and sports is a lingua frana is something that no matter who you meet you can just talk about a team a recent thing that happened. You have this funny story saying when your wife says, "We're going to go out to dinner with this couple that you don't really know." You're saying in your mind, "God damn it, I just hope this guy is a sports fan. Cuz if not, I do not know what I'm going to talk to him about."

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 嗯，不是我不知道该和他说什么。可能有很多事情。我们可能有许多共同点，但如果他喜欢体育，这几乎超越了他的个性。他可能是一个混蛋，但他对**SEC橄榄球**很感兴趣，所以我们可以谈论那个。我有一部分对此感到有点羞愧，我觉得除非他有这些兴趣，否则我无法立即感到自在。但如果他有这些兴趣，我完全不在乎他是什么样的人。一切都很好。这很奇怪。就像这个“兄弟会”的事情一样，这对我来说很有趣。没有任何一个主题能有如此高比例的人拥有专家级的知识。我可以坐在机场的**Chili's**餐厅里，屏幕上播放着**ESPN**或其他什么，没有声音，旁边坐着一个人，我们开始谈论体育，特别是橄榄球的可能性很高，而这个人将拥有足够的知识，基本上可以上电视。他可能不是播音员，但他的知识几乎是相同的。这种情况经常发生。没有多少主题是这样的。我不能坐在那个**Chili's**里，开始和某人谈论现在电影界正在发生的事情。这个人可能有一线机会说：“哦，是的，我对**马丁·斯科塞斯**和所有这些都感兴趣。”但也有可能他们会觉得，这几乎是一个奇怪的对话切入点。而开始和喜欢体育的人谈论体育，从来都不会觉得奇怪。他们认为这是正常的交谈方式。我当然也这么认为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Well, it's not that I do not know. I don't know what I'm going to talk to him about. It might be a ton of things. There could be a ton of things that we have in common, but if he likes sports, it almost transcends what his personality is. he can be a jerk, but it's he's really interested in **SEC football**, so we can talk about that. And there's there's a part of me that's almost a little bit ashamed of that that I feel as though I can't immediately be comfortable with a guy unless he has these interests. But if he has these interests, I don't care what he's like at all. Everything is fine. It is it is bizarre. Like in this fraternity thing, like it is interesting to me. There is just no subject with a higher percentage of people who have an expert level knowledge of something. I can sit in an airport **chili** and they're showing **ESPN** or whatever on the screen there with the sound down and there'll be a guy sitting next to me and the likelihood that we start talking about sports, football in specific, and this guy will have enough knowledge to basically be on television. He might not be a broadcaster, but his knowledge is almost identical. And that happens a lot. There's not a lot of subjects like that. I can't sit down in that **chili** and start talking to somebody say about what's going on in film right now. There's a sliver of chance that the person might be like, "Oh yeah, I'm interested in **Marty Supreme** and all." But there's also a chance they're like, there would be a weird thing almost to enter the conversation with. It's never weird to start talking about sports with someone who likes sports. They think it's the normal way to talk. I certainly do.

</details>

### 橄榄球与美国社会精神

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。我被你书中的一段话吸引了。所以橄榄球，正如我们已经确立的，最显而易见的事情就是，它是美国最受欢迎的机构。你写道，它“通过在近乎完全控制的环境中产生一种混乱的自由感来模仿美国社会”。这句话让我思绪万千。但我很好奇，你觉得美国就是这种感觉吗？橄榄球是这种感觉吗？美国是这种感觉吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah. I was taken by a passage from from your book. So football, as we've established, uh the most obvious thing that's ever been said, is the most popular institution in the United States. And you write that it quote imitates American society by generating a sensation of chaotic freedom within an environment of near total control. And that just sent my mind spinning. But I'm curious, is that how America feels to you? That's how football feels? Is that how America feels?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 哦，绝对是。是的。而且这不是一个新现象。我觉得这是我一生中都感受到的东西。当你和来自其他国家的人交谈时，他们几乎是，我不知道，对美国人对自由的痴迷感到好笑或什么的。然而与此同时，对我来说，即使在我以任何政治背景思考它之前，它一直都是一件重要的事情。那种我对自己生活拥有自主权和主导权的想法。然而，社会并没有真正以我们真正自由的想法运作。它在这些限制中给人一种自由的幻觉。只要你不撞到那些墙，你就可以感到完全不受束缚。在你引用的那篇文章中，我谈到了艺术评论家**David Hickey**的另一篇文章，他写了《**Air**》，他写了一篇非常精彩的体育文章，叫做《**区域防守的异端**》（**The Heresy of Zone Defense**）。它是关于篮球的，特别是**Julius Erving**在1980年**NBA总决赛**对阵**湖人队**时的一个动作。但实际上他写的是，所有规则，甚至像章程或任何比赛的心态，都应该旨在最大化球员的自由，因为我们想要球员。我们就是为了看他们。我们喜欢这些球员，所以我们希望他们拥有无限的自由去行动和表达自己。橄榄球则恰恰相反。橄榄球是迄今为止最受控制的团队运动。即使是一个简单的战术，也是从新闻发布席传到场边，再由协调员通过无线电发射器发送给四分卫，然后四分卫查看他的腕带解锁密码，告诉其他10个人他们要做什么。这种情况一遍又一遍地发生。在很多方面，它几乎就像一个奇怪的过度系统化的公司情况。现在，当我这样描述它时，它似乎应该很糟糕。没有人应该想看这样条件的运动。然而，橄榄球却最受欢迎，正是因为这个原因。人们想要自己的自由。他们想要控制所有其他可以想象的事情。我认为这就是橄榄球在某些方面以无意识的方式与人们产生共鸣的原因之一。如果他们试图描述它，他们只会说：“哦，我喜欢，我只是喜欢放松地看这些比赛。我是**比尔队**的忠实粉丝，或者我是**巨人队**的忠实粉丝。”他们几乎试图将其简化为他们正在拥有的这种简单联系。我认为它并不简单。我认为它实际上相当深刻。我认为橄榄球在电视上传播的方式是一种极其复杂的符号学体验，如果你描述它，它会像一个真正的矛盾。它不应该奏效，但它比任何事情都奏效得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And that this is not a new phenomenon. I feel like this is something I've sensed my entire life. When you talk to people from other countries, they're almost I don't know amused or whatever by like the American obsession with freedom. And yet at the same time, that was always for me, even before I thought of it in any kind of political context. It was like that was always an important thing. The idea that I had autonomy over my own life and agency. And yet, society does not really operate with the idea that we are truly free. It's it gives the illusion of freedom within these kind of constraints. As long as you don't bump up against those walls, you can feel completely untethered. In that same essay that you're referencing, I talk about a different essay by the art critic **David Hickeyi** who wrote **Air** and he had this just amazing sports essay called **The Heresy of Zone Defense**. And it was about basketball, specifically a play by **Julius Irving** in the 1980 **NBA finals** against the **Lakers**. But really what he's writing about is that all rules or even like bylaws or just the mindset of any game should be to maximize the freedom of the players because we want the players. We that's what we're watching for. We like the guys so we want them to have unlimited freedom to do and express themselves. Football does the exact opposite. Football is by far the most controlled team sport imaginable. Even a single play comes in from the press box down to the sideline to a coordinator who sends the play in via a radio transmitter to the quarterback who then looks at his wristband to unlock the code to tell the other 10 guys what they're going to do. This happens over and over again. It is in many ways like almost like a like a bizarrely oversystemized corporate situation. Now, when I describe it like that, it seems like that should be terrible. Nobody should want to watch a sport with that with those conditions. And yet football's the most popular because of this. People want freedom for themselves. They want control for every other thing imaginable. And I think this is part of the reason why football in some ways resonates with people in an unconscious way. And if they're trying to describe it, they're just like, "Oh, I like to I just kind of like to space out and watch these games. I'm a big fan of the **Bills** or I'm a big fan of the **Giants** or whatever." They almost try to reduce it to this simple connection they're having. And I don't think it is simple. I think it's actually pretty profound. I think the way football is transmitted on television is kind of a a incredibly complicated semiodic experience that if you would if you described it would seem like a a real contradiction. It shouldn't work, but it works better than anything.

### 电视与橄榄球的共生关系

**Gilbert Cruz**: 你还写道，橄榄球的兴起与电视的兴起是并行的，这两者相互碰撞。橄榄球和电视确实是天作之合。橄榄球的成功离不开电视的兴起。电视的成功也许离不开体育的兴起，离不开橄榄球的兴起。而我们现在体验它的方式，可以说，当你退一步思考时，是极其 Bizarre 的，但实际上它完美地为我们正在体验的这项运动而设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You also write that the rise of football and the rise of television happened in parallel and these two things encountered each other. They're really made for each other, football and television. And football success could not have happened without the rise of television. Television success maybe could not have happened without the rise of sports, without the rise of football. And the way that we experience it now is arguably, when you step back and think about it, incredibly bizarre, but actually is perfectly designed for the sport that we are experiencing.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 确实如此，这很难简要描述。在某些方面，这本书在这方面有很多页的论述，但橄榄球是一种媒介化体验，即使没有媒体参与也是如此。即使有人在没有摄像机的高中比赛现场，站在边线区角观看15、16岁的年轻人踢橄榄球，他们也会将这种体验转变为媒介化体验，因为橄榄球与电视的结合不同于任何其他运动之间的关系。通常在体育运动中，电视体验的尝试是将现场体验转换为二维的观看物。好吧，冰球可能是一个例外，因为它总是现场观看更好。所有其他运动，你都可以争辩说，如果条件完美，现场观看更好，或者在电视上观看更好，因为橄榄球总是在电视上观看更好。没有多少理由去现场观看橄榄球比赛，但没有一个理由是“我想更好地观看比赛”。要真正观看比赛，它必须通过电视转播。即使你正在现场观看，你也会在脑海中思考它在电视上会如何呈现，以便理解它。

**Chuck Klosterman**: It is, and it's this is a hard thing to describe briefly. It's a it's many pages on this in some ways, but football is a mediated experience even when there is no media involved. That even if someone is at a high school game with no cameras, standing on the sideline in the corner of the end zone watching 15-year-old guys, 16-y old guys play football, they are transposing that experience into the mediated experience because football's marriage to television is unlike the relationship between any other sport. Typically in sports what the attempt of the televised experience is to transfer the live experience into a two-dimensional thing to watch. Okay, hockey might be is one exception because it's always better live. Every other sport you can really make an argument it's better live if the conditions are perfect or it's better on television because football is always better on TV. There aren't many reasons to go to a football game live, but none of them can be I want to see the game better. To really see the game, it has to be televised. And even if you're seeing it live, you are thinking in your mind how it would appear on television in order to understand it.

### 橄榄球的“11分钟”魅力

**Gilbert Cruz**: 在你为这本书做过的几次采访中，你都提到了《**华尔街日报**》2010年发表的一篇引人入胜的文章。这篇文章测量了四场**NFL**比赛的平均比赛时间，我相信，它得出结论，在3个小时里，实际上只有11分钟的实际行动。第一，你认为16年后，这个数字大体上仍然准确吗？第二，你认为11分钟的比赛时间对于一场橄榄球比赛来说，实际上是刚刚好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: In several interviews you've already done for this book, you've spoken about this fascinating article from 2010 published by the **Wall Street Journal**. The article measured the average amount of play over four **NFL** games, I believe, and it concluded that over 3 hours there actually were only 11 minutes of action. Now, one, do you think 16 years later that number is still generally right as far as you know? And number two, you think that 11 minutes of play is actually just fine for a football game?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我会说这不仅仅是刚刚好。我认为它几乎是完美的。也许如果我深入研究，我会觉得“如果能有13分钟就好了”，但在大多数情况下，是的，这个比例就是你想要的。当然，这看起来很疯狂。如果有人推销一项新运动，他们说：“我有一个很棒的游戏想法。”现在，有一个小小的转折。它在电视上播放三个小时，但只有11分钟的实际行动。人们会说：“这行不通。我们不会这么做。”就像如果你试图呈现一部动作电影，你说：“嗯，它有两个小时，但实际上只有125秒的动作。”他们会说：“那不是人们想要的。”然而，橄榄球的结构方式，那11分钟是理想的，因为有这些小片段，五到七秒的超动力、超暴力、极其复杂的动作发生，这创造了一种动态、快速移动、充满动作的感觉，你可以说是幻觉，但我会说是感觉。然而，橄榄球中所有那些什么都没发生的间隙，让它成为一种脑力体验，你在思考发生了什么以及为什么会发生。接下来会发生什么？对接下来会发生的事情有什么想法？你也可以思考与比赛无关的事情。你可以暂时思考自己的生活，然后重新投入。你可以以一种非常丰富和令人满意的方式与某人谈论你所看到的一切。这就像我整个职业生涯都在说：“嗯，这实际上是反直觉的。这与你所想的恰恰相反。”但这是我相当自信的一个例子。它不应该以这种方式运作。但橄榄球实际上提供了我们想要的娱乐视觉体验，而不是我们所描述的。我们所描述的我们想要的东西会非常不同。如果我们真的得到了它，它永远不会以这种方式成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I would say it's more than fine. I think it's almost perfect. I maybe if I really got into the research, I would be like, well, it'd be nice if it was 13 minutes, but for the most part, yeah, you know, that ratio was what you want. And of course, that seems insane. If someone was pitching a new sport and they were like, "I got this great idea for a game." Now, there's one kind of twist, though. It takes three hours on television and there's only 11 minutes of action. People would be like, "This is not going to work. We're not going to do that." In the same way that if you were trying to present an action movie, and you said like, "Well, it's 2 hours, but there's really only 125 seconds of action." They'd be like, "That's not what people want." And yet the way football is structured, those 11 minutes are ideal because there are these little snippets, you know, five to seven seconds of hyperinetic, superviolent, incredibly complex action happening, which creates the sensation, you could say the illusion, but I would say the sensation of something that is dynamic and fastm moving and filled with action. And yet the gaps in football all the time when nothing is happening allows it to take on this cerebral experience where you're thinking about what happened and why that happened. What will happen next? What is the thinking on what will happen next? You can also think about things unrelated to the game. You can think about your own life momentarily and then go back into the engagement. You can talk to someone about what you're seeing in a way that is very rich and satisfying. It is one of those things like my whole career is like me saying, "Well, this is actually counterintuitive. This is the opposite of what you think." But yet, this is one example where I'm pretty confident it is. It should not work the way it does. But football actually provides the visual experience of entertainment that we want, not what we would describe. What we would describe what we want would be a very different thing. And if we actually got it, it would never succeed in this way.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 正如你在书中写道，这与篮球形成对比。其他运动中，屏幕上不断有动作发生，正如你所说，如果橄榄球更接近篮球，它可能会让人应接不暇。这两种比赛为观众实现了不同的目标，并且它们都以自己的方式取得了成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: And this is in contrast, as you write in the book, to basketball. the other sports in which there's action constantly happening on screen and that as you say if football were closer to basketball it possibly would be overwhelming. The two games accomplish different things for the viewer and they both succeed in their own right.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 实际上有三种类型的电视体育节目。一种是像篮球、足球、拳击、赛车等某种程度上动作不停的持续催眠、迷人的事物。当然，在这些运动最精彩的时刻，它会以一种难以复制的方式令人兴奋。但也有很长一段时间，它会以一种消极的方式变得催眠，让你在精神上脱离。即使是一场精彩的**NBA季后赛**，有时在第二节或第三节也会有沉闷的时刻。然后还有一类是完全智力型或脑力型的运动，比如棒球和高尔夫，其中动作量很小。每个人都知道这一点，但你所观看的一切都是对意义的思考过程。这都是结局的序幕。你观看高尔夫时尤其如此。你看着一个人思考他将要打的一杆90秒。他打完球。然后我们讨论发生了什么两分钟。他走向球，接下来他会做什么？然后第三类是橄榄球，它在大部分时间里是第二类，但又注入了第一类中最强烈的例子。它感觉就像这两种范式的优点汇聚在了一起。我认为这是它在吸引消费者方面与众不同的一个重要原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: There's really three types of televised sports and one is this perpetual hypnotic mesmerizing thing like basketball, soccer, boxing, autoracing to some degree where the action is doesn't stop. Okay. And of course, in the greatest moments of those sports, it's electrifying in a way that's hard to replicate. But there are also long stretches where it becomes hypnotic in a negative way that you kind of mentally check out. Even a great **NBA playoff** game at times will have a dull moment in the second quarter or the third quarter. Then there's also this category of totally intellectual sports or cerebral sports like baseball and golf where the amount of action is tiny. Everyone knows it, but everything you watch is the thought process of what the meaning of this is. And it's all kind of prologue to the end. And you watch golf particularly. You watch a guy think about a shot he's going to take for 90 seconds. He takes the shot. Then we have two minutes of a discussion of what happened with it. And he's walking to the ball and what will he do next? And then the third category is football which is the second category most of the time but imbued and injected with the most intense example of that first category. And it feels like the strengths of both of those kind of paradigms coales in this one thing. And I think that's a big reason why it's so different than anything else in terms of how it appeals to the consumer.

### 橄榄球的保守主义与集体主义

**Gilbert Cruz**: 欢迎回来。这里是书评播客。我是**Gilbert Cruz**，本周与我一起的是《**Football**》的作者**Chuck Klosterman**。查克，在对话的早些时候，你提到了橄榄球在某种程度上带有保守主义的色彩。我们谈论了一点自由与控制。你是否认为现代橄榄球自上而下的企业性质与我们对这项运动、教练以及其运作方式所持的刻板保守观念之间存在某种联系？它们之间是否存在某种交集？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Welcome back. This is the book review podcast. I'm **Gilbert Cruz** and I'm joined this week by **Chuck Clustermanman**, author of **Football**. Chuck, earlier in the conversation you mentioned the idea that football is somewhat conservative coded. We talked a little bit about freedom versus control. Do you see a connection between the top-down corporate nature of modern football and the way in which the stereotypically conservative idea we've had about the sport and about the coaches and about the way that it is run? Do those intersect in some way?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我不知道它们是否有很多交集，但它们确实相互映照。在第一个例子中，当我们谈论整个世界时，这些事物被视为根本性的负面，对吧？对这种运作方式的描述似乎是自上而下的权力，你不会向某人描述它，然后他们会说“那是一个多么乌托邦的场景啊”。你不会那样说。但当它实际发生在橄榄球中，我们可以像模拟一样观看它，它的一个仿真物，那么它就是理想的。在第一类中，我们对此没有真正的选择。生活就是这样。我们无法逃避。我想你可以尝试像**泰德·卡钦斯基**那样逃避，但实际上不行。如果你要生活在社会中，你就要遵守这些规则，并接受世界就是这样运作的。但你可以在橄榄球中看到它，你实际上可以享受这种体验，你可以看到它以一种分散注意力、娱乐的方式运作，同时它对你来说也可以非常重要，但这是你的选择。你有能力选择观看或不观看，参与或不参与。你在生活中没有这种选择。我认为任何时候，一场比赛，或某种艺术形式，或一本书，或任何这些事物，能让人们以一种不像是被迫违背意愿的方式思考世界的真实面貌，我认为这有助于人们理解自己的生活。他们能够看到这件事，而不是把自己置身其中，但又以某种方式知道它发生的原因。它发生的原因与你生活中发生的一切事情的原因是相同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I don't know if it's so much that they intersect, but they do sort of reflect each other. And in the first example when we're talking about the world at large, these things are seen fundamentally negative, right? The description of how this would work seems as though you know it is like top down power and you wouldn't describe that to someone and they'd be like what a utopian scenario that is. You wouldn't say that. But then when it actually happens in football and we can watch it like a simulation of it, a simulacrum of it, then it's it's ideal. And in that first category, we don't really have a choice about it. It's like that's how life is. We can't escape from it. I guess you can try to **Ted Kazinski** and escape from it, but not really. For if you're going to live in society, you're going to live by these rules and have to accept that this is how the world works. But then you can see it in football and you can actually enjoy the the this like you you can see it work in a way that is a distraction, an entertainment, and also something that can be real important to you, but it's your choice. You have the ability to watch it or not watch it, to be involved or not involved. you don't have this in life. And I think anytime a game or some other idiom of art or a book or any of these things allows someone to think about how the world actually is in a way that does not seem as though it's almost forced against their will. I think that helps people understanding their life in a way. They're able to see this thing and not put themselves in it, but know in a way that there's a reason this is happening. the reason it's happening is the same reason that whatever is happening in your life is happening.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 与此相关的还有一件事，也许你告诉我你是否认为这是真的。再说一次，对于我们认为是美国运动的东西来说，这很奇怪，但橄榄球的集体性质。在某种程度上，橄榄球的反个人主义性质，与你书中提到的其他运动相反，在其他运动中，你真的可以投入到个人、个人成就、球员的名字中。当你观看橄榄球时，特别是只看一场比赛时，除非你下注或你有一个梦幻球队，否则它只是一场身体的碰撞，两队身体的碰撞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: There's also related to this something maybe you tell me if you think this is true. Again, this is very odd for something we considered to be the American sport, but the sort of the collective nature of football. the in a way the anti-individual nature of football as opposed to I think you say this in your book as opposed to other sports in which you really can get invested in individuals in individual achievement in names of players when you're looking at football particularly when just watching a game it is unless you're betting on it or you're or you have a fantasy team it is just a clash of bodies two sides of bodies.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 和颜色，是的，几乎是面无表情的机器人。四分卫很有名，但在很多方面，几乎所有其他人似乎都可以互换。如果你不真正了解他们的天赋或任何东西，他们就像是一个进攻截锋进来替换了前一个进攻截锋。你很容易完全没有注意到这一点。我认为这只是一个重要的讽刺。**NBA**一直强调这个想法。它就像是，谁是联盟的门面？谁是明星？我们如何让人们与**勒布朗·詹姆斯**或**斯蒂芬·库里**建立关系？在棒球中，现在**大谷翔平**也正在发生这样的事情，这些想法是，这个人能否代表联盟，让小孩子看到并想要在房间里贴海报等等。这非常可以理解，因为任何时候你试图推广任何东西，你都想推广它的人性方面。然而，橄榄球如此主导的原因恰恰相反。人们喜欢它的不是个人。它是比赛。是比赛本身。它不是以某种方式可以通过“我们会说服人们投资这个人”来销售的。这种情况偶尔会发生，但不多。橄榄球之所以能够以这种方式长期存在并不断变得更受欢迎，是因为它是少数不需要名人的事物之一。它是比赛本身。**NFL**会因为球员穿错袜子而罚款。他们不希望个人主义。他们公开反对个人主义。橄榄球教练告诉你的整个理念就是“牺牲小我”。在**NCAA冠军赛**后，**印第安纳州**的四分卫说：“我愿意为我的球队而死。”他说了两次他愿意为他的队友而死。当然，他不是字面意思，但在某种意义上，他是。他是在说，这是我承诺的体现，我的生命不如我们所有人的生命加起来那么重要。在每项运动中，每个团队运动中，你都有这个元素。但在橄榄球中，它实际上存在，在某种意义上，我们都理解这一点。橄榄球就像是美国最成功的社会主义延伸，至少是职业橄榄球，通过收入分享以及它如何使联盟成为现在的样子。这只是我刚才要说的许多矛盾之一，但矛盾使事物变得有趣。任何时候你谈论任何主题，你都知道你总是在提出一些观点，比如现在**HBO Max**正在发生什么，或者有人会说“嗯，那有点矛盾，因为这个那个”，嗯，这就是它有趣的地方。那些总是像“是的，那是真的，当然那也是真的”的事情，它延伸到了这个停滞无聊的宇宙中。它必须是要求人们认知失调的事物，它必须存在。我们需要它才能被点燃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: and colors yeah and almost faceless automatons in a way like the quarterbacks are famous, but in many ways the almost everyone else seems interchangeable. If you don't really have an understanding of their talent or anything, it's like they're just a guy comes in at offensive tackle and replaces the previous offensive tackle. It's very easy not to notice that at all. And this, I think, is just like an just a like an important irony. The **NBA** has always emphasized this idea. It's like, who's the face of the league? Who are the stars? How do we get people to to have a relationship with **LeBron James** or with **Steph Curry** in baseball that's happening now with **Okconi**, these ideas, could this guy be a representation of the league that little kids will see and want to have a poster on their room and all these things. And it's very understandable because anytime you're trying to sort of promote anything, you want to promote the human aspect of it. And yet, the reason football is so dominant is because it is the opposite. What people like about it are not the individuals. It is the game. It is the game itself. It is not there. There isn't some way that that it can be sold through like like a well, we're going to we're going to convince people to become invested in this guy. That happens every so often, but not that much. The reason football has been able to exist in this way over time and just continually get more popular is it's one of the few things where it is devoid of need for celebrity. It is the game itself. The **NFL** will find guys for wearing the wrong socks. They do not want individualism. They're openly against it. The whole idea of what a football coach tells you is sublimate yourself. In the **NCA championship** after the game, the quarterback for **Indiana** is like, "I would die for my team." He said this twice that he would die for his teammates. And now, of course, he doesn't mean that literally, but in a sense, he does. He's saying this is a a reflection of my commitment that my life does not mean as much as all our lives together. And in every sport, every team sport you have that element. But in football, it actually is there in in the sense that we all we all understand this. Football is like the most pro football at least like the most successful extension of socialism there is in the United States with revenue sharing and how it has made the league the what it is. It's just one of the many sort of paradoxes that I was just gonna say another contradiction and but contradictions make things interesting anytime you're talking about any subject you know it's always you're making some point about you know like what's happening with **HBO Max** now or someone say well that's kind of contradictory because of this that well that's why it's interesting like things that are always like yep that's true and of course that's true as well and that extends to this thing that is a stayed boring universe it has to be things that demand cognitive dissonance from people like it has to be there. We need that in order to be electrified.

### 融入橄榄球文化：赌博与幻想橄榄球

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我真的需要玩幻想橄榄球或成为赌徒才能关心橄榄球吗？说服我。我需要做什么？我觉得自己被排除在我们文化的一个巨大组成部分之外。我不能坐在机场的**Chili's**餐厅里和别人谈论我刚读过的**Percival Everett**的小说。他们根本不知道我在说什么。我想更接近人群。我想更接近我的同胞。帮帮我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Do I actually need to get into fantasy football or become a gambler in order to care about football? Convert me. What What do I need to do here? I feel like I'm left out of a giant part of our culture. I can't sit at an airport **chili**'s and talk to someone about the **Pful Everett** novel I just read. They're just going to have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. I want to be closer to people. I want to be closer to my fellow country people. Help me out.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 嗯，好吧，我说三件事。第一，我不想改变你，我也不认为你应该想被改变。我不认为这是你觉得自己被迫要做的事情，就像我认为在你生活的其他方面，你不会说：“嗯，其他人都是这么想的，所以我需要这么想。”或者说，我认为你作为一个人不是那样运作的。所以，我不认为你需要被改变。其次，如果你开始赌博或玩幻想橄榄球，你将在某些方面成为这方面的低级专家，即使你不看比赛，因为这两者都非常适合休闲消费者。比如，你可以在不看一场比赛的情况下赢得一个幻想橄榄球联赛。赌博的设置是为了让几乎所有提议都成为五五开的事情，但如果你开始赌博并开始观看比赛，你就会有所感觉。我不知道现在有多少人，比如当我与父亲们交谈时，我们所有的孩子都在一起，我们谈论体育，不可避免地会提到赌博，你会听到有人说：“哦，是的，你知道，前几天有一场沉闷的**北卡罗来纳州立大学**对**波士顿学院**的比赛，但在中场休息时，我拿出手机下了一些赌注，只是为了感受点什么。”就是这样。所以，我会让自己感觉，说出来听起来很悲伤，但与此同时，我完全明白它的意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Well, okay, I'll say three things. One is I don't think I I don't want to convert you and I don't think you should want to be converted. I don't think that is something that you should feel like I am compelled to do in the same way that I don't think in other aspects of your life that you would be like, well, everybody else thinks this, so I need to think this, too. Or that's not how I think you as a person operate. So, I don't think you need to be converted. Second of all, if you start gambling or playing fantasy football, you will become in some ways a low-level expert on this, even if you don't watch the games, because both of those things are really perfectly set up for the casual consumer. Like, you can win a fantasy football league and never watch a game. Gambling is set up to make almost every proposition a 50-50 thing, but if you start gambling and you start watching that game, you're going to feel something. I don't know how many guys now, like when I talk to dads, all our kids are together, we're talking about sports and inevitably gambling starts coming up and you'll just hear a guy saying like, "Oh yeah, you know, I was there's kind of a dull **NC State Boston College** game the other night and at halftime though I went on my phone and I made some bets just to feel something." That's what it is. So like I'm going to make myself feel like it's it sounds so sad when you say, but yet at the same time I know exactly what it means.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 第三件事，这也是我关于这本书最后想说的一点。我现在确实觉得，我认识到其中的复杂性。**Rush乐队**的**Geddy Lee**曾说过一句话，我总是想到它，他说：“喜欢重金属的人不认为**Rush**是金属乐队，但讨厌重金属的人却认为我们是金属乐队。所以我不知道我们的音乐是为谁而作。”这本书很有趣，因为这本书的某些方面确实是为那些一生都在思考橄榄球的人而写的，也有一些章节是为那些可能只知道橄榄球很受欢迎的人而写的。那么，朝这两个方向中的一个走会更好吗？但那不是我的风格。我就是那种会思考另一种人很多的人，我试图走中间路线，看看会发生什么。但我认为如果你能读懂并喜欢这本书，对我来说这是一种解脱，也是一件好事，就像如果我与一位**NFL**球探交谈，他们说：“我喜欢这本书。”我也会对此感到高兴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: The third thing is and this is like the last thing. Well, I kind of say about this book. I do feel now I I I recognize sort of the complexity of this. There was a quote once by **Getty Lee** of **Rush** and I just I always think of this and he was like he said people into heavy metal don't think **Rush** is a metal band and yet people who hate heavy metal assume we are a metal band. So I don't know who our music is for. It is interesting with this book because there are aspects of this book that are very much for people who like have thought about football their whole life and there are sections for people who maybe only know that football is popular. Now, would it have been better to go more in one of the two directions? But that's not how I am. I am one kind of person who thinks a lot about that other kind of person and I'm trying to go right down the middle and we'll see what happens. But I think if you were able to read this book and enjoy it, to me that's a relief to me and a and a good thing in the same way that if I talked to an **NFL** scout and they said like, "I like this book." I would feel good about that, too.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯，我很感谢一些脚注。我当时想：“你一直提到的**拉马尔·杰克逊**的那个战术是什么？”幸好这里有脚注。你写过两部小说，《**Downtown Owl**》和《**The Visible Man**》，但你主要是一位非虚构作家。我们正处于一个非虚构类书籍销量似乎正在下降的时期，仅仅根据数据来看。我们《**泰晤士书评**》报道，2025年非虚构类书籍销量仅比前一年下降了约2%，但这只是因为过去几年的一些巨著仍在持续销售。从一位出版了二十多年的作者的角度来看，同时作为**Chuck Klosterman**，一个思考媒体消费、思考人们与文化互动方式的人，你对非虚构类出版业有什么特别的观察？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, I was appreciative for some of the footnotes. I [laughter] was like, "What is this **Lamar Jackson** play that you keep referring to?" Thankfully, there's a footnote here. You've written two novels, **Downtown Owl** and **The Visible Man**, but you're primarily a writer of non-fiction. And we are in a moment where the non-fiction book appears, just based on the numbers, to be in a bit of a decline. We at the **Times Book Review** reported that in 2025, non-fiction sales were only down about 2% from the year prior, but that's only because of some huge titles from the past few years that have continued to sell. from the perspective of an author who has been publishing for more than two decades, but also as **Chuck Lerman**, someone who thinks about media consumption, who thinks about the way in which people interact with culture. What have you observed about non-fiction publishing in particular?

</details>

### 信息消费与出版业的变迁

**Chuck Klosterman**: 当我第一次在2001年左右开始出版书籍时，当时人们普遍的说法是，我们正处于一个非虚构时代。虚构类书籍甚至很难出版。这是一个非虚构的世界。现在，从统计数据来看，情况似乎完全相反。似乎很多出版社都是由专门面向女性读者的书籍支撑的，它们为所有人承担了所有重担。然后人们的评估是，男人不再读书了。男人以前读非虚构类书籍，现在不读了。有趣的是，男人可能不再像以前那样读书了，但他们阅读的量并没有减少。我认为，这是关键，我们现在整天都在阅读。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: When I got into this, when I first started publishing books in like 2001, kind of what the anecdotal thing people were saying is we're in a non-fiction era now. It's like like fiction is really hard to even get published. this is a non-fictional world. Now, statistically, it seems the complete opposite. It seems like like a lot of publishing houses are carried by especially books that are geared toward female audiences that they really they haul all the water for everyone. And then the p the assessment then people make is men just don't read books anymore. Men used to read non-fiction and now they don't. What is interesting is it's possible that men are not reading books the way they used to, but they're not reading less. I think, and this is real key, we're reading all day now.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 当然。当然。

**Chuck Klosterman**: 不停地读。比如，我一天中阅读的时间可能比我一生中任何时候都多，其中大部分都是肤浅、简洁、只有两句话的东西。但如果你整天都在阅读，这些累积起来就会削弱你为了乐趣而阅读的欲望。有些人会说：“我讨厌写作，但我喜欢写完的感觉。”在某些方面，我完全不是那样。我喜欢写作。出版是我在某些方面不喜欢的部分，但我喜欢“读过”的感觉胜过阅读本身。我年轻的时候，非常喜欢那种体验。我会逃离世界去读一本书。现在对我来说不再是那种感觉了。我猜这是因为我被迫或者说世界运作的方式让我不得不不停地阅读。所以，在一天结束时，在我睡觉之前，那个可能在1970年代我会读《**海鸥乔纳森**》或其他什么书的时间，现在电视上有一些东西可以扮演那个角色，比如**《黑道家族》**和**《广告狂人》**那些剧集，现在我们其实没有那么好的剧集了，**Plurbus**是唯一一部属于那个级别的，但如果你现在看**Plurbus**，它在很多方面都非常类似于阅读小说的体验，只不过它是一种被动体验。所以我不需要阅读关于角色并想象她长什么样。我不需要那样做。他们给我呈现了这些，我就可以思考内容，这不会以任何方式耗尽我的精力。我认为对很多人来说，他们会觉得这就是我正在进行的阅读。这不是一本书，但我正在电视上阅读这个东西，我不知道我是否与他们有那么大的不同。此外，作为一个喜欢体育的人，或者说一直喜欢体育的人，我想说的是，曾经有一段时间，你可以消费的体育节目数量是有限的。当我还是个孩子的时候，这现在听起来很疯狂，但在1980年代，每周通常只有一场大学橄榄球比赛供所有人观看。那是唯一的比赛。**ABC**可能有一场比赛。周六可能还有两场比赛，但**ESPN**上没有铺天盖地的比赛。现在，一周中的每一天都有橄榄球比赛。所以，如果你是一个过去非常期待那一场大学比赛和可能三场**NFL**比赛的人，现在你可以看30场比赛。当我还是个孩子的时候，我想看每一场比赛。我现在是成年人，我想看每一场比赛，但现在有30场。那我要花多少时间？我很不好意思，我为了看那些我必须看的橄榄球比赛，会经历多少想象，而这些比赛我在48小时内就会忘记。我会编造各种奇怪的借口，或者我会围绕这些事情安排我的生活。我录制了那么多比赛，然后当我妻子睡着后，我会在午夜或其他时间看这些大学橄榄球比赛，如果你问我为什么想看或者后来发生了什么，我可能会说，我模糊地记得，但它们都模糊在一起了。我不知道那是什么。它就像一种上瘾的东西。不过，我想这并不是一种可怕的瘾，因为它只是意味着我观看了一些不一定会改变我生活的东西。你没有伤害任何人，理论上说。你甚至没有伤害自己。

**Chuck Klosterman**: Constantly. Like I probably the number of minutes in a day that I read something I suspect is higher than it's ever been in my life, a ton of it is entirely shallow, concise, a limited two sentence thing. But if you read all day, the aggregate of that sort of takes away like the desire to read for pleasure. it. There are people who say things like, "I hate writing, but I love having written." In some ways, I'm not like that at all. I like writing. Publishing is the part that I don't like in some ways, but I like having read in a way more than reading. I don't I've when I was a young person though, I loved that experience so much. I would like escape from the world to read a book. It doesn't feel that way to me now. And I assume it is because I am sort of forced or the way the world works to just read constantly. So then at the end of the day before I go to sleep a time that maybe in the 1970s that's when I read **Jonathan Livingston seagull** or whatever what I would ever be reading then you know now there are things on television that fulfill that role like the and this really changed like with the **Sopranos** and **Madmen** and those shows and we don't really have shows actually that good anymore like **Plurbus** is the only one that's in that class where but if you're watching **Plurbus** now it is very similar to the experience of reading a novel in a lot of ways except it's a passive experience. So I don't have to read about the character and imagine what she looks like. I don't have to do that. They're giving me that and I can just think about the content in a way that is not like a it it doesn't really drain my mind in any way. It just and I think for a lot of people they're like this is the reading I'm doing. This is I'm It's not a book, but I'm reading this thing on television and I don't know if I'm that different than it. Plus, as somebody who like who likes sports now, okay, or always has like sports, but what I'm saying is there was a time when there was a limited amount of sports you could consume. When I was a This is so crazy now, but like in the 1980s, there was often one college football game on a week for everyone. That was the only game. There would be like a game on **ABC**. Maybe there'd be two games on Saturday, but there wasn't like wall-to-wall games on **ESPN**. Now there's football on every day of the week. So if you're a person who in the past was really looked forward to that one college game and like maybe the three **NFL** games you could watch, now you have 30 games you can watch. When I was a kid, I wanted to see every game. I'm an adult. I want to see every game, but now there are 30. That's like how much time do I like? It is. I am so embarrassed about the amount of imaginations I go through in order to see football games that I have to see that I will forget in 48 hours. [laughter] I have I'll make up all these weird excuses or I'll plan my life around things. I record so many games and then when my wife falls asleep, I'm watching these college football games at midnight or whatever that that if you asked me about why I wanted to watch it or what happened later, I'd be like, I vaguely remember, but they all blur together. I don't know what it is. It is like an addictive thing. Although, I guess it's not really a horrific addiction because it just means I watch something that doesn't necessarily change my life. You're not harming anyone else hypothetically. You're not harming yourself even.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那么，你现在是如何获取信息的呢？比如非虚构类。你发现了吗？你还在读非虚构类书籍吗？你听的非虚构类播客更多了吗？你现在是如何学习事物的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So, how do you consume information now? Like non-fiction. Do you find that? Are you still reading non-fiction books? Are you listening to more non-fiction podcast? How are you learning about things now?

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我不觉得我现在的信息不足，与过去相比。然而，我很难解释这个过程是如何进行的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I don't feel like I'm underinformed compared to how I was in the past. And yet, it's very hard for me to explain how that process is going on.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 现在有**Mark**写的《**Blank Space**》这本书。我现在正在读这本书。所以，作为一名作家，我仍然会读这些书。我仍然以一种奇怪的方式不断阅读非虚构类书籍。我不会从头到尾读完它们。我只读我需要的部分。所以，我觉得这就像一种功利主义的东西。我想正在发生的是，决定社交媒体的算法当然会响应我们阅读的其他东西。白天我查看新闻。我查看新闻，我查看体育。所以我只是不断地被喂食。任何时候你看到有趣的东西，你当然现在就有了这个过程：这是真的吗？这其中哪些元素是真的？这是什么？这是新闻报道还是激进主义？所以你必须基本上调查你吸收的东西，通过这种调查你就会变得知情。此外，这实际上我认为甚至在社交媒体之前就开始了，但现在非常真实。即使对于不使用社交媒体的人来说也是如此。似乎我认识的每个聪明人都变成了一家特殊兴趣报纸，每次我与某人交谈，他们都想向我爆料。这太疯狂了，比如，格陵兰岛会发生什么事，我发现的速度有多快，即使我没有刻意去寻找。这太疯狂了。我想我也是一样。你学到了一些有趣的东西。哦，我要给这两个朋友发短信，他们也会感兴趣。这几乎就像我们被大量错误信息淹没，其中夹杂着一些好信息，而你必须深入挖掘并找到它，这就是你变得知情的方式。

**Gilbert Cruz**: There's this book, **Blank Space**, now by this guy named **Mark**. I'm reading this book now, you know. So I read those books still for what I do as a writer. I am constantly reading non-fiction books in a weird way though. I'm not reading them cover to cover. I'm reading the parts I need. So it's I feel it's like a utilitarian thing. I suppose what is happening is the algorithms that dictate social media of course respond to the other things that we read. And during the day I look at news. I look at news and I look at sports. So I'm just getting it fed constantly. And anytime that you see something interesting, you then of course now have the process of what is this real? Like what element of this is real? What is this? Is this journalism or is this activism? So you have to basically investigate the thing that you absorb and through that investigation you become informed. Also this really started I think even before social media but now is very true. This is even true for people who aren't on social media. It seems as though every person I know who's smart has become a special interest newspaper that every time I talk to someone, they want to break news to me. It is crazy how like, oh, something's going to happen with Greenland. How fast I find out about that, even if I'm not trying. It's just it is crazy. And I'm I think I'm the same way. You learn something interesting. Oh, I'm going to text these two friends and they'll be interested, too. It is almost as though we're just flooded with a ton of bad information with some good information inside of that and having to drill down and find it is how you become informed.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 这在某种程度上是一个谜，有时我会知道一本新书要出版，或者一张新唱片要发行，我就会想我是怎么知道的？我记得90年代读《**娱乐周刊**》（**Entertainment Weekly**），其中一件事就是，你翻到书评页面，这里有本周要出版的14本大书，你翻到音乐版块，这里有所有新唱片，所有这些，甚至不是，我没有，它几乎与他们对这些事物的评价无关，而仅仅是这里有一个列表，好吧，这里是所有这些事物的列表，现在没有了，这本书就是这样，例如，据我所知，最大的障碍是让人们知道它存在。不是我无法说服他们它很好，或者它物有所值，或者他们是足够的橄榄球迷来享受它，或者这真的不重要。所有这些事情似乎都是次要的，只是某种程度上说服他们，或者不是说服他们，而是向他们解释它是一种可以购买的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: It is a mystery in a way like sometimes I will know a new book is coming out or I'll know a new record is about to be released and I'll be like how did I know this? I remember reading **Entertainment Weekly** in the 90s and one of the things about that was that like you go to the book page and here are the 14 big books coming out this week and you go to the music section here are all the new records here are all the and it was wasn't even I didn't it was almost it had less to do with what they were saying about these things but just the fact is here's the list okay here's the list of all these things and now there's that doesn't that's how it is this book for example the biggest obstacle as far as I can tell is having people know that it exists at all. It's not that I can't convince them that it's good or that it's worth the price or that they're enough of a football fan to enjoy or it doesn't really matter. All these things they seem secondary to just somehow convincing them or not convincing them, explaining to them that it's something that can be purchased.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。而唯一的方法显然就是铺天盖地地宣传，做所有这些播客，接受所有被要求的采访，我的意思是，唯一的方法。这感觉真的很奇怪。这感觉完全脱离了作家的身份。是的。2001年我刚开始的时候，就像是出版社告诉你该做哪些媒体宣传。他们会来找你，说：“哦，**芝加哥论坛报**想采访你，我觉得你应该做。”然后你等着，而现在，期望是你最好自己做这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah. And the only way to do it apparently is to just flood the zone and do all of these podcasts and do every interview I'm asked about and do I mean the only way. It feels real weird. It feels completely detached from being a writer. Yeah. In 2001 when I started it was like the it was like the publishing house told you like what media you would do. They would come to you and be like, "Oh, the **Chicago Tribune** wants to talk to you and I think you should do it or whatever." And then you'd wait and you now the expectation is you better do this yourself.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我知道成为一个有趣的播客嘉宾会有帮助。我明白，它不会改变书本本身的内容。但就像，我确实想知道对于那些真正的天才作家，他们就是不善言辞，那会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I know it helps to be an entertaining podcast guest. I understand that you like it it's it doesn't mean the doesn't change the book at all with between the covers is what it is. But like going and I do wonder what it must be like for the true genius writer who just can't talk to people.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 绝对是。去年秋天有多少人知道**托马斯·品钦**有新小说？也许他是个不好的例子，因为他是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Absolutely. How many people knew that there was a new **Thomas Pinchan** novel last fall? Maybe he's a bad example because he's one of the.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 好吧，这是一个很好的例子。我知道。我是怎么知道的？我甚至不确定那是怎么发生的。是谁告诉我的？因为我认为即使是五六年前，**Twitter**也不同了，你会说：“好吧，我要关注这些人，这些人将是告诉我消息的人。”但现在不是这样了。现在很多人以前在**Twitter**上，现在他们不在了。他们去了不同的平台，因为有所有这些不同的信息孤岛，比如**Blue Sky**、**Mastodon**和**Threads**等等。你可能会发现，在一个平台上发生的大事，在另一个平台上却完全不为人知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Okay, it's a great example. I did. How did I know that? I I'm not exactly even sure how that happened. Who was the person who told me that? Because I think even just say five years ago or six years ago like **Twitter** was different and you would say, "Okay, I'm going to follow these people and these are the people who are going to be served as the people who tell me." But now that's not the way it works. It's like a a lot of people who were on **Twitter** like they aren't anymore. They've went to a different and because there's all these different sort of silos like **blue sky** and **mastadon** and **threads** and all these things. It's you things can be happening in huge in one and completely unknown in the other.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 绝对是。当你提到翻阅《**娱乐周刊**》的书评页面时，那是我在纽约市出版界开始职业生涯的地方，我在《**娱乐周刊**》做图书助理，那仍然是我做过的最好的工作之一，或者当我年轻时读《**Spin**》杂志，看封面人物，翻到评论页面，那是一种主动的行为。我觉得你现在说的几乎是，信息就在空气中，它是被动的。我只是通过手机上的提醒接收它，我在**Instagram**上看到它被提及，我看着标题，我没有主动搜索任何东西，但它以某种方式向我涌来，其中一些东西非常棒，很高兴知道每个人都喜欢**Geese**乐队，过去我会有一个专门阅读该乐队简介或评论的地方，然后我就会喜欢上它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Absolutely. When you talk about going to the book pages and **EW**, which is where I started my career in New York City publishing, working as a books assistant at **Entertainment Weekly**, one of the best jobs I still have ever had, or when I was younger reading **Spin magazine**, seeing who's on the cover going to the review pages, it was an active thing. I feel like what you're talking about is almost there's just there's information in the air and it's passive. I'm just receiving it through alerts in my phone and I see it mentioned on **Instagram** and I'm looking at headlines and I'm not searching anything out but it's coming to me in some ways and some of that stuff is very it's great to know that everyone is into **geese** in the past I would have there would have been a place where I specifically read a profile or a review of that band and then I would have been into it.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 不仅仅是那样，就像**Geese**乐队一样，所有事情都同时发生，你听到关于乐队的消息，听到人们对它的反应，以及乐队本身，你几乎同时了解所有这些。就像谈到**Spin**杂志，我记得读到**Pavement**乐队。最初对一个乐队名叫**Pavement**感到好笑，读到对他们的狂热评论，然后想，我不知道我是否会喜欢这个。我读着那个人说的话，他描述的方式似乎我可能会喜欢它。也许它会让我反感。我去唱片店。他们还没有，因为事实证明**Spin**杂志在它发行前六周就评论了它，当时就是这样。然后等待它，然后终于得到它。然后回想起对我描述的实际体验，以及这些事情如何相似或不同，或者也许因为对我描述而听到一些改善了体验的东西，如果我只是播放它，我甚至不会意识到，这非常奇怪。我的一个朋友现在回她父母家了，她正在整理她所有的旧物。有一本书在2001年或2002年出版。我想它叫《**Or Not to Be**》。它是一本自杀笔记合集。有人把各种自杀笔记汇编成了一本书。当我遇到这个女人时，我们因为我们都有这本书而结缘。她找到了这本书，我们说：“哈哈，还记得这个吗？”然后我们想，我们是怎么找到那本书的？我们只是走进一家媒体店或**巴诺书店**（**Barnes & Noble**）逛逛，然后偶然发现的吗？是《**GQ**》或《**Esquire**》或其他什么杂志写过它吗？我们读了同一篇文章，因为它是一件很奇怪的事情，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: and not just that but it's like the thing like **Geese** for example it's like all the things happen at once you hearing about the and hearing what people react to it and the band itself you all kind of learn about in the same time. Like talking about **Spin**, man, I remember reading about the band **Pavement**. Initially being amused that a band was called **Pavement**, reading about them just being rapodic about it and then being like, I wonder if I would be into this. I'm reading what the guy says and the way he describes it seems like maybe I'll love it. Maybe it'll repel me going to the record store. They don't have it yet because it turns out that they **spin** reviewed it like six weeks before it came out because that's how it was. So then waiting for it, then finally getting it. Then thinking back to what was described to me in the actual experience and how those things are similar or different or maybe hearing things because it was described to me that improve the experience that I wouldn't have even recognized if I had just played it is very weird. A friend of mine is back home with at her parents house now and she's going through all her old stuff. And there was this book that came out in 2001 or 2002. It was like a I think it was called **Or Not to Be**. It was a collection of suicide notes. Someone had put a book together of just various suicide notes. And when I had met this woman, we had bonded over. We both had this book. And she found this book and we was, "Haha, remember this." And then we were like, you know, how did we find that book? Did we just go into like a media play or a **Barnes & Noble** and walk around and come across it? Did **GQ** or **Esquire** or something write about it? We read the same artic because it's such an odd thing, right?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 现在他们必须知道书名和作者，这就是复杂性的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Now they got to know the title author and that is part of the complexity.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 这就是你把它命名为《**Football**》的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Is that why you named it just football?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 从技术上讲，那是一个错误，对吧？因为他们说，我想是**SEO**或其他什么，你永远不会，它永远不会出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Technically that was a mistake right because they say I guess the **SEO** or whatever that you'll never it'll never come up.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 如果我谷歌你的书名，天哪，还有所有这些其他东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: If I'm googling the title of your book shoot there's all this other stuff.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 我把它命名为《**Football**》是因为它就是关于这个的。那不是最初的书名。有很多书名，然后有很多副标题。但后来在某个时候，我就想，我就是要直说它是什么。我希望它，我只是觉得非虚构类书籍的副标题通常比书名重要得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: I called it football because that's what it's about. That wasn't the original title. There was a bunch of titles and then there was a bunch of subtitles. But then at some point I was like I'm just gonna say what it is. Like I want this to I I just even the let's feel like the subtitle in in non-fiction is often much more important than the title.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 它们之所以那么长，是因为你必须把所有这些都塞进去，这些是这本书的三个主题，或者诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: They're so long because you have to fit in all that this these are three things that the book is about or what have you.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 它们最终完全扭曲了这本书的意义，以及人们对这本书的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: And they end up completely warping what the book is about, the perception of the book.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 如果人们看到那个副标题，他们就会通过“这就是意图”的视角来阅读书中的每一行。而我当时想，我要把它拿掉。我要把它拿掉，我不想让人们说：“哦，这是一本关于橄榄球的书，但它实际上是关于这个的。”它真正是什么，就是书名。它就是这样。而且，我还想，好吧，**Walter Camp**，橄榄球之父什么的，他在19世纪末写了一本名为《**Football**》的书。它几乎是橄榄球的圣经。里面有所有橄榄球的规则，它们应该是什么，所有策略，还有关于**拿破仑**以及橄榄球与战争的关系等等。这本书很有趣，它就是《**Football**》。然后我想，我想知道20世纪还有谁写过一本就叫《**Football**》的书。真的没有。所以我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: If people see that subtitle, they're going to read every line in that book through the lens that this is what the intention is. And I was like, I'm going to take that away. I'm because I'm going to take away I don't want people to be like, "Oh, it's a book about football, but it's really about this. What it really is is the title." That's what it is. And also, I just I also thought, okay, so **Walter Camp**, the godfather of football or whatever, he wrote a book called **Football** in the late 19th century. And it's as close to a Bible of football there is. It's all the rules of football, what they should be, all the strategies, also stuff about **Napoleon** and like football's relationship to warfare and all these things. It's kind of interesting this book that came out just football. And then I was like, I wonder who else has written a book just called football in the 20th century. And there was really nothing. So I was like,

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这是我的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: it's mine.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 是的。我不仅要拥有它，而且在某些方面，这是一种致敬。我对体育史很感兴趣，这就像是一种连接回过去的方式。而且，这样做也确实有点大胆。我总是想到**诺亚·鲍姆巴赫**的电影《**婚姻故事**》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Yeah. I'm going to not just mine, but like this is in some ways it is a way to pay homage. I'm interested in the history of sport where this is like a connecting back to it. And also it's it is a little bit it is a little bit audacious maybe to just do it. I always think that there was that movie that **Noah Bombbeck** movie **marriage story**.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 如果它叫《**一个婚姻故事**》，那它就是一部不同的电影。但通过称之为《**婚姻故事**》，它意味着这就是婚姻中发生的事情。当**莉娜·杜汉姆**制作《**女孩们**》（**Girls**）时，如果那部剧叫《**汉娜**》，那它就像是关于这个角色的。那会非常不同。通过称之为《**女孩们**》，它确实获得了更深层的意义，是一个更大胆的举动。现在，你不想为了大胆而大胆，但我被那种冒险所吸引。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: That's a different movie if it's called a **marriage story**. But by calling it **Marriage Story**, it means that this is what happens in marriages. When **Lena Dunham** made **girls**, okay, if that show had been called **Hannah**, and it was like, oh, it's about this character. That's very different. By calling it **Girls**, it did take on a deeper meaning and was a bolder move. And now, you don't want to be bold just for the sake of boldness, but I'm attracted to that gamble. Yeah.

</details>

**Chuck Klosterman**: 就像，这不是众多关于橄榄球的书之一。我希望它是它自己的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chuck Klosterman**: Like, this isn't one of many books about football. This is its own thing. I hope.

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯，查克，令我生活中一些人沮丧的是，由于读了这本书，由于我们的对话，我可能真的会开始多看一点橄榄球了。

**Gilbert Cruz**: Well, Chuck, to the dismay of some in my life, I may actually start watching a tiny bit more football as a result of reading this book, as a result of our conversation.
