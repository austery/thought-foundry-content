### 节目开场与嘉宾介绍

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 想象一下巧克力的外衣。你希望它闪亮，希望它清脆，希望它薄而均匀，并且与包裹的内馅和谐统一。这需要高超的技艺，也确实能极大地提升你品尝巧克力的整体体验。我是**Christine Sir Cleette**。

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Think about the coating on a chocolate. You want it to be shiny. You want it to snap. You want it to be thin and uniform and also in harmony with the filling that is covering. And that requires a great amount of skill and also really adds to your overall experience of tasting the chocolate.

</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我是**Rosie Garin**。你正在收听**Wirecutter Show**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I'm Rosie Garin. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: **Rosie**，你好。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Rosie, hello.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 今天会是我们做过的最喜欢的一期节目，我保证，因为我们将品尝一些美味的巧克力。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: It's going to be your favorite episode we've ever done today. I guarantee because we are going to get to taste some amazing chocolates.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我确实喜欢巧克力。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I do love chocolate.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的，现在是情人节前夕。我们绞尽脑汁，这期节目能做些什么呢？**Wirecutter**涵盖了很多适合的话题，但我们还没有涉及盒装巧克力。我们有一份非常棒的盒装巧克力指南。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: So, yeah, it's the run-up to Valentine's Day. We were racking our brains. What could we do for this episode? There are so many things Wire Cutter covers that would be appropriate, but we haven't covered box chocolates yet. And we have a really, really great guide to box chocolates.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我喜欢你一直温和地推动我们做这期节目。我有点不高兴它花了这么长时间，但现在正是时候。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I like that you've been gently nudging us toward this episode for a long time. And I'm sort of upset that it's taken this long, but there's no time like the present.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 嗯，好主意永远是好主意。所以，今天我们要请来**Gabriella Gersonen**。她是**Wirecutter**的厨房编辑，负责我们所有的口味测试。所以，她的工作非常有趣。她一直在我们办公室协调口味测试。她还是一位经验丰富的食品作家，拥有超过20年的食品写作、品尝和从事食品记者工作的经验。她曾凭借与他人合著的**《Love Japan》**一书获得**James Beard Award**。她对巧克力了解很多。为了我们的盒装巧克力指南，她品尝了近二十个品牌的巧克力。所以，她会带着真正的知识来和我们分享。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Well, a good idea is always a good idea. So, today we are going to bring on Gabriella Gersonen. She is Wire Cutters kitchen editor who oversees all of our taste tests. So, she has a really fun job. She is coordinating taste tests in our office all the time. She's also a seasoned food writer. She has over 20 years of experience writing about food, tasting food, doing all the food things that food journalists do. She has won a James Beard Award for a book she co-wrote called Love Japan. And she knows a ton about chocolate. For our guide to box chocolates, she's tasted close to two dozen brands of chocolate. So, she's going to come in with some real knowledge for us.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我要抢她的工作。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I'm coming for her job.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的。好的，我们休息一下再和**Gabby**聊，稍后我们要吃一些巧克力。没错，那会很棒。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah. All right, we're going to talk to Gabby after the break and later we're going to eat some chocolate. That's right. And it's going to be great.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我很兴奋。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I'm excited.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 马上回来。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Be right back.
</details>

### 巧克力评测工作与标准

**Christine Sir Cleette**: **Gabriella**，欢迎来到**Wirecutter Show**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Gabriella, welcome to the Wire Cutter Show.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 谢谢邀请。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Thank you for having me.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 非常高兴能邀请你。我想，我们从最重要的问题开始：你是如何得到这份测试盒装巧克力的工作的？因为它听起来很糟糕。我真的很抱歉你接到了这个任务。它是如何演变而来的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Very happy to have you. Um, starting with the most important question, I think, which is how did you end up with the job of testing box chocolates cuz it sounds awful. I'm really sorry that you ended up with the assignment. How did it evolve?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 这很难。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: It's been hard.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是啊。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是啊。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Yeah.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。嗯，我们做一份指南，然后我们再做一次，再做一次，再做一次。很多时候，作者一开始可能对主题充满热情，但几年后，他们就准备把它交出去了。所以，我从我的同事**Leslie Stockton**那里继承了这份指南，我紧紧抓住它，不打算放手。所以，大家不要有任何想法。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yeah. Well, we do a guide once, then we do it again, and we do it again, and we do it again. And a lot of the times, the authors might start off very much energized by the subject matter, and then after, I don't know, a handful of years, they're ready to hand it off. So, I inherited this guide from my colleague Leslie Stockton, and I I just grabbed on really tight, and I'm not going to let go. So, don't get any ideas, anyone.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 嗯，我很好奇。有这么多盒装巧克力可供选择，而且我确定总会有很多新产品不断涌现。那么，你是如何筛选出要测试的巧克力，以及你在盒装巧克力中寻找什么样的标准呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Well, I'm curious. There are so many box chocolates to choose from and I'm sure there's a ton that just crop up all the time. So, how did you go about sort of narrowing down what you were going to test for this guide and what are the kind of criteria you're looking for in box chocolate?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 嗯，有一个基本标准，我们真正追求的是**品质**和**美味**。所以，当我们谈论**品质**时，我们指的是**食材的纯度**。高质量的巧克力通常由**可可块**、**可可脂**和**糖**制成，不含**植物油**，因为植物油可以用来补充低质量的巧克力，但会真正改变巧克力的风味和口感。食材的质量也延伸到内馅。所以，你不希望看到**人工香料**。你希望看到新鲜、高质量的食材，比如**乳制品**、**坚果**、**香草**、**水果**。这在品尝时会非常明显。当你吃东西时，好的食材是无法替代的。就像意大利菜非常简单，因为它完全依赖于食材的质量。这个原则确实适用于我们所有的测试，在盒装巧克力中尤其重要，因为市面上有很多有趣又美味的产品，但它们是糖果，而不是高质量的糖果。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Well, there is a baseline criteria and what we're really looking for is quality and deliciousness. And so, when we're talking about quality, we're talking about purity of ingredients. So high quality chocolate usually which is made from cocoa mass, cocoa butter and sugar and is lacking vegetable oils for instance which can be used to supplement lower quality chocolates but really change the flavor and the mouth feel of the chocolate. Quality of ingredients also extends to the filling. So you don't want to be seeing artificial flavors. You want to be seeing fresh, high quality ingredients like dairy, nuts, herbs, fruit. It really comes across in the tasting. There's there's no substituting a good ingredient when you are eating. It's like, you know, Italian cooking is very simple because it all relies on the quality of the ingredients. And the principle really carries over to all of our testing and it's especially relevant in boxed chocolates because there are so many products out there that are fun and tasty, but they're candy. They're not a high quality confection.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 那么，如果看盒装巧克力的配料表，如果有很多你无法发音的词，是不是就说明它可能不含最高质量的食材？它应该很简单，应该是一些你大致了解的东西。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: So, is it fair to say if you're looking at an ingredient list on a box of chocolate and there are a bunch of words you can't pronounce, it's probably a good sign that it doesn't have like the highest quality ingredients. It should be simple. It should be things that you kind of understand what they are.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。除非是某种你无法发音的南美**可可豆荚**的名字，那可能是一个好兆头。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. Unless there's some cacao pod from South America whose name you can't pronounce, which is probably a good sign.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 好的，好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Okay. Okay.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 还有其他你测试的品质吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Are there any other qualities that you're testing for?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 当然。盒装巧克力真的很有趣。它们不仅仅是一个食谱，它们是一种**工艺**。所以，制作盒装巧克力的人需要考虑很多因素，才能创造出这种小巧精致的食用体验。想想巧克力的外衣。你希望它闪亮，希望它清脆，希望它薄而均匀，并且与包裹的内馅和谐统一。这需要高超的技艺，也确实能极大地提升你品尝巧克力的整体体验和风味。你在餐厅看菜单，点了一份**核桃派**，结果端上来只有三颗核桃。你会说：“嗯，这应该叫**黄油挞**，因为里面根本没有核桃。”所以，每盒巧克力的小标签或说明书上都有一个**期望管理**。那里有一种承诺。当你品尝那块巧克力时，你希望巧克力的风味能与它的承诺相符。你希望巧克力以一种愉悦的方式覆盖你的口腔，而不是蜡质或油腻的方式。你希望风味在达到你的体温时绽放开来。还有**视觉元素**。你希望它看起来开胃。你希望盒子很漂亮。你希望它以预期的包装方式送达，而不是被晃动或压坏。这也是**Wirecutter**的一个考量，因为我们经常告诉人们通过邮购购买东西。我们必须向他们保证，是的，你为一盒巧克力支付90美元，其中很大一部分是运费，但它们会完好无损地送达。所以，仅仅告诉你这些就有点压力，因为你真的必须全力以赴才能制作出美丽又美味的盒装巧克力。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Absolutely. So, box chocolates are really interesting. They're not just a a recipe. They're a craft. So, the person who is making a box of chocolates has so many factors to work into this little tiny edible experience. So, think about the coating on a chocolate. You want it to be shiny. You want it to snap. You want it to be thin and uniform and also in harmony with the filling that is covering. And that requires a great amount of skill and also really adds to your overall experience of tasting the chocolate and flavor. You look at the menu at a restaurant and you order a pecan pie and it shows up and there's like three pecans in it. You're like, "Well, this should just be called a butter tart because there's no pecans in it." So, there is a managing of expectations on the little key or legend in every chocolate box. There is kind of a promise that exists. And when you taste that chocolate, you want the flavor of the chocolate to match up to the promise of it. You want the chocolate to coat your mouth in a pleasant way, not in a a waxy, oily way. Uh, you want flavor to bloom and open up as it reaches your body temperature. There's also a visual element. You want it to look appetizing. You want the box to be pretty. You want it to come packaged the way it was intended to and not all jostled and dented. And that is a consideration also with Wire Cutter because we're telling people to buy things through mail order a lot of the time. and we have to reassure them that yes, you're paying $90 for a box of chocolates and a lot of that is going into shipping, but they're going to show up looking good. So, it's kind of stressful just telling you all about it because you really have to be on your game to put out a beautiful and delicious box of chocolates.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我的意思是，所有这些都让我觉得如此**感性**，对吧？它就像是动用了所有的感官，这使得它成为一份很棒的**情人节礼物**，对吧？如果你真的收到一盒精美的巧克力，如果你曾经体验过，那真的是非常非常特别的，而且你仿佛在享受每一颗，可以细细品味。这不是那种你想狼吞虎咽的东西，你知道，它是一种体验。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: I mean, all of that strikes me as so sensuous, right? It's like using all the senses, which makes a great Valentine's gift, right? If you really get a nice box of chocolates, if you've ever experienced that, it is really, really special and it's kind of like you enjoy each one and it's like you can savor them. It's not something you want to gobble, you know, experiential.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的，没错。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes, exactly.
</details>

### 盒装巧克力的不同类别

**Kyra Blackwell**: 那么，考虑到**Wirecutter**多年来测试过的40多个盒装巧克力品牌，你能谈谈盒装巧克力可能属于哪些不同类别吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: So, thinking about the 40 plus brands Wire Cutter has tested of box chocolates over the years, can you talk about some of the different categories that box chocolates might fall into?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。我认为作为美国人，当我们想到盒装巧克力时，我们会想到**Russell Stovers**、**Whitman's**和**Seas**，对我来说，这在某种程度上是**柏拉图式的理想**。我们仍在寻找这种风格巧克力的优秀范例。但我们确实有一些选择更倾向于那个领域。例如，我认为那是一种**美式盒装巧克力**。如今，我们也有一些巧克力似乎是**糕点师的艺术表现**。比如**Melissa Capel**巧克力，它是我们的一个推荐，非常出色。它几乎是**威利·旺卡**式的。巧克力的外观很漂亮。有非常**漩涡状的饱和色彩**，这是一种现在很流行的风格。真正让它与众不同的是内部。她所做的是，她有独特的组成部分，当你切开它看横截面时，就像是用小镊子把所有东西都放到了正确的位置。最重要的是，风味真的非常突出。所以我认为那更像是一种**厨师主导的巧克力**。你也有可能更适合**巧克力纯粹主义者**的巧克力，比如我今天带来的**Dandelion Chocolate**。它纯粹是**甘纳许**。**Dandelion Chocolate**生产**从可可豆到巧克力块**的巧克力，这意味着他们从**可可豆**开始，在内部制作巧克力块和**夹心巧克力**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. I think that as Americans when we think boxed chocolates, we think about Russell Stovers and Whitman's and Seas and that's for me in a way the Platonic ideal. We're still looking for an excellent example of that style of chocolate. But we do have some picss that migrate more into that territory. For instance, I think of that as like an Americanstyle box chocolate. We also have chocolates these days that really seem to be expressions of a pastry chef. There's Melissa Capel chocolates which are one of our picks and it's quite extraordinary. It's almost Willy Wonka-esque. The exterior of the chocolate is beautiful. There are these very swirly saturated colors and that's a style that's popular now. It's really the interior that sets it apart. And and what she does is she has distinct components that when you cut through just to see the cross-section, it's like a little tweezers put everything into its rightful place. And on top of that, the flavors really come through. So I think of that as almost more like a chef driven chocolate. You have chocolates that are perhaps more for the chocolate purist like dandelion chocolate that I brought here today. It is purely ginache. Dandelion chocolate makes beantobar chocolate which means they manufacture their chocolate from the cacao bean inhouse to create their chocolate bars and bon bonss.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哇。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Wow.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 这盒巧克力最迷人之处在于它是**单一产地松露巧克力**。它们每一颗都由来自不同地方的单一产地巧克力制成。哦，所以这真的就像我妈妈，她会闭上眼睛说，你知道吗，这是85%的，我想这是——她会说出一个国家或什么的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: And what's fascinating about this box is that it is single origin truffle. They're each made from a single origin chocolate from a different place. Oh, so this is really like my mom who is going to close her eyes and be like, you know what, this is 85% and I think this is and she'll name a country or something.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 有那种，但也有，你知道，他们会给你这些**品鉴笔记**。这是更高一个层次，对吧？因为我们说，如果你说巧克力会像**榛子巧克力**，它就需要尝起来像榛子。好的，那是一个很好的基准。在**Dandelion**的**单一产地巧克力松露**中，他们告诉你你尝到了**草莓**，你尝到了**焦糖**，但它只是巧克力。然后当你品尝它们时，你会想，“得了吧，我真的能尝到这些东西吗？”而我们的品鉴小组和我发现的是，“是的，你真的能。”而且每一颗巧克力，它只是**黑巧克力**，都与下一颗有独特的风味。所以你可以非常——这很有趣，因为**Christine**，你说它非常感性。你也会对这些巧克力变得非常**理性**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: There's that, but there's also, you know, they give you these tasting notes. This is next level, right? Cuz we're saying if you say the chocolate's going to be like a hazelnut chocolate, it needs to taste like hazelnuts. Okay, that's like good baseline. In the Dandelion single origin chocolate truffles, they're telling you that you're tasting strawberry, you're tasting caramel, but it's it's just chocolate. And then when you taste them, you're like, "Come on, am I really going to taste these things?" And what our tasting panel and I found was like, "Yes, you really do." And each chocolate, which is just dark chocolate, has a distinct flavor from the next one. So you can get very It's It's funny because Christine, you said is very sensual. You also get very cerebral with these.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 你真的可以深入探究。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: You can really go deep.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 这听起来有点像那些非常喜欢咖啡的人，你会有各种各样的品鉴笔记，你会说，你知道，这个有**糖蜜**什么的。你并不是说那块巧克力里真的有**香蕉味**。它实际上是某种**香蕉味**在巧克力中呈现出来。这是为了引出食品描述中最自命不凡的词之一，**风土**（terroir），意思是巧克力来自一个非常特定的地方。所以，它是这个地方的表达，也是巧克力加工方式的表达。它对风味的影响是惊人的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: It sounds a little bit like people who are really into coffee and you have all these notes that you're like, you know, this has got, you know, molasses and whatever. You're not saying that there's actually banana flavoring in that chocolate. It's actually the presentation of some kind of banana type flavor that's coming out in the chocolate. It's to pull out one of the most pretentious words in a food description, the teroir, which is that the chocolate comes from a very specific place. So, it's an expression of the place and an expression of how the chocolate was processed. It's extraordinary how it can impact the flavor.
</details>

### 高端巧克力的价格与价值

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 这些很贵。很多这样的盒子要50、60，甚至90美元。如果有人去买一盒非常好的巧克力，他们可能会想，我不知道。我真的要下手吗？除了好的食材，是什么让一盒巧克力值这么多钱？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: These are expensive. A lot of these boxes are 50, 60, maybe $90. If anybody has gone to go buy a really nice box of chocolates, they might have been like, I don't know. Am I going to pull the trigger? Beyond good ingredients, what makes a box of chocolate worth that much?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。嗯，有一点要记住，我们谈论了食材的质量，食材的价格，巧克力、可可的价格，它波动剧烈。我联系了一些我们指南中推荐的巧克力制造商，只是想了解为什么我们的巧克力这么贵。**缅因州Ragged Coast Chocolates**的**Kate Schaefer**说，她现在支付的巧克力价格比三年前高了74%。非洲有**农作物歉收**，拉丁美洲有**关税**。我们推荐的人，他们购买的是非常高质量的**可可**。这受到全球因素的影响。此外，这些地方很多都是**小型企业**。事实上，大多数都是。所以，我们把它们与那些大规模生产的工厂制造产品进行比较，这些产品虽然在我们生活中很常见，也许我们喜欢吃它们并享受它们，但它们是在完全不同的规模上运作的。而且，你知道，这些企业中，大多数都是**独立拥有**的，其中很多是**女性经营**的，他们支付熟练工人来制作非常特定的产品。所以，这是一个非常公平的问题，我为未来做了标记。我希望将来能为这份指南找到一个好的**经济型选择**，至少一个。但这是一种**奢侈品**。基本上就是这样。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. Well, one thing to keep in mind, you know, we talked about quality of ingredients, price of ingredients, prices of chocolate, cocoa, cacao, it fluctuates wildly. And I reached out to some of the chocoliers who we do feature in the guide just to get a sense of why our chocolate's so expensive. And Kate Schaefer from Ragged Coast Chocolates in Maine said that she's paying 74% more for chocolate than she did 3 years ago. And that there were crop failures in Africa. There are tariffs in Latin America. And people who we feature, they're buying very high quality cacao. And it's being impacted by, you know, global considerations. Also, many of these places are small businesses. In fact, most of them are. So, we're comparing them head-to-head with these mass-produced factory-made products that while they're wonderful kind of wallpaper in our lives, and maybe we like to eat them and enjoy them, they operate on completely different scales. And you know, many of these businesses, most of them are independently owned, many of them are womenowned, and they're paying skilled laborers to make a very specific product. So, it's a very fair question, and I dogeared for the future. I would like to get a good budget pick, at least one good budget pick for this guide for the future. But um this is a luxury item. That's basically what it is.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我认为这种框架很有帮助，你知道，让你觉得，哦，这是一种非常非常特别的东西。这不是那种随时都能享受的款待。确实如此。这就是它的遗憾之处，对吧？如果你有一个当地的商店，你可以进去，不必非得买一盒12块的巧克力，也许你可以少买几块，那样就不会花那么多钱。如果有人想花更少的钱，但仍然想获得高端巧克力体验，虽然不如一盒巧克力有趣，但一块真正好的巧克力棒。如果你购买**手工巧克力中的凯迪拉克**，你仍然会花费不到20美元。我还认为购买你年轻时喜欢的巧克力也很有趣，比如**Toblerone巧克力棒**，或者**Ferrero Rocher**，我觉得它正在卷土重来。我希望看到**Almond Roka**卷土重来。我采访了**Michael Recudi**，他的**Recuti Chocolates**是我们**夹心巧克力**的整体首选。我问他，你知道，你最喜欢的超市巧克力是什么？我问的一些糖果制造商拒绝回答，但是——
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: That's I think that's helpful framing though, you know, to be thinking like, oh, this is something that is very very special. That is a not all the time type of a treat. It is. That's the bummer of it, right? It's nice if you have a local shop where you can go in and you don't have to commit to a 12piece box of chocolates. Maybe you can buy fewer chocolates and then it doesn't cost as much. If somebody wants to spend less money but still have a high-end chocolate experience, it's not as fun as a box of chocolates, but a really good bar of chocolate. If you're buying the Cadillac of Artisal chocolate, you're still going to be spending under $20. I also think that there is a lot of fun to buy the chocolate of your youth, to get the Toblon bar, to get I think Fer Rocher is really making a comeback. I would like to see Almond Roka make a comeback. I interviewed Michael Recudi who his Recuti Chocolates are our overall pick for Bon Bons. And I I asked, you know, what's your favorite supermarket chocolate? Some of the confectioners who I asked abstained from answering, but
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我拒绝回答。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I take the fifth.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我拒绝回答，但对**Michael**来说，是**Reese's Peanut Butter Cups**和**Junior Mints**。在巧克力所能达到的美食高度之外，也能找到乐趣。有时如果你没有钱花，或者不想花，就用其他方式寻找乐趣。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: I take the fifth, but Michael, for Michael, it was, you know, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Junior Mints. And there is joy to be found outside of the gastronomic height that chocolates can achieve. And sometimes if you don't have the cash to spend or you don't want to, just find a joy some other way.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我真的很喜欢**Junior Mints**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I do so love a junior man.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我也是。我也喜欢那些放在冰箱里的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I do. I also I love those in the freezer and those
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 制作它们。
<details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: making them.

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 嗯，好的。所以，**Gabriella**，我在这里听到的是，如果你正在为情人节或以后寻找一盒巧克力，也许这是一份送给某人的特别礼物，你真正想要寻找的是**高质量的食材**。我们指南中的任何产品都符合这个要求。当你可能对价格感到有点震惊时，这些盒装巧克力之所以如此昂贵是有原因的。他们不仅仅是在敲诈你。这确实是他们购买的食材质量、他们工作的规模、以及制作这些精美小糖果所付出的努力和工作。如果你不能或不想花那么多钱，你可能需要考虑将**美食巧克力棒**作为礼物。如果你仍然想要那种美食体验，而又不想花90美元、50美元，那将是一个很好的选择。你可以花不到20美元买到一块很棒的巧克力棒，但如果你想买便宜一点的，那也没关系。如果你想选择那些经典的糖果棒，那也很好，很美味。一个心形盒子可能就足够了。里面是什么可能并不重要。但既然我们是**Wirecutter**，我们的职责就是告诉你去哪里找到最好的巧克力。如果你打算在盒装巧克力上花钱，因为花60美元买一盒巧克力并不少见，当你看到市面上的产品时，我们希望你知道什么值得花钱。我16年前结婚时收到的最难忘的礼物之一，我收到了很多漂亮的礼物，但那是一盒来自**Maison de Shaka**的巧克力。我以前从未吃过他们的巧克力，它非常特别，非常棒。我至今仍记得那是一份真正的“哇”的礼物，我和我丈夫品尝了大约两周。

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Um okay. So, what I'm hearing here, Gabriella, is that if you are looking for a box of chocolates for Valentine's Day or beyond, maybe it's a gift, a special gift for someone, what you're really wanting to look for are high quality ingredients. Anything that's in our guide is going to fit that bill. When you might get a little sticker shocked by the prices, there are reasons why these boxes of chocolate are really expensive. They're not just gouging you. It is really the quality of ingredients they're buying, the scale at which they're working, the amount of effort and work that goes into making these beautiful little confections, and that if you are not able or desiring to spend that much, you might want to think about gourmet bar chocolate as a gift. That would be a good place to go if you're still wanting sort of that gourmet experience without having to spend 90 bucks, 50 bucks. You could spend under 20 and get a great bar of chocolate, but also no shade if you want to get something cheaper. If you want to go for sort of those like classic candy type bars, that's also great and delicious. A heart-shaped box might just do it. And it won't really matter what's inside. But since we are Wire Cutter, it is our duty to tell you where to find the best chocolates. And if you're going to spend money on boxed chocolates, because it's not unusual to spend $60 on a box of chocolates when you see what's out there, we want you to know what's worth the money. One of the most memorable gifts I received for my wedding 16 years ago, I got lots of beautiful gifts, but it was a box of chocolate from Maison Desa. And I'd never had their chocolate before, and it was so special and so awesome. And I still remember that as just like a real wow kind of gift that my husband and I just savored for like two weeks, you know.

**Rosie Garin**: 我为什么会感动？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Why am I getting emotional?
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 我们将快速休息一下，回来后我们将进行一次品尝测试。令人兴奋！我们还将和**Gabby**玩一个小游戏，我们将把**人格类型**与你可能喜欢的盒装巧克力的**潜在风味特征**进行匹配。所以请留下来，我们马上回来。
<details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: We're going to take a quick break on the other side. We're doing a taste test. Exciting. And we are going to do a little bit of a game with you, Gabby, where we match personality type with potential flavor profile of boxed chocolates that you might like. So stick around.

### 过敏友好型巧克力选项

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 欢迎回来。我们今天的嘉宾是**Wirecutter**厨房团队的同事**Gabriella Gersonen**。她撰写了我们的盒装巧克力指南。现在我们进入节目我最喜欢的部分，我们将真正深入了解我们所有的推荐。我喜欢我们即将对所有这些不同的盒子进行深入探讨。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Welcome back. Our guest today is our colleague on Wire Cutters Kitchen team, Gabriella Gersonensen. She wrote our guide to box chocolates. And now we get to my favorite part of the episode where we're gonna really get in to all of our picks. I'm loving that we're about to geek out majorly on all of these different boxes.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我不想打击你的热情和兴奋。嗯，我只是想暂时有点难过，问问你，**Gabriella**，关于**过敏**的问题。我对**坚果**和**花生**过敏。**Kyra**，我们的另一位共同主持人，不吃**乳制品**。所以，我想知道像我们这样的人，盒装巧克力的选择情况如何。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Not to pull from that enthusiasm and excitement. Um I'm going to get sad for just a second and ask you uh Gabriella about allergies. So I have allergies to tree nuts, to peanuts. Kyra, our other co-host, doesn't eat dairy. So, I'm wondering what the boxed chocolate landscape looks like for people like us.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。首先，我深表同情。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. First of all, my condolences.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 非常感谢。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Thank you so much.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 嗯，我认为当你对食物有**身体反应**时，这是非常严重的事情。我们确实有一个**无过敏原**的选择，它实际上是在一个不含**坚果**、**乳制品**、**麸质**的设施中生产的。它们也是**纯素**的。这个品牌是**Amore Deona**。它们制作得非常精美。这个小盒子实际上也是我们比较**经济实惠**的选择之一。很棒。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Uh, I think that um it's very serious when you can have a physical reaction to food. And we do have an allergen-free pick that is actually manufactured in a facility that has no nuts, dairy, gluten. They're also vegan. The brand is Amore Deona. They're very beautifully made. Little box is actually one of our more affordable picks, too. Nice.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 我带来了一盒**Stick With Me Sweets**，它是在**纽约市**制作的。这位巧克力师来自**Thomas Keller**餐厅的**Per Se**厨房，这对于我们的餐厅爱好者来说是众所周知的。非常——
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: I brought a box of stick with me sweets, which are made here in New York City. The chocolier comes from the kitchens of Purse, which is for, you know, our restaurant geeks at Thomas Keller restaurant. Very
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 非常高级。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: trey fancy.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 非常高级。非常高级。她提供**无坚果**选项。她提供**纯素**选项。我们有很多纯素选项。我们很多人更喜欢纯素版本而不是原版，因为乳制品有风味，而很多纯素巧克力似乎能穿透你在巧克力中可能发现的一些乳制品风味。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Trey fancy. Trey Fancy. And she offers a nut-free option. She offers a vegan option. We have a lot of vegan options. A lot of us preferred the vegan versions to the original versions because dairy has flavor and a lot of the vegan chocolates seem to cut through some of the dairy flavor that you might find in chocolate.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: **纯素巧克力**的**风味清晰度**甚至超越了传统巧克力的风味清晰度，这非常令人兴奋。所以我们没有觉得错过了什么。**纯素巧克力**通常用什么来替代？如果你不用乳制品，他们会用什么来弥补？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: There was clarity in the vegan chocolates that even surpassed the clarity of flavor in the conventional chocolates and that was very exciting. So we didn't feel like we were missing out. What's the swap generally in vegan chocolate? If you're not using dairy, what are they upping in the vegan chocolate to compensate?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 这部分有点令人难过，因为很多都是**坚果基**的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: This is the part that is a little sad because a lot of it is nut-based.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 你可能会在纯素牛奶巧克力中发现**杏仁奶**。**椰子**，我认为这是一个**坚果**问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: You might find almond milk in a milk chocolate that's vegan. Coconut, which I think is a tree nut issue.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 它是**坚果**。我对此没问题，而且我通常也对**交叉污染**没问题。很多人都有问题。所以，听到有完全在安全厨房中制作的产品，这很令人振奋，因为我知道这对很多人来说很重要，也很关键。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: It is a tree nut. I'm okay with it and I also am generally okay with crosscontamination. A lot of people aren't. And so it is heartening to hear that there are picss that are created in a completely safe kitchen cuz that for a lot of folks I know makes a difference is is really important and crucial.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 我想在指南中增加更多适合有**饮食限制**人群的产品。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: I want to add more to the guide that are accessible to people with dietary restrictions.
</details>

### 巧克力礼品推荐：匹配人格类型与风味

**Rosie Garin**: 你曾将自己描述为**巧克力礼宾**。所以，我们将给你一个**原型**或**人格类型**或一个**特定场景**，然后你告诉我们你会为他们匹配哪个盒装巧克力品牌。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: You have described yourself as a bit of a chocolate concierge. So, we're going to give you an archetype or a personality type or a specific scenario and you tell us the box chocolate brand you'd match them with.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Okay.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的。所以，我们称之为“这是给谁的？”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay. So, we'll call it um who is this for?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 好的。有蜂鸣器吗？我只是觉得这应该是一个节目，就像“等等”。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Okay. Is there a buzzer? I'm just feeling like this should be a show to be like wait for.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的。太棒了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay. Great.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 好的，好的。我来开始。**巧克力传统主义者**喜欢经典口味。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: All right. All right. I'll start. Chocolate traditionalist likes classic flavors.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。那么，**Valerie Confections**。她的**太妃糖**真的非常棒。如果你喜欢脆脆的**黄油太妃糖**，我认为这是一种非常**美式糖果**，她做的是我们许多品尝者吃过的最好的。她还制作了很棒的**咸焦糖**和**波旁松露**、**巧克力甘纳许**。所以我认为一个想要保持那种美式**耐嚼焦糖**口味的人，这会是一个不错的选择。还有一个品牌叫**Shakola Modern**。不要被那个法语名字迷惑，它让我想起奶奶的**夹心巧克力**。它们有漂亮的模制形状，里面有**杏仁糖馅**、**果酱馅**和**甜酒**。而且我们的推荐恰好是**纯素**的**Shakola Modern**，但它绝不会影响风味。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. So, Valerie confections. It's really amazing how good her toffee is. If you like a snappy butter toffee, which I think is a very Americanstyle confection, uh she does the best that many of our tasters had ever had. And she also makes fantastic salted caramels and bourbon truffles, chocolate ganache. So I think a person who is looking to stay within that American like chewy caramel palette, this could be a good choice. And there is also a brand called Shakola Modern. And do not let the uh French name, it reminds me of like grandma's bon bons. They they come in beautiful molded shapes and there's marzipan fillings and jam fillings and cordials and also our pick happens to be vegan the shakalama but by no means does it compromise the flavor in any way.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我喜欢。好的，那么对于**冒险型食客**呢？那种会去餐厅只为品尝**品鉴菜单**的人。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I love it. Okay, so how about for an adventurous eater? So someone who goes to a restaurant because they have a tasting menu.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 所以对于你生活中喜欢**品鉴菜单**的人，我有两个推荐。其中一个又是**法国**的。我们确实要感谢法国很多东西。谢谢。**Rishard**是一个品牌。它在法国制造。我们很喜欢它的一款盒子。它有两个小抽屉。上面的抽屉里有一个小小的**马赛克**，几乎就像**《爱丽丝梦游仙境》**里的小巧一口巧克力。每一颗都有不同的风味。而且风味，他们能把这么多风味融入一个小方块里，真是非凡。他们有**香草味**、**坚果味**和**水果味**。我们说的是**柚子**、**榛子果仁糖**和**百里香**。他们考虑了所有可能加入的风味。你咬一小口，看看说明，你会说：“哦，哇。它真的尝起来是那样的。”还有一个小托盘，里面有脆薄的**巧克力薄片**。所以，它们只是小小的薄薄的**调温巧克力圆片**。这很简单。巧克力的百分比印在每个小圆片上。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: So for the tasting menu lover in your life, I have two picks in mind. One of them again French. We do have to thank the French for many things. Thank you. Rishard is a brand. It's made in France. And there is a box that we have enjoyed. It has two little drawers. So the top drawer has a mosaic of little tiny, it's almost like an Alice in Wonderland, like a little tiny one bite chocolate. Each one has a different flavor. And the flavor, it's extraordinary how much flavor they can get into one little cube. And they have herb flavors and nut flavors and fruit flavors. And we're talking yuzu and um you know, hazelnut praline and thyme and and they've thought about every single flavor they could put in. And you take a little bite and you look at the key and you're like, "Oh, wow. That really does taste like that." And there's also a little tray of snappy thin chocolate wafers. So, they're just little thin tempered chocolate discs. And it's quite simple. And the percentage of the chocolate is printed on each little disc.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 天哪，天哪。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Man, oh man.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 它很特别。它也是一种非常**烹饪的体验**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: It's it's it's special. And it's also very a very culinary experience.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 如果我丈夫在听，那就是我想要的那个。谢谢。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: If my husband is listening, that's the one I want. Thanks.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 好的。所以，是的，我意识到我对所有这些都如此热情，但那些真正好的，是真的真的很好。我还提到了**Melissa Capel**。她在**拉斯维加斯**有一个工作室，就像**威利·旺卡**一样。首先，外观很漂亮，这一点我提得不够多，因为我常常觉得外观会让你误以为你得到了不一样的东西。但它们看起来就像小圆顶，有美丽的**漩涡状色彩**，传达出一种深度。它就像一个**星系**，巧克力里的星系。它们**光泽亮丽**。外壳薄得不可思议。当你切开它时，风味就像一个完美的**小构造**。我在指南中提到的一种风味是**花生酱甘纳许**，还有一种我忘了是什么果酱，以及一点点**面包丁**。它就像**花生酱和果酱**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Okay. So yeah, that's uh I I'm realizing I'm so affusive about all of these, but the ones that are really good are really really good. Melissa Capel, I also mentioned her. She has a studio in Vegas, and it's like Willy Wonka. First of all, the exterior is beautiful, which I don't mention enough because I I think often the exteriors can trick you into thinking you're getting something that you're not. But they just look like they're little domes and they have these beautiful swirls of color that convey a depth. It's like a galaxy, like a galaxy in a chocolate. They're glossy. They're the shells are impossibly thin. And the flavor, you cut into it and it's like a perfect little construction. One of the flavors I mentioned in the guide is peanut butter ganache and um I forgot what kind of jam and a little bio crouton. It's like a peanut butter and jelly.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哦，哇。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Oh wow.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 另一个是**酸奶慕斯**，上面有三点**玫瑰果酱**。这种构造本身就很了不起，但你确实能获得**高端摆盘甜点**的风味精确度和相互作用。它就像魔法一样。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Um another one was like a little yogurt mousse with three dots of rose jam. The construction on its own is remarkable, but you really do get the flavor precision and interplay of a high-end plated dessert. It's it's like magic.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 如果我要送礼物给一个我不太了解的人，但我又想给他们留下深刻印象，该怎么办？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: What about if I'm gifting to someone I don't know super well uh but I do want to impress them.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的。嗯，这里有两种方法你可以尝试。一种是选择更保守的。**Christine**，你的婚礼礼物来自**Maison de Shaka**的轶事让我感到非常认可，因为我首先想到的是我们的**Maison de Shaka**推荐，它恰好也是**纯素**的。再次强调，听众们，如果一盒巧克力是纯素的，那并不是一个缺点。你不需要是纯素主义者也能享受它。这个盒子是**水果甘纳许**。每一小块**长条巧克力**，都是精美精确、高高立起的**甘纳许长方体**，外面裹着巧克力，里面注入了**水果风味**。它非常**时尚**，我认为一块真正好的巧克力能让人感觉自己像个**鉴赏家**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yes. Well, here's a you know two approaches you could take. One would be sticking with a more conservative choice and I feel very validated by your anecdote Christine about your wedding gift from Lamezone de Shaka because what first comes to mind is our Lamezone de Shaka pick which also happens to be vegan. Again, listeners, it is not a demerit if a box of chocolates happens to be vegan. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy it. And this box is fruit ganache. Each little baton, which is just beautifully precise little tall standing rectangle of ganache coated in chocolate, has an infusion of fruit flavor. It's very sleek and I think a really good chocolate can make a person feel like a connoisseur.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 因为你咬一口，它看起来是纯巧克力，但你会尝到这种**柚子**或**百香果**的明亮歌唱般的音符。我认为这可以提升品尝者的感受，因为他们能尝到这种**短暂而无形**的风味，这让他们觉得自己拥有——
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Because you take a bite and it looks like pure chocolate, but you get, you know, this like singing bright note of yuzu or of passion fruit. And I I think it can elevate the person who's tasting it because they can taste this ephemeral invisible flavor and it makes them feel like they have
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 一种味觉。所以不像我喝葡萄酒时会说：“是的，我尝到了**焦油味**。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: a palette. So it's not like when I'm drinking wine and I'm like, "Yeah, I am getting tar."
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 嗯，说到这一点，我认为每个人可能都曾有过某种食物或饮料的体验，他们不一定对这种食物了解很多，但当他们品尝到真正好的版本时，就像他们的眼睛被打开了。哦，哇。这比我原以为的要好得多。我在**奶酪**、**咖啡**、**葡萄酒**、**巧克力**方面都有过这种体验。所以，我确实认为这是一份很棒的礼物，送给一个不太了解的人。我想你确实想知道他们是否喜欢巧克力，但什么样的怪物不喜欢巧克力呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Well, to that point though, I think like everyone has probably had some kind of experience with food or drink where they don't necessarily know that much about this sty this type of food, but when they taste a really good version of it, it's like your eyes are opened. Oh, wow. This can be so much better than I even thought that it could be. I've had that experience with cheese. I've had that experience with coffee, wine, chocolate. So, I do think that that's a lovely gift for someone who don't know super well. I guess you do want to find out if they like chocolate, but what kind of monsters like chocolate?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 嗯，另一个推荐属于不同的类别，那就是**Recuti**，它多年来一直是我们的**整体首选**。它在某种意义上更传统，因为它是一盒有不同形状的**夹心巧克力**。你有**黑巧克力**，你有**白巧克力**。每种内馅都与众不同。它不像**Maison de Shaka**那样更像一块整体的、带有不同风味的**甘纳许**，但它是一个非常精致的**填充盒装巧克力**版本。我确实认为它很受大众欢迎，因为它有**熟悉感**，但同时又以一种非常明显的方式得到了**提升**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Well, the the other recommendation is sort of in a different category, which is the Rekiuti, which for several years now has been our overall pick. And that is more conventional in the sense that it's a box of bon bonss with different shapes. You have dark chocolate, you have white chocolate. Each filling is distinct. It's not like this more monolithic, you know, um, ganaches with different flavors that you would get out of the mison deco, but it is a very refined version of a filled box of chocolates. And I I I do think that it is a crowd-pleaser because it has familiarity, but also it is heightened in a way that is very obvious.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 所以，这就像一个**从农场到餐桌**风格的人。他们购买**有机食品**。他们可能在家种**蘑菇**。他们**徒步旅行**。他们基本上就是**回归土地的美食家**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: So, this is like a farmtotable style person. They shop organic. They maybe grow mushrooms at home. They hike. They're basically like back to the land foodies.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 是的，是的。我提到了**Recuti**。他们是**加州湾区**的品牌。所以，这在烹饪术语中意味着他们与农民有合作关系，他们从农民那里采购**香草**。他们使用**当地和季节性食材**。这在另一个海岸也一样。我们有**Ragged Coast Chocolates**，这是一个**缅因州**的品牌。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Yeah. Yeah. I had mentioned Rakiudi. They're California brand Bay Area. And so what that means in culinary parlance is that they have relationships with farmers and they are sourcing herbs from farmers. They are using local and seasonal ingredients. That's also true on the other coast. We have Ragged Coast Chocolates, which is a mainbased brand.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我爱他们。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Love them.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的，**Rosie**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay, Rosie.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我知道。我知道。我完全公正。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I know. I know. I'm I'm I'm I'm completely impartial.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: **Ragged Coast**有一种质朴感，这可能从名字上就有所暗示，但他们也致力于尽可能使用**当地食材**。他们确实展现出一种**朴实无华**的氛围，以及**缅因州**的**乡土气息**。是的，他们的巧克力**不花哨**，但又如此**精致**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: There's a certain rusticity to Ragged Coast, which maybe is a little bit implied by the name, but they also have a commitment to using local ingredients when possible. They do project a certain uh like salt of the earth vibe and main folksiness. in main folksiness. And yes, the chocolates are are unfussy, but also so elevated.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的。我能再补充一个“回归土地”的吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yes. Can I add one more to the back to the lander?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 嗯，**Dandelion单一产地松露巧克力**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Um, the dandelion single origin truffle,
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 就是那些松露巧克力，对吧？好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: the ones with the truffles, right? Okay.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 它完全关乎**土地**。关乎**可可豆**，它来自哪里，如何种植。这是一种非常现代的呈现方式。每颗巧克力看起来都一模一样，只是顶部有不同的图案来区分它们。它们是这些美丽完美的**立方体**，而且相当大。但归根结底，它真正关乎**作物**。它真正关乎作物以及它是如何加工的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: It's all about the land. It's about the cacao bean, where it's from, how it was grown. It's a very modern presentation. Each chocolate looks exactly the same except they have a different design painted on top to differentiate them. They're these beautiful perfect cubes and and quite big. But at the end of the day, it's really about the crop. It's really about the crop and how it was processed.
</details>

### 现场品尝体验

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我们可以品尝吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Can we taste?
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 是的，我们来吧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Yeah, let's do this.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我们等了很久。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: We've waited.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 这显然是我今天出现的唯一原因。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: This is the only reason I showed up today, clearly.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: All right.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 好的。嗯，**Gabby**，我们应该从哪里开始呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: All right. Um, Gabby, where should we begin here?
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 好的，这是一个很好的问题。也许我们可以从最基本的**Dandelion**开始，因为这款是**100%巧克力**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Okay, that's a really good question. Uh perhaps with just like the baseline, the dandelion, because this one is 100% chocolate.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 好的。那么我们打开它，里面有什么呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Okay. And so we're opening it up. And what do we have?
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 哦，天哪。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Oh my lord.
</details>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: 它们是不是很惊艳？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gabriella Gersonen**: Aren't they stunning?
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 它们很华丽。因为它们如此简单。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Those are gorgeous. Because they're so simple. It's like they're
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 它们只是小小的巧克力方块，上面有这些美丽的金色浮雕顶盖，设计各不相同。太美了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: just little squares of chocolate with these beautiful gold kind of embossed tops that are like different designs. So beautiful.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 惊艳。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Stunning.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 非常有品味。嗯，好的。那么，我们来看看说明。

### 节目总结与感悟

**Christine Sir Cleette**: **Rosie**，你是不是进入巧克力昏迷状态了？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Rosie, are you in a chocolate coma?
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我感到无比幸福。那真是一种享受。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I am bliss out. That was a treat.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 那真是太有趣了。那么，你从这期节目中有什么收获？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: That was that was super fun. So, what are you taking away from this episode?
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 我认为对我来说，最令人振奋的事情之一是认识到或意识到，对于有**饮食限制**的人，特别是**纯素主义者**，有这么多好的、高质量的选择。然后是**Stick With Me**巧克力的那一整盒，它们是**无坚果**的，而且不仅仅是无坚果，而是顶部有那个安全标志。我可以毫无顾虑地享用，这真的很好。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: I think for me, one of the things that was most heartening is recognizing or realizing that there are so many options that are good, high quality options for folks with dietary restrictions, particularly vegans. And then that whole box of stick with me chocolates that were nut-free and not just nut-free, but like had that badge right on the top safe. I could go in without worry and that's really nice.
</details>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: 那些很棒。所以这些是非常好的选择。另外，如果你不知道你要送礼给谁，如果你不知道他们是否有过敏症，那可能是一个不错的选择。所以我喜欢这一点。我也喜欢很多没有过敏症的人也真的很喜欢**纯素巧克力**。这对我来说很有趣。我最大的收获是，我不会再对这些盒子的**高价**感到不满。它真的帮助我理解了这些盒装巧克力所投入的**关怀和质量水平**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sir Cleette**: Those are great. And so those are really great options. Also, if you don't know who you're gifting to, if you don't know if they have allergies, that might be a good choice. So, I love that. I also love that a lot of people who don't have allergies really like the vegan chocolates. That's that's pretty interesting for me. My big takeaway is that I'm not going to be a kermagin about the high price of these boxes. It really helped to understand the level of care and quality that's going into a lot of this box chocolate.
</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 对我来说，最后一点是，你知道，这些都是**极其高端**的。我们非常幸运能品尝到这些。也有一些**老牌经典**，它们之所以经典是有原因的。然后是**超市巧克力**。然后是**巧克力棒**。如果你不想选择价格更高的产品，有很多东西你可以选择。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: The last thing for me, I think, is that, you know, these are incredibly high-end. We're very lucky to have tasted these. There's also the old standbys that are standbys for a reason and classic. And then there's grocery store chocolate. And then there's bars. There's so many things you can reach for if you're not feeling good about reaching for something at a higher price point.
</details>

**Rosie Garin**: 是的。如果你喜欢，你就喜欢。而且那些也都有它们自己的位置。所以——
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garin**: Somebody Yeah. If you like it, you like it. And those also, they all have their place. So,
