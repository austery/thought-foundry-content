### 爱泼斯坦文件公布：政治余波与情报机构疑云

好了，各位。你们一直希望我们谈谈爱泼斯坦文件，今天我们就来谈谈。事件出现了惊人的转折，众议院和参议院几乎一致投票决定公布爱泼斯坦文件。关于《爱泼斯坦文件法案》的投票结果是 427 票对 1 票。弃权的是来自路易斯安那州的共和党人克莱·希金斯 (Clay Higgins)。他表示，这会曝光并伤害成千上万的无辜者、证人、提供不在场证明的人以及家庭成员。他的观点很有道理，但司法部长已经回应过，他们不会公布任何正在进行的调查，并且如果会伤害到任何人，他们会隐去姓名。参议院以一致同意的方式通过了该法案，这需要每位参议员的签字。而特朗普也一反常态，在昨晚签署了该法案，表示“把所有东西都给他们”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, everybody. You've wanted us to talk about the Epstein Files and we're going to talk about it today in a stunning turn of events. The House and Senate voted nearly unanimously to release the Epstein files. The vote was 427 to 1 for the Epstein files act. The person who abstained was Republican Clay Higgins from Louisiana. He said it reveals and injures thousands of innocent people, witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members. He makes a great point, but the Attorney General has addressed that already that they're not going to release any open investigations and they're going to remove names if it would harm anybody. The Senate passed it by unanimous consent which requires a sign off from every senator and Trump in a reversal signed the bill last night saying give them everything.</p>
</details>

上周我们确实看到一些来自爱泼斯坦文件的邮件被公布。播客的朋友拉里·萨默斯 (Larry Summers) 是其中的主要人物，他直到 2019 年还在与爱泼斯坦联系，向他咨询约会建议。此后，他辞去了在 OpenAI 和其他几个面向公众的职务，并且我刚听说他被哈佛大学停职了。你们认为这件事的后续影响会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We did see some emails come out from the Epstein files last week. Friend of the pod Larry Summers was a main character in them and he was communicating with Epstein up until 2019 asking him for advice on dating. He's since stepped down from OpenAI and several other public facing roles and was just, I think, put on leave from Harvard. I mean, what do you guys think's going to be the fallout from this?</p>
</details>

Chamath：让我们来分析一下。第一个问题是，爱泼斯坦文件和唐纳德·特朗普之间有什么关系？我认为答案是关系不大。原因在于，特朗普是地球上被调查最多、被诉讼最多的人。如果你有任何对特朗普极具煽动性和指控性的材料，它早应该在拜登执政期间就被公布了，因为从政治上讲，试图损害他的候选资格是很有意义的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's break this down. So, I think the first question is what is the relation between the Epstein files and Donald Trump? And I think the answer is it's flimsy. And the reason is because this is the most investigated, most litigated human being on earth. And I think that if you had something that was incredibly salacious and accusatory of Trump, it would have been released during the Biden administration because it would have made a lot of sense politically to try to damage his candidacy.</p>
</details>

所以，除了几张照片之外，我们没有看到任何实质性内容，这意味着没有与特朗普相关的东西。那么问题就来了，为什么拜登政府在掌握这些文件四年的时间里没有公布更多内容？这可能是因为有相当数量的民主党活动家牵涉其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the fact that we haven't seen much of anything other than some photos means that there's nothing there related to Trump. So then the question is why didn't the Biden administration release more of the files when they had them for four years? And it's probably because there are a non-trivial number of Democratic operatives that are touched by these things.</p>
</details>

现在你在这些文件中开始看到的是，它似乎更多地玷污了民主党的建制派精英，而不是共和党人。这就解释了为什么过去四年里泄露的信息如此之少。重点是，杰弗里·爱泼斯坦是个彻头彻尾的变态。那个岛应该被水泥覆盖并沉入海底。那栋房子应该被烧毁，然后换上一些美好的东西。你必须确保这些……是你说的，有一千名女性受害者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My point is now what you're starting to see in these documents is that it seems to be tainting the Democratic establishment elite more than the Republicans. It explains why there was so few leaks in the last four years. The point is Jeffrey Epstein was a total creep, right? That island should be covered in cement and drowned. The house should be burned to the ground and replaced with something nice. And you have to make sure that these... You're the one that said this. It's a thousand women.</p>
</details>

你必须非常小心和周到地保护她们的权利，并尊重她们所经历的一切。但我认为现在我们需要有序地公布这些文件，把这一页翻过去。从中吸取我们需要的教训，变得更好，做得更好，尊重这些人，然后继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you have to be incredibly careful and thoughtful to protect their rights and just to respect what they've gone through. But I think now we need to just release these files in an orderly manner and put this episode behind us. Learn what we need to learn from it. Get better. Be better. treat these people with respect and move on.</p>
</details>

Jason：回顾过去，我认为他是个间谍。我认为他为情报机构工作。我不是这个播客里的阴谋论者，但他可能与情报机构共享信息，因为我们都认识情报界的人，有很多简单的方法可以传递情报而不会被认为是正式“工作”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think looking back on it, I think he's a spy. I think he worked for intelligence agencies. Now I am not the conspiracy theorist of this podcast, but he could have shared intel with them. It could be any of them. We all know people in the intelligence community and there's easy ways to pass intel without it being formal work.</p>
</details>

那么问题就变成了，他是一个资产吗？他在多大程度上分享信息？我之所以这么想，是因为他为什么会对顶尖大学的顶尖科学家感兴趣，并与他们建立密切关系？然后他想把这些信息传递给谁？谁会想要来自科学家的顶级情报？俄罗斯、以色列、中央情报局 (CIA)。然后，那个“黑材料”(kompromat) 的事情似乎也很有可能，因为他到处都装了摄像头，他们也谈到过这一点。我认为这部分故事是真的可能性非零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then I think the question becomes was he an asset? Was he sharing information? To what extent? And the reason I think this is because why would he have an interest in the top scientists in the top universities to get close to them and then who did he want to pass that information on to? Who would want top intelligence from scientists? Russia, Israel, the CIA. And then the compromat thing does seem also likely because he had cameras everywhere and they've talked about this. So I think there is a nonzero chance that that part of the story is true.</p>
</details>

我认为，当我们回顾这件事时，会发现有一大群人与这个到处撒钱的人有过令人尴尬的互动。每个人都想要他的钱。这就是为什么他们排着队。所有的科学家，Joi Ito，Reid Hoffman，所有这些人都在试图得到他的钱，这很奇怪。他还为微软的人和 Peter Thiel 提供税务建议。所以他总是在试图融入有钱有势的人和科学家的圈子。为什么？是为了赚钱，还是有其他目的？我认为不是为了赚钱。我认为这里有其他目的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that when we go back and we look at this, there's a bunch of people who have embarrassing interactions with this person who spread money everywhere. Everybody wanted his money. That's why they were lining up. All the scientists, Joey Ito, Reed Hoffman, all of these folks were trying to get his money, which is peculiar. And he was also giving tax advice to the Microsoft people, to Peter Teal. So he was always trying to integrate himself into powerful people with money and scientists. Why was it to make money or was it for some other purpose? I think it was not to make money. I think there was some other purpose here.</p>
</details>

我的预测是，我们会发现某个情报机构以某种方式参与其中，这就是为什么这件事被掩盖，为什么这么棘手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's my prediction. Yes. My prediction is we're going to find out that some intelligence agency was somehow involved in this and that's why it's being covered up and that's why it's so difficult.</p>
</details>

### Tether 揭秘：稳定币如何成为全球金融巨头

Chamath：我昨晚和 Tether 的创始人兼首席执行官 Paolo Ardoino 共进晚餐。他是个了不起的人。那真是一项不可思议的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had dinner last night with Paulo Arduino, CEO, founder of Tether. Amazing, amazing guy. That is an incredible business.</p>
</details>

这项业务之所以不可思议，原因如下。我喜欢这一点。你说的 Tether 是指**稳定币** (Stablecoin: 一种价值与美元等稳定资产挂钩的加密货币) 吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's why that business is incredible. This is what I love. You're talking about Tether, the stable coin.</p>
</details>

是的。全球有 5 亿人正在使用 Tether 发行的美元支持的稳定币，遍布非洲、中美洲和亚洲。第一点。第二点，他的用户群每季度增长 3000 万。这种金融普惠性与美元霸权的联系是难以置信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. There are 500 million people using US dollar-backed stable coins from Tether all around the world all over Africa, all over Central America, all over Asia. Number one. Number two, his user base is growing by 30 million users a quarter. It's the financial inclusion that then ties back to US dollar hegemony is unbelievable.</p>
</details>

让我们把这些业务看作是大致相同的：有 Circle，有 Tether，还有 World Liberty Financial。它们都有稳定币。这是什么呢？假设 Jason 是印度的一名现金工。他挣了 100 卢比，然后他觉得卢比在不断贬值，他的购买力在不断下降。他想把它换成美元。所以他会创建一个加密钱包，Tether 会说，好的，把你的 100 卢比给我。他们会立即将其兑换成美元。现在有了一美元，就有一个代表这一美元的代币。我把这个代币给 Jason。现在我有了这一美元，我该怎么处理它？当我积累了足够多的美元，比如 500 亿、1000 亿，我就可以把它们投资于国债，这样就完全安全了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's look at these businesses as roughly the same. There's circle, there's tether, there's world liberty financial. They all have a stable coin. What is it? Okay. So let's just say that Jason is a cash worker in India. He gets paid a hundred rupees and he's like you know the rupee is constantly getting devalued. I'm constantly losing purchasing power. I want to swap that into a US dollar. So he would create a crypto wallet and what tether will say is great give me your hundred rupees. They immediately swap it to a US dollar. So now there's a US dollar and there's a token for that dollar. I give to Jason the token for that dollar. Now I have this dollar. What do I do with it? When I accumulate enough of these dollars, 50 billion, hundred billion, I can take that and I would invest it in treasuries so that it's completely safe.</p>
</details>

现在，Tether、Circle 和 World Liberty 就可以从中赚取利息。当这个数字变得足够大时，这个数字会变得非常巨大。然后，以 Tether 为例，他们会将这些资本再投资于各种分布式资产，如比特币、黄金、房地产。但他们也会投资于像非洲的金融普惠这样的项目。他昨天向我介绍了他正在做的一系列事情。这是一项不可思议的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now Tether and Circle and World Liberty, they earn interest on that. And so now when the number gets big enough, this number gets ginormous. Then what they do in Tether's case is they then reinvest this capital into all kinds of distributed assets, Bitcoin, gold, real estate. But what they also do is they now invest in things like financial inclusion in Africa. So he walked me through kind of a bunch of things that he's doing yesterday. It is an incredible business.</p>
</details>

作为我钱包里稳定币的持有者，我赚不到任何国债收益。我只是拥有一个与美元挂钩或受美元保护的稳定币。对于 5 亿人来说，这已经足够进行风险管理和风险缓释了。他们不是想获得 4% 或 3% 的利息收益，他们更关心的是不要持有本国货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a holder of the stable coin in my wallet, I'm not earning any of that treasury yield. I just have a flat dollar denominated or dollar protected stable coin. And that is sufficient risk management and risk mitigation for half a billion people. They're not trying to get a 4% or 3% interest yield. They care more about not being in their local currency.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达财报与贝瑞的做空：一场关于会计准则的辩论

Jason：英伟达公布了井喷式的季度财报。营收同比增长 62%，环比增长 22%。净利润 319 亿美元，同比增长 65%。他们预计本季度营收将达到 650 亿美元。播客的朋友黄仁勋 (Jensen Huang) 表示，他们的产品供不应求，到处都卖断货了。与此同时，做空英伟达的迈克尔·贝瑞 (Michael Burry) 正在搅局。他发帖回应，我认为是针对 Friedberg 你上周的言论，为英伟达销售的这些新芯片组 H100 的合理使用寿命进行辩护。是四年、五年、六年还是七年？它们何时被替换？它们的有效使用寿命是多久？根据**GAAP**（Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: 美国公认会计准则）会计准则，他认为，大型科技公司正在做假账以抬高收益。这是一个纸牌屋，他将做空 Palantir，因为它的市销率是 100 比 1，但他也会因为折旧问题做空英伟达等公司。Friedberg，你对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia had a blowout quarter. Revenue up 62% year-over-year, 22% quarter over quarter. Net income 31.9 billion. That's up 65% year-over-year. They expect 65 billion this quarter. Jensen, friend of the pod, has said that they can't keep their product on the shelves. It's sold out everywhere. And then at the same time, Michael Burry who has got the short on it, he's been mixing it up. He is posting in response, I think, to you Freeberg last week making it a defense of the reasonable life of an H100 of these new chipsets that Nvidia sells. Is it four years, five years, six years, seven years? When do they get replaced? When do they have a useful life and gap accounting? He believes, just to make it easy for the audience to understand that major tech companies, big tech are cooking the books in order to spike their earnings. That this is a house of cards and that he's going to short Palantir because it's 100 to 1 price to sales ratio, but he's going to also short Nvidia, etc. because of the depreciation. What's your thoughts? I know you've seen his comments.</p>
</details>

Friedberg：根据 GAAP 准则，你设定一个有效使用寿命，并在重新评估实际使用该资产时重置该寿命，而不一定是因为出现了能创造更多价值的更好资产。你进行一项大型投资，购买物业、厂房和设备 (PP&E)，然后在你作为会计师估计的该资产的有效使用寿命内分期摊销这项投资。如果你要使用一栋建筑 20 年，每年你就摊销该建筑成本的二十分之一。你不能在第一年就全部摊销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Under the GAAP standards, the general accepted accounting principle standards. So, you set a useful life and you reset that useful life as you do a reassessment on when you're actually using that asset, not necessarily if there's a better asset that makes more value. You make a big investment in property, plant, equipment, PP&E, and that investment you write down over a period of time that you as an accountant estimate to be the useful life of that asset. So, if you're going to use a building for 20 years, every year you write down the cost of that building by 1/20th. You don't get to write it all down in the first year.</p>
</details>

贝瑞的论点在 Twitter 上是错误的。他说，“认为折旧的有效使用寿命更长，因为三四年前的芯片仍在满负荷运行，这是混淆了物理利用率和价值创造。” 这是不正确的。它们确实在创造价值，因为它们在第六年仍然在用那些芯片创造收入。所以，事实上，那块芯片的有效使用寿命已经延长到了第六年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Burry's point is incorrect on Twitter. He said the idea of a useful life for depreciation being longer because chips from more than 3 to four years ago are fully booked confuses physical utilization with value creation. That is incorrect. There is value creation because they are generating revenue from those chips this year, 6 years later. So there is in fact a useful life for that chip that has extended into year six.</p>
</details>

这几乎是教科书式的 GAAP 准则，即如果你在 6 年后仍在使用该资产，你就可以在六年内对其进行折旧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is almost textbook GAAP, which is that if you're still using the asset after 6 years, you can depreciate it over six years.</p>
</details>

Chamath：我认为这次对话缺乏技术素养。假设你是谷歌，一个输出 token 就相当于一个链接。你首先会告诉我，嘿，Chamath，不是所有的链接都是平等的，对吧？例如，如果你为一个药品生成一个链接，谷歌收取的每次点击价格与他们为亚马逊上购买牙膏生成的链接完全不同。我认为他需要理解的是，他把这等同于能源，但现实是在 AI 模型中，我们关心的是输出 token 是什么，它产生了多少收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this conversation lacks technical literacy. So let's assume you were Google and let's just say that the equivalent of an output token was the equivalent of a link. The first thing you would tell me is, hey, Chimath, not all links are made equal, right? So for example, if you generate a link for a pharmaceutical drug, Google charges a price per click that's way different than the link that they generate that goes to Amazon to buy toothpaste. I think the thing that he needs to understand is he's equating this to energy but the reality is that in AI models the thing that we care about is what is that output token what is the revenue that's being generated by the output token.</p>
</details>

Friedberg：这里没有隐藏信息。贝瑞暗示他们做假账或隐藏会计信息是完全错误的，因为所有的会计信息都清晰地体现在现金流量表和资产负债表中。公司有三张财务报表：利润表、资产负负债表和现金流量表。现金流量表对利润表和资产负债表进行调节，建立联系，并显示公司所有现金的流入和流出。许多聪明的、做足功课的分析师和投资者会看现金流量表，他们会看到资本支出，看到所有流出的投资，他们会计算一个通常称为自由现金流的数字，从而估算企业在特定时期的真实现金生成能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no hidden information here. Bur's implication that they are cooking the books or hiding accounting is completely false because all of the accounting is apparent in the cash flow statement and in the balance sheet. Remember companies have three financial statements. An income statement, a balance sheet, and a cash flow statement. The cash flow statement reconciles the income statement, the balance sheet, makes the linkage, and it shows you all the cash that's going in and out of the company. And many analysts and many investors that are intelligent and do their homework will look at the cash flow statement and they will see the capex. They will see all the investments going out and they will calculate a number typically called free cash flow that will allow them to estimate the true cash generation of the business in a particular period.</p>

### 谷歌 Gemini 3 崛起：AI 市场格局重塑

Jason：谷歌发布了 Gemini 3，表现相当出色。他们在大多数基准测试中重新夺回了领先地位。市场现在预测谷歌有 89% 的机会在年底成为顶级的**LLM** (Large Language Model: 大型语言模型)。所有关于谷歌搜索业务将被 ChatGPT 彻底摧毁的猜测，至少今年看来并未成真，他们的搜索量和收入都在增长。但最大的新闻是关于 Gemini 3 据说完全是在谷歌的 **TPU** (Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌为机器学习定制的专用集成电路) 上训练的，而不是英伟达的 GPU。Chamath，你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google released Gemini 3, it's pretty great. They regained the lead on most of the benchmarks. Market now has Google at 89% to finish the year as the top LLM and all the speculation that Google was going to have their search franchise absolutely slaughtered by Chat GPT has turned out to not be true, at least not this year with their searches going up, revenue going up. But the big story is speculation around Gemini 3 being trained only on Google's TPUs, not Nvidia's GPUs. Your thoughts, Jamaat?</p>
</details>

Chamath：我认为 TPU 是一款不可思议的产品。我可能有偏见，但我认为它是一个了不起的架构。最新的版本非常深刻。但我也认为，我们很快会看到市场上出现一个高度碎片化的解码芯片层。Groq 是一个，TPU 是一个，微软有自己的版本，亚马逊有 Inferentia，Facebook 据说也在开发自己的芯片。所以我们将很快实现解码的分散化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think TPU is an incredible product. I'm biased, but I think it's an incredible architecture. This latest spin is very profound. But I also think that what we are quickly seeing is that there's going to be a highly fragmented layer of decoding chips that exist in the marketplace. Groq is one, TPU is one, Microsoft has a spin, Amazon has inferentia, Facebook I think is apparently spinning up their own silicon. So we're going to get to disagregated decode pretty quickly.</p>
</details>

我们看到的是一个新兴市场的形成。我们曾看到流量分配基本上偏向一家公司，而现在我们开始看到在所有这些不同市场中出现了排序功能和分类器。它正在分化，对吧？科学领域会有赢家，企业级编码领域会有赢家，聊天方面也会有赢家。优势在哪里？在企业方面，将是模型质量，Anthropic 的模型非常出色。在聊天方面，可能将围绕你现有的固有分发渠道，也就是操作系统、浏览器、手机，即苹果、谷歌和微软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are we seeing? We're seeing a nascent market get created. We saw an allocation of traffic that basically favored one company over everyone. And now we're starting to see a sorting function and a classifier in all of these different markets. It's like breaking apart, right? There'll be winners in science. There'll be winners in enterprise level coding. There's going to be winners on the chat side. And where are the advantages going to be? On the enterprise side, it's going to be model quality. Anthropics is excellent. On the chat side, it's probably going to pivot around your existing inherent distribution which is operating system which is your browser which is your phone which is Apple and Google and Microsoft.</p>
</details>

Jason：我认为搜索业务将会增长，谷歌不会输给 ChatGPT。我认为这一切中的最大输家将是 OpenAI，因为他们从 100% 的市场份额开始，现在只是一路下滑。他们面临着全力以赴的谷歌，以及在排行榜上持续击败他们的 Anthropic 和 Grok。所以，如果你要做配对交易，我认为应该做空 OpenAI，它被高估了，而且会下跌。我会做多谷歌、Grok 和 Anthropic。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the search franchise is going to grow and that Google's not going to lose to chat GPT. And I think the big loser in all this is going to be OpenAI because they started with 100% of the market and they're only going down and they're facing a Google firing on all cylinders. Anthropic and Grock beating them in the leaderboards pretty consistently. So, I think the short in all of this, if you were going to put on the pair trade, is short OpenAI, which I think is overvalued and is going to go down. And I think I would be long Google, Grock, and Anthropic.</p>
</details>

### AI 芯片的未来：英伟达面临的挑战与华为的黑天鹅

Friedberg：我认为，随着时间的推移，我们将看到芯片架构从通用型“主力”向更专业的芯片分化，这些专用芯片能更好地与特定模型和应用配合。你可以想象一下机器人技术中的机器视觉推理，你不一定需要 H100 来做这个，你可以使用专门为此设计的芯片，这样可以降低功耗成本和最终的资本部署成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think what we will see over time is probably a differentiation of general purpose workhorses in chip architecture to more of these kind of special purpose chips that work well with certain models and certain applications. You can kind of think about inference in machine vision in robotics. You don't necessarily need an H100 to do that. you can use a purpose-built chip to do that in a way that reduces power cost, reduces ultimate kind of capital cost to deploy that in an edge environment.</p>
</details>

另一个我认为目前被忽略的黑天鹅，我对 2026 年的早期预测是华为。我认为中国存在一种未公开讨论的光刻技术，将被部署在华为和他们在中国大陆建造的所有这些晶圆厂中。华为能够以非常低的成本、可能非常高的产量，并且在相当短的时间内，制造出可以在某些市场应用上与昂贵且交货期长的芯片相媲美的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other black swan that I think is missing in the equation today and my early prediction for 2026 is Huawei. I think that there's a lithography technology that exists in China that is not publicly discussed that is going to be deployed in Huawei and all these fabs that they're building in mainland China and Huawei can create at a very low cost probably very high volume and probably in reasonably short order chips that can start to rival for certain market applications chips that might be expensive and long.</p>
</details>

Jason：给个时间线，两年还是三年后？他们什么时候开始发布公告？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give a timeline for that 2 years 3 years out when we start when they start to make announcements.</p>
</details>

Friedberg：好的，2026 年发布公告，2027 年产生影响。

<p class="english-text">Okay. So announcements 2026 impact 27.</p>

### 投资心法与职业反思：从个人资金到为LP负责

Chamath：你觉得是投资自己的钱时表现更好，还是在需要向 **LP** (Limited Partner: 有限合伙人，通常指风险投资基金的出资人) 汇报的纪律约束下表现更好？这其实是个好问题。

<p class="english-text">Do you feel you're a better investor when you're investing your money or do you think you're better when you have the discipline of having to report into LPs? It's actually a good question.</p>
</details>

我的回报在我自己投资时更好。但我认为为他人工作确实有其价值，它能让你保持责任感。发生的情况是，我自己投资时，我的投资回报离散度大大增加了，这意味着我持有亏损项目的时间远比我管理基金时要长。因为我认为我管理基金时所承诺的是永不亏钱，并尽快返还资金，然后再去追求上行空间。

<p class="english-text">My returns have been better when I've been by myself. But I think that there is something really valuable about working for other people which it does keep you accountable. What's happened is my dispersion has increased massively investing on my own, which means I cut the losers off far longer than I would have if I was running a fund because I think what I signed up for when I was running a fund was never lose money ever and return the money as quickly as possible and then run the upside.</p>

Friedberg：2011 年，在我卖掉 Climate Corp 的两年前，我创办了一家名为 MetroMile 的公司。我是公司的董事长，聘请了外部 CEO，一年后解雇了他，然后提拔 CTO 担任 CEO 多年。我作为董事长与他共事。我在这家公司投入了近 1000 万美元的自有资金，花了好几年时间。它已经完成了 B 轮、C 轮、D 轮融资，发展得很好。我当时想，天哪，这太棒了。我可以当董事长，而不是 CEO，来运营这些公司。这进展顺利。

<p class="english-text">In 2011, two years before I sold Climate Corp, I started a company called Metro Mile. I was the chairman of the board of the company. I hired an outside CEO, fired him in a year, brought the promoted the CTO to be CEO for years. I worked with him as the chairman of the board. I invested close to 10 million of my own money in this company. Spent years on it. It had raised a series B, a series C, series D. Was doing great. I'm like, man, this is awesome. I can be a chairman, not a CEO, run these companies. This goes great.</p>
</details>

我当时想，天哪，我太擅长创办公司和当董事长了。这就是我应该做的事。这也促使我创办了风险工作室。但那两家公司最终都给我带来了负回报。多年来，我作为创始人但担任董事长的其他许多项目在财务上也没有成功。在我多年的董事会经历中，我意识到在董事会里是多么令人沮丧，你告诉 CEO 一堆事情，他们不听，做他们想做的任何事。我感到沮丧，快要抓狂了，看着他们做我不会做的事，而不做我会做的事。

<p class="english-text">And I'm like man I am so good at starting companies and being a chairman. This is what I should do. And that's what led me to start the venture studio. Both those companies ended up being net negative returners for me. And over time, many of the other projects that I was a founder of but chairman of didn't succeed financially. And over my years being on boards, I realized how frustrating it was to be on a board where you would tell a CEO a bunch of stuff. They wouldn't listen. They would do whatever they wanted to do. I was frustrated pulling my hair out, watching them do things I wouldn't do, not doing the things I would do.</p>
</details>

然后，在 Oho 项目上我们取得了一系列惊人的成果。这是一个持续了好几年的研究项目。在这些结果出来之前，我们投入了近 4000 万美元。我当时想，天哪，这是我职业生涯中改变游戏规则的业务。这就是幂律分布的体现。就在那时，我决定全力以赴，亲自运营它。

<p class="english-text">So after many years of this failure after failure, I realized, you know, this was the moment where we had this amazing outcome, series of outcomes at Oho. And it was a research project for several years. We put close to $40 million into this project before these results started to come in. I'm like, holy crap this is the gamechanging business of my career. This is the power law. And that's when I made the decision, I'm going to go all in on this and I'm going to run it.</p>

你知道是什么改变了我的想法吗？我看了 IMAX 版的电影《奥本海默》。看完电影我哭了，我意识到我没有在做我生命中应该做的事情，只是当一个无用的董事会成员。我说，我要做这件事。我一直在考虑这件事，然后我说，就是它了。它推动了我，我做出了出任 CEO 的决定。

<p class="english-text">You know what changed my mind about this was I saw the movie Oppenheimer in IMAX and I left that movie and I cried and I realized I wasn't doing what I should be doing with my life by being this board member who was useless. I said I'm going to make this and I'd been thinking about this and I'm like that's it. It tipped me over and I made the decision to step in as CEO.</p>

### 高额桌扑克心理学：与 Alan Keating 对话

Jason：Alan Keating 多年来在这里经营着高额桌游戏，精英级别的大局。然后他开始投资公司。他是一家名为 Poly Market 的小公司的种子投资者。大约十年前，Chamath 把他带进了我们的朋友圈，他很快就融入了。我们开始一起玩，并逐渐了解他。在那段时间里，他也开始在电视上打高额桌扑克。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Alan Keating ran the high stakes game here, the elite big game for many years. Um then he started investing in companies. He was the seed investor in a little company known as Poly Market. and he's gotten into our friend group. I don't know how many years ago Chamathy brought him in and he fit right in and we started hanging out 10 years ago and we got to know him. In that time he also started to play high stakes on TV.</p>
</details>

Chamath：Keating 的核心是一位杰出的牌手。不像其他一些更倾向于使用**求解器** (Solver: 一种使用博弈论最优策略来计算扑克最佳玩法的软件) 的人，Keating 有着令人难以置信的现场读牌能力，有点像现代年轻版的 Hellmuth。他能洞察人心，当你在高额桌上玩牌时，老实说，这才是最重要的，因为你不能在我们玩的这种赌注级别上基于求解器来打牌。你只会被碾压。

<p class="english-text">Kading at his core is an exceptional player not a traditional like you know you'll see the some of the other guys who are more solver oriented but Keading has incredible incredible live reads kind of like a modern younger generation of Helm youth. He can soul read people which when you're playing at the high stakes honestly that's all that matters because you can't play solver-based at these stakes in which we play. You cannot you're just going to get run over.</p>
</details>

Keating：是的，我认为我在牌桌上比大多数人更能驾驭恐惧。所以当人们害怕时，他们往往会泄露信息、变得胆怯或行为异常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think I've I'm a navigating fear on the poker table better than most. So I think when people are, you know, afraid, they tend to give things away or get scared or act different.</p>
</details>

Jason：你是如何处理输掉 70 万美元这种情况的？你会想“这太蠢了，我为什么要这么做？”还是你会说……你的自我对话和内心独白是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you process losing $700,000 that way? Do you think this is so stupid? Why did I do that? Or do you are you saying what's what's the self talk? What's the internal monologue?</p>
</details>

Keating：我不知道这种心态从何而来，但我一直想对我身上发生的任何事都保持一种幽默感。无论是那些我能控制的，还是我不能控制的。我把自己置于一个境地。我已经到了一个可以立即认识到我刚才做的事情有多荒谬，并能一笑置之的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess I don't know where it came from, but I wanted to always kind of have a sense of humor around whatever happens to me. You know, the the things I can't control, the things I can control. I put myself in a spot. I've gotten to a point where I can immediately recognize how ridiculous what I just did was and kind of laugh and be okay with it.</p>
</details>

这关乎于掌控恐惧。是的，我只是认识到当人们害怕时会做出糟糕的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's about mastering the fear. Yeah. I think I just recognize that people make bad decisions when they're scared.</p>
</details>

Chamath：掌控恐惧。你通过重复练习。你是如何通过重复练习来掌控恐惧的？因为这可以延伸到生活中的许多其他方面。

<p class="english-text">Mastering fear. You put in reps. How do you put in reps to master fear because that extends to many other things in life, right?</p>

Keating：我喜欢下那种如果失败了会让我陷入一点麻烦的赌注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I like making the bet where if it doesn't work out, I'm in a little bit of trouble, right?</p>
</details>

Jason：你喜欢感受那种痛苦。你喜欢那种真实的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You like to feel the pain. You like that it feels real.</p>
</details>

Keating：是的，这是一种激励。它能驱动我。我喜欢扑克，我也会把自己置于同样的情境中。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's a motivator. It's something that drives and I like poker. I'll put myself in the same type of situation.</p>
