大家好，欢迎回到本频道。我们又回到了每日回顾节目。今天我们有很多内容要讨论。感谢大家的到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. We have a lot to talk about today. Thank you everybody for being here.</p>
</details>

**AMD**（Advanced Micro Devices: 超微半导体公司）举行了投资者日活动，发布了非常重要的更新。**Nebius**（一家数据中心服务提供商）公布了财报，这对整个数据中心领域至关重要。**软银**（SoftBank: 日本跨国综合企业集团）出售了其持有的英伟达股份。今天我们有很多关于数据中心和基础设施的头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD had an investor day. Very important stuff. Nebas had earnings important for the overall data center space. Soft bank sold their Nvidia. You got just a bunch of these headlines in terms of what's going on with data centers, what's going on with infrastructure.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还将讨论像**Anthropic**（一家领先的AI安全和研究公司，开发基础模型）这样的**基础模型**（Foundation Models: 指在大量数据上预训练、可适应广泛下游任务的巨型AI模型）的最新进展，该公司今天上调了其2028年的营收指引。我们将深入探讨所有这些内容，以及一些宏观经济和政府停摆的最新情况。有很多内容要谈，让我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, what's going on with the foundation models like Anthropic that increased their revenue guidance for 2028 today. We'll get into all that. We got some stuff going on in the macro shutdown updates. A lot to talk about, a lot to get into. Let's get into it.</p>
</details>

### AMD投资者日与AI数据中心前景

好的，让我们从今天围绕**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）和数据中心的核心头条新闻开始，我认为这些新闻非常重要，特别是如果您持有**英伟达**（Nvidia: 领先的图形处理器和AI芯片制造商）的股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started with kind of the core headlines of the day around AI and data centers that I think are pretty important, especially if you own Nvidia stock.</p>
</details>

我个人不持有英伟达的股票，我对这个领域的主要投资是英伟达。但AMD是一个非常重要的参与者，市值达4000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I do not own Nvidia stock. My main exposure to this sector is Nvidia. Uh, but AMD is a really big player, $400 billion company.</p>
</details>

他们在去年9月时市值只有1500亿美元。他们获得了**OpenAI**（一家人工智能研究和部署公司，开发了ChatGPT等模型）约800亿美元的预计营收合同，以及6吉瓦的电力供应，这使得他们的股价飙升至4000亿美元。目前股价为250美元，跌至约240美元，上周从约260美元下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They were $150 back in September. They got the big OpenAI contract of around 80 billion of projected revenue, 6 gawatts of power, and that took the stock up to 400 billion. $250 right now down at about 240. fell from about 260 last week.</p>
</details>

那么，**Lisa Su**（苏姿丰: AMD首席执行官）今天说了些什么呢？她提到了一些非常引人注目的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh what did Lisa Seuss to say today? Well, she said some stuff that is pretty remarkable when you look at the raw numbers.</p>
</details>

首先，她表示：“对AI计算基础设施的需求依然极其旺盛。客户并未减少他们在AI领域的投资。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one, she says, "Demand for AI compute infrastructure remains extremely high. Customers are not reducing their investments in AI.</p>
</details>

AMD预测，未来五年数据中心将以超过80%的**复合年增长率**（CAGR: Compounded Annual Growth Rate: 衡量投资在特定时期内年均增长率的指标）增长。他们还预计未来三到五年内，年营收将以35%的复合年增长率增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD is forecasting data center growth exceeding 80% on a compounded annual growth rate over the next five years. And they're projecting annual revenue growth of 35% kager over the next three to five years.</p>
</details>

因此，**Lisa Su**对整个数据中心市场持非常乐观的态度。这里有一段她谈论未来三到五年情况的视频剪辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you got a lot of bullish things coming from Lisa Sue in terms of how she's thinking about the overall data center market. Here is a one minute clip of her talking about what's going on over the next three to five years.</p>
</details>

Lisa Su表示，尽管数据中心AI的营收机会令人兴奋，但他们今天想传达的另一个信息是，公司其他所有业务都表现出色。这是一个非常好的局面。他们今天将讨论的其他关键目标是，他们认为有能力显著超越市场动态增长的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, as exciting as the data center AI, you know, revenue opportunity is for us, um the other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders. And um that's actually a very nice place to be. Um some of the other you know key targets that we're going to talk about today are um areas where we think we have the ability to grow significantly ahead of the market um dynamics.</p>
</details>

在服务器方面，**Dan McNamera**将向大家展示，他们目前占据大约40%的市场份额。他们有明确的路径在未来三到五年内，在更大的**总潜在市场**（TAM: Total Addressable Market: 某个产品或服务在理想情况下可以达到的最大市场规模）中，将服务器市场的营收份额提升到50%以上。**Jack**将谈论他们的客户端营收市场份额。他们目前处于20%的高位，同样，在未来三到五年内，有明确的路径将客户端营收市场份额提升到40%以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um on the server side Dan McNamera is going to show you uh sitting currently at approximately 40% share. We have a clear path to over 50% uh revenue share of the server market over a larger TAM um over the next uh three to five years. Um Jack will talk about our client uh revenue market share. We're sitting let's call it in the high 20s right now. Um again a clear path to over 40% client revenue market share um in this uh 3 to 5 year time frame.</p>
</details>

### AI数据中心投资的质疑与机遇

我认为过去几周的一个重要议题是对更广泛的AI数据中心交易的质疑，坦率地说，有很多理由应该质疑它。我认为我们所有人都应该对AI数据中心交易持怀疑态度，并且应该不断检查我们对这种交易如何演变的假设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think one of the big things over the past couple of weeks has been questioning the broader AI data center trade and quite frankly there's a lot of different reasons why you should question it. I think all of us should be skeptical about the AI data center trade and we should kind of make sure that we constantly check our assumptions in terms of how this trade is playing out.</p>
</details>

过去一周发生的最重要的事情之一是，**甲骨文**（Oracle: 领先的企业软件和云计算公司）的股价跌回了9月以来的水平。上次甲骨文股价在这些水平（233美元左右）交易时，他们宣布了来自OpenAI合同的**剩余履约义务**（RPO: Remaining Performance Obligations: 指客户已签约但尚未履行的合同金额）增长，这导致股价飙升至350美元以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the most important things that's happened over the past week is Oracle has gone back down to prices that we haven't seen since September. Last time Oracle was trading around these levels at 233. Uh they announced the RPO growth from the opening eye contract and that led to a massive surge of above 350.</p>
</details>

在我看来，股价回落到现实的原因是他们正在积极地利用债务市场。但不仅仅是甲骨文这样做，这也是为什么其股价受到打击的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the reason it's back down to reality in my opinion is because well they're tapping the debt markets and they're tapping the debt markets in a pretty aggressive way. But it's not just Oracle that's doing that, which is why the stock has taken a hit.</p>
</details>

**Coreweave**（一家专注于AI和高性能计算的云基础设施提供商）今天下跌了15%。他们与第三方开发商合作的一个数据中心在第四季度出现了延迟。我认为这就是市场感到不满和股价受挫的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cororeef. Coreweave down 15% today. There is a delay on one of their data centers from a thirdparty developer they're working with for fourth quarter. And I think that's why the street's kind of upset and that's why the stock's getting hit.</p>
</details>

更重要的是，我认为他们的**债务股本比**（Debt-to-equity ratio: 衡量公司债务与其股东权益之间关系的财务杠杆比率）持续攀升，目前已超过300%。市场不喜欢这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But more importantly, I think their debt to equity ratio continues to pile up now above 300%. Street doesn't love that.</p>
</details>

**Nebius**是我今天建仓的股票。我之前对Nebius做过深入研究，我会把链接放在聊天中。当时，Nebius的股价在130美元左右。我对这个名字很感兴趣。我不会在这里详细阐述整个投资理念，但如果有人感兴趣，可以阅读Substack上的那篇文章。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nebius, which is a position that I initiated today. I did a deep dive on Nebius a while ago. I'll put the link in the chat. At that time, Nebus was trading at 130 bucks. Got pretty interested about the name. I won't go through the entire thesis here, but if anyone's interested, you can read that link um or that article in the Substack.</p>
</details>

今天给了我机会。我的意思是，现在股价大约是101美元。我今天早上以108美元买入。显然，你不可能每次都完美把握时机。但我今天早上看到了那些数据，这些数据相当惊人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today gave me my opportunity. I mean, the stock's at like 101 right now. Bought it at 108 this morning. Obviously, you're not going to get perfect timing on these things. But I saw those numbers this morning, and the numbers were quite incredible.</p>
</details>

他们现在预计**年度经常性收入**（ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue: 指企业在一年内从订阅或合同中获得的重复性收入）将达到90亿美元，调整后的**息税前利润**（EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes: 衡量公司盈利能力的指标）利润率为19%。他们的交易价格是2026年年度经常性收入的3倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're now guiding for $9 billion annual recurring revenue with adjusted EBIT margins of 19%. They're trading at 3x times 2026 annual recurring revenue.</p>
</details>

我并不是说这只股票会一飞冲天，也绝不是说它会回到130美元。而且它也上涨了很多。所以如果你购买Nebius，请注意它今年迄今已上涨了240%，我在建仓时充分认识到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not saying the stock has to go to the moon. Definitely not saying it has to go back to 130. And it also has gone up a lot. So if you're buying Nebus just recognize it's up 240% year to date and I fully recognize that while I'm taking the position.</p>
</details>

然而，我一直希望在英伟达之外获得更多数据中心的敞口。我认为**Nebius**、Coreweave、Ren Galaxy、Cipher、Terawolf等许多参与者，都与我们刚才谈到的AMD的宏观主题相吻合，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, I have been wanting to get more data center exposure outside of Nvidia. Now I do think that a lot of these players Nebas Cory by Ren Galaxy Cipher Terolf etc. Terowolf down 15% today even though they did get a bunch of upgrades. All of these players are coinciding with the larger macro theme from what we just talked about when it came to AMD, right?</p>
</details>

整个数据中心领域正在经历巨大的复合年增长率，所有这些**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscalers: 指提供大规模云计算服务的公司，如亚马逊AWS、微软Azure、谷歌云等）现在都需要**新云**（Neoclouds: 指下一代或新兴的云服务提供商）的容量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have this massive kagger that's happening in the overall data center space and you have all these hyperscalers that are now needing capacity with the neoclouds.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，Nebius今天没有与**Meta**（Facebook母公司）达成协议，我认为这也很重要，因为我个人希望他们能获得更多除了**微软**（Microsoft: 跨国科技公司，提供软件、硬件和云计算服务）之外的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Nebas didn't get deal with meta today which I also thought was very important because I personally wanted to see them get more than just the Microsoft deal.</p>
</details>

结果是，你看到整个行业都在复合增长。这并不意味着他们的股价必须一直上涨，特别是考虑到我提到的所有这些公司股价都在上涨。我认为今天是一个非常健康的调整日，它们正在喘息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, you're seeing the broader industry compound. That does not mean their stock prices have to go up and to the right, especially since all of those companies that I named are all up and to the right. And I think today's a very, very healthy day that they're taking a breather.</p>
</details>

特别是考虑到它们一直在上涨。当英伟达在数据中心股休息的一天里下跌2%到3%时，这很可能是因为英伟达的下跌，这对我来说似乎是合理的，它们都在重新调整，并随着估值的扩大而继续增长，尽管我认为Nebius很便宜，但它继续增长以支撑其估值扩张是很重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh especially because, you know, they've just been on a run. And when Nvidia is down two to 3% on a day on on a day where the data center plays are taking a breather because of likely Nvidia being down, it seems to make sense to me that they're all kind of resetting and essentially growing into the valuations which although I think Nebius is cheap, it's important for it to continue to grow as its valuation expands.</p>
</details>

因此，从这个角度来看，我做多Nebius是基于AMD的言论以及对Nebius的基本面尽职调查。但我认为整个行业有很大的增长空间，仅仅是因为AMD和英伟达一直在说，对AI的需求是永不满足的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So from that perspective, the reason I'm long Nebas is based on what AMD said along with the fundamental due diligence on Nebus. But the reason I think the overall sector has a lot of room to grow is just because of what AMD and Nvidia keep saying, which is that the demand is insatiable when it comes to AI.</p>
</details>

这也是他们一直使用的关键词之一。甚至Nebius今天也表示，他们之所以能与Meta达成30亿美元的交易，唯一的原因是他们没有足够的产能，否则交易额会更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is one of the key words that they keep using as well. The idea that I mean even Nebia said it today, the only reason they had a $3 billion deal with Meta, they would have had more, but they didn't have enough capacity.</p>
</details>

在财报电话会议中，他们说：“我们卖掉了所有能卖的东西。”所以显然需求量巨大。问题在于基础设施和将这种需求变为现实的执行能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like they they in in the in the earnings call, they said we sold whatever we possibly could. And so obviously there is tons of demand. The question is just the infrastructure and the ability to execute on making that demand real.</p>
</details>

### 软银出售英伟达股份与AI投资策略

现在，我们还有另外两条关于AI的头条新闻，我认为它们也与数据中心领域正在发生的事情相吻合。Anthropic表示，他们计划在2027年实现盈利，这将比OpenAI提前两年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, two other headlines we have in the context of AI that I think are also coinciding with what's going on with the data center plays. Anthropic says they're targeting profitability by 2027.</p>
</details>

他们预计到2028年将有170亿美元的**自由现金流**（Free Cash Flow: 公司在支付所有运营费用和资本支出后所剩余的现金），以及700亿美元的营收。到2027年实现收支平衡，所以实际上是到2028年实现盈利。看到这个消息非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That would be two years ahead of OpenAI. And they're expecting 17 billion in free cash flow by 2028 with 70 billion in revenue by 2028 as well. And then break even by 2027. So realistically profitability by 2028. Very exciting to see this.</p>
</details>

同样，这些基础模型公司也与所有超大规模云服务商以及新云服务商合作。所以，像Anthropic、OpenAI、**谷歌**（Google: 跨国科技公司）旗下的**Gemini**（谷歌开发的大型多模态AI模型）、**XAI**（埃隆·马斯克创立的AI公司）旗下的**Grok**（XAI开发的大型语言模型）等公司，你确实希望看到它们在增长能力方面不断提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the foundation models, those are also companies that are partnering with all the hyperscalers and also partnering with the Neocloud. So, the Anthropics of the world, the OpenAIs of the world, the Geminis of the world owned by Google, the Gros of the world with XAI. You really want to see them continuing to up the ante in terms of their ability to not only grow, which will justify a lot of the debt that these companies are taking out, uh, but also justify the capex commitments that all the hyperscalers are committing to, which is very, very important.</p>
</details>

这不仅能证明这些公司所承担的大量债务是合理的，还能证明所有超大规模云服务商所承诺的**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure: 指企业用于购买、改进或延长固定资产使用寿命的资金）是合理的，这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You really want to see them continuing to up the ante in terms of their ability to not only grow, which will justify a lot of the debt that these companies are taking out, uh, but also justify the capex commitments that all the hyperscalers are committing to, which is very, very important.</p>
</details>

这是第一条主要新闻。第二条新闻是软银出售了其持有的英伟达全部股份，获得了58亿美元的收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that was one main headline. The second headline right here is that SoftBank sold their entire stake in Nvidia, $5.8 billion game.</p>
</details>

这条核心新闻听起来像是利空，因为他们出售了英伟达。但实际上，我认为这是非常利好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That the the sort of core headline makes it sound like it's bearish because they sold Nvidia. But in reality, I think it's very bullish.</p>
</details>

首先，他们过去10年一直持有英伟达。他们上次出售英伟达是在2019年。当时他们持有公司5%的股份，出售的股份价值约80亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, they owned Nvidia for the past 10 years. The last time they sold Nvidia was in 2019. They sold 5% of the company or they owned 5% of the company and the stake they sold was worth about $8 billion.</p>
</details>

如果他们一直持有并挺过了过去五年，那笔股份现在将价值2320亿美元。所以，显然**孙正义**（Masayoshi Son: 软银集团创始人兼首席执行官）对出售那笔股份并不高兴，他可能对此非常恼火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if they held on and just got through the past five years, uh, that stake would have been worth $232 billion. So, obviously, Mazasan is not the happiest about selling that stake. He's probably pissed off about it.</p>
</details>

但他们最终出售了剩余的58亿美元股份。对我来说，我认为这很有道理，原因有二。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, they sold off their final 5.8 billion. And to me, I think it makes a lot of sense because two reasons.</p>
</details>

第一，也许英伟达在未来5到10年内会翻倍，这对于从5万亿美元市值增长到10万亿美元来说是非常激进的。我希望它能实现，我希望这个预测不要那么激进。但如果真的发生了，像软银这样今年股价上涨了150%或200%的公司，他们的业绩非常强劲，没有理由将这么多资金投入到一个可能只会翻倍的投资中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one, maybe Nvidia doubles in the next 5 to 10 years, which is very, you know, aggressive for going from 5 trillion to 10 trillion. I hope it happens. I hope that, you know, it's not as aggressive of a projection. But if it does happen, a company like SoftBank, which has had their stock go up 200% or 150% this year, I mean, they've had a very, very strong year, there's no reason for them to hold that amount of money into something that can double.</p>
</details>

归根结底，这是一个**愿景基金**（Vision Fund: 软银集团旗下的大型科技投资基金）。他们正在寻找下一个有远见的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the day, it's a vision fund. They're looking for the next visionary idea.</p>
</details>

因此，如果这些资本可以部署到可能在OpenAI中增长三倍或四倍的投资中，而他们正在利用这笔钱进行大量投资，考虑到他们基金的规模，走这条路对他们来说更有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if that capital could be deployed in something that's going to triple or quadruple potentially in OpenAI, which is what they're using a lot of that money to be able to invest in, just given the size and scale of the fund that they have, it makes more sense for them to go that route.</p>
</details>

第二，他们并没有把这笔钱投入国库基金，根据他们今天在财报电话会议上的说法，他们正在投资AI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is that they are not taking this money and just putting it in treasury funds based on what they said on the earnings call today. They are investing in AI.</p>
</details>

所以，如果软银将这58亿美元投入OpenAI，然后OpenAI又将这笔钱投入英伟达芯片，那么软银实际上是在资助英伟达销售更多芯片，这对我来说并不是一个循环。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if SoftBank takes this 5.8 billion and dumps it into OpenAI and then OpenAI takes that money and dumps it into Nvidia chips, basically SoftBank is financing the ability for Nvidia to have more chip sales, which to me is not circular.</p>
</details>

如果OpenAI能从这些英伟达芯片中获得**投资回报**（ROI: Return on Investment: 衡量投资效益的指标），那么英伟达显然可以帮助他们执行这些数据中心的建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If OpenAI can get an ROI from these Nvidia chips and then obviously Nvidia can help them execute on the buildout of these data centers.</p>
</details>

所以，这一切都归结于这些使用数据中心的公司是否能获得实际的投资回报，显然我站在“是”这一边，我认为会有投资回报，而且我们已经看到了他们的投资回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, it all comes down to is there an actual ROI from these companies that are using these uh data centers and obviously I'm on the side of yes, I do think there will be an ROI and we're already seeing their ROI.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么软银出售股份，投资其他AI公司，而这些AI公司最终又帮助了英伟达，这是有道理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is why it makes sense for Soft Bank to sell, put into other AI plays and those other AI plays end up ultimately helping Nvidia.</p>
</details>

### SoFi重新引入加密货币与Grab/GoTo合并案

好的，接下来的两条更新是关于**SoFi**（一家提供金融服务的在线个人理财公司）和**Grab**（东南亚领先的超级应用，提供出行、外卖和金融服务）。让我们来谈谈这两家公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, next two updates uh SoFi and Grab. So let's talk about these two companies.</p>
</details>

首先，SoFi正式将加密货币重新引入其平台。他们已经有几年没有在平台上提供加密货币服务了。加密货币重新回到平台非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one, SoFi, they are officially putting crypto back into the platform. It has been a couple years since they've had crypto on the platform. Very important that crypto comes back to the platform.</p>
</details>

显然，为了实现**一站式服务**（One-stop shop: 指在一个地方提供所有相关产品或服务的商业模式），能够提供用户关心的所有不同金融服务，他们需要能够提供加密货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, for the one-stop shop to be able to have all the different financial services that users care about, they're going to need to be able to offer crypto.</p>
</details>

这项公告最重要的一点，你稍后会听到一段关于它的剪辑，是能够直接从您的支票账户进行操作。所以，您不必进入一个全新的投资平台。您可以直接从您的银行账户购买加密货币，我认为这对SoFi来说是净利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing from this announcement, and you're going to listen to a clip of not talking about it in just a second, is um the ability to do it from your checkings account. So, you don't have to like get into this whole new invest platform. You can do it literally right from your bank account and buy crypto, which I think is net bullish for SoFi.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我不认为这是利空。这会给SoFi带来更多费用。这在保持生态系统和飞轮完整性方面更具创造性。

<p class="english-text">I mean, I don't see how it's bearish. It's more fees for SoFi. It's more uh creative in terms of keeping the ecosystem and flywheel intact.</p>
</details>

这也有利于吸引新用户到平台，他们可能想寻找一种交易加密货币的方式，并且正在寻找一个他们信任的机构合作伙伴，而SoFi与他们的用户，特别是在银行方面，有着非常好的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also very good to get new people onto the platform that potentially want to find a way to trade crypto and they're looking for a institutional partner that's like something they trust and SoFi has a really good relationship with their users, especially on the banking side.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为SoFi重新引入加密货币非常有意义。他们将收取1%的费用。**Robinhood**（一家提供免佣金股票、ETF和加密货币交易的金融服务公司）约为0.6%，**Coinbase**（美国最大的加密货币交易所之一）为1.5%。所以，他们介于Robinhood和Coinbase之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think it makes a lot of sense for not to bring back crypto. They're going to be charging 1%. Robin Hood's at like 6. Coinbase is at 1.5. So, they're just in the middle between Robin Hood and Coinbase.</p>
</details>

我认为这在未来会成为他们巨大的营收驱动因素吗？不会。但为了帮助他们调整后的运营利润率，这最终为更好的调整后运营杠杆奠定了基础，他们需要有其他业务杠杆，而不仅仅是与贷款发放挂钩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do I think it's going to be a massive revenue driver for them in the future? No. But to help their adjusted operating margins, which ultimately creates the foundation for better adjusted um operating leverage, they need to have other levers of the business that aren't just tied to loan origination.</p>
</details>

显然，SoFi正在开始真正实现加密货币的多元化。即使他们每个季度能从中赚取1000万到2000万美元，那也将是非常利好的。所以，这对SoFi来说不是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And obviously, SoFi is beginning to really diversify crypto. You know, even if they can make like 10 20 million bucks a quarter off of it, it would be very bullish. So, this is not on SoFi. It</p>
</details>

这是一个非常大的交易。这是一个重要的日子，一个重要的里程碑。它扭转了时间的进程。是的，我们一直希望成为您所有金融服务需求的一站式商店。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is a very big deal. Uh it's a big day and a big milestone. Uh reverses the course of time. Um it does. We've wanted to be a one-stop shop for all your financial services needs.</p>
</details>

过去两年我们面临的一个障碍是加密货币，即买卖和持有加密货币的能力。作为一家银行，我们不允许这样做，这是不被允许的。但今年3月，**货币监理署**（OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: 美国财政部下属的独立机构，负责监管和监督所有国家银行和联邦储蓄协会）发布了一份解释性信函，现在像SoFi这样的银行可以提供加密货币了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the holds we've had for the last two years was in cryptocurrency, the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto. Uh we were not allowed to do that as a bank. It was not permissible. But in March of this year, the OC came out with an interpretive letter that it's now permissible for banks like SoFi to offer uh cryptocurrencies.</p>
</details>

所以今天早上，我们作为唯一一家国家银行，第一家也是唯一一家国家银行，推出了买卖和持有**比特币**（Bitcoin: 一种去中心化的数字加密货币）、**以太坊**（Ethereum: 一种基于区块链的开源平台和加密货币）和**Solana**（一种高性能的区块链平台和加密货币）等加密货币的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this morning, we're launching as the only national bank, the first and only national bank, the opportunity to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Salano.</p>
</details>

所以我想问，我们现在只谈论这三种吗？我们将会扩展到远不止这三种。这将是一个相当广泛的品类。我们努力在速度、广泛选择、优惠价格和易用性方面实现差异化。所以，我们将努力为SoFi会员提供尽可能多的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I was going to ask, are we just talking about three for now? Uh, we'll expand well beyond three. It'll be a pretty broad assortment. We try to differentiate on being fast, having broad selection, great prices, ease of use. So, we'll try to give members, SoFi members, as much selection as they would like.</p>
</details>

那么，通过你们进行交易与通过Coinbase或Robinhood或其他公司进行交易有什么区别呢？是的，有几个非常大的区别。首先，我们是一家全国性特许银行，这意味着我们拥有消费者期望从银行获得的保障所需的基础设施、流程和财务条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's the difference between going through you and going through Coinbase or going through Robin Hood or somebody else? Yeah, there's a couple of really big differences. First, we're a nationally chartered bank, which means we have the infrastructure, the processes, the financial conditions that provides the safeguards that a consumer would expect from a bank.</p>
</details>

这将使我们能够负责任地扩展。其次，因为我们是一站式服务，您可以在SoFi进行所有银行业务、支票和储蓄、借贷和投资，现在还包括加密货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, which is going to allow us to scale responsibly. Uh, the second thing is because we are a one-stop shop, you can do all your banking, checking and savings at SoFi, your borrowing and your investing and now crypto.</p>
</details>

其中一个独特之处是，当您来到SoFi并为您的加密货币投资注资时，您将通过SoFi的支票和储蓄账户进行注资。这些支票和储蓄账户的存款会赚取利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the unique things about that is when you come to SoFi and fund your crypto investments, you'll fund them in a SoFi checking and savings account. that checking savings accounts deposits earn interest.</p>
</details>

再说一遍，您将用加密货币为它注资？您将用现金为您的支票账户注资。好的？然后当您购买比特币、Solana或以太坊时，资金将直接从您的支票储蓄账户中扣除。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Say that again. You're gonna fund it with crypto. You're gonna fund it. You're gonna fund your checking account with cash. Okay? And then when you buy, right, Bitcoin or Solano or Ethereum, the money will come straight out of your checking savings account.</p>
</details>

所以当您不使用现金时，它不会闲置在一个不赚取利息的账户中，也不会闲置在一个没有保险的账户中。所以这笔钱将存放在一个**联邦存款保险公司**（FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 美国政府机构，为银行存款提供保险）承保的账户中。我们提供最高200万美元的保险。当您购买时，它将立即从该账户中提取并发送到市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you're not putting cash to work, it's not sitting in an account that earns no interest and it's not sitting account that's not insured. So the money will sit in an FDIC insured account. Up to $2 million is what we offer. And when you buy, it will instantly withdraw from that account and send it to the marketplace.</p>
</details>

所以这里有一个问题。这在目前看来似乎很新颖。如果我们一年后坐在这里，考虑到OCC的这项决定以及这个国家的其他所有银行，这最终会有多新颖？我的意思是，您认为**美国银行**（Bank of America）、**摩根大通**（JPMorgan）、**富国银行**（Wells Fargo）以及所有大银行和其他所有银行都会做同样的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here's a question. This seems novel in this moment. If we're sitting here a year from now, given this OC decision and every other bank in this country, how novel will this ultimately be? Meaning, do you imagine Bank of America and JP Morgan and every bank, Wells Fargo, all the big banks and everybody else will be doing exactly this?</p>
</details>

我不认为会。原因有几个。我们是唯一的数字一站式商店。他们不提供我们所提供的包括借贷、储蓄、投资、保护和消费在内的广泛产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't. And a couple of reasons for that. We're the only digital one-stop shop. they do not offer the breath of products that we offer across borrowing, saving, investing, protecting um and and and spending.</p>
</details>

所以，我们不仅能够购买加密货币，现在还通过**闪电网络**（Lightning Network: 一种比特币的第二层支付协议，旨在实现快速、低成本的交易）提供国际支付的能力，闪电网络是一个加密货币网络，我们还会增加其他网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we have the ability to not just buy cryptocurrency, but we're now providing the ability to send payments internationally via uh the Lightning Network, which is a crypto uh network, and we'll add others to that.</p>
</details>

为什么他们，为什么一些更传统的传统银行不能做同样的事情呢？他们必须自己回答这个问题。我坚信我们以会员为中心，专注于与您的资金相关的活动，而不是产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why can't they the why can't some of these sort of more traditional legacy banks do the same thing? They'll have to answer why. I fundamentally believe that we put the member at the center of that what we do. We focus on these things that are activities to do with your money, not products.</p>
</details>

所以SoFi Money账户是一个您可以用于国际汇款、自助电汇、现在可以用于购买加密货币、可以通过电子邮件向朋友付款（通过Zelle）的账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the SoFi money account is an account that you can use for international remittance, you could use for self-s served wires, you can now use for crypto buying, you could use for paying friends via email, Enzel.</p>
</details>

所以，整个想法是利用技术让您的资金流动尽可能简单，同时也能完成您需要做的所有其他事情，以正确管理您的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the whole idea is to leverage technology to make moving your money as easy as possible, but also doing all the other things you need to do to get your money right.</p>
</details>

所以总的来说，SoFi将加密货币重新引入平台是净利好。Grab呢？这些家伙怎么了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So overall, net bullish that SoFi is bringing crypto back to the platform. Grab. What's going on with these guys?</p>
</details>

如果您一直在关注Grab和**GoTo**（印度尼西亚领先的科技公司，提供出行、电商和金融服务）在过去几个月的传奇故事，那么GoTo是Grab在印度尼西亚最大的竞争对手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you've been following the Grab Goto saga over the past couple of months, uh Goto is Grab's largest competitor in Indonesia.</p>
</details>

基本上，根据彭博社报道的传闻，今年3月的说法是Grab将收购GoTo。这很有道理。这有点像一场价格战。所有这些公司都在争夺**网约车**（Ride-hailing: 通过移动应用程序提供叫车服务的模式）和**出行利润**（Mobility margins: 指出行服务业务的利润率），这意味着客户受益，但股东却不受益，因为没有利润，公司也无法真正盈利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And essentially the argument back in March based on rumors that Bloomberg was reporting was that Graph was going to acquire Goto. Makes a lot of sense. It's kind of a race to a bottom. All these companies fighting for ride hailing and mobility margins, which means the customer wins, but shareholders don't win because there's no margins and then the actual companies aren't able to really turn a profit.</p>
</details>

所以，该地区的整合是我投资Grab时的论点之一，我当时认为这会发生。过去几个月，我们没有听到太多关于这方面的消息。所以我一度认为70亿美元的现金，Grab在6月份通过0%的**可转换票据发行**（Convertible note offering: 一种债务工具，可以在未来转换为公司的股权）筹集了约15亿美元，我认为这并不太重要，因为我想他们最终不会收购这家公司，因为过去几个月我们什么也没听到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the consolidation of the region was part of my thesis when I invested in Graph and I thought that that would happen. Over the past couple months, we haven't heard too much about that. So I kind of thought the seven billion in cash, Graph did raise about 1.5 billion on a 0% convertible note offering back in June. I thought that didn't matter too much because like I guess they weren't going to end up acquiring the company because we just hadn't heard anything over the past couple of months.</p>
</details>

嗯，现在在我脑海深处，我有点觉得这可能，但我只是不再关心它了。然而，过去几天发生了两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, now in the back of my head, I kind of thought maybe it's possible, but I just stopped really caring about it. Well, two things happened over the past couple days.</p>
</details>

第一，一位印度尼西亚总统办公室的官员表示，他们正在积极寻找Grab和GoTo合并的方式，我认为这太不可思议了。这意味着GoTo平台上的1亿用户将被带到Grab。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one, an Indonesian president uh official, so someone from the president's office in Indonesia said that they are actively looking for a way to grab and go to merge, which I thought was incredible. That's a 100 million users that are on Go's platform to bring that over to Grab.</p>
</details>

那将是东南亚的一个绝对巨头。可能会重新评估这家公司。顺便说一句，现在所有的目标价格都从6.90美元到7美元。所以几乎所有分析师都认为这个故事应该被重新评估，股价应该更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That would be an absolute behemoth in Southeast Asia. Probably rerate the company. By the way, all the price targets now are from $690 to $7. So pretty much the entire I think the highest is at $8 and then you have 755. So pretty much all the analysts are on board that this story should be rerated to go higher.</p>
</details>

但这，我认为将巩固该地区的整合，这是利好的。我们一周前得到了这个消息。昨晚彭博社报道称，我们之前谈论过软银与英伟达，软银在Grab和GoTo中拥有主要股份，现在正寻求罢免GoTo的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that would I think solidify that the consolidation of the region that was bullish. We got that news a week ago. Last night Bloomberg reported that SoftBank, we were talking about Soft Bank with Nvidia that has a major stake in Grab and Goto is now looking to oust the CEO of GoTo.</p>
</details>

原因之一是他卷入了大量的争议。今年发生了许多关于GoTo从印度尼西亚政府窃取本应提供给儿童和**谷歌Chromebooks**（Google Chromebooks: 运行Google Chrome OS的笔记本电脑）的资金，反而中饱私囊的事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A because he's been involved in a ton of controversies. There was a bunch of different stuff that happened this year about Goto stealing money from the Indonesian government that they were supposed to give to kids and Google Chromebooks. Instead, they pocketed the money.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是政府已经对他们不满的原因。其次，他拒绝了Grab的收购。他不想让Grab收购公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like that is a reason why the uh government has already been pissed off with them. And then number two, he's rejecting the Grab takeover. He doesn't want Grab to take over the company.</p>
</details>

所以软银介入说：“嘿，老兄，你的股票在过去几年里表现不佳，一直在下跌。Grab不一定一飞冲天，但Grab正在开始突破。过去一年上涨了35%。GoTo过去一年下跌了1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you got SoftBank coming in saying, "Hey buddy, your stock has done this, aka go down over the past couple years. Grab has not necessarily gone straight to the moon, but Grab is starting to break out. It's up 35% over the past year. Go's down 1% over the past year.</p>
</details>

而且Grab的盈利增长正在开始真正显示出拐点。所以Grab拥有70亿美元现金，因为他们在东南亚所有这些地区都处于更主导的地位，而不仅仅是一个国家，所以他们是明显的收购GoTo的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Grab is starting to really show an inflection in terms of earnings growth. So I and Grab has 7 billion in cash because they're just in a more dominant position because they're part of all these regions in Southeast Asia, not just one country that they're the obvious choice to be able to take them over.</p>
</details>

所以我认为软银正准备罢免GoTo的首席执行官。未来几周，12月17日将举行一次**特别股东大会**（Extraordinary General Meeting: EGM: 在公司正常年度股东大会之外召开的会议，通常用于讨论紧急或特殊事项）。我们将了解事情将如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think SoftBank is getting ready to get rid of the go-to CEO. There's an extraordinary general meeting on December 17th in the next couple weeks. We're going to find out kind of how this plays out.</p>
</details>

董事会可能会召开会议，罢免首席执行官，然后为Grab收购GoTo公司制定框架。我不知道这是否会发生。我不是基于这会发生而投资的。如果真的发生了，那将是相当疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you might have the board of directors come together, get rid of the CEO, and then make the framework for Grab to be able to acquire the company. I don't know if it's going to happen. I'm not investing based on that happening. That would be pretty crazy if it did happen.</p>
</details>

我认为这显然会重新评估Grab的故事，但这是利好的，因为归根结底，GoTo和Grab相互竞争是愚蠢的。这是一种失败的宣言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it would obviously rerate the story for Grab, but it is bullish because at the end of the day, go to and Grab competing against each other is a stupid thing. Like, it's it's a losing proclamation.</p>
</details>

如果你想从该地区获得任何水平的股东回报，并且该地区的利润率已经相当糟糕，那么你不应该希望看到这种竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not something that you should want to see in the overall region if you want to have any level of shareholder returns from being able to generate a margin where the margins are already pretty crappy in the region.</p>
</details>

所以，要做到这一点意味着你需要整合。在我看来，Grab应该是整合的赢家。会有少数赢家。我认为Grab就在这个名单上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, so being able to do that means you need consolidation. In my opinion, Grap should be the one that's the winner of the consolidation. There's going to be a handful of winners. I think Graph is on that list.</p>
</details>

最终，即使你只获得了GoTo的网约车和出行部分，即使没有获得他们的金融科技部门，那也没关系。即使是单独收购，我们只需要支付10亿或20亿美元，我的意思是，那也不会太糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then ultimately if you end up getting the ride hailing and mobility part of goto even if you don't get the fintech arm of them which is fine even if it's a separate acquisition and we only have to pay a billion two billion bucks I mean that would not be bad.</p>
</details>

我认为它不值超过20亿美元，但Grab有现金，这可能是聪明钱一直在增持的原因，85%的机构流通股表明他们认为这会发生，如果真的发生了，从长远来看，这对Grab来说似乎是利好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think it's worth more than two billion but Grab has the cash potentially the reason why smart money's been loading up 85% institutional float is because they think that this is going to happen and if it does happen it does seem like it would be bullish for Grab in the long term.</p>

### 宏观经济：美国政府停摆与特朗普关税裁决

好的，让我们谈谈宏观经济。美国政府正在发生什么，以及关税方面的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's talk about the macro. What's going on with the US government and what's going on with tariffs.</p>
</details>

所以我真的希望这次政府停摆能尽快结束，并尽快进行投票，但最晚可能需要一周时间才能看到结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I am really hoping this shutdown is over pretty soon and a vote happens ASAP, but it might end up taking a week at the latest to see uh if this ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

其次，除了政府停摆（至少我们有程序性投票），**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 美国500家最大上市公司股票的市值加权指数）今天上涨了0.683%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, outside of the shutdown, which at least we have a procedural vote on and the S&P 500, by the way, I mean, green on the day, 683.</p>
</details>

所以，尽管今天有一些数据中心股下跌，一些可能有点过热的股票失去了部分动力，英伟达昨天表现最好，上涨了6%，今天下跌了2%。我一点也不认为这糟糕。坦率地说，我认为这很健康。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, even though you've had some data center red today, you've had some stocks that maybe were a little frothy, got some of the wind taken out of them, Nvidia had its best day yesterday, up 6%, today it's down 2%. I don't think that's bad at all. I quite frankly think that's healthy.</p>
</details>

标普500指数上涨，但有一条新闻传出，我不知道会发生什么，但我们昨天谈到了最高法院的关税裁决以及将要发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um S&P's green, but you've got this headline that came across that I don't know what the heck's going to happen here, but we we talked yesterday about Supreme Court uh tariff rulings and what's going to happen right here.</p>
</details>

根据我一直在阅读的内容，有几个关键点。如果最高法院命令**特朗普**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）偿还关税，美国进口商今天在最高法院的口头听证会上表示，这不会很混乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Couple key points from what I've been reading. Uh if the Supreme Court orders Trump to repay tariffs, US importers today in an oral hearing with the Supreme Court said it wouldn't be messy.</p>
</details>

美国进口商表示，如果最高法院裁定他们为**唐纳德·特朗普**总统的关税所支付的钱必须偿还，那么这样做会很简单。进口商指出，有文件清楚地详细说明了他们为进口到美国商品所支付的关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">American importers said that if the Supreme Court rules that the money they have paid for President Donald Trump's tariffs must be repaid, it would be simple to do so. importers pointed to a paperwork that clearly details the tariffs they paid on goods brought into the US.</p>
</details>

基本上，他们认为“嘿，如果我们必须偿还我们一直在收取的钱，那也不是世界上最困难的事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basically making the argument that says, "Hey, if we had to repay the money that we've been collecting, it would not be the hardest thing in the world to do."</p>
</details>

对我来说，你知道，我之前的一个论点是，为什么最高法院可能认为关税不容易推翻，是因为他们可能会说这会引起混乱，关于偿还等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh which to me, you know, one of the arguments I had for why the Supreme Court might think that the tariffs are um well that the tariffs are not easy to overturn is because they might say all the chaos that it would cause about repaying and like you know at the end of the day Supreme Court as constitutional as they are, they might look to the reality of what the decision would entail and say, "Hey, maybe we should stay away from this. Maybe we should just vote in favor of the president so things don't go crazy."</p>
</details>

归根结底，最高法院尽管是宪法机构，他们可能会考虑判决的实际影响，然后说：“嘿，也许我们应该避开这个问题。也许我们应该投票支持总统，这样事情就不会失控。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at the end of the day Supreme Court as constitutional as they are, they might look to the reality of what the decision would entail and say, "Hey, maybe we should stay away from this. Maybe we should just vote in favor of the president so things don't go crazy."</p>
</details>

然而，现在进口商表示情况不会那么糟糕。这是**CNBC**（美国消费者新闻与商业频道）的报道。在上周三关于决定特朗普关税命运的案件的口头辩论中，大多数最高法院大法官对这些关税的合法性表示怀疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, now you've got importers saying that it's not going to be that bad. And then this is what CNBC is reporting. During oral arguments last Wednesday for a case that would decide the fate of Trump's tariffs, most Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism that the duties were legal.</p>
</details>

特朗普今天发推文表示，他对最高法院可能对该案件的裁决感到非常愤怒，而且他特别指出，这不符合国家安全利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump today tweeted he was pretty pissed off about the Supreme Court potential ruling of the case and uh you know he specifically made the argument that this is not something that should be good in the interest of national security.</p>
</details>

他确切地说：“美国最高法院得到了错误的数字。如果对关税做出负面裁决，包括为返还超过3万亿美元资金而进行的投资，将导致无法弥补的打击，这确实会成为一个无法克服的国家安全事件，并对我们国家的未来造成毁灭性影响，甚至可能无法持续。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The exact thing he said was the US Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. the unwind in the event of a negative decision on tariffs would be including investments made to be made in return of funds in excess of $3 trillion. It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of drubbing that would truly become an insurmountable national security event and devastating to the future of our country possibly non-sustainable.</p>
</details>

我不知道会发生什么。我认为我们将在未来几周内得到裁决。如果您是市场投资者，这是我的看法，我们大多数人最终关心的是这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know what's going to happen. I think we're going to get a decision over the next coming weeks. Here's my takeaway for you if you're a markets investor, which most of us here that you know that's what we ultimately care about.</p>
</details>

有两个观点。第一，我认为市场可能会上涨。我认为市场一开始就不喜欢关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, two perspectives. Number one, I think the market could go up. I think the market never liked tariffs in the first place.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我们知道市场不喜欢关税。尽管过去一年有所有其他积极因素，市场仍能保持上涨。但最初，我们看到了4月份发生的事情。市场不喜欢关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, we know the market doesn't like tariffs. The market's been able to keep up and go higher even with all the other positive things that we've had on for the past year. But initially, we saw what happened in April. The market didn't like the tariffs.</p>
</details>

市场反弹的唯一原因是特朗普表示他将取消所有**对等关税**（Reciprocal tariffs: 指两国之间相互征收的相同或类似关税）。所以，我的意思是，存在这样一种情况，即市场喜欢我们不再有这些关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The only reason the market rebounded was because Trump said he's getting rid of all the reciprocal tariffs. So, I mean, there is a world in which the market loves that we don't have this tariff stuff anymore.</p>
</details>

以及通货膨胀的威胁，这可能是市场坚决反对的另一个因素，信贷市场可能会担心如果关税取消，通货膨胀会下降，这理论上可能是市场上涨的另一个原因。

<p class="english-text">and the threat of inflation which could be one of the other things that the market is hellbent on definitely that the credit markets could be scared about that going down if the tariffs go away theoretically could be another reason why the markets go higher</p>
</details>

这里的悲观观点是，我们与日本、韩国、印度（可能与印度仍在进行中）、中国、欧洲达成的所有协议，所有这些的**关键**（lynchpin: 指事物的核心或关键所在）都是关税，对吧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">the bearish perspective here is that all of the deals that we've been able to cultivate with Japan South Korea India potentially with India that's still in the works China um Europe like all that the lynch pin of all that was tariffs right?</p>
</details>

想法是，嘿，如果你不这样做，我们就会把关税提高40-50%，就像我们威胁欧盟那样。我的意思是，我不知道这些国家投资的动机是什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">the idea was that hey if you don't do this we're going to bring up the tariffs by 40 50% % like we threatened for the EU. I mean, I wonder what's the motivation for a lot of those countries to invest.</p>
</details>

也许他们想与美国保持良好关系，这很公平。但如果他们不这样做，或者他们不关心这一点，或者他们无法证明因为关税威胁而在美国投入这么多资金是合理的，我的意思是，**苹果**（Apple: 跨国科技公司，设计、开发和销售消费电子、计算机软件和在线服务）实际上做出了三四五千亿美元的承诺，因为他们不想让在中国生产的产品被征收巨额关税。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Maybe they want to keep a good relationship with the United States, which is fair. But if they don't or if they don't care about that or if they can't justify putting in that much money into the US because of the threat of tariffs, I mean, Apple literally made, you know, three four 500 billion commitments because they don't want to have massive tariffs imposed on their products that are being made in China.</p>
</details>

如果这一切都被取消了，我只是想知道，从经济角度来看，特朗普关于这将是多么难以克服的观点是否有道理？显然从国家安全的角度来看，我确实同意我们应该有一些关税，以激励美国国内大量产品的制造业，但也要考虑到不得不退还这笔钱或重新谈判这些协议。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If that's all taken away, I just wonder economically, does Trump have a point about how insurmountable it would be? Obviously from a national security perspective, which I do agree, we should have some tariffs to be able to uh incentivize the domestic manufacturing of a lot of pro products in the United States, but also from the idea of having to just refund that money or renegotiate on these deals.</p>
</details>

这些协议是特朗普总统任期第一年（第二任期）的亮点。所以，我不知道会发生什么。显然，随着盈利持续走高，我对年底的股市更加乐观。

<details>

<p class="english-text">These deals that were kind of the highlight of Trump's presidency in the first year of his second term. So, I don't know what's going to happen. Obviously, I'm a bit more bullish towards the end of the year for the stock market as earnings continue to go higher.</p>
</details>

我们将在12月迎来降息。但如果关税问题消失了，我不知道这是否是净利好。请在评论中告诉我您的想法，或者这是否是净利空。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We got this rate cut coming in December. But if the tariff thing goes away, I don't know if it's net bullish and let me know in the comments what you think or if it's net bearish.</p>
</details>

如果政府停摆没有很快结束，再加上关税问题，未来几周可能会导致更多的波动。所以政府很快就会重新开放，这是我们终于摆脱的一个主要**逆风**（Headwind: 指阻碍进步或增长的因素），周五我们下跌2%时它确实成为了一个逆风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if the shutdown doesn't end soon in conjunction with the tariffs that might lead to a little bit more volatility over the coming weeks. So the government will reopen soon and that's like one major headwind we finally got rid of and it really became a headwind on Friday when we fell 2%.</p>
</details>

但现在这个关税问题，我不知道它是逆风还是**顺风**（Tailwind: 指促进进步或增长的因素），我非常好奇人们怎么看。但这对我们投资者来说将是非常重要的跟踪事项，因为我们正在走向年底。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now this tariff thing, I don't know if it's a headwind or a tailwind and I'm very curious to see what people think. But that is something that's going to be very very important to track for us as investors as we navigate going into the end of the year.</p>

### 结语与感恩

好的，今天的节目到此结束。感谢大家的收听和观看。感谢大家对这些每日回顾节目的所有支持。我看到了昨天你们在周一几周以来的第一集中的许多评论。

<p class="english-text">All right, that's it for me. Thank everybody for listening and watching. Thank you for all the support on these daily recaps. I saw a lot of your comments yesterday on the uh first episode in a couple weeks on Monday.</p>
</details>

是的，我非常非常感谢所有说他们喜欢这些内容的人。我喜欢每天制作它。我认为这让我保持敏锐和警觉，以便每天整合所有新闻并发布出来。

<p class="english-text">And uh yeah, deeply deeply appreciate everyone who said, you know, that they enjoy the content. I enjoy making it every single day. I think it keeps me sharp and on my toes in terms of figuring out how to amalgamate all the news every day and put it out there.</p>
</details>

所以，非常非常感谢大家的收看。也祝大家退伍军人节快乐。我今天在开盘时说过，但随着年龄增长，我开始意识到我之所以能够从事我现在正在做的事情，有机会创业并追求美国梦，唯一的原因是有人牺牲了，有人为了我拥有这些权利而献出了生命。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So definitely definitely appreciate everyone tuning in. And uh also happy Veterans Day. I said this on the market open today, but um you know I as I get older, I'm starting to realize that the only reason I'm able to do what I'm even doing in society, have a chance to start a business and pursue the American dream is because people died and people uh gave up their life for me to have these rights.</p>
</details>

所以我从未以任何方式回馈我的国家，除了纳税，我不知道这是否是最值得纪念的表达“嘿，我回馈了我的国家”的方式。那些冒着生命危险的人，那些在陆军、海军、空军服役的人，我的意思是，所有这些真正说过“嘿，我的生命不如我的国家自由的能力重要”的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I've never given back to my country in any way outside of taxes, which I don't know if that's the most uh commemorable way to say, "Hey, like I gave back to my country." People who put their life on the line, people who served in the army, military, navy, air force, I mean, all these people that actually really said, "Hey, my life matters less than the ability for my country to be free."</p>
</details>

对此我无比感激。坦率地说，我认为随着年龄增长，你会开始意识到这项权利有多么重要，以及世界其他地方与我们有多么不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is something that I'm unbelievably grateful for. And quite frankly, I think as you get older, you start to realize how important that right is and how different the rest of the world has it than us.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么至少我为自己是美国人而自豪，为什么我认为美国是世界上最伟大的国家之一。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There is a reason why at least I'm proud to be American and why I think America is one of the greatest countries in the world.</p>
</details>
