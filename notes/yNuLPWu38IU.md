### 序言：全球市值最高公司的CEO访谈

主持人：大家好。我刚刚经历了我一生中最不可思议的体验，我有幸采访了萨提亚·纳德拉，微软的首席执行官，该公司现在是全球市值最高的公司。哇，请大家收听。萨提亚，您是全球市值最高公司的CEO，最近您在思考些什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi there I've just had the most incredible experience of my life having been allowed to interview saan Adella the CEO of Microsoft which is now the most valuable company in the world wow please tune in SAA you are the CEO of the most valuable company in the world what's what's on your mind these days</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：尼古拉，首先，很高兴能和您一起进行这次对话。我最关心的事情有两方面。第一，我深知在我们的科技行业——这已经是我在微软的第32年了——没有所谓的**特许经营价值**（franchise value: 指品牌或公司因其市场地位和声誉而享有的持续性竞争优势）。这意味着你每天都必须起床，并希望你所做的事情在明天仍然具有相关性。对我来说，这也许是过去几十年中学到的最大教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">look to me um Nikolai first of all it's great to be with you and um have this conversation what's top of mind for me is twofold right one is I'm grounded in the fact that in our business in Tech business now this is my 32nd year at Microsoft um I know that for a fact that there's no such thing as a franchise value and so that means every day you have to get up and hopefully you're doing things that are going to be relevant tomorrow um and so to me that's sort of perhaps the biggest lesson learned over all these decades and years</p>
</details>

### 平台转型与持续创新

萨提亚·纳德拉：我们现在正处于一场全新的**平台转型**（platform shift: 指技术或商业模式发生根本性改变，导致新的市场机会和竞争格局）之中。我常说这是我在微软的第32年，但却是我的第四次平台转型的第二年。所以，我思考的是：这次平台转型究竟意味着什么？作为一家公司，我们能否全身心投入并进行创新？毕竟，当我说没有特许经营价值时，也意味着你必须重新为一切而战，即使是我们曾经赢得或输掉的战役，现在都再次摆在面前。因此，这带来了一种新鲜感。所以，我脑海中想的是，如何让自己再次扎根于又一次平台转型，这令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so here we are on what is is essentially a complete new platform shift uh that we're in the midst of right I kind of say it's my 32nd year but it's year two of my fourth platform shift and so what's on mind is like okay what is this platform shift really all about and as a company can we be all in and innovate right I mean at the end of the day uh when I say there's no franchise value it also means that you get to play for it all up again even the battles we won and the battles we lost are all up for grab again and so therefore um there's a freshness to it so what's on my mind is you know that ability to ground myself back yet on on another platform shift and it's exciting</p>
</details>

主持人：没有特许经营价值这个事实，会让您感到紧张吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the fact that there is no franchise value does that make you nervous</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：当然会。我的意思是，它应该让我们每个人都感到紧张，对吧？至少这就是科技如此令人兴奋的原因。这就像一枚硬币的两面：一方面你感到紧张，另一方面又充满兴奋，所以你不能停歇。但与此同时，谁又想在一个无法不断重塑自我的行业中呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely I mean it should make every one of us nervous right at least that's why the tech is so exciting right it's sort of it's kind of like the two sides to the same coin right one is you're nervous and it's exciting so therefore you can't rest uh but at the same time hey who wants to be in in a business that you know where you don't get to reinvent yourself again and again</p>
</details>

### 科技作为经济增长的驱动力

主持人：当然。您认为我们是否对科技的看法过于狭隘？我的意思是，科技如何才能真正成为下一阶段经济增长的驱动力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely do you think we look at Tech in two narrow a sense I mean how can technology really be a driver for the next level of economic growth</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：这是一个非常棒的问题，我对此思考很多。在某种意义上，如果从GDP层面来看，狭义定义的科技支出可能只占4%到5%。那么问题是，其他95%的领域发生了什么？我一直以来思考任何新技术范式或平台转型（比如人工智能）前景的方式是：如果人工智能将成为下一个重要的**通用技术**（general purpose technology: 指对经济和社会产生广泛而深远影响的技术，如蒸汽机、电力或互联网），那么真正的机会在于，假设未来五到十年内科技支出从5%增长到10%，那么其他90%的领域会发生什么？整个经济蛋糕会变得更大吗？我们能否在医疗保健领域因AI而取得突破？我们能否在材料科学和能源转型领域因AI而取得突破？这样的例子不胜枚举。所以对我来说，这基本上就是我思考问题的方式。我认为对我们来说，最重要的事情之一是思考通用技术如何发挥作用。有人曾告诉我，在工业革命鼎盛时期，英国将GDP的10%用于修建铁路，而铁路显然不仅仅是关于铁路本身，它关乎整个英国经济。我认为，这就是我分析科技及其未来将如何影响更广泛社会和经济的单位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah that's a great great question I think a lot about that right which is uh in some sense if you take at a GDP level uh Tech spend narrowly defined is probably 4 5% uh so the question is what is happening with the other 95% so one of the ways I've always thought about the prospects of any new technological Paradigm or platform shift like take AI let's I if AI is going to be the next big general purpose technology for me the real opportunity is let's say Tech spend goes from 5 to 10% over the next you know five years or what have you or 10 years then what happens to the other 90% And the pi does it become bigger right does the you know do we have a breakthrough in healthc care driven by AI do we have a breakthrough in material signs and energy transition because of uh AI uh and the list goes on right so to me that is fundamentally the way I think about it right which is I I think that one of the things that might be most important for us is to consider how a general purpose technology somebody was telling me this right which is in the height of the Industrial Revolution uh in the United Kingdom they spent 10% of their GDP building the railroads and obviously the railroads not just didn't is not about the railroads it was about the entire economy of the United Kingdom and so something like that I think is what uh that's the unit of analysis at least for me as to how Tech and its future will impact the in a broader society and economy</p>
</details>

### 微软的AI战略与OpenAI合作

主持人：现在，谷歌几乎拥有所有顶尖的AI人才，而你们突然领先，部分原因在于与OpenAI的合作。这合作是如何促成的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now um Google had almost all the top AI people and you suddenly got ahead partly due to your partnership with open AI now how did that come about</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：对我来说，尼古拉，我对此的看法非常简单。显然，我们一直都在做AI。我认为微软研究院在1995年成立时做的第一件事就是与语音相关的一些工作。事实上，我认为我们当时从**卡内基梅隆大学**（Carnegie Mellon University: 美国顶尖研究型大学，尤其在计算机科学领域享有盛誉）聘请了一批人才。所以，我们以各种不同的形式从事AI研究已经很久了。当我与OpenAI的团队，包括萨姆·奥特曼（Sam Altman）和格雷格·布罗克曼（Greg Brockman）等人会面时——那是在他们甚至还在Dota 2竞赛上努力的时候——我发现他们对事物有一种全新的、不同的方法。我们想要一个合作伙伴。在我在微软的这些年里，我一直在寻找那些拥有远大抱负的科技创新公司，并建立伙伴关系，比如英特尔（Intel）和Windows的结合取得了成功，SAP和SQL Server的结合也取得了成功。所以我一直在寻找可以共同创新的伙伴，我在萨姆和他的团队身上找到了这一点。当时，这并不是一个显而易见的成功，我们是在黑暗中摸索，并不是说“哇，这绝对会成功”。现在每个人都谈论它，就好像这是理所当然的，但这正是科技的特点：在它成为**普遍共识**（conventional wisdom: 指社会上普遍接受的观点或信念）之前，你必须全力投入并希望它能成功。我们早在它成为普遍共识之前就支持了它，才有了今天的局面。但我并不认为竞争会减少。谷歌是一家非常有实力的公司，他们拥有人才和计算能力，他们是这个领域的**垂直整合**（vertically integrated: 指公司在一个行业内拥有多个生产阶段或供应链环节）玩家，从数据到芯片，再到模型、产品和分销，他们拥有一切。还有其他公司也一样。所以，是的，我们将面临激烈的竞争。我认为，如果说有什么不同的话，那就是微软与OpenAI的合作正在带来更多的竞争，否则谷歌本应是默认的赢家。如果我们合作得好，创新得好，我们就能给他们带来一些竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean um to me the way I came at this Nikolai is just very simple which is obviously we have been like I think the very first thing Microsoft research did in 1995 when it was formed was some stuff around speech right in fact I think we hired a bunch of the folks from CMU and so we've been at this AI thing in its variety of different forms forever um and so one of the things that when I met with the open AI folks and Sam and Greg and crew uh back in you know I would say when they were working even on the Dota 2 contest and what have you uh was to sort of say wow they have a new different approach to things and we wanted a partner I mean you know one of the things that I've always looked at over my years at Microsoft is look for high ambition um Technology Innovation companies right whether it you know or and partnership like whether it's Intel and windows came together and that was successful sap and SQL Server it came together and was successful so I'm always looking for partners that we can innovate with and that's what I found in uh Sam and team and uh and we you know at that time it was not like it was a it was a real uh in the dark right it is not like oh wow this is a sure sure thing everybody now talks about it as if uh you know this is the issue with tech right which is uh long before it's conventional wisdom you have to be all in and hope it works um and this is one of those things where we backed it long before it was conventional wisdom um and here we are but I don't take you know like there's going to be severe amount of competition you know Google's a very competent company and obviously they have both the talent and the compute and they have you know they're the vertically integrated player in this right they have everything from data to Silicon to models to have products and distribution and there's others as well and so yeah we will have significant amount of competition and I think if anything Microsoft's partnership with open AI is bringing more competition to otherwise what would have been a default Google should have be the default winner uh and if we partner well and we innovate well we can bring some competition to them</p>
</details>

### 微软在AI生态系统中的全栈策略

主持人：那么，展望未来三到五年，您认为微软在整个AI生态系统中将处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so if you look 3 to five years from now where is Microsoft in this whole AI ecosystem you think</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：对我来说，我从**全栈**（full stack: 指涵盖从底层硬件到顶层应用所有技术层面）的角度来思考这个问题。首先，我们希望拥有最好的AI基础设施。这意味着在Azure上，无论是用于训练还是推理，我们都要提供卓越的基础设施。我们将与英伟达（Nvidia）和AMD合作，也将拥有自己的芯片。我们将拥有自己的系统架构，并借鉴詹森·黄（Jensen Huang）和丽莎·苏（Lisa Su）以及其他可能加入者的最佳系统架构创新，确保Azure能够满足OpenAI、Mistral以及我们正在构建的Phi（小型语言模型）的需求。这是我们想做的第一件事，即在构建训练和推理基础设施方面做到最好。然后，再上一层，我们希望拥有完整的数据层。你可以想象，随着这些模型和模型能力的增强，数据层将完全重构。我们已经讨论过**检索增强生成**（Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG: 一种结合信息检索和文本生成的技术，使大型语言模型能够访问外部知识库以生成更准确和最新的回答）。你拥有所有这些东西，无论是**嵌入**（embeddings: 将文本、图像等数据转换为数值向量表示，以便机器学习模型处理）还是**向量搜索**（vector search: 一种基于向量相似度进行数据检索的方法），如何对数据进行分块，以便检索增强生成能够良好运作。这是一个完整的层次。或者当隐形眼镜变得更普及时，那将是另一种数据层，比如数据和你的推理集群之间的吞吐量如何？你如何思考这些问题？因此，我们将在数据层进行创新。当然，在此之上，我们将在我们的**Copilot**（AI助手产品系列）上进行创新。我们最早构建的产品之一是GitHub Copilot。事实上，我对这一代AI的全部信心始于我看到从GPT-3到GPT-3.5及其在GitHub中的实现。所以，我们现在不仅有GitHub Copilot，还有用于Microsoft 365中所有知识工作的Copilot，我们还有用于服务、销售或财务等职能的Copilot。因此，我们将在应用层进行自主创新。这基本上就是我的看法，这是一个全栈方法。顺便说一句，在每个层次上，我们都会创新，我们会有合作伙伴，也会有其他人在那里创新，甚至会有竞争。作为一家平台公司，你必须习惯于许多第三方在不同层次上与你竞争，因为这对我来说是核心。否则，你就会试图以**单体式**（monolithic: 指系统或应用程序被构建为一个单一的、紧密耦合的单元）的方式做所有事情，而我们多年来学到的最好经验是让每个层次都保持自身的竞争力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so to me I think about this in the fullness of the stack right so I want us to have first and foremost the best AI infrastructure uh so that means when it comes to Azure whether it's for training whether it's for inference to have fantastic infrastructure we'll partner with Nvidia we'll partner with AMD we'll have our own own silicon uh we will have our own system architecture we will take the best system architecture Innovation from Jensen and Lisa and others who may come along and make sure Azure is serving the needs of open AI serving the needs of Mistral uh serving the needs of fi that we are building right which is the small language model so that's kind of the first uh thing that we want to do which is the best work um in being able to build the infrastructure out for both training and inference and then the next layer up we want to have like the entire data tier right so you can imagine as these models and model capabilities become uh you know more capable I think the data tier will be completely uh redone uh right we've talked with the retrieval augmented generation already you have all these things where whether it's embeddings vctor search how do you chunk data such that retrieval augmented generation can work well so that's an entire l layer or when contact lens become bigger that's a different sort of data layer like what's the throughput between data and your inference Fleet uh how do you sort of think about that so therefore we will innovate on the data layer and then of course on top of it is where um we will innovate on our uh co-pilots one of the first products we built was get up co-pilot in fact my entire confidence in this generation of AI started when I started seeing from GPD 3 to 35 and that implementation in GitHub uh and so we now have you know not only GitHub co-pilot we have co-pilot for M all knowledge work in Microsoft 365 we have co-pilots for these functions whether it's service or sales or Finance uh so we're going to innovate in our app layer uh on our own and so that's I think fundamentally how I look at it it's it's a full stack approach uh and each layer by the way we're we will innovate we will have Partners we will have others innovating there will be competition even it's not like you know one of the things of being a platform company is you got to be comfortable with many third parties competing with you on different layers because that to me is core otherwise you kind of try to you know do everything in a monolithic way and at least what we've learned over the years is the best thing to do is to keep each layer competitive on its own</p>
</details>

### AI与历史上的技术突破

主持人：您在开头提到，我们正处于这场范式转变的第二年。与您经历过的其他技术突破相比，您如何看待它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you said in the beginning that we are year two into this Paradigm Shift uh how do you see it compared to other technological breakthroughs that we that you've been through</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：尼古拉，我至少经历了四次：首先是PC客户端-服务器时代，包括PC端和服务器端发生的一切，那是我在92年加入微软时所处的开端。然后是万维网/互联网时代，接着是移动-云计算时代，而AI是第四次。我认为有趣的一点是，每一次都建立在前一次的基础上。所以，如果没有PC，我认为互联网就不会出现。毕竟，我第一次看到Mosaic浏览器是在Windows之上运行的。然后是网景（Netscape）出现，接着是IE等等。因此，我认为，你会看到每一次都催生了下一次，然后它超越了最初的催生者。这才是真正的关键。我们现在正看到这一点：我们所知的云计算、移动技术以及边缘计算的PC，真正催生了AI时代。问题是接下来会发生什么？它会超越这些吗？我认为会的。我的意思是，将会有不仅仅是关于认知工作的AI，它还将加速科学发展，我认为这是一个令人兴奋的领域。AI也将**具身化**（embodied: 指AI系统能够存在于物理世界中，并通过传感器和执行器与环境互动，例如机器人）在现实世界中，因此机器人领域可能发生的一切也是一个令人兴奋的领域。所以，随着时间的推移，将会有很多事情发生。但显然，是的，这是全新范式的第二年，它显然强化或建立在之前发生的事情之上，但也正在展现接下来会发生什么的早期迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so at least the four I've seen Nicolai is um obviously PC client server both what happened on the you know PC and the server side that was my first that's kind of when I joined 92 where at the beginning of that uh then there was the Web Internet uh and then there was mobile cloud and so AI is the fourth um I think one of the interesting things is each one of these built on the previous right so I don't think the web would have happened if there was not and you B his PC after all the first time I saw MOS uh you know was as a browser on top of Windows right so and then Netscape came about and then uh IE and what have you and so therefore I think um you sort of see each one of these births the next uh and then it goes beyond uh what births you right that's I think the the real thing right right now we're seeing that right which is the cloud um as we know of it and mobile uh and PCS on the edge have really birthed the AI age and the question is what happens next uh right which is does it go beyond that and that I think is going I mean there's going to be AI that is not just what about cognitive work AI that is also going to accelerate science so I think that that's a exciting space uh AI that is going to be embodied in the real world so what may happen in robotics is an exciting space and so there is a bunch of things that are going to happen over time uh but clearly yes this is year two of a complete new paradigm that obviously reinforces what happened pre or bills on what happened previously but also also is showing early signs of what happens next</p>
</details>

### 芯片短缺、规模法则与模型架构创新

主持人：如果现在没有芯片短缺，开发速度会更快吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if there had been no shortage of um uh chips now would the development have gone even faster</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：这是一个关于**规模法则**（scaling laws: 指在机器学习中，模型性能随计算资源、数据量和模型参数增加而呈现可预测的提升规律）的好问题。这有两个方面：训练侧和推理侧。在训练侧，计算能力、计算规模和规模法则已被证明非常成功。问题是这种情况会持续多久？是否会有另一个模型架构的突破？我认为这有待观察，目前尚不清楚。但我们绝不会与规模法则作对，也不会说这是最后一个模型架构的突破。事实上，一个很好的例子就是我们的小型语言模型创新，比如Phi。我们能够在小型语言模型中创造出显著的能力，而这显然不需要相同数量的计算资源。这就像“注意力就是一切”（Attention Is All You Need）和“教科书就是你所需要的一切”（Textbooks Are All You Need）一样，直观地说明了学习是如何发生的。因此，我想说，是的，如果世界上有更多的计算能力，我们很可能会取得进展。但与此同时，我不会排除模型架构上真正的突破，这种突破可能不需要相同类型的计算资源。这就是为什么我认为，至少我希望对此保持开放的心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a good question in the sense of scaling laws right so there are two sides to it right there's the the training side and the inference side on the training side clearly uh compute and compute scale and the scaling laws have proven to be very successful U and the question is how long does that go is there going to be another model architecture breakthrough or what have you um I I think that one has to see it's it's unclear uh but we definitely are not going to bet against scaling laws nor are we going to bet against uh or not are we going to say that this is the last Model architecture breakthrough in fact a great example of it is even uh what what we've we've seen even with uh our small language model Innovation like fi right which is we are able to create what is significant um capabilities uh in a small language model uh which uh doesn't require obviously the same amount of compute right which is uh like just like attention is everything attenti is all you need uh textbooks is all you need I mean that sort of intuitively speaks to uh how I think Co you know learning can happen and so therefore I would say uh yes if more more more capacity there is in the world the chances are that we will be able to make progress but at the same time I would discount a real breakthrough uh in model architecture that doesn't perhaps require uh the same type of compute so that's why I think um at least I want to keep myself open-minded about it</p>
</details>

### 小型语言模型与国家战略

主持人：谈到小型语言模型，您认为像挪威这样的小国应该开发自己的模型吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">talking of a small language models do you think a small country like Norway should develop its own model</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：我研究过一个来自达特茅斯（Dartmouth）的经济学家，名叫迭戈·科明（Diego Comin），他做了一项关于技术扩散的最佳**纵向研究**（longitudinal studies: 指在较长时间内对同一批对象进行跟踪观察和研究的方法）。他的基本结论，我在此转述一下，是任何想要领先的国家，首先应该确保他们不会**重复造轮子**（reinvent the wheel: 指重复做已经完成或有现成解决方案的事情），也就是说，他们应该引进现有的最佳通用技术，然后在此基础上增加**附加值**（value add: 指企业通过其活动为产品或服务增加的价值）。所以，我认为，例如对于挪威来说，我首先会做的是，如果出于某种原因，这些**基础模型**（foundation models: 指在大量数据上预训练的、具有广泛能力的通用AI模型，如GPT-3）在处理挪威语方面表现不佳，那么我们应该确保对其进行**微调**（fine-tuning: 指在预训练模型的基础上，使用特定任务的数据进行进一步训练，以适应特定应用）。在基础模型之上，比如OpenAI的模型或Mistral模型，有很多事情可以做。因此，你可以在现有技术之上增加独特的知识和独特的价值，而不是一开始就说我们要构建所有的计算资源，进行相同的预训练。当然，没有任何东西能阻止任何国家做这些事情，但问题是附加值在哪里。所以，我认为你应该从附加值开始，然后反推需要什么来实现它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know one of the things that I've studied there's an economist out of darthmouth his name is Diego colan and he did one of the best longitudinal studies uh of Technology diffusion uh and the fundamental conclusion um paraphrasing was that any country that wants to get ahead should one first make sure that they don't reinvent the wheel which is they import the best general purpose technology that is available in and then on top of it build value ad so I think for example U even on for no way first thing I would do is if we feel like for whatever reason these Foundation models are not good at Norwegian or what have you then let's make sure they're fine-tuning and and there there are many things one could do even top of foundation models like an open eye model or a Mistral or what have you so there are ways you can add unique knowledge unique value on top of even what exists uh before you go off and say let's build all the compute all of it and do the same pre-training run uh you know there's no nothing stopping any country from doing any of this uh but the question is what is the value ad and so therefore I think that you start from the value ad and then back into whatever is needed for it</p>
</details>

### 科技公司与地缘政治

主持人：当您看到大型科技公司在地缘政治中变得如此重要时，您有什么样的思考？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you look at how uh important the big technology companies have become in in geopolitics what kind of Reflections do you make</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：嗯，归根结底，有两点。首先，我非常清楚我们是一家跨国公司，在这种情况下，是一家总部位于美国的跨国公司，必须逐个国家地赢得运营许可和执照。因此，我认为我们不是拥有权力的民族国家。我们能够在任何国家运营，取决于我们为该国进步做出贡献的能力。所以，无论我在哪里，无论是在挪威、雅加达还是新德里，我总是立足于一个基本事实：我们能否直视当地政治家、政治领导层和整个社会，并说我们为他们的公共部门变得更高效做出了贡献，或者因为一些技术投入、教育成果、健康成果、小型企业及其生产力，使该地区的大型跨国公司在全球更具竞争力？归根结底，你与一个国家的**社会契约**（social contract: 指个人与社会或政府之间相互权利和义务的默示协议）来自于你为当地进步做出贡献的能力。所以，我认为我们永远不可能超越地缘政治；无论有没有我们，地缘政治都将存在，而我们的目标必须是如何参与并获得运营许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I mean at the end of the day um to two things right one is I'm very very grounded on the fact that we are a multinational company that is a definitely in this case a us-based multinational company that has to earn permission and license to operate one country at a time right so therefore I I think of the uh we're not nation states are the ones that have power we get to operate in any Nation based on our ability to contribute to that country's progress right so whenever I am right whether I'm in Norway or or I'm in Jakarta or or New Delhi or wherever I I am always grounded on uh fundamentally the fact is are we able to make you know look the local politicians and political leadership and Society at large in the eyes and say that we contributed to their public sector becoming more efficient or large multinational companies in the region becoming more globally competitive because of some tech input education outcome Health outcome small businesses and their productivity at the end of the day you have your your social contract with the country uh comes from your ability to contribute to their local progress and that so I don't think we we can ever be Beyond geopolitics will exist with or without us and our goal has to be how do you participate and have permission to operate</p>
</details>

### 量子计算与混合现实的机遇

主持人：接着，在您的著作《刷新》（Refresh）中，您提到了三个领域：人工智能、量子计算和混合现实。那么，您在量子计算中看到了哪些机遇？

萨提亚·纳德拉：这非常引人入胜。事实上，在这三个领域中，我仍然认为，例如，当我思考**混合现实**（mixed reality: 融合现实世界与虚拟世界，允许物理和数字对象共存并实时交互的技术）时，我将其视为一种具身化AI。无论是自动驾驶汽车、机器人，还是戴着眼镜的人，他们都在有效地将现实世界作为提示。因此，你对现实世界的理解，使得在AI时代，其中一些事物变得更加有趣和重要，我们需要拓宽视野，而不是狭隘地只考虑一种设备或一种**形态因子**（form factor: 指设备或产品在尺寸、形状和物理布局上的特征）。同样，量子计算也是一个引人入胜的领域。当我提到科学时，我看到的一点是，为了在科学上取得进展，你需要出色的**计算机模拟**（in-silico simulation: 指在计算机中进行的模拟实验，常用于生物学、化学等领域）。量子计算是最终的突破。当我们拥有一个完全新的系统架构，能够摆脱**冯·诺依曼限制**（Von Neumann limitation: 指传统计算机架构中，处理器和内存之间数据传输速率的瓶颈），你最终将能够模拟细胞或分子的动态。我认为，当你能做到这一点时，其他一切，甚至在生物学方面，都将变得更加可行。有趣的是，AI有点像那个模拟器的**模拟器**（emulator: 指一种软件或硬件，能够模拟另一个系统或设备的功能）。换句话说，你可以简化搜索空间。尼古拉，我们已经看到了这一点。我们最近做的一件事是，我们有一个材料科学模型，我们用它来生成一种新型化合物，然后我们将其制造出来。我们与当地的**太平洋西北国家实验室**（Pacific Northwest National Laboratory: 美国能源部下属的国家实验室，专注于科学研究和技术创新）合作，有效地将一种新型电池材料中的锂含量减少了70%，并成功生产出来。不仅仅是概念化，而是模拟并生产出来。所以对我来说，量子计算加上AI，我认为可以成为科学的终极加速器。我们正在取得进展，即使在量子计算方面，我们也正在采取全栈方法。我们拥有自己的软件栈，包括我们的**Q#**（Q Sharp: 微软开发的量子编程语言），这是我们的量子编程栈。因此，我们对量子计算的进展及其如何补充AI感到兴奋。

### 游戏与AI的融合

主持人：那么，游戏在这个大背景下处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and where does the gaming fit into this</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：对我来说，事实上，微软早在我们涉足Windows之前就已经进入游戏领域了。我认为《微软模拟飞行》（Flight Simulator）的发布甚至早于Windows。所以，我们非常非常兴奋。显然，现在动视（Activision）也成为微软的一部分，我们拥有移动游戏、云游戏、主机游戏和PC游戏。因此，我们是一家**全栈游戏发行商**（full stack game publisher: 指涵盖游戏开发、发行、运营等所有环节的公司），同时也是游戏系统提供商。我们的目标是，首先，我们热爱游戏才进入这个领域。我总是说，我们不应该把业务作为实现其他目的的手段，它本身必须是一个目的，否则就不是一门生意。所以对我来说，游戏是一个我们希望带来游戏乐趣的领域，这是我唯一喜欢的纯粹的消费娱乐类别。我喜欢这样一个事实：从长远来看，游戏很可能（如果不是已经）是最大的娱乐类别。这是其一。当然，它对其他领域也有实际影响。如果你想想，这很有趣，我没有和詹森·黄（Jensen Huang）谈过，但GPU最大的成功之一就是由游戏创新推动的。DirectX，也就是微软的图形堆栈，正是让GPU成为加速器的原因。毕竟，GPU最初就是为PC游戏而创造的。我认为游戏既是AI的一个应用，例如在游戏测试方面，我非常兴奋的首批领域之一就是现在的游戏非常复杂，我们希望利用AI在这些封闭世界中发现bug，在它们发布之前。因此，我们在这方面有一些非常棒的用例。但除此之外，我认为游戏作为我们模型中一些创新的数据来源，也将非常重要。

<p class="english-text">yeah so to me one of the things in fact Microsoft was in gaming long before we you know we were into windows in fact flight simulator I think was launched long before Windows was launched so uh we are very very excited obviously now with Activision as part of Microsoft we have Mobile gaming we have cloud gaming we have console gaming PC gaming so we are a full stack game publ publisher uh as well as a game systems provider um and so our goal there is one we're in gaming for our love of gaming right so I always sort of say we should never be in businesses as a means to someone other end it has to be an end otherwise it's not a business so to me gaming uh is something where we want to bring joy of gaming that's the one pure consumer entertainment category I love the fact that gaming on a secular basis is probably going to be if not already the biggest entertainment category out there so that's one and of course it has real implications on the rest of it right if you think about even remember it's interesting I'm not talk to Jensen about it but one of the greatest sort of success es of gpus was fostered by innovation in gaming right DX which was the Microsoft graphic stack is what made gpus uh an accelerator uh right after all the gpus were created for PC gaming you know gaming I think as both a an application of AI in terms of like game testing one of the first areas I'm very excited about is games are so complicated right now one of the things that we want to use I is to be able to find these bugs in these even closed worlds uh before they're out there and so therefore we have some very great use cases there uh but beyond that I think gaming as uh data in the context of some of the Innovation uh in our models I think is going to be important</p>

### 微软的文化转型：成长型思维

主持人：您确实改变了微软的文化。回顾过去，您认为您做出的最重要的改变是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you have really changed the culture at Microsoft when you look back what do you think are the most important changes you made</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：尼古拉，首先，正如我所说，我的职业生涯大部分时间都在微软度过。所以，当您说我在微软工作了32年时，无论好坏，我都是其中的一部分。所以我不会以某种方式认为我不是微软所有时代的代表，我代表了微软的所有时代。是的，这使得您所做的这些改变更加令人难以置信。是的，而我之所以能做到这一点，坦率地说，是作为一个彻头彻尾的内部人士，我基本上是进行**模式匹配**（pattern matched: 指识别和应用过去经验中的成功模式或失败模式）。我会想：我们什么时候表现最好？哪些文化特质帮助我们成功了？当我们失败时，又是什么样的文化特质导致了失败？然后，抑制后者，放大前者，就这么简单。所以，我回顾我在微软的职业生涯，当我们第一次成为市值最大的公司时，我忘了具体是哪一年，我想是在2000年代初，我们超越了某个里程碑。校园里的人，包括我，可能都觉得自己是上帝赐予人类的礼物，因为我们太出色了。然而，那天我们真正需要立足的现实是：哇，我们现在有真正的责任重新扎根，再次创新，以便我们在未来保持相关性。正因为如此，我很幸运读到了卡罗尔·德韦克（Carol Dweck）关于心态（mindset）的书，这是一本关于儿童心理学的书，名为《**成长型思维**》（Growth Mindset: 认为个人能力和智力可以通过努力和学习而发展和提高的信念）。我非常喜欢那本书。我更多地是在我们孩子教育的背景下阅读它的，但我必须说，我受到了启发，因为我感觉这正是让个体成功的关键。在学校里的孩子身上，这一点非常清楚：成为一个“求知者”（learn-it-all）比成为一个“自以为是者”（know-it-all）更好，因为即使“自以为是者”拥有出色的天赋能力，“求知者”即使起步落后，最终也会超越“自以为是者”。这对于学校里的孩子是如此，对于我这样的CEO也是如此，对于公司也是如此。所以我们采用了这种方法。

<p class="english-text">look I mean Nicola I sort of first of all I've as I said I've grown up all my professional career for most part is all Microsoft so uh you know when you say I've being at Microsoft for 30 two years all the good the bad uh I was part of it right so I don't sort of somehow think that uh I'm I don't repes I represent all errors of Microsoft yeah which makes it even more incredible that you have made these changes yeah and the way though I came about it is quite frankly as a consumate Insider I basically pattern matched as to hey what were the thing when were we at our best uh what was the cultural set of attributes that helped us succeed and then when we failed what were the cultural attributes that caused that failure and then you know dampen this latter and amplify the former that was as simple as that so one of the things I look back even in my you know career at Microsoft when we first became the largest market cap company I forget I think in the early 2000s I think we crossed G you know people on our campus prob were walking around including me thinking oh we must be God's gifts uh to humankind uh because we are so brilliant and what have you except what we needed to be grounded on that day was to say wow we now have a real responsibility to reground ourselves to innovate again uh so that we are relevant in the future right and so that's why I I I was lucky enough to have read Carol D's book on mindset which is around child psychology called growth mindset and I love that book I read it more on the context of sort of our children's education but I must say I got educated because I felt like this is uh what makes uh individuals children in school it's very clear right it's better to be a learn it all versus a know it all because even if the know it all has great innate capability uh the learn it all you know even if they start from behind they will surpass the know-it-all right that's sort of uh you know true for children in school it's true for CEOs in my seat uh it's true for companies and so we took that approach</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：尼古拉，我们说要成为一个“求知者”，而不是一个“自以为是者”。当你宣称已经实现了这种文化转型的那一天，就意味着你又成了“自以为是者”。所以，这是一种很好的方式来提醒自己，每天你都会犯很多错误，但你至少有勇气承认它们并继续前进。因此，这不是一个你能真正到达的终点。但你如何让组织接受这一点？如何让它渗透到组织内部的“**永久冻土层**”（Permafrost: 在组织语境中，指组织内部根深蒂固、难以改变的旧有观念、习惯或阻力）？这是一个很棒的观点。我认为，我看待公司问题的方式，特别是对于非创始人公司而言——创始人拥有巨大的权力和追随者，这就是为什么我认为他们如此成功，或者至少我们只谈论成功的创始人——但如果把这类人放在一边，对于像我这样的管理者来说，它不能仅仅是新CEO带来的新教条或更多的企业套话。它必须能吸引我们作为人类。这就是为什么我更看重卡罗尔（Carol Dweck）和她的团队所做的这项工作，因为它不是微软的教条，也绝不是萨提亚·纳德拉的教条。它能触动他们作为人类的内心，对吧？它对他们作为朋友、同事、伙伴、父母、邻居都有益。它将工作融入生活，他们可以把自己的个性和热情带入其中，并从中受益。我总是说，微软的这种成长型思维文化不是为了微软，而是为了你。只有当你觉得它能促进你在微软和生活中的发展时，你才应该去实践它。我认为这就是它成功的原因。如果它只是另一个自上而下的口号，它就不会流行起来。我一直相信，人们工作并从中找到意义，只有当他们能为自己找到某种真正更深层的意义时。我认为这就是我一直在努力唤起的。

</details>

### 同理心：创新与领导力的根源

主持人：很明显，他们也从**同理心**（empathy: 指理解并分享他人感受的能力）的概念中找到了真正更深层的意义，因为您谈了很多关于同理心的话题，并说它是创新和领导力的关键等等。那么，为什么它对您如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well they clearly also have found um true deeper meaning in in the concept of empathy because uh you talked a lot about that and you say that it's key to Innovation and Leadership and so on so what do you um why why is that why is it so important for you</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：我对此的看法是，我认为大多数人把同理心看作是一种软技能，在家庭或个人生活中很有趣，而工作则完全是关于硬核的东西，对吧？但我看待它时会再次思考，创新从何而来？创新来自于我们能够为客户未被满足、未被表达的需求提供解决方案。所以关键在于“未被满足”和“未被表达”。这意味着当你查看一些日志数据，或者一些客户访谈数据时，你必须有更好的感知能力。不仅仅是他们所说的话，你还必须能够设身处地为他们着想。好消息是，这是我们所有人与生俱来的能力，我们天生就拥有与他人产生同理心的能力。事实上，**设计思维**（design thinking: 一种以人为本的解决问题方法论，强调理解用户需求、迭代原型和测试）就是如此。所以当人们说要学习设计思维时，设计思维就是应用了的同理心。对我来说，这就是我深入探讨的重点，即我们不要把同理心看作是一种只为朋友和家人保留的软技能，我认为它是所有创新的根源。它关乎你能够满足那些未被满足、未被表达的需求，这来自于你独特的天赋能力，即拥有好奇心去了解他人、设身处地为他们着想，并代表他们进行创新。我认为这就是我们必须做的，这也是为什么我认为同理心对我们所有人来说都是一项非常重要的技能。

<p class="english-text">I think about this as um I think most people think of empathy as some kind of a soft skill that's interesting in the context of your family or personal life and works all about hardcore you know whatever right but that but I look at that and say again what is where is innovation come from right Innovation comes from us being able to drive the solutions to unmet unarticulated needs of customers out there right so the key being unmet and unarticulated so that means you have to have a better sense when you're even looking at some log data or you know some customer interview data or whatever you it's not just the words that they're saying but you got to be able to walk in their shoes uh and the good news there is this is innate in us all human beings we have uh the ability to empathize with the other person um in fact design thinking is that right so when people go and say let's do learn about design thinking design thinking is applied empathy uh and so to me uh that's what I pull the thread on which is let's not think of empathy as something that you know is just a soft skill that you reserve for your friends and family but it's I think it's at the root of all Innovation uh it's about being able to meet the unmet unarticulated needs that comes from your unique I mean your innate ability to have curiosity to learn about others walk in their shoes innovate on their behalf uh and that I think is I think what we have to do and that's why I I think empathy is an important important skill for all of us</p>

主持人：您是何时首次发现同理心的力量的？我读过您的书，非常棒的书，您在书中非常热情地谈论您的母亲，说她非常有同理心。

<details>

<p class="english-text">when did you first discover the power of empathy I mean I I read your book fantastic book you talk very warmly about your mother she being very empathetic</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：是的，我认为我们所有人都是通过生活经历学会开启这种同理心的。所以在某种意义上，你每天都会面临不同的情况，不仅仅是你个人，还有你身边的人。对我来说，显然，我儿子的出生对我和我的妻子来说都是一个改变人生的事件，多年来我至少学到了很多。我记得在早期，我儿子出生时患有**脑瘫**（cerebral palsy: 一种影响运动和肌肉协调的神经系统疾病），他几年前去世了。在他刚出生时，我更多地关注的是“我”发生了什么，我当时基本上是在想“为什么会发生在我们身上？为什么会发生在我身上？怎么会这样？”然后，在某种程度上，我看着我的妻子，她作为一名照护者、一位母亲，带着他往返于西雅图的各种治疗机构，我才意识到。坦率地说，这花了我数年时间，而不是几天、几个月或几周。然后我意识到，并不是我发生了什么，而是我的儿子发生了什么，我需要为我的儿子而存在。这就是我经常谈论的经历。但这样的经历每天都在发生，对吧？我的某个同事会带着需要照顾的父母来找我，我从中学习。或者至少这样说吧，我今天比我职业生涯初期更善于从他人的经历中学习。我认为我们所有人都会经历这样的事情，那就是生活的经历，如果它们能够积累，就会培养出对他人更深层次的同理心，这也能帮助你成为一个更好的管理者、更好的同事、更好的创新者。

<p class="english-text">yeah and you know I think that one of the things that I I feel like all of us learn how to turn on this bit of empathy through life's experience right so in some sense every day you get confronted with different circumstances not just yourself personally but people around you uh for me obviously the birth of my son uh for both my wife and me was uh was a life-changing event and was something that uh you know over the years I at least learned a lot because I I I remember in the early days it was all about sort of my son was born with cbal poliy he passed away a few years ago uh and um uh but you know in the when when he was born it was a lot about what happened to me I was sort of you know essentially quote unquote um you know in you know all about why did this happen to us why did it happen to me how and then I realized after watching in some sense my wife uh who was there as a caregiver as a parent uh you know taking him up and down Seattle to every therapy possible uh quite frankly you know it took me years not you know days or months or weeks um and um and then I realized that nothing had happened to me but something had happened to my son and I needed to be there for my son and that is the experience I talk a lot about but there's experiences like that every day right some colleague of mine comes with some you know parent of theirs who needs care right that sort of you know I learn from it I or at least let me put it this way I am more a tuned to learning from other people's experiences today than I was in the beginning of my career and I think that happens to all of us right which is life's experiences if they they ACW uh that ability to build a deeper empathy for other people and that also helps you be a better manager a better coworker a better uh innovator</p>

### 同理心与执行力：并非权衡

主持人：您认为同理心和执行力之间存在矛盾吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you um think there is a contradiction between empathy and execution</p>
</details>

萨提亚·纳德拉：我不认为。我认为，归根结底，你必须承担责任。所以在商业中，就像生活中一样，你必须对取得真正的进展负责。我思考企业为何存在，至少我喜欢科林·梅耶（Colin Mayer）的这个定义：你必须为人类和地球的挑战创造盈利的解决方案。因为这至少是分配现有全球资源的好方法。利润动机是一个好的动机，因为它意味着你正在以最有效的方式竞争和分配资源，并面临竞争。因此，你必须有出色的执行力，必须有出色的责任感。所以我认为同理心是创造出色的、盈利的、有竞争力的、在市场上取得成功的解决方案的必要条件，而不是某种权衡。

<p class="english-text">when you look at your your your skill set and your personality what do you think it is that makes you so effective as a leader</p>

萨提亚·纳德拉：首先，我并不认为我完全理解这里的因果关系，因为坦率地说，让别人来评价和归因要容易得多。但我至少看待这个问题的方式是，我不会从“我擅长什么”开始，我非常敏锐地被“我不擅长什么”所塑造。换句话说，我总是在寻找我可以从别人那里学到什么。所以，如果我有一个特质，那就是我不会每天都想着“哦，我懂这些，我擅长这些”，而是会想“哇，我哪里不足？我应该和谁交谈？我应该见谁？我如何真正塑造我周围那些在许多方面比我更有能力的同事？”我就是这样被塑造的，也许这有帮助，但我不知道这是否就是因果关系。但我不会每天都说“哇，我太擅长这个了，所以我去做这个”，不，我恰恰相反。

萨提亚·纳德拉：我不知道，我的意思是，这是一个很好的观点。比尔（Bill Gates）和史蒂夫（Steve Ballmer）都有这种特质。我认为微软有一种感觉，明年我们将迎来50周年，这很有趣。安迪·格鲁夫（Andy Grove）曾说过“只有偏执狂才能生存”（Only the Paranoid Survive），但我并不是带着偏执来做事的。我的意思是，我不喜欢偏执。我喜欢的是，这就是为什么我回到我自己的话来解释：这就是成长型思维，或者说，面对你自己的**固定型思维**（fixed mindset: 认为个人能力和智力是固定不变的，难以改变的信念），拥有信心，感叹我们生活在一个多么不可思议的世界，每个客户都能教我，每个合作伙伴都能教我，每个同事都能教我，我还能奢求什么呢？所以，这不是偏执，不是说“哦，哇，我们每天都必须努力，如果我不学习就会失败”。我更关注的是我能学到什么，以便我能够创新。也许这就是我处理问题的方式。比尔和史蒂夫以他们自己独特的方式也拥有这种心态，我就是在这种环境中成长起来的。

<p class="english-text">another thing that makes you stand out is you know there is a saying most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people that's clearly clearly not the case for you tell me about your love for poetry</p>

萨提亚·纳德拉：我热爱诗歌。你知道，以一种有趣的方式，我接触诗歌很晚。我的母亲是梵语戏剧教授，她确实向我灌输，或者至少试图向我灌输对诗歌的热爱，在她那里是梵语文学和诗歌等等。但我认为诗歌是一种**压缩**（compression: 指将信息以更紧凑的形式表示，以减少存储空间或传输时间）。它是最好的，就像你思考代码一样。当我写了更多代码时，我才感觉到“哇，诗歌基本上就是自然语言的压缩”。它能够以最简洁的形式描述世界，它是一种世界模型。我在三十多岁时开始大量接触乌尔都语诗歌。我在海得拉巴长大，那里显然乌尔都语诗歌盛行。现在我当然热爱它，但即使是美国诗人、英国浪漫主义者、德国诗人，他们也很棒。我的意思是，我至少不会说我懂很多诗歌，但我至少被人类思维压缩思想的能力所吸引，无论是代码还是诗歌。

<p class="english-text">I love poetry you know F you know the because in an interesting way I got into poetry very late uh my mom was a a professor of Sanskrit drama and um and um and so she really instilled in me or at least tried to instill in me the love for um you know poetry and in her case you know Sanskrit uh literature and poetry and what have you but I think of it as compression it's the best like when you think about code uh is as I coded more is when I sort of sort of felt like wow poetry is basically natural language compression um and it is able to describe you know it's it's a model of the world in the most uh succinct form and so there's um and I I got into uru poetry in a big way in my mid-30s and so I grew up in Hyderabad where obviously Udu poetry was in the air um and now of course I love it but even you know the American poets uh the English Romantics Germans they're F I mean like so I I'm at least I'm not I I wouldn't say I know much poetry uh but I at least I'm fascinated by the ability of the human mind to compress uh thought whether it's code or poetry</p>

<p class="english-text">well that's fantastic last question um SAA we have um tens of thousands of young people listening to this what is your best advice to young people</p>

萨提亚·纳德拉：我想说，对于任何刚开始工作的人来说，最好的建议，或者说我得到的一种建议，我将其概括为“永远不要等到下一份工作才做你最好的工作”。我的意思是，无论你得到什么工作，我都不记得在微软曾觉得“哦，我必须升职才能感到更满意或更充实”，因为我总觉得我中了彩票，我已经从事了我能得到的最好的工作。我并不是说你不应该有抱负，不应该争取下一次晋升，不应该为自己争取或让别人为你争取，你当然应该做所有这些。但与此同时，我的建议是，也要做好你手头的工作，并以你所有的活力和精力去出色地完成它，并且尽可能广泛地定义你的工作。我的意思是，这也许是我回顾过去时发现的一点，我从不狭隘地定义我的工作。我认为这在当时非常令人满意，也帮助我获得了下一份工作。所以，这也许是我会留给人们的一条建议。

<p class="english-text">I'd say the best you know advice for anyone starting out in I oh you know some sort of advice I got uh which I paraphrase as never wait for your next job to do your best work right which is one of the things is any job you get like I don't remember ever at Microsoft feeling like oh I have to get a promotion in order to feel more satisfied or more fulfilled because I Som felt I had gotten the lottery and I was in the best job I could ever be in and I'm not saying you shouldn't have ambition you shouldn't strive for your next promotion you shouldn't put advocate for yourself or have others you absolutely should do all that but at the same time really my advice would be also to take the job you have at hand and do an un wonderful you know go at it with uh all of you the wiger and all of the energy and also Define it as broadly as possible right I mean that is perhaps one of the things when I look back at it I never defined my job narrowly uh and that I think was both very satisfying in the moment and it helped I think land me the next job and so that that that is my perhaps the ad one advice I would leave people with</p>
