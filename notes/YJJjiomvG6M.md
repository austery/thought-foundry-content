summary: 本周市场开盘迎来积极信号，美国政府停摆危机基本结束，提振了投资者信心，推动股市全面上涨。英伟达因其Blackwell芯片需求激增而股价大涨，进一步巩固了AI领域的看涨情绪。然而，由于《平价医疗法案》补贴前景不明，医疗保健板块承压。此外，分析师还关注Grab的并购传闻、Bitmine对以太坊的大举投资，以及迈克尔·贝瑞对科技巨头财务折旧方式发出的新警告。同时，特朗普提出的“2000美元分红”计划也引发了关于其潜在通胀影响的激烈讨论。

### 政府停摆危机解除，市场全线飘绿

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月10日，星期一，我们又迎来新的一周来分析全球资本股票市场。感谢各位的到来，希望大家周末愉快。我们有很多内容要谈，盘前市场一片绿色，原因在于**政府停摆**（Government Shutdown: 指美国政府因国会未能通过预算案而导致部分机构关闭的状况）基本已经结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Monday, November 10th. We are back and we've got another week to analyze the global capital equity markets. Thank you everybody for being here. Hopefully everyone had a good weekend. We got a lot to talk about. We've got a green pre-market and the reason we are green is because the shutdown is basically over.</p>
</details>

从技术上讲，停摆还没有完全结束，因为它还需要众议院投票表决。但昨晚参议院已经以60票赞成通过了结束停摆的议案。我们需要60票，最终有52名共和党人和8名民主党人投了赞成票。因此，这项在参议院通过的程序性投票法案现在将送交众议院。众议院很可能会通过它，这样一来，政府停摆就不会再发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Technically it's not because it's got to get voted on by the House, but the Senate last night, if you were on the market future show, you saw that 60 votes were indeed granted in the affirmative to end the shutdown. We needed 60. You had 52 Republicans. You got eight Democrats to join them. And as a result, the government shutdown is now headed. At least the bill, the procedural vote that ended in the Senate last night now goes to the House. The House likely passes it. And if that's the case, we will not have a shutdown anymore.</p>
</details>

这很可能需要几天时间。我不知道今晚是否能完成，但众议院自9月19日以来一直处于休会状态，已经有一段时间了。昨晚，议长迈克·约翰逊召集了一次紧急会议，这意味着在接下来的48小时内，我们有望在解决停摆问题上取得一些进展。如果一切顺利，政府将重新开放。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most likely, it's going to take a couple days. I don't know if it happens tonight, but the House has been out of session since September 19th. So, it's been a while. And Mike Johnson just called for an emergency session open last night, which means over the next 48 hours, you likely will hopefully get some progress on the shutdown being resolved. And if that's the case, we get to get the government reopen.</p>
</details>

受此消息影响，股指期货市场反应热烈。标普500指数报677点，上涨1%。特斯拉上涨2%，英伟达上涨3.4%。英伟达股价曾一度跌至179美元，现在回升至194美元。Robinhood上周跌至120美元。上周五无疑是艰难的一天，但到了下午2点，随着市场意识到停摆很可能不会发生，情况几乎完全改变。上周五的大幅下跌似乎就是因为停摆所致，而局势的逆转也带动了整个市场的反转。虽然我们还没有回到历史高点，但考虑到上周五曾逼近659点，677点的水平已经相当不错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, the futures love it. S&P 500 677, we are up 1%. Tesla is up 2%. Nvidia is up 3.4. Nvidia fell all the way to 179. Now it's at 194. Robin Hood fell to 120 last week. Friday was definitely an ugly day. By 2 PM on Friday, everything pretty much changed as the market realized that the shutdown was likely not going to happen. It seems like the reason we had that much of a decline on Friday is because of the shutdown taking place. That reversal caused the entire market to reverse. We're not back to all-time highs yet, but 677, not too bad given we were pushing 659 on Friday.</p>
</details>

Grab上涨了6%，我们稍后会讨论相关新闻。谷歌上涨2%，SoFi上涨3.34%，从25美元回升至29美元。亚马逊回到248美元，Meta回到630美元，上周五Meta曾跌至61美元，简直疯狂。苹果股价为269美元，SMCI上涨4%。比特币和以太坊也终于开始有所起色。我们稍后也会谈到关于Bitmine的一些更新。以太坊价格为3600美元，比特币为106,000美元。Bitmine曾跌至35美元，现在上涨8%，报43.36美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Grab is up 6%. We got some headlines on Grab. We'll talk about in a second. Google right there up 2%. SoFi is up 3.34. SoFi was 25, now at 29. Amazon back to 248. Meta back to 630. Meta fell to $61 on Friday. Absolutely crazy. Meta right there back to 630. Apple right here 269. SMCI up 4%. Bitcoin and Ethereum finally beginning to cooperate a little bit. We do have some updates on Bitmine that we'll talk about in a second as well. Ethereum right there 3600. Bitcoin 106. Bit mine felt to 35. That's up 8% as you got Bitmine right there at 4336.</p>
</details>

过去48小时，关于停摆问题的进展相当不错。无论你从政治角度如何看待这次停摆，问题的解决至少足以让市场趋于稳定。我不想说市场正在恢复正常，但至少可以整合我们之前经历的动荡，并可能为下一轮上涨做好准备。显然，下一个最大的催化剂将是英伟达的财报。今天早上我们已经有一些财报发布，稍后会讨论，但几周后英伟达的财报将是重头戏，它将在某种程度上决定市场的走向。但随着停摆问题看似解决，我们应该有希望在此基础上继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's been a pretty good 48 hours in terms of getting updates on this shutdown. And you know, regardless of what you think about the shutdown from a political perspective, getting it resolved at least is enough to get the markets to be consolidating whatever choppiness we had and potentially getting ready for the next leg up. Obviously, the next biggest catalyst we have is Nvidia. We did have a bunch of earnings this morning that we'll talk about, but Nvidia is going to be the big one in a couple weeks. And you know that will kind of decide the trajectory of where this market goes. But we got the shutdown seemingly done and as a result we should hopefully be able to continue going further from there.</p>

### 财报季展望与关键经济指标

感谢各位的到来，让我们来看看所有的新闻头条。本周我们还有很多其他事情要讨论，财报方面并不算多。坦白说，本周最重要的事情有两件。首先，我想观察本周的价格走势，看看我们是否能延续10月份的涨势。大型科技公司的财报表现非常出色，其中许多股票都获得了一定程度的提振，但像Meta和微软这样的公司则没有。所以我很好奇，几周后市场会如何解读这些财报，是否有逢低买入者入场，那些追逐业绩和收益的基金经理在年底会采取什么行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So thank you everybody for being here. Let's get into all the headlines. We got a lot of other stuff to talk about this week. We don't have a ton of earnings. The most important thing this week quite frankly is two things. Number one, I want to see price action this week and see can we continue to make sense of the gains that we had in October. Again we had really good big tech earnings. A lot of those stocks were able to get somewhat of a lift. Some of those stocks didn't get a lift like a Meta and Microsoft. So, I'm curious to see kind of how the market interprets it a couple weeks later. If there's dip buyers that are coming in, if there's these fund managers that are chasing performance, chasing yield, what do they do towards the end of the year?</p>
</details>

在财报方面，今天有Rocklab、Core、Rigetti、ESTS、Big Bear AI和TerraWulf。所以收盘后我会进行直播，看看情况如何。早上有Instacart的财报。明天有Nebius，我知道这是一个重要的公司。Oklo也将在明天盘后公布财报。还有Sea Limited，这在东南亚是一家大公司。然后是Cisco、Disney、Circle、ESBET、New Bank、Redcat、AAT和JD。所以本周确实有一些重要的公司发布财报，虽然不像上周那样密集，但下周我们将迎来英伟达的财报，届时我们将看到大盘的走向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in terms of earnings, you got Rocklab, Cory, Regetti, ESTS, Big Bear AI, and Terraolf today. So, I'll be live after the close and we'll see what we got. We had Instacart in the morning. You have Nebas tomorrow. I know that's an important one. Oaklos tomorrow as well after the bell. You have se Limited, that's big in Southeast Asia. Then you got Cisco, Disney, Circle, ESBET, New Bank, Redcat, AAT, and JD. So, you do have some important companies that are reporting this week. It's nothing like it was last week, but the week after that is when we get Nvidia and you know, then we're going to see what happens to the broader market once we get Nvidia.</p>
</details>

VG今天早上也公布了财报，我们稍后会谈到。我认为他们的财报相当不错，股价昨天就已经有所预示。VG股价上涨了16%。看起来他们的财报确实不错。我知道这家公司在与BP的诉讼后股价腰斩，但看到一家真正盈利的公司受到追捧还是很高兴的。我记得他们本季度的净利润大约是4.7亿美元。现在股价为9.33美元，在盘前上涨了16%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">VG, we also had their earnings this morning. We'll talk about that. I think they had a pretty good earnings and stock was kind of foreshadowing that yesterday. VG right there. Wow. 16%. All right, looks like they added decent earnings. I know this one got cut in half after the BP lawsuit, but it's nice to see a company that actually makes money. I think they did about 470 million in net income this quarter getting a bit of a bid right there. $9.33. That's up 16% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

好了，让我们来看一些新闻头条，首先从停摆的消息开始。我们来了解一下具体发生了什么，以及接下来的步骤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into a bunch of different headlines and let's start off with this shutdown news. Let's get a little bit of an update right here on in terms of exactly what happened and what are the steps going forward and then we will keep going from there.</p>
</details>

参议院还将进行几次投票，众议院也至少还有一次投票。但目前来看，停摆问题可能在未来几天或一周内解决。他们达成的协议为政府部分部门提供资金，包括SNAP（补充营养援助计划）、农业和退伍军人项目，直至2026财年结束。对于政府其他部门，则将资金延续至1月30日。该协议还撤销了在停摆期间解雇联邦雇员的决定，并确保所有联邦雇员都能领到欠薪。民主党人也得到了承诺，将在12月的第二周就延长医疗保健税收抵免的法案进行投票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are going to be a few more votes in the Senate. We've got to have at least one more vote in the House but at this point the shutdown could be done within the next couple days and within the next week. Now, the agreement that they put together, it funds part of the government, including things like SNAP, agriculture, veterans programs for the rest of the 2026 fiscal year. The for the rest of the government and continues funding until January 30th. It also goes ahead and reverses those attempted firings of federal employees during the shutdown, make sure that all the federal employees are going to get their back pay. And Democrats have been promised a vote on extending those healthcare tax credits by the second week of December on a bill of their choosing.</p>
</details>

尽管这八位民主党人表示，目前的协议是他们能得到的最好结果，但党内其他人，包括参议院少数党领袖查克·舒默，对停摆在没有就医疗保健税收抵免达成具体协议的情况下结束感到非常愤怒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And while again these eight Democrats, they've said the deal on the table right now it's the best they were going to get, others within their party, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, were livid that the shutdown is going to end with no concrete deal on those healthcare tax credits.</p>
</details>

这次停摆最重要的启示是，他们谈判达成的协议只是在拖延问题。到1月30日，将再次就停摆问题进行投票，如果届时仍无法达成任何结论，我们将再次面临政府停摆。这是整个事件中令人烦恼的部分。然而，这确实能让联邦雇员重返工作岗位，撤销许多解雇决定，并通过资助农业部门来为SNAP福利提供资金。此外，根据民主党人在此次协议中为一月份谈判争取到的条件，12月将就医疗保健问题进行投票，重新商议**ACA补贴**（Affordable Care Act subsidies: 即《平价医疗法案》补贴，旨在帮助中低收入人群支付医疗保险费用）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this is the most important takeaway from the shutdown. The shutdown is essentially or the deal that they've negotiated is just kicking the can down the road. So January 30th there will be another vote on the shutdown and if we can't get to any conclusion by January 30th then we will shut down again. So that is the kind of annoying part of everything that is going on. However, it will get furled employees to get back. It will allow it will be a reversal of a lot of the layoffs. It will fund SNAP benefits by funding the agricultural sector of the economy. Uh, and it will also make sure that a healthcare vote happens in December with a renegotiation as per what the Democrats have negotiated in this bill for October or for January for those ACA subsidies.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么Oscar Health股价目前下跌的原因。很多人想知道Oscar发生了什么，其实不仅是Oscar，许多医疗保健股都依赖于ACA补贴的延长。目前，补贴是否延长尚未确认。Oscar股价下跌了约8.5%，所有医疗保健股都受到了一定冲击。UNH两周前股价为390美元，现在跌至317美元。所以，你必须准备好承受一只大幅下跌股票的波动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the reason why Oscar is down right now for a lot of people wondering what's going on with Oscar. Well, Oscar was primarily contingent and not just Oscar, but a lot of these healthcare names on those ACA subsidies being extended. Right now, it is not confirmed that they are extended. Oscar right here down about 8.5%. All the healthcare names taking a bit of a hit. UNH right there. UNH was 390 two weeks ago. UNH is down to 317. So I mean you gotta be ready to embrace the volatility of a a name that has sold off aggressively.</p>
</details>

### 悬而未决的医保补贴与13F报告前瞻

我忘了提，本周除了财报之外，我们最关注的是**13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会规定，管理资产超过1亿美元的机构投资者需在每季度结束后45天内提交的持仓报告）和13G报告。我们已经看到了迈克尔·贝瑞的报告，他披露了对Palantir和英伟达的看跌头寸。但在未来几天，我们将看到伯克希尔·哈撒韦、大卫·泰珀、霍华德·马克斯等许多人的持仓报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing I forgot to mention that we're looking for this week outside of the earnings is 13Fs. 13Fs and 13G. So we obviously had Michael Burry's come out already and that's where he disclosed his Palantir and Nvidia bearish position. Um but we're going to get Berkshire Hathaway, um David Tepper, Howard Marx, a lot of these people over the next coming days.</p>
</details>

实际上，我们应该从今晚或周三开始陆续看到13F报告，截止日期是周五。我们将看到这些超级投资者在投资方面采取了哪些行动。我很好奇伯克希尔是否继续逢低买入UNH，霍华德·马克斯是否继续增持Grab。这些都是本周值得关注的重要问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, realistically, we should start getting 13Fs either tonight or by Wednesday. Uh, the deadline is Friday to see all of them. And we're going to see what some of these super investors did in terms of making moves. I wonder if Berkshire continue to buy the UNH dip. I wonder if Howard Marks continued to buy Grab. So, those are a lot of questions that I think are going to be really important to take a look at this week.</p>
</details>

根据上次的13F文件，第二季度被买入最多的三只股票是UNH、谷歌和亚马逊。所以我很好奇，人们是否已经获利了结？谷歌的平均买入价大约是172美元，现在是290美元。亚马逊当时约219美元，现在是240美元。UNH曾涨到230美元，现在是310美元。所以，我很想看看这一切将如何发展。但今天医疗保健股下跌的原因是ACA补贴没有得到确认，我们必须等到一月份才能知道后续进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, remember the top three stocks that were bought in Q2 as per the last filings of 13Fs were UNH, Google, and Amazon. So, I wonder, you know, did people take profits? I mean, Google, you know, I think the average price people bought at was 172, now it's at 290. Um, Amazon was at around 219. Now it's at 240. UNH got to 230, now it's at 310. So, going to be curious to see how that all plays out. But the reason the healthcare stocks are down today is because there is no confirmation on these ACA subsidies and you're going to have to just keep waiting until January to kind of figure out where exactly goes from there.</p>
</details>

### Grab 与 Bitmine：并购传闻与加密货币动态

好了，让我们快速转换到Grab。为什么Grab在盘前上涨呢？有两个原因。第一，Grab与GoTo的合并传闻越来越受关注。对于一直关注Grab的人来说，GoTo是他们在东南亚，尤其是在印尼最大的竞争对手之一。这次不仅仅是彭博社像五个月前那样制造谣言，尽管当时他们也有一些可靠的消息来源。这次是印尼总统办公室的一位代表表示：“我们正在积极寻求让这两家公司合并的方式，不是GoTo的金融科技部分，而是网约车部分。”他们还谈到，确保在GoTo平台（其母公司下的平台是Gojek）上工作的司机、商户等拥有稳定的就业是多么重要。问题在于Gojek的财务状况不佳，而Grab的财务状况非常好。因此，政府对合并更感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's transition real quick into Grab. So, why is Grab up right here in the pre-market? Two reasons. Number one, the Grab GoTo merger is getting a lot more excitement. For those that have been keeping up with the Grab story, Goto is one of their largest competitors in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Uh the Indonesian government, you know, this is not just Bloomberg creating a rumor like they did five months ago, although they had some pretty good sources for those rumors. This is a representative from the Indonesian president's office saying, "We are actively looking for a way for these two companies to merge. Not the fintech part of GoTo, but the ride hailing part." And they're talking about how important it is to make sure that there's stable employment for drivers, merchants, etc. that work on the goto platform which is or the go-to parent company, which is their their platform beneath that is Gojek. The problem is GoJek is not having the best financials and Grab is having really good financials. Also a merger is why the government is a bit more excited.</p>
</details>

另一个原因是Grab开始利用其70亿美元的现金储备。他们今天投资了Vay Technology。首席执行官Anthony Tan表示：“我们相信东南亚出行的未来将是一种混合模式，既依赖我们司机伙伴的专业知识，也结合了自动驾驶汽车和远程驾驶服务。”这项初步投资将有助于加速Vay的远程驾驶技术开发，并为Grab的长期出行战略创造宝贵的技术和运营协同效应。它还将支持Vay在美国的扩张，服务于那些不愿拥有汽车、寻求更灵活、更实惠出行选择的日益增长的消费群体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's one reason the stock is up. Another reason is Grab is starting to utilize their 7 billion in cash. They made an investment today in Vay technology. CEO Anthony Tan. We believe the future of mobility in Southeast Asia will be a hybrid model that relies on the expertise of our driver partners alongside autonomous vehicles and remote driving services. The initial investment will help accelerate VA's remote driving technology development and create valuable technical and operational synergies for Grab's long-term mobility strategy. It will also support Vay expansion in the US where they serve a growing segment of consumers who prefer to not be car owners and are looking for more flexible affordable and mobility options.</p>
</details>

这是Grab在自动驾驶领域的第三笔投资。他们投资了6000万美元，并有可能在明年再投资3.5亿美元，总额将达到4亿美元，这将是一笔相当可观的投资。我想你可以说Grab对自动驾驶汽车的未来以及自动驾驶与当前出行模式之间的混合模式感到非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the third investment we ride may mobility and then they technology that grab is doing in the autonomous space. They invested 60 million with the potential to invest another 350 million over the next year which would be 400 million. it would be a pretty sizable investment. And I guess you could basically say that Grab is getting very excited about the future of AV and this kind of hybrid model between autonomous vehicles and the current state of mobility.</p>
</details>

我不知道这是否足以真正推动股价上涨。我很高兴它上涨了6%，但话又说回来，Grab上周大部分时间股价都在6美元。我认为需要更多具体的证据才能让这只股票真正有所作为。看到盘前的一些动静是好事，但总的来说，我认为市场希望看到这次现金注入这些公司的确切目标，以及它最终如何为业务增值。所以，这是好事，我认为不坏。但最终，我们需要看到更多实质性的东西，市场才会感到兴奋。但这就是为什么该股在盘前上涨6%的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if that's enough to really make the stock move. I mean, I'm happy it's up 6%, but then again, Grab was at $6, you know, last week. It was at $6 for the majority of September. So, I think you're going to need some more concrete evidence to get this one to really make a move. It's nice to see a little bit of, you know, pre-market movement right there. But overall, I think the market's going to want to see exactly what the goal of this cash injection is into these companies and then, you know, how it ultimately is accreted to the business. So, good stuff. I don't think it's bad. Ultimately, we've got to see a little bit more meat on the bones for the market to get excited. But that is why the stock is up 6% in the pre-market.</p>
</details>

接下来是Bitmine。Tom Lee买了多少？他买入了相当可观的数量，过去一周购买了11万个以太坊。他们现在拥有整个以太坊供应量的近3%。那么他们为什么购买这么多以太坊呢？Tom Lee在这份新闻稿中表示，这次下跌非常有吸引力。他说：“最近ETH价格的下跌提供了一个有吸引力的机会，Bitmine本周增加了ETH的购买量。对我来说，很明显华尔街对将资产代币化到区块链上非常感兴趣，这为发行人和投资者创造了更大的透明度并释放了新价值。这是关键的基本面故事，并支持我们认为以太坊在未来十年是一个超级周期故事的观点。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bit mine. All right. How much did Tom Lee buy? Well, he bought a decent chunk. 110,000 Ethereum over the past week. They now own 2.9% almost 3% of the entire Ethereum supply. So why did they buy this much Ethereum? Well, Tom Lee said on this press release that the dip was pretty attractive. So Tom Lee, the recent dip in ETH prices presented an attractive opportunity and Bitmine increased its ETH purchases this week. To me, it is evident that Wall Street is very interested in tokenizing assets onto the blockchain, creating greater transparency and unlocking new value for issuers and investors. This is the key fundamental story and supports our view that Ethereum is a super cycle story over the next decade.</p>
</details>

这基本上就是我们长期以来讨论的关于以太坊的论点。这将是一段充满波动的旅程，你必须能够驾驭这种波动。但尽管如此，看到他们购买了大量以太坊还是很高兴的。他们还将现金持有量从3.89亿美元增加到3.98亿美元。所以，如果股价跌破1倍的MNAV（每股资产净值），我认为上周我们曾短暂处于这个水平，而现在有了更新的ETH数据，我们可能会略高于1倍MNAV。但这足以让他回购股票，也足以让公司继续发行股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that's kind of the thesis that again we've been talking about for Ethereum for a long time. It is going to be a volatile ride and so that volatility, you know, you're going to have to be able to navigate as the ride continues. But nonetheless, it is nice to see that they bought a decent chunk of ETH. They also increased their cash holdings from 389 million to 398. So if we do fall below a 1 MNAV, which I think we were at for a little bit last week and I think now with the updated ETH numbers, we might be a bit above 1 MNAV. But it's enough for him to buy back stock and it's also enough for the company to continue issuing shares.</p>
</details>

我知道以太坊和BMR就像坐过山车。如果你想下车，你随时可以下车。但就是这样，上涨时幅度巨大，下跌时也同样巨大，你只需要问自己，你想把它配置为投资组合的多少百分比来应对这种波动性。对于那些投资BMNU（该产品的2倍杠杆版本）的人来说，它在盘前上涨了17%，但上周却下跌了40%。所以，这关乎你如何应对这种波动性。但这就是我们在盘前看到的BMR和Grab的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I know ETH and BMR is just a roller coaster ride. And if you want to get off that ride, then, you know, it's you're able to get off that ride. But, it's just one of those things where the upswings are massive, the down swings are also massive, and you just have to ask yourself, how much do you want to size it as a percentage of the portfolio to deal with that type of volatility? And yeah, for those that get into BMNU, which is the 2x leverage version of this, there you go. That's up 17% in the pre-markets, but it was down freaking 40% last week, right? So, it's one of those things about how do you embrace that volatility? But that is what we have for BMR and Grab right here in the pre-market.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达需求激增，估值逻辑重塑

好了，英伟达。让我们谈谈昨晚英伟达发生的事情，这同样非常利好，令人兴奋。英伟达向台积电（TSMC）提出了为其Blackwell芯片增加晶圆供应的请求，这只有在需求增加的情况下才会发生。而且看起来他们的需求确实在大幅增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so Nvidia, let's talk about what happened with Nvidia last night, which also was pretty damn bullish and I think was exciting to see. Now, Nvidia made a request to TSMC for more wafers for their Blackwell chip, which you would only be doing if you had more demand. And it does seem like they are getting a lot more demand.</p>
</details>

英伟达向其最大供应商之一台积电增订了50%的晶圆，以应对Blackwell芯片的需求。他们要求台积电将月产能从11万片提升至16万片。这意味着每月额外增加3.5万片与Blackwell芯片相关的晶圆。这一切都是在没有中国市场的情况下发生的，因为特朗普上周表示他们将无法向中国销售。黄仁勋表示，需求逐月增强，所有三家**HBM**（High Bandwidth Memory: 高带宽内存，一种用于高性能计算的内存技术）供应商，如美光、SK海力士等，都已经扩大产能以支持这一增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, Nvidia orders 50% more wafers from TSMC, which is one of their largest suppliers, amid Blackwell demand. They've asked them to push capacity from 110,000 a month to 160,000. That's an extra 35,000 monthly wafers tied to Blackwell chips. This is all without China because Trump said they're not going to be able to sell into China at least as of last week. And Jensen Huang said demand is strengthening month by month and that all three HBM suppliers like Micron, SK Hynix, etc. have already scaled capacity to support the ramp.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么美光股价持续创下历史新高的原因。美光股价达到247美元，又上涨了4%。向那些做多美光的人致敬。有很多半导体股表现不错，但这只股票在65美元的价位上停滞了整整一年，没什么动静。我想，只要你了解HBM的基本知识，你就会明白内存的需求将会非常充足。我记得他们曾宣布2025年全年的产能都已被预订满，而第二天股价却下跌了5%。所以你只需要对这只股票保持耐心。随着投资逻辑的展开，你获得了超过一倍的回报。美光股价现在是247美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's why Micron is continuing to hit all-time highs. Micron right there 247. Wow. Up another 4%. I mean shout out to those who are long Micron. This was I mean there's a lot of semi-names that have done well. This one was stuck for a good year at 65. It really wasn't making that much of a move. I think everyone if you understood the basics of HBM you understood like okay there's going to be plenty of demand for memory. So I remember they came out they said we are booked to capacity for all of 2024. No all of 2025 because they said this at the end of 2024 and the stock was down 5% the next day. So you kind of just have to be patient on this one. And as it played out in terms of a thesis, you know, you got more than a double on your hand. Micron right there at 247.</p>
</details>

这对英伟达意味着什么？我认为，这意味着即使没有中国的收入，黄仁勋也看到了Blackwell芯片需求的增长。这一点非常重要，因为你需要越来越多的超大规模数据中心投资于其资本支出，而所有这些公司都告诉我们，他们将在2026年前投资高达1000亿美元。其中大部分公司将在今年年底前接近1000亿美元的投资额，谷歌为930亿，Meta为720亿。所以，看起来英伟达的需求故事不会消失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does this mean for Nvidia? Well, I think it means even without China revenues, Jensen is seeing an increased level of demand for Blackwell. That is very important as you need more and more hyperscalers that need to be investing in their capex and all of them told us they were going to be investing upwards of 100 billion each going into 2026. Most of them getting closer to 100 billion by the end of the year. Uh Google at 93 and Meta at 72. So, I mean, it seems like the demand story for Nvidia is not going anywhere.</p>
</details>

这里有一张关于英伟达的图表，我认为非常重要。它展示了一个牛市应该具备的特征。早在2023年7月，当英伟达股价为46美元，并开始实现惊人盈利时，其市盈率为158倍。现在，股价为188美元，市盈率却降至50倍。如果再往前看几年，市盈率更是只有28倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's a chart on Nvidia that I think is really important and then we'll get into some of the earnings that we have this morning. Um, take a look at this. I saw this this morning and once again, it just goes to show you what a bull market should consist of. So, back when Nvidia was trading $46 a share in July of 2023 when it really started having the types of earnings that it was having, it was trading at 158 times. So it was trading at 158 times earnings at $46. Now at $188, Nvidia trades at 50 times. And if you go a couple years out forward, it's trading at 28 times.</p>
</details>

看到股价大幅上涨的同时，市盈率却在压缩，这确实令人难以置信。这意味着盈利增长速度超过了估值倍数的扩张。你看到的是一家非常健康的5万亿美元公司。是的，它市值5万亿美元，人们听到这个数字，看到它比两个加拿大的经济总量还大，就会感到恐慌。但如果盈利能够持续以目前的速度增长，我认为这就是为什么持有英伟达头寸变得容易的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it really is quite incredible. It is quite incredible to see the level of stock price appreciation with the level of earnings compression in terms of the multiple, meaning the growth is outpacing the expansion of the multiple. And you're seeing a really healthy, I think, $5 trillion company, which yes, it's worth five trillion. and people hear that and see it's worth more than two Canadas and people freak out. But if the earnings are growing and they can continue to grow at the level they're growing at, I think that's why it becomes easy to hold on to an Nvidia position.</p>
</details>

因此，如果Blackwell的需求只会越来越好，而台积电继续表示英伟达需要越来越多的芯片，那么这很可能意味着即使没有中国市场，英伟达的需求依然强劲，AI的投资主题也可能不会消失。因此，英伟达在盘前上涨是合情合理的。上周五，英伟达股价曾跌至178美元，现在回升至194.52美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if this Blackwell demand is only getting better and TSM is continuing to say that Nvidia wants more and more chips from us, then it likely means that even without China, demand for Nvidia strong and the AI thesis is likely not going anywhere. So makes sense for Nvidia being green right here in the pre-market. Again, Nvidia got to 178 on Friday. Nvidia right now at 194.52.</p>

### 财报前瞻：AI 基础设施公司的机遇与挑战

谈到英伟达，让我们来看看一些与英伟达相关的财报。首先是CoreWeave，目前在盘前上涨。CoreWeave今天将公布财报。CoreWeave股价上涨了4.75%。黄仁勋对CoreWeave有投资，这家公司的良好表现对英伟达也非常重要。更不用说，明天我们还有Nebius的财报，这也将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of Nvidia, let's get into some earnings that are tied to Nvidia. First of all, you had Coreweave, which is up right now in the pre-markets. Coreweave did have earnings today. Core right there up 4.75%. Uh Jensen Huang has an investment in Coreweave, and you know, this company doing well is going to be very important also for Nvidia. Not to mention, we got Nebius tomorrow, which is going to be very important.</p>
</details>

市场预期CoreWeave每股亏损51美分，营收12.8亿美元。我认为这将是营收和利润的双重超预期。我需要更深入地了解CoreWeave的内部细微差别。我知道他们的债务股本比很高。是的，我们今天还有Rocklab的财报，显然它会有更多的动力，但无论如何，这就是CoreWeave的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">51 cents a share of a loss and 1.28 billion in revenue is what you had from coreweave. I think that is a beat on the top and the bottom. Let me just confirm right there. But the internal nuances of core I have to go a bit deeper to understand. I know that their debt to equity ratio is aggressive and um yes, we do have Rocklab today and obviously there's going to be a lot more momentum for it, but nonetheless, that's what you have right there for Core.</p>
</details>

哦等等，CoreWeave是盘后公布财报吗？是的，是盘后。好吧，我搞错了数据。那些是市场预期。抱歉。所以市场预期是亏损51美分，营收12.8亿美元。好吧，所以今天收盘后我们就会知道结果。我还在想为什么CoreWeave上涨了5%，我以为是因为财报，但看来只是因为大盘走高。所以我们将在收盘后得到CoreWeave的财报，明天还有Nebius。Nebius股价上涨了3.8%。上周五Nebius一度跌至102美元，CoreWeave跌至101美元。随着市场全面上涨，这两只股票都在反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, wait. Is Core aftermarket? Oh, it is aftermarket. Okay, I got the wrong stats in. All right, so Oh, those are Sorry. Sorry. Those are what the market's expecting. Sorry about that. So 51 cents is what the market's expecting with 1.28 billion in revenue. Okay, so today after the bell, we're going to see what happens. I was wondering why Corwe was up 5%. I thought it was because of the earnings, but I guess that's just based on the broader market going higher. So we'll get Coreweave after the bell and then we'll get Nebius as well tomorrow. Nebius right here up 3.8% again. Nebius got all the way down to 102 on Friday. Coreweave got down to 101. Both of those getting a rebound as we're seeing a bit of green right here across the board.</p>
</details>

是的，CoreWeave将在收盘后公布财报。Wolf也将于收盘后公布。今天收盘后将是重要的一天。Wolf有来自谷歌的股份。然后是Rocket Lab和AS。还有Space、Big Bear AI，以及许多以GPU为导向的数据中心公司将发布财报。Big Bear AI在盘前也上涨了4.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So Coreweave after the bell. Wolf will be after the bell as well. It's going to be a big day after the bell. Wolf again has that stake from Google. Then you got Rocket Lab and AS. You got space, you have Big Bear AI, and then you have a obviously a lot of the GPU oriented data center plays that will be reporting. Big Bear right there up four and a half% as well in the pre-markets.</p>

### 特朗普的“2000美元分红”引发通胀担忧

我们可能会在2026年看到一笔2000美元的分红。这是特朗普昨天发的推文。根据我们稍后将听到的澄清评论，我认为这不会是真正的2000美元刺激支票。但你可以看出特朗普昨天很生气，他开始就很多不同的事情发推文。他说：“我们正在收入数万亿美元，并很快开始偿还我们巨额的债务。37万亿美元创纪录的投资进入美国，工厂遍地开花。将向每个人支付至少2000美元的分红（不包括高收入人群）。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, another thing that we could see going into 2026 is a $2,000 dividend. This is what Trump tweeted yesterday. I don't think it's legitimately going to be a $2,000 stimmy check based on the clarification comments by Vance that we're going to listen to in a second. But you could tell Trump was mad yesterday. He started tweeting about a lot of different things. He said, "We are taking in trillions of dollars and soon begin paying down our enormous debt. 37 trillion record investment in the USA plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least 2,000 a person. not including highincome people will be paid to everyone."</p>
</details>

这听起来显然像一张刺激支票，但他们实际上不会这么做，那将意味着增发约4000亿美元。我非常怀疑他们会这样做，尤其是如果关税的全部目标是偿还债务。如果他们通过发行4000亿美元来增加债务，那似乎没什么意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which obviously sounds like a stimmy check but that's you know not really what they're going to do and that would be printing about $400 billion I really doubt they're going to do that especially if the whole goal of the tariffs is to pay down the debt like if they increase the debt by issuing $400 billion wouldn't seem to make a lot of sense.</p>
</details>

这似乎让2000美元的分红已经包含在内了，而特朗普正试图为公众舆论制造一个论点。这里有两点分析。第一，根据我读到的信息，而且我读到的可能完全错误，但看起来最高法院的裁决可能对特朗普不利。一个月前，当我最初听说这个案子时，我以为他不可能输。但随着你深入了解其中的逻辑，看起来即使是一些保守派法官也不会投票支持特朗普实施关税的方式是合法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which makes it seem like the 2000 dividend is already kind of baked in and Trump is trying to, you know, kind of make an argument for for the public perception there. There's two pieces of analysis here. Number one is that based on the stuff that I'm reading and what I could be reading could be incredibly wrong, but it seems like the Supreme Court decision might not go in Trump's favor. And, you know, a month ago when I originally heard about the case, I thought there was no way he was going to lose. And you know, as you get deeper into the logistics of it, it does look like even some of the conservative justices are not going to vote to say that tariffs are uh legal in the way that Trump has conducted him.</p>
</details>

所以我认为特朗普正试图让公众站在他这边。他昨天发了多条推文，解释为什么关税对国家安全最重要，以及过去几周他一直在重复的那些论点，因为他知道如果裁决被推翻，美国公众开始反对关税——要知道在四月份，因为市场崩盘，每个人都很沮丧，但一旦市场恢复，人们就有点忘了——如果这个话题再次回到公众视野，特朗普希望它是以积极的方式出现。所以有一种说法是，最高法院可能不会支持他，而特朗普正试图转移讨论的焦点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think Trump is trying to get the public to be on his side. had multiple tweets yesterday about why tariffs are the most important thing for national security and kind of the same talking points he's been having over the past couple of weeks now because he knows that if it gets reversed and the American public starts to turn on the idea of tariffs which largely you know back in April everyone was upset because the market crashed but once the market recovered people kind of forgot I mean we we stopped talking about tariffs if that conversation comes back into the fold Trump wants it to be on the positive side so there's an argument that the Supreme Court doesn't potentially uh go in his favor and Trump is trying to, you know, pivot the discussion.</p>
</details>

另一个论点是，这对通货膨胀会有什么影响？我认为这个论点有两个层面。有人可能会说，如果我们增发4000亿美元，显然是每人2000美元，2亿人。你可能会对单身人士的收入设置75000美元的上限，已婚夫妇则是15万美元。这是在新冠疫情期间的做法。如果你作为单身人士收入超过75000美元，你就得不到刺激支票。4000亿美元将是通货膨胀性的，对吧？我不认为鲍威尔或即将上任的新美联储主席会对4000亿美元的刺激措施感到高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other argument here is what would that do for inflation? And I think there's kind of two layers to this argument. One could argue that if we printed $400 billion, obviously two, you know, 2,000 per person, 200 million people. You would probably have a cap of 75,000 for um income that qualifies if you're single, 150,000 if you are a married couple. This was back in COVID. If you make more than 75,000 as a single person, you would not get the stimulus. Um 400 billion would be inflationary, right? like I don't think JPOW or even the new incoming Fed person would be happy about $400 billion of stimulus.</p>
</details>

然而，也有人可能会说，如果你从埃隆·马斯克的角度看，人工智能是极具通缩性的，而且不仅仅是人工智能作为通缩的宏观顺风。你还有所有这些正在发生的裁员，这将是通缩性的，因为如果人们被解雇并且没有工作，他们就不会花那么多钱，所以你必须向系统中注入一些资金来保持增长。信不信由你，我认为第二层，即裁员和人工智能具有通缩性的观点，意味着如果你向经济中注入4000亿美元，我们不会有那么多的通货膨胀。这有点可信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, one could also say that if you go the Elon perspective of AI is incredibly deflationary and forget just AI is a macro tailwind for deflation. you have all these layoffs that are taking place and that's going to be deflationary because if people get laid off and they don't have a job, they're not going to be spending as much money that you kind of have to inject some money into the system to keep the growth going up as high as it is. And believe it or not, I think that the the the second layer of that, the idea of layoffs and AI being deflationary means that if you put 400 billion into the economy, we wouldn't have that much inflation. It is kind of believable.</p>
</details>

当然，我的直觉告诉我，我们将会有更多的通货膨胀，而且来自人工智能或裁员的通缩不足以抵消你投入的4000亿美元，但你可以为这样一个事实提出一个伪经济学的论点，即也许那4000亿美元，如果我们真的印了，不会那么具有通货膨胀性。我实际上不认为他会印4000亿美元。只是推文的措辞听起来确实像是“每人至少2000美元的分红，不包括高收入人群”。这听起来几乎和新冠疫情期间的措辞一模一样，即如果你收入达到一定数额，你就没有资格获得这些支票，但如果你没有，如果你低于75000美元或无论多少，你就能得到这些支票。这显然可以成为一些人认为他们会得到支票的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, my gut tells me we're going to have a lot more inflation and there's not going to be enough deflation from AI or layoffs to be able to offset the 400 billion that you would put in, but there is like a pseudoeconomic argument you can make for the fact that maybe that 400 billion would be, if we did print it, not as inflationary. I don't actually think he's going to print $400 billion. It's just the way that the tweet sounded does make it seem like a dividend of at least 2,000 a person, not including highincome people. That almost makes it sound exactly what the wording was during COVID about, hey, if you make a certain amount of money, you know, you're not going to be able to qualify for these checks, but if you don't, if you're under 75,000 or whatever, then you get these checks. That could obviously be the argument for why uh some people are thinking that they're going to get a check.</p>
</details>

所以，如果非要我回答，他们会发2000美元的支票吗？不。如果他们真的发了，那就准备好买入一些股票吧，因为我们将进入极度风险偏好的模式。我们看到了2020年他们印发刺激支票后发生了什么。我们知道Robinhood会获得大量新账户，我们知道加密货币会受到追捧。我们知道如果那样做，基本上会制造一个泡沫。而这一次，也许我们中的许多人可以更好地把握时机。但我认为他们实际上不会给每个人发2000美元，尤其是当特朗普一直在说我们需要偿还债务的时候。我认为这也是最重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, my like if if you had to, you know, gun to my head or are they going to print $2,000 checks? No. If they do, get ready to buy some equities because we are going so risk on. We saw what happened in 2020 after they printed the stimmy checks. We know that Robinhood is going to get a ton of new accounts. We know that crypto is going to catch a bid. Like, we know we're going to basically create a bubble if that happens. And this time, maybe a lot of us can time it better. Um, but I don't think they're actually going to give out $2,000 to everybody, especially when Trump's been saying we need to pay off the debt. And I think, you know, that's the most important thing as well.</p>

### 市场健康度分析与 OpenAI 新动向

就这次牛市的健康状况而言，这里有几张图表我想展示给大家。我知道有很多看空的人说我们市场泡沫化了，但看看这张图表。我们真的那么泡沫化吗？看看**IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股）市场。2025年，我们有56宗IPO。我们并没有大量的IPO。互联网泡沫时期，我们有511宗。2021年的SPAC热潮中，我们有大约250宗。2025年，我们只有50多宗。我们没有大量的IPO。所有的大公司，比如Stripe、Discord，这些公司都没有上市。Klarna是上市的大公司之一，但它的IPO表现并不算最好。而且很多这些IPO，如果公司没有盈利，表现也并不好。Figma上市当天涨了3倍，但后来人们抛售后，Figma也回到了现实。所以，我们在并购或IPO方面并没有出现疯狂的狂热。我认为这很健康。这也为2026年更多IPO进入市场创造了条件，而不会出现这种大规模的狂热。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, in terms of the health of this bull market, couple charts right here that I want to show everybody. Um, you know, I know there's a lot of bears right here saying we're frothy, but take a look at this chart right here. Are we that frothy? I mean, look at the IPO market. In 2025, we've had 56 IPOs. We haven't had a ton of IPOs. Dot com bubble, we had 511. 2021 we had about 250 in the spack boom. 2025 we've had a little bit over 50. We've not had a massive amount of IPOs. All the major companies like Stripe, Discord, like these companies have not gone public. Klarna is like one of the major ones that did and Klarna's IPO has not really been the best. And a lot of these IPOs, they haven't done that well if the companies haven't put up earnings. I mean Figma, you know, went up 3x in a day, but then Figma came back down to reality after people ended up just selling it off. So, we didn't have some crazy crazy level of exuberance in the market via M&A or IPOs. And I think that's pretty healthy. And that also sets up 2026 to have a lot more IPOs come into the market, you know, without having this massive level of uh exuberance there.</p>
</details>

另一张关于政府停摆的图表。在停摆期间，股市上涨，但涨幅不大。你可以看到，2025年我们从10月1日开始，看起来将在11月9日结束。在政府重新开放后的一年里，股市在22次中有20次是上涨的。所以，无论是民主党还是共和党执政，在停摆结束后的12个月里，标普500指数平均上涨12.7%。我们仅有的两次下跌是在2018年、1983年和1976年。所以在大约20次中只有3次是下跌的，大部分都是上涨的。如果这遵循我们看到的规律，那么12个月后我们很可能会有一个上涨的市场。当然，前提是盈利能够继续保持，这将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, another chart right here in terms of shutdowns. So stocks were higher during the shutdown, but not by much. As you can see right here for 2025, we started on October 1st. It looks like we're ending on November 9th. Uh stocks have been higher 20 out of 22 times a year after the government opened back up. So whether it's Democrat or Republicans, the S&P 500 on average is up 12.7% 12 months after the uh shutdown has ended. And the only two times we were negative was 2018 and 1983 and then 1976. So three times out of about 20 that we were negative. Most of them have been green. So if that follows what we're seeing then, you know, we likely have a green market 12 months from now. Obviously, if earnings can continue to hold up, which will be very important.</p>

今天早上有一条关于OpenAI的新闻。OpenAI正在考虑进入消费健康应用领域。OpenAI正在探索消费健康工具，包括个人健康助手或一个可以将你所有医疗数据整合到一处的应用。该公司已经引进了新的健康产品领导层，并表示ChatGPT已经收到了大量的健康问题咨询。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Open AI, here's a headline this morning. Open AI is weighing a move into consumer health apps. OpenAI is exploring consumer health tools, including a personal health assistant or an app that can put all your medical data into one place. the company has brought in new health product leadership and says Chachi already sees a huge volume of health questions.</p>
</details>

我认为这对消费领域来说是一个巨大的论点。原因是OpenAI每天都有大量用户向它咨询医疗保健问题。我们昨天看了一些OpenAI首席财务官的视频，他们谈到了公司发展速度之快，以及为什么他们能够证明花费1.4万亿美元是合理的，尽管他们的收入只有200亿美元。原因就在于他们正在进入所有这些不同的垂直领域。其中一个垂直领域是 massive enterprise adoption，首席财务官表示，这一领域的年增长率达到了9倍。另一个可能就是这个消费健康领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this is a massive massive argument for um for the consumer world and the reason for this is because uh OpenAI has a ton of people that ask healthcare questions to it every single day. We looked at a couple of uh videos yesterday from the OpenAI CFO and they talked about this idea of how fast the company is moving, how fast they're growing, why they're able to justify spending 1.4 trillion even though they're doing 20 billions of dollars of revenue. And the reason is because of all these different verticals that they're getting into. One of those verticals being massive enterprise adoption which the CFO said is growing 9x year over year. The other adoption might be this consumer health play.</p>
</details>

我敢肯定人们曾向OpenAI或ChatGPT询问过关于自己健康的问题，并得到了答案。有很多故事说人们通过向ChatGPT提问而不是去谷歌搜索，然后从某个随机的博客上获取健康建议，从而得到了挽救生命的建议。这些聊天机器人在医疗保健方面能说什么，总有一个灰色地带。但如果他们能将其正式化为一个更复杂的AI健康助手产品，我不是说它会一夜爆红，但它可能是AI最好的用例之一。我知道Siri，或者我觉得Siri会有一个有意义的机会，因为他们已经拥有你的Apple健康数据来做这件事。然后显然Gemini也可能会加入竞争。一个更健康的WebMD版本，完全正确。所以，你只是看到了AI的垂直领域在不断增加。如果这些垂直领域能够大幅增长并真正产生有意义的收入形式，那可能就是AI的牛市论据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I'm sure people have asked OpenAI or ChatGPT a question around their health and have gotten an answer. There's plenty of stories of people, you know, really getting some life-saving advice by asking Chat a question, not asking it to Google, then going to some random blog that gives you health advice. There's always a gray area between what these chatbots are able to say from a healthcare perspective. But if they can formalize it into a product that is more sophisticated around an AI assistant for health, not saying that's going to blow up, but it could be one of the best use cases of AI. I know Siri or I feel like Siri would have a meaningful opportunity because they already have your Apple health data to go after that as well. And then obviously Gemini is probably going to be in the mix. A more healthier version of WebMD. Exactly. So, uh, you're just seeing a lot more verticals for AI increasing. And if those verticals can substantially increase and actually generate meaningful forms of revenue, that could be your bullcase for AI.</p>

### 迈克尔·贝瑞再发警告：直指科技巨头财务问题

有人在说，你的图例出问题了。看起来很多人在市场开盘时都在使用这个平台。标普指数上涨超过1%。哇，678点。伙计们，如果我们能达到680点，我认为那将是一个非常重要的水平，即使是心理上的，也会很不错。谷歌报283美元，是绿色的。SoFi 29.01美元，也在努力上涨。英伟达上涨了3.5%，标普指数也上涨了1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, a couple of you saying your legend is bugging a little bit. Looks like a lot of people are using the platform as soon as the market opens. S&P up 1% above 1%. Wow, 678 guys. If we can get to 680, I think that's a very important level for us to reach even psychologically, which would be nice. Google right there 283. That's green. SoFi 2901 trying to get up there. Nvidia is up three and a half and then S&P is up 1% as well.</p>
</details>

你知道今天早上谁会生气吗？就是那个昨晚还在发推特谈论Palantir的人。迈克尔·贝瑞发了这条推文：“亚历克斯·卡普和他的本体论连一份简单的13F报告都看不懂，我一点也不惊讶。任何严谨的本体论或认识论模型，无论是哲学的还是数据科学的，其基本原则都是要认识到你的信息集不足以得出有效结论。”我不知道他到底在说什么。我的第一反应是，他认为Palantir没有真正理解他在13F中披露的内容。据我理解，无论是做空还是买入看跌期权，这都是对Palantir的看跌押注。所以如果他认为卡普的反应是错误的，因为他看不懂13F，我会想，嗯，13F报告说你对Palantir持看跌头寸，不管你是做空还是持有看跌期权，或者你用的是什么金融工具，它都不是看涨的。

<p class="english-text">you know someone's pissed off this morning and that person is the same person who was tweeting about Palunteer last night. Michael Burry put out this tweet. Doesn't surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his ontology cannot crack a simple 13F. A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological or epistemological model whether philosophical or in data science is recognizing when your information is set is insufficient for valid conclusions. I don't know what the hell he's saying. The gut reaction is that he's thinking that Palanteer doesn't really understand what he disclosed on his 13F. And from my understanding, whether it's shorts, whether it's puts, it's a bearish bet on Paler. And so if he thinks that Karp is reacting in a wrong way because he can't read the 13F, I'm like, well, the 13F says you have a bearish position on Palantir, whether you're shorting it or whether you have puts or whatever financial instrument you're using, it's not bullish.</p>

### 美联储官员的鸽派信号

是的，所以毫无疑问，拥有更多数据总比数据少要好。这绝对是事实。尽管如此，我们确实有一些数据。我认为，如果你回顾过去几个月的情况，回到联邦公开市场委员会九月份的会议，经济预测摘要中的中位数参与者预测今年将有三次降息。也就是说，九月一次，十月一次，十二月一次。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, absolutely, it would be better to have more data than than than less data. That's absolutely something that would be the case. Nevertheless, we do have some data. And I think if you look at uh what's happened in the last few months, you go back to the September uh September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the median participant in summary of economic projections was projecting a a three cuts this year. So a cut in September, a cut in October, and a cut in December.</p>
</details>

自那以后发生了什么？我们得到了新的通胀数据，比预期的要好，这会让人认为，与九月份的FOMC会议相比，采取更鸽派的立场是合理的，而当时的中位数预测是三次降息。最重要的是，劳动力市场数据也已公布，劳动力市场继续沿着其轨迹发展，即逐渐疲软。我们有一些关于职位空缺、薪资和失业救济申请的数据，所有这些都与持续的、渐进的疲软相符。我认为，合理的做法是比九月份FOMC会议时更偏向鸽派，而那次会议已经预示了三次降息。

<p class="english-text">What's happened since that happened, since we put those projections out? Well, we've gotten new inflation data which were better than expected which would make one think that it would be reasonable to be incrementally more dovish than at the September FOMC when again the median projection was for three cuts. And on top of that, labor market data have come out with continued with the labor market continuing in the trajectory it was on which is one of gradual softening. We do have some data on openings on new new openings that are available. We have some data on wages and we have some data on jobless claims and all of those are consistent with continued incremental softer weakening. I would think the reasonable thing to be is incrementally more dovish than we were in the September FOMC which again indicated three cuts for</p>

### 迈克尔·贝瑞再发警告：直指科技巨头财务问题

我们一分钟前又收到了一条贝瑞的推文。好吧，让我们看看他说了什么。“通过延长资产的使用寿命来低估折旧，从而人为地抬高收益。这是现代更常见的欺诈行为之一。”哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got another Burry tweet. We got another Burry tweet one minute ago. Okay, let's see what we got. Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boost earnings. One of the more common frauds of the modern era. Wow.</p>
</details>

贝瑞基本上是在说，公司用来提高收益的所有这些GPU折旧都是假的。通过购买英伟达芯片服务器来大规模增加资本支出，而这些服务器的产品周期为两到三年，这不应该导致计算设备使用寿命的延长。然而，这正是所有超大规模数据中心所做的。哇，贝瑞直接公开点名了。这家伙已经两年没说话了，他现在正式用自己的话发表声明，显然是更看空了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Barry's basically saying all this GPU depreciation that companies are using to boost their earnings is fake. Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chip servers on a two to threeyear product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done. Wow. Burry's straight up officially talking. This guy's not talked for two years. He is officially putting out statements in his own words that are obviously more bearish.</p>
</details>

根据我的估计，他们在未来两年内将低估折旧1760亿美元。到2028年，甲骨文将高估收益27%，Meta高估20.8%，等等。但情况会变得更糟。更多细节将于11月25日公布。敬请期待，伙计们。他正在进行另一次“大空头”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By my estimates, they will underdepreciate or understate depreciation by 176 billion in the next two years. By 2028, or Oracle will overstate earnings by 27%, Meta by 20.8%, etc. But it gets worse. More details coming November 25th. Stay tuned, guys. He's going for another big short.</p>
</details>

他正在进行另一次“大空头”。是的，我们得截图，因为他可能会在五秒钟内删除这条推文。让我截个图。天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He is going for another big short. Yeah, we got to screenshot it because he's going to delete this in like five seconds. Let me take the screenshot. Goodness gracious.</p>
</details>

我认为人们没有意识到他实际点名公司股票代码是多么大的事情。贝瑞从来不提股票代码。他刚刚提到了Meta、甲骨文和英伟达。他通常不这么做。他倾向于在实际说出任何公司名称时非常谨慎。他发布分析报告，要么是他变得非常绝望，要么是更多细节即将公布。这家伙是不是要在11月25日发布一张专辑，《大空头2.0》？比如，这是什么？11月25日？他想让每个人都紧张地等待，好像在等什么。他发布股票代码并向市场发出警告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think people realize how big of a deal it is that he's actually calling out tickers. Burry never mentions tickers ever. He just mentioned Meta, Oracle, and Nvidia. He doesn't do that. He tends to be very quiet when it comes to actually saying the name of any companies. the fact that he's putting out analysis either he's getting super desperate more details coming what this guy has a freaking album coming out November 25th big short 2.0 know, like what is this November 25th? He wants everyone to be on their toes waiting for like what the fact that he's putting out tickers and sending a warning to the market.</p>
</details>

所有数据中心股票都在下跌。我的意思是，他显然是在试图引起注意。对我来说，如果你试图引起注意，也许是因为你的空头头寸亏损严重，或者他根本没有空头头寸或看跌期权。他退出了所有关于Palantir和英伟达的交易，现在只是为了发布内容而发布内容，并且他的看空观点并没有财务动机。谁知道呢？也许他只是想制造混乱并证明自己是对的，即使他没有把钱投到他所说的地方。但鉴于贝瑞的历史记录，如果他发布所有这些相关内容，他通常会押注于看跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You got all the data center stocks going down right here. I mean, he's obviously trying to get attention and and to me, if you're trying to get attention, maybe it's because you're really underwater on the short or he has no short or no puts. He got out of the whole pounder in video thing and now he's just putting out content for the sake of putting out content and and he's not financially motivated by being bearish, which I mean, who knows? Maybe he just wants to cause chaos and be right even if he's not putting his money where his mouth is. But given Burry's history, usually he tends to put some money on a bearish bet if he's putting out all this content around it.</p>
</details>

他只在看空时发帖吗？是的，差不多。我的意思是，他从不……他做多Lululemon，但他从未发布过关于服装消费状况的看多言论。他没有发布关于Molina Healthcare的帖子，尽管他做多Molina。他倾向于在看空时出现，但他已经好几年没这么做了。而且，过去三年里，他肯定从未提及过任何股票代码。所以，他居然发布这些内容，真是令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does he only post when bearish? Yeah, pretty much. I mean, he does not he that's what he never like he's long Lululemon. He's never posted something bullish about the state of the consumer in the context of clothing, you know, he's not posting things about Molina healthcare, even though he's long Molina, you know, he he tends to come out when he's bearish, but he hasn't done that for years. So, and he's damn sure never mentioned tickers for the past three years. So, it is quite incredible that he's actually putting this out there.</p>
</details>

他希望人们和他一起做空。这就是为什么我百分之百同意。我的意思是，你在谈论某个随机的11月25日，要公布一些可能是他正在进行的分析或研究的总体计划。他显然希望人们站在他这边，和他一起交易。如果他正在进行交易，我们唯一知道的是英伟达和Palantir。也许还有另一个。距离他必须披露已经过去两个月了，所以，也许他对整个市场或者其他什么东西更加看空，但我不确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He wants people to short it with him. That's why I 100% agree. I mean, you're talking about some random November 25th date to unveil some potentially master plan of analysis or research that he's putting out. He obviously wants people to be on his side of the story and jump in trade with him. If he's in a trade, the only one we know about is Invidian Pounder. Maybe there's another one. It's been, you know, two months since it was disclosed maybe or since he had to disclose it. So, you know, maybe he's even more short the broader market or something, but I'm not sure.</p>
</details>

为什么是11月25日？这是个好问题。我不知道。他想毁掉假期。他可能真的想毁掉假期。戴尔在11月25日公布财报，嗯？哦，这可能是个好点。也许这与他发布研究报告无关。也许这与他希望人们关注的公司有关。你知道这让我想起了什么吗？这让我想起了《猫鼠游戏》，那是一部非常棒的电影。我知道我对电影了解不多，或者说我知道你们认为我对电影了解不多。在我看来，我是一个电影鉴赏家，但这是一部非常棒的电影，我看了两遍，显然是因为迪卡普里奥，我是他的粉丝。但就像他在电影中一直给出线索，他几乎是想被抓住。这有点像贝瑞现在的玩法，对吧？

<p class="english-text">Why November 25th? That's a good question. I don't know. He's trying to ruin the holidays. He might legit be trying to ruin the holidays. Dell reports earnings November 25th, huh? Oh, may that's a good point. Maybe it has nothing to do with him putting out like research. Maybe it has to do with companies he wants people Dude, you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of freaking um um Catch Me If You Can, which is a phenomenal movie. I know I don't know that much about movies or rather I should say I know that you guys don't think I know that much about movies. I'm you know my opinion a movie connoisseur but uh this is a phenomenal movie and I've watched this twice obviously DiCaprio I'm a fanboy but um you know like he was giving out hints throughout the movie he almost wanted to be caught. It's almost kind of like how Burry's playing it, right?</p>
</details>

更多细节将于11月25日公布。如果戴尔的财报中有什么他预计会出现的关于资本支出和折旧的内容。等等，英伟达的第三季度财报？不，英伟达的财报在11月25日之前，对吧？英伟达是11月19日。所以，戴尔是11月25日的主要公司。戴尔、惠普、Autodesk、Workday和Zscaler。这些是当天的财报。

<p class="english-text">More details coming November 25th. If if there's something in Dell's earnings that he's projecting is going to show up in regards to capex and depreciation. Who? Hold on. Is Nvidia Nvidia Q3 earnings? No, Nvidia is before November 25th, right? Nvidia is November 19th. So, Dell is the major major company. November 25th, Dell, HP, Autodesk, Workday, and Zcaler. Those are the earnings.</p>

是的，我看过《肖申克的救赎》。那也是一部非常棒的电影。我知道你们不会相信我，但我很久以前就看过了。那是一部很棒的电影。你知道我昨晚试着看什么吗？我试着看文斯·吉里根的新剧《Pluribus》还是什么。我注册了Apple TV，用了三个月的试用期。我连五分钟都看不下去，兄弟。我真的看不下去。文斯·吉里根，《绝命毒师》在我看来是有史以来最好的剧。所以，我想给它一个机会，因为这是文斯·吉里根的第二部大作。我试了，我真的试了。我做不到。五分钟。我就想，这到底是什么，兄弟？我直接去睡觉了。我本来打算睡前看的，结果直接关掉了。我就想，我看不下去这玩意儿。我会再试试。当我没那么困的时候我会再试试，因为是文斯·吉里根。我真的很尊重文斯·吉里根。但我就想，兄弟，能不能前几分钟搞得刺激一点？

<p class="english-text">So, there you go. I have seen Shaw Shank Redemption. It's also a phenomenal movie. Uh, I know you guys won't believe me, but I did watch that a long time ago. It's a great movie. You know what I tried to watch last night? I tried to watch uh the new Vince Gilligan show um uh Pluribbus or whatever. I signed up for Apple TV, did the three-month trial. I couldn't get through five minutes of it, bro. I could not get through f I was like, dude, and Vince Gilligan, Breaking Bad is the best show of all time in my opinion. And so, I wanted to give it a chance because it's Vince Gilligan's that, you know, it's the second big show. I tried. I really tried. I I couldn't do it. Five minutes. I was like, the hell is this, bro? I went I went to sleep. I was going to watch it before I went to sleep. I just turned it off. I was like, I can't watch this. I'll try again. I'll try again when I'm not as sleepy because it's Vince Gilligan. Like, I really respect Vince Gilligan. But I was like, bro, like, can we be a bit more exciting for the first couple minutes?</p>
</details>

不管怎样，这就是贝瑞的推文。非常奇怪，兄弟。我之所以把这件事搞得这么大，是因为他通常不这样点名股票。他如此明确地指出，让我觉得他对他做空这件事越来越认真了。再说一次，我认为他是错的。我愿意听听他的论点。我只是不认为你应该去赌我们看到的这种盈利增长。他的论点是，所有的盈利增长都不是真实的。那没关系。这就是辩论的所在。但我不知道这是否是故事最好的一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, anyway, that's the Burry tweet. Very weird, dude. The only reason I'm making a big deal out of this is because he does not state tickers like that. The fact that he's that explicit about it makes me think that he is getting much more serious about his short. Again, I think he's wrong. I'm willing to listen to the arguments. I just don't think you bet against the types of earnings growth we're seeing. His argument is that none of the earnings growth is real. That's fine. That's where you have a debate. But I don't know if that's the best side of the story to be on.</p>

而且，你知道，他在2023年1月就说过要卖出。显然，从那时起我们经历了一场大规模的牛市。所以，我的意思是，自2008年以来，他并没有真正准确地预测过一个周期或者一个看跌或看涨的赌注。他在2024年中国市场便宜的时候确实预测对了中国。这是公平的。这是否意味着他会预测对整个AI泡沫、资本支出泡沫的事情？我不这么认为。除非真的出现了一些裂缝，但我们需要一些公司数据来看到这些裂缝的显现。否则，很难仅仅因为他上一次从看空角度预测对是在2008年就给他信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, you know, he said back in January 2023 to sell. Obviously, we had a massive bull market since then. So, I mean, ever since 2008, he hasn't really called a cycle or a or a uh a bearish or bullish bet as accurate. He did get China correct back when China was cheap in 2024. And that's that's fair. Does that mean he's going to get this whole AI bubble, capex bubble thing? I don't I don't think so. Unless there is some real cracks, but we got to get some company data to see those cracks manifest themselves. Otherwise, it's hard to just give him the benefit of the doubt, given the last thing he got right from a bearish perspective was 2008.</p>
