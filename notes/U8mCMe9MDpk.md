### 理想主义的萌芽与职业选择

本期节目重访了去年的一期精彩对话，深入了解了律师 Thomas Sip 的故事。Sip 曾就职于一家享有盛誉的律师事务所，后因其雇主屈服于时任总统特朗普提出的、在法律上存疑的要求而选择辞职。八个月后，Sip 在节目中回顾了这一决定性时刻。他坦言，即使在访谈开始前，他仍感到一丝紧张。Sip 的职业生涯始于一个跨文化背景：他出生在日本，父亲是美国人，母亲是日本人。十岁时随家人移居美国，不久后父母离异。在美国学习英语和融入社会的过程中，他开始理解作为混血儿的身份认同，以及美国独特的社会结构，这与他成长于相对同质化的日本形成了鲜明对比。单身母亲的抚养经历，以及在学习英语和适应新环境时遇到的挑战，如交友困难、因口音被嘲笑等，在他心中埋下了对不公的感知，但也同时吸收了美国关于希望和包容的理想主义叙事。高中时期，他加入了辩论队以锻炼公开演讲能力；大学期间，他在德克萨斯大学学习政治学，并获得了在**美国参议院**担任实习生的宝贵机会。这段经历，尤其是在国会大厦穿梭、与参议员和国会议员互动、旁听重要听证会的经历，让他坚定了投身于美国“追求正义、促进人人福祉”的“项目”的决心。尽管他承认美国并非完美国家，历史中存在错误，但他仍坚信当美国践行正确价值观时，世界会因此变得更好。

Hey,
 it's
 Michael.
 This
 week,
 The
 Daily


is
 revisiting
 some
 of
 our
 favorite


episodes
 this
 year,
 listening
 back
 and


hearing
 what's
 happened
 in
 the
 time


since
 they
 first
 ran.


Today,
 we
 return
 to
 our
 conversation


with
 Thomas
 Sip,
 the
 lawyer
 who
 quit
 his


job
 at
 a
 prestigious
 corporate
 law
 firm


after
 his
 bosses
 gave
 in
 to
 legally


dubious
 demands
 from
 President
 Trump.


And
 we
 hear
 how
 SIP
 views
 that
 moment.


Now,
 eight
 months
 later,
 it's
 Monday,


December
 29th.


Thomas,
 welcome
 to
 the
 Daily.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> I'm
 getting
 the
 small
 sense
 that
 this
 is


a
 nerve-wracking
 experience
 for
 you
 even


before
 it
 started.
 I'm
 just
 seeing
 it
 on


your
 face.


>> Yeah,
 it
 definitely
 is.


I
 want
 to
 start
 by
 asking
 you
 to
 explain


Thomas
 how
 it
 is
 that
 you
 came
 to
 be
 a


lawyer
 in
 the
 first
 place
 and
 ended
 up


at
 this
 very
 prestigious
 firm
 where
 you


worked
 until
 just
 a
 few
 days
 ago


Scatteren
 Ararps.
 What's
 that
 story?


>> So
 going
 all
 the
 way
 to
 the
 start,
 I
 was


born
 in
 Japan
 to
 an
 American
 father
 and


a
 Japanese
 mother.


>> And
 my
 family
 moved
 to
 the
 United
 States


when
 I
 was
 10.
 My
 parents
 separated


shortly
 after.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 was


learning
 English
 in
 middle
 school
 and


also
 learning
 about
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be


an
 American.
 [clears throat]
 Suddenly


becoming
 this
 sort
 of
 racial
 minority


because
 I'm
 mixed
 race
 and
 coming
 to


understand
 the
 social
 fabric
 that's
 kind


of
 unique
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 Um,


especially
 compared
 to
 a
 relatively


homogeneous
 country
 like
 Japan,


>> right?


and
 you
 know
 growing
 up
 with
 my
 my


single
 mom
 who
 doesn't
 speak
 you
 know


fluent
 English
 and
 getting
 all
 those


sort
 of
 experiences
 I
 think
 started
 to


put
 me
 on
 the
 path
 that
 I'm
 on
 now.


>> Can
 you
 just
 explain
 that?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 there
 were
 difficult
 days


for
 sure.
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's


not
 being
 able
 to
 make
 friends,
 being


made
 fun
 of
 for
 my
 accent
 and
 stuff
 like


that
 that
 really
 I
 think
 started
 to
 form


uh
 like
 that
 sense
 of
 injustice
 that
 I


think
 fuels
 me
 sometimes,
 right?
 But
 at


the
 same
 time,
 I
 moved
 to
 the
 United


States,
 you
 know,
 in
 2008
 and
 during
 the


election
 and
 there's
 all
 this


conversation
 in
 America
 about


hopefulness
 and
 about,
 you
 know,
 this


being
 a
 country
 where
 there's
 a
 place


for
 for
 anyone,


>> right?
 And
 so
 I
 was
 also
 absorbing
 that


as
 well.


>> Mhm.


>> In
 high
 school,
 I
 joined
 a
 debate
 team


to
 practice
 public
 speaking.
 And
 in


college,
 I
 was
 studying
 political


science
 at
 the
 University
 of
 Texas.


>> And
 I
 had
 this
 wonderful
 opportunity
 to


be
 a
 an
 intern
 at
 the
 United
 States


Senate.


>> Wow.


>> This
 was
 probably
 basically
 like
 a


decade
 after
 I
 moved
 to
 the
 United


States.
 And
 suddenly
 I'm
 walking
 through


the
 halls
 of
 Congress
 with
 my
 little,


you
 know,
 yellow
 Senate
 intern
 badge
 and


running
 into
 senators
 and
 congressmen


getting
 to
 sit
 in
 on
 important
 hearings.


And
 it
 was
 during
 that
 time
 that
 I


really
 decided
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


this
 project
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 this
 project,


>> what
 do
 you
 mean?


>> It's,
 you
 know,
 a
 march
 towards
 justice,


the
 betterment
 of
 everyone.
 I
 think


there
 are
 these
 like
 core
 principles


that
 are
 unique
 to
 the
 United
 States
 in


many
 ways.


>> I'm
 getting
 from
 you
 a
 real
 sense
 of


idealism
 and
 a
 real
 pure
 admiration
 for


what
 the
 United
 States
 represents.
 Yeah,


I'm
 not
 blind
 to
 the
 errors
 in
 the
 past


and
 I
 I
 know
 that
 the
 United
 States
 has


not
 been
 and
 still
 is
 not
 a
 perfect


country,
 but
 I
 really
 still
 believe


that,
 you
 know,
 when
 the
 United
 States


is
 doing
 the
 right
 things,
 the
 whole


world
 is
 a
 better
 place
 because
 of
 it.


>> So,
 talk
 about
 how
 this
 all
 translates


into
 your
 decision
 to
 become
 a
 lawyer,


to
 enter
 this
 industry.
 Well,
 so
 a
 lot


of
 the
 people
 with
 the
 cool
 jobs
 in
 DC


tend
 to
 have
 law
 degrees.
 And
 so
 I


figured
 it
 was
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 next


best
 step
 um
 afterward.
 And
 so
 I
 go
 to


law
 school
 straight
 out
 of
 college.
 All


the
 law
 firms,
 the
 big
 law
 firms,
 um


almost
 by
 definition
 pay
 the
 same
 scale


salary.
 So
 that
 the
 way
 that
 these
 law


firms
 distinguish
 themselves
 from
 each


other
 often
 times
 is
 in
 things
 like
 how


their
 proono
 program
 operates,
 how
 how


invested
 they
 are
 into
 diversity


initiatives.


>> And
 I
 chose
 Scatteren
 because
 it
 had
 the


prestige.
 And
 as
 a
 as
 a
 22-year-old


trying
 to
 pay
 off
 a
 six-f
 figureure


debt,
 I
 was
 drawn
 toward
 a
 higher
 salary


among
 other
 things.


>> I'm
 just
 going
 to
 explain
 to
 people.


>> Yes.
 By
 Scatteren,
 you
 mean
 Scatteren


Arps?


>> Scatteren
 Arps.
 Yes.


>> Big
 big
 law
 firm
 has
 an
 office
 here.
 New


York
 has
 offices
 I
 think
 all
 over
 the


world.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 firms
 that
 we


think
 of
 when
 we
 think
 of
 this
 concept


of
 big
 law
 law
 firms
 that
 do
 a
 huge


amount
 of
 work
 in
 corporate
 America.


>> Mhm.
 [clears throat]
 That's
 right.
 And


Scatteren
 really
 advertised
 two
 things.


It's
 proono
 program
 and
 its
 diversity


initiatives.
 With
 regard
 to
 the
 proono


programs,
 Scatteren
 had
 a
 rule
 basically


that
 said
 that
 you
 can
 count
 an


unlimited
 number
 of
 your
 proono
 hours


towards
 your
 billable
 hours
 requirement.


And
 it
 was
 a
 big
 deal
 that
 Scatteren


does
 that
 because
 not
 many
 other
 firms


do.

### 律所妥协：原则的失落与道德困境

Sip 在律所的职业生涯进入转折点，源于**美国平等就业机会委员会**（EEOC）于3月17日发布的一封信函，该信函点名了包括 Sip 所在律所**Skadden Arps**在内的20家律所，指出它们因多元化实践而接受调查。指控的核心在于这些律所可能在推行多元化、公平与包容（DEI）实践时存在歧视。Sip 认为，总统的行政命令对律所而言如同“死亡判决”，因为它们明确禁止与联邦政府的互动，这让律所员工担忧公司可能因此倒闭。随后，Sip 的一位律所朋友转发了一篇《纽约时报》的文章，披露 Skadden Arps 正与政府协商，试图规避一项行政命令。此前，另一家知名律所 **Paul Weiss** 已与政府达成协议，承诺向总统支持的事业捐赠4000万美元的**无偿法律服务**（pro bono）。在协议达成的前一周，律所内部已出现一些声音，试图组织内部讨论，寻求对局势的清晰认识，并希望律师们能就当前事件表达看法。许多律师认为总统的行为是违宪的，缺乏法律依据，是滥用权力。他们希望律所能够坚持立场，但感到事态发展迅速，自己却“发不出声音”。Sip 看到一份在律所内部流传的邮件串后，意识到律所很可能将达成一项令律师们不满的协议。不出几个小时，新闻报道证实了这一消息，律所也发布了通知：他们已经达成了一项协议。

<details><summary>Original English Source</summary>
>> So
 when
 did
 you
 start
 to
 understand
 that


Scatteren
 had
 entered
 the
 president's


crosshairs?
 So
 on
 March
 17th
 when
 the


EEOC,
 which
 stands
 for
 the
 Equal


Employment
 Opportunity
 Commission,


>> basically
 published
 this
 letter
 listing


20
 law
 firms,
 including
 my
 own,
 saying


that
 these
 law
 firms
 are
 essentially


under
 investigation
 for
 their
 practices


um
 related
 to
 diversity.


>> Right.
 I
 believe
 the
 claim
 was
 that


these
 law
 firms
 may
 have
 practiced


discrimination
 through
 the
 application


of
 diversity,
 equity,
 and
 inclusion


practices.


>> Right.
 And
 these
 executive
 orders,
 I


think
 it's
 worth
 reminding
 listeners,


they
 can
 feel
 to
 the
 law
 firms
 that
 are


being
 hit
 with
 them
 like
 death
 sentences


because
 they
 explicitly
 prevent
 these


firms
 like
 Perkins
 Kuey
 from
 interacting


with
 the
 federal
 government.
 And
 so
 the


people
 [clears throat]
 work
 at
 these


firms
 fear
 that
 they
 may
 go
 out
 of


business.


>> Right.
 Yeah.
 And
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 from


the
 firm
 sends
 me
 an
 article
 that
 the


New
 York
 Times
 published
 basically


stating
 that
 Scatteren
 was
 in
 talks
 with


the
 administration
 to
 avert
 an
 executive


order.
 And
 this
 was
 after
 Paul
 Weiss,


which
 is
 essentially
 a
 pure
 firm,
 made
 a


deal
 including
 for
 $40
 million
 proono


commitment
 to
 causes
 that
 the
 president


agrees
 with.
 And
 during
 that
 preceding


week,
 there
 had
 been,
 you
 know,
 pockets


of
 the
 law
 firm
 trying
 to
 organize
 some


sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 requests
 from
 a


response,
 nothing
 publicly,
 but
 at least


internally,
 seeking
 clarity
 and
 hoping


to
 provide
 at
 least
 some
 input
 into
 what


the
 attorneys
 who
 actually
 work
 there


feel
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 and
 how
 so


many
 of
 us
 believe
 that
 it's


unconstitutional,


>> the
 executive
 orders,


>> right?
 Like,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 difficult


legal
 question.
 There's
 no
 legal
 basis


for
 what
 the
 president's
 doing.
 It's


complete
 abuse
 of
 power.
 And
 so
 we
 want


our
 firm
 to
 stand
 up
 for
 that,


>> but
 we're
 feeling
 like
 things
 are
 moving


really
 fast
 and
 and
 we
 felt
 voiceless.


>> Mhm.
 So
 what
 what
 happens
 next?


>> So
 there's
 this
 email
 thread
 that
 got


around
 to
 parts
 of
 the
 firm.
 And
 so
 when


I
 see
 that,


I
 realize,
 you
 know,
 at
 that
 point


that's
 pretty
 likely
 that
 there's
 going


to
 be
 a
 deal


and
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 that
 the


attorneys
 don't
 like.


[music]


>> And
 you
 know,
 within
 hours,
 I
 think


we
 again
 find
 out
 from
 the
 news


that
 there
 [music]
 is
 this
 agreement


and
 then
 we
 hear
 from
 the
 firm.
 They


have
 done
 a
 deal.


>> Yeah.
 [music]


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 [music]
 back.


I
 just
 want
 to
 summarize
 what
 is
 in
 this


deal
 that
 Scatteren
 reached
 with


President
 Trump.
 It
 promises
 to
 provide


$100
 million
 in
 proono
 legal
 services


from
 Scatteren
 to
 causes
 that
 both


President
 Trump
 and
 the
 law
 firm
 both


support.
 It
 calls
 for
 hiring
 what
 are


known
 as
 Scatteren
 fellows.
 Those


fellows
 are
 at
 least
 some
 of
 them


supposed
 to
 be
 focused
 on
 Trump
 friendly


issues
 and
 some
 of
 them
 have
 to
 be


conservative


>> in
 their
 ideological
 outlook.
 And
 then


there's
 a
 part
 of
 the
 agreement
 that


vows
 that
 Scatteren
 will
 not
 engage
 in


quote
 unquote
 illegal
 DEI
 hiring


practices.


Broadly,
 this
 is
 the
 deal
 that
 every


major
 law
 firm
 that
 has
 come
 to
 an


agreement
 has
 reached
 with
 the


president.
 So
 what
 is
 your
 reaction
 to


this
 deal
 when
 you
 finally
 digest
 it?


Personally,
 I
 felt
 ashamed
 to
 work
 at


Scatteren
 and
 that's
 such
 a
 new


experience
 because
 because
 of
 how
 you


know
 prestigious
 the
 law
 firm
 is
 and


then
 suddenly
 in
 you
 know
 the
 blink
 of


an
 eye
 in
 just
 a
 few
 days
 even
 like
 my


whole
 view
 of
 the
 firm
 has
 been


completely
 tainted.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 what
 precisely
 is
 making


you
 feel
 the
 shame?


>> You
 know
 it's
 a
 mix
 of
 things.
 This
 is


giving
 the
 president
 a
 PR
 win
 after


[clears throat]
 being
 bullied.
 So,
 it


seems
 like
 I'm
 working
 at
 a
 firm
 that,


you
 know,
 isn't
 as
 high
 caliber
 as
 it


said
 it
 was,


>> right?
 But
 more
 importantly
 than
 that,


so
 many
 lawyers
 agree
 that
 what
 the


president
 is
 doing
 is
 wrong.
 This
 is
 a


threat
 to
 our
 constitutional
 fabric,
 to


our
 democracy,
 to
 our
 civil
 liberties.


You
 know,
 people
 should
 be
 able
 to
 be


represented
 by
 by
 their
 lawyers
 freely.


Judges
 should
 be
 able
 to
 make
 decisions


even
 if
 it
 goes
 against
 the
 president.


And
 to
 see
 Scatteren
 be
 complicit
 to
 aid


this
 attack,


I
 was
 so
 ashamed
 to
 work
 there.

### 辞职信的诞生与历史的审判

面对律所的决定，Sip 开始记录自己的想法和疑问，从实际操作层面（如协议如何执行、具体会是什么样子）到更深层的思考。随着答案的浮现，他的疑问逐渐转变为陈述，他意识到自己写下的内容已成为一份辞职信的草稿，这并非他最初的计划。Sip 分享了辞职信的部分内容：“亲爱的同事们，我写信通知大家，我将离开本律所。曾几何时，我在这里工作似乎是不可想象的。在我童年早期的大部分时间里，我并非一名优秀的学生，难以集中注意力，也无法认真对待任何事情。但即便如此，我热爱一门学科——历史。我曾觉得学习过去的一切是如此美妙，关于胜利与悲剧，关于个体勇敢的时刻与集体的麻木不仁。我常常设想自己身处同样的困境，我会怎么做？我会做正确的事吗？但总感觉无从得知。我相信，正如你们许多人所相信的那样，本届总统政府所做的一切是错误的。我们正在滑向一个权力者凌驾于法律之上的独裁统治。Skadden Arps 与特朗普政府的协议，让我们的国家更深地陷入了这种堕落。最终，Skadden Arps 站在了历史的错误一边。我无法再继续留在这里，因为我知道总有一天我必须解释我为何留下。” 当被问及按下“发送”键时的感受时，Sip 表示那是一种百倍的强烈感受，因为他知道这是他人生中的一个关键时刻，可能与初到美国一样重要。他明白自己正在关闭一些门，但也对在美国这样的国家能有这样的经历表示感激。他知道许多反对特朗普及其政策的人都曾遭受过猛烈的反击，这可能是一次改变人生的事件，而他对此有所担忧。他与远在日本的母亲通话，告知辞职的消息，母亲起初不理解，后开始哭泣，并希望他回日本，但他坚定地拒绝了。

<details><summary>Original English Source</summary>
>> So
 what
 did
 you
 do?


>> So
 I
 start
 actually
 just
 writing
 down


notes
 and
 really
 my
 questions.
 Some
 of


them
 are
 practical
 like
 how
 is
 this


going
 to
 be
 enforced?
 What
 will
 it


actually
 look
 like?
 And
 I
 started


thinking
 about
 it
 and
 finding
 answers


and
 so
 the
 questions
 became
 statements


and
 I
 realized
 what
 I
 had
 written
 was
 a


draft
 of
 resignation
 letter.
 So
 that's


>> not
 necessarily
 what
 you
 set
 out
 to
 do.


>> No.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 to
 to
 read
 from
 parts
 of


the
 letter?


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.


>> [clears throat]


>> Dear
 colleagues
 and
 friends,


I'm
 writing
 to
 let
 you
 know
 that
 I'm


leaving
 [music]
 this
 firm.


There
 was
 a
 time
 when
 my
 employment
 here


was
 so
 unlikely.
 For
 much
 of
 my
 early


childhood,
 I
 [music]
 was
 not
 a
 good


student.
 I
 struggled
 to
 focus
 in
 class


and
 take
 anything
 seriously.
 But
 even


then,
 there
 was
 one
 subject
 I
 loved.


History.


I
 thought
 it
 was
 so
 wonderful
 to
 learn


about
 all
 that
 came
 before
 me,
 [music]


about
 the
 triumphs
 and
 tragedies,
 about


the
 moments
 of
 individual
 bravery
 and


[music]
 collective
 complacency.


I
 would
 often
 imagine
 myself
 faced
 with


the
 same
 dilemmas.


What
 would
 I
 do
 if
 I
 was
 there?
 Would
 I


do
 the
 right
 thing?


It
 always
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 no
 way
 to


know.


I
 believe,
 as
 I
 know
 many
 of
 you
 do,


that
 what
 the
 current
 presidential


administration
 is
 doing
 is
 wrong.
 That


we
 are
 sliding
 into
 an
 autocracy
 where


those
 in
 power
 are
 above
 the
 rule
 of


law.


Scatteren's
 agreement
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 sent
 our
 country
 deeper


down
 this
 descent.
 [music]


And
 then
 I
 finish,


Scatteren
 is
 on
 the
 wrong
 side
 of


history.
 [music]


I
 could
 no
 longer
 stay
 knowing
 that


someday
 I
 would
 have
 to
 explain
 why
 I


stayed.
 [music]


>> What
 did
 it
 feel
 like
 to
 hit
 send?


I
 mean,
 listen
 to
 your


>> breathing
 right
 now.
 It's
 like
 you're


reliving
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Um,


>> what
 was
 it
 like
 to
 send
 that
 email?


If
 you
 heard
 my
 breath,
 it
 felt
 like


that.


Uh
 maybe
 a hundred
 times
 more
 though


because
 I
 knew
 that,
 you
 know,
 that
 was


a
 pivotal
 moment
 in
 my
 life.
 Maybe
 maybe


just
 as
 pivotal
 as
 coming
 to
 the
 United


States
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 I
 knew
 that
 I


was
 closing
 some
 doors
 and,


you
 know,
 a
 place
 like
 Scatteren.


I'm
 grateful
 for
 that
 experience.
 I


think
 it's
 only
 possible
 in
 a
 country


like
 the
 United
 States.
 and
 I
 really


really
 believe
 in
 it.


>> I'm
 sure
 you're
 aware

 I
 told
 her
 I
 quit.
 She's
 like, "Do


you

 another

 And
 I
 was
 like,


"No,
 mom,
 you
 don't

this

 "No,

 I
 can't

 I
 won't."

### 对妥协逻辑的驳斥与对未来的信心

许多同事选择不辞职，他们可能面临经济压力，如需要供养子女完成大学学业。Sip 提到，一些同事在 Paul Weiss 律所与特朗普达成协议时，曾考虑过举报。他了解到，Paul Weiss 的高层认为，与总统达成协议是保护律所数千名员工的最佳方式，而牺牲的原则与员工的生存相比微不足道。这些律所的领导者普遍声称，协议达成后，律所“依然是我们”。Sip 的前老板在公司全员邮件中也写道：“这项协议并没有改变我们是谁。” 然而，Sip 强烈反对这种说法。他认为，律所明知特朗普的行政命令缺乏法律依据，却依然同意协议，这无异于是在资助对法律职业、司法独立和民主制度的“生存威胁”。他坚信，这种妥协确实改变了律所的本质。尽管 Sip 对美国抱有极大的信念，但经历此事后，他对美国是否仍是他所崇尚的那个版本感到疑虑。然而，他从许多陌生人那里收到的信息让他感到一丝希望：尽管每个人都感到恐惧，但如果大家都能站出来发声，就有可能扭转局面，挽救这个国家。他承认自己也在冒险，将职业生涯置于风险之中，但他认为这是值得的。他从未后悔成为一名律师或上法学院，并认为在 Skadden Arps 的经历也教会了他许多，为他提供了倡导自己信仰和帮助他人的技能。

>> Many
 of
 your
 colleagues
 are
 not
 leaving


their
 jobs.
 They
 may
 feel
 the
 way
 you


feel
 and
 have
 two
 kids
 they
 have
 to
 put


through
 college.


>> They
 might
 not
 feel
 the
 way
 you
 feel.


I'm
 thinking
 about
 reporting
 my


colleagues
 did
 inside
 the
 upper
 echelons


of
 Paul
 Weiss
 when
 that
 law
 firm
 did
 a


deal
 with
 Trump.
 And
 it
 became
 clear


that
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 people
 who
 run


the
 firm,
 lots
 of
 them,
 felt
 that
 the


best
 thing
 to
 do
 was
 to
 make
 a
 deal
 to


protect
 the
 thousands
 of
 people
 who
 work


at
 these
 firms.
 And
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 what
 they're
 giving
 up
 is
 small


compared
 to
 that
 survival.
 And
 the


bosses
 at
 all
 these
 firms
 that
 end
 up


capitulating
 to
 Trump
 say
 some
 version


of,
 "We
 are
 the
 same
 law
 firm
 after
 we


did
 these
 deals
 as
 we
 were
 before."
 In


fact,
 in
 a
 companywide
 email,
 your


former
 boss
 says
 just
 that,
 quote,
 "This


agreement
 does
 not
 change
 who
 we
 are."


What
 do
 you
 make
 of
 that?


>> I
 just
 don't
 think
 that's
 true.


These
 law
 firms
 are
 agreeing
 to
 these


deals
 when
 they
 know
 that
 there's
 no


legal
 basis
 for
 any
 threat
 executive


order.
 And
 by
 capitulating,
 they're


aiding,
 you
 know,
 this
 existential


threat
 against
 the
 profession,
 the


independence
 of
 the
 judiciary
 and
 our


democracy
 and
 everyone
 who
 depends
 on


it.


>> It
 does
 change
 who
 the
 firm
 is.


>> Yes.
 In
 short,


>> yes,


>> you
 very
 clearly
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 faith
 in


the
 US,
 but
 at
 this
 point,
 how
 confident


are
 you
 given
 everything
 you've
 just


been
 through
 that
 the
 version
 of
 the


United
 States
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 at
 the


center
 of
 everything
 you've
 done
 here
 is


now
 the
 version
 of
 the
 United
 States?


confident
 because
 of
 what
 so
 many


people,
 strangers,
 you
 know,
 reaching


out
 to
 me
 have
 said
 to
 me,
 which
 is
 that


they're
 also
 scared.
 Everyone
 is
 scared.


But
 if
 everyone
 could,
 you
 know,
 stand


up
 and
 speak
 up
 about
 this,
 then
 we
 can


turn
 this
 back,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 save
 it


still.


>> But
 are
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 worried
 that


you're
 making
 the
 wrong
 bet?


>> Well,
 of
 course
 I'm,
 you
 know,
 worried.


I
 guess,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 putting
 my
 career


on
 the
 line
 for
 this
 and
 I
 I
 knew
 that


going
 into
 this.
 I
 have
 student
 loans.
 I


have
 a
 single
 mom
 who,
 you
 know,


>> Andrew
 just
 publicly
 picked
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 fight
 with
 the
 president.


>> That's
 right.


>> I
 wonder
 if
 this
 experience
 made
 you


question
 going
 into
 law.


>> No,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 regret
 becoming
 a


lawyer


and
 going
 to
 law
 school.
 It's
 a


wonderful
 education.


You
 know,
 even
 my
 time
 at
 Scatteren,
 I


learned
 so
 much
 and
 it's
 equipping
 me


with
 skills,
 I
 think,
 to
 advocate
 for


what
 I
 believe
 in
 and
 for
 for
 others
 as


well.


And
 that's
 what
 lawyers
 do.


Well,
 Thomas,
 thank
 you
 for
 for
 coming


[music]
 in
 here
 and
 for
 telling
 us
 the


story.
 We
 really
 appreciate
 it.

 you.

### 后续生活与原则的价值

在辞职后，Sip 的生活发生了积极的变化。他收到了许多来自听众的温暖信息，他们分享了对民主价值观和“美国人身份”的思考，这让他感到一种希望。也有人因相似的背景或经历而与他产生共鸣。其中一位父亲在开车送孩子上学时，与孩子们一起收听了这期节目，并询问孩子们：“如果你们处在 Thomas 的位置，会怎么做？” 这种互动让 Sip 深感欣慰，仿佛在历史课上思考的场景得以重现，这给了他巨大的鼓舞。

在职业前景方面，Sip 最终找到了一份新工作，目前在一位**联邦法官**手下担任**法律书记员**（law clerk）。这份工作涉及分析法律、向法官提供建议，本质上是法官的助手。尽管他无法透露具体案件细节，但他认为这份工作与他之前的经历有着内在联系。联邦法官在法律体系中扮演着制衡总统权力的关键角色，而 Sip 的选择正是基于伦理考量，他认为这是对法律和宪法的忠诚体现。他希望通过分享自己的经历，为那些面临类似抉择但犹豫不决的人提供一个参照，证明“另一面”是存在的。

Sip 强调，辞去一份体面、高薪的律所工作，转而坚持原则，最终是能够获得回报的。他认为，到2025年，他会“一切安好”，甚至比之前更好。他特别指出，虽然并非所有美国人都能自由表达观点，但律师可以。尽管可能面临被针对的风险，但那些敢于抗争并最终在法庭上获胜的律所，在财务上并未受损，并未“亏损”。他认为，律所曾声称的“生存恐惧”被夸大了，这不过是“将利润置于律师誓言之上”的借口。如果像他这样的个体都能安好，那么那些收入数百万的律所高管也同样会安好。他重申，誓言必须具有意义。

after
 the
 break.
 How
 Thomas
 has
 fared


[music]
 since
 he
 quit
 his
 job.


[music]


>> Let's
 catch
 up.
 Okay.
 Formally.


>> Okay.
 You
 look
 well.
 You
 look
 rested.


>> The
 last
 time
 you
 saw
 me,
 I
 was
 running


on
 almost
 no
 sleep.


>> Well,
 catch
 me
 up
 on
 everything
 that's


happened
 to
 you.
 Last
 time
 we
 spoke,
 it


was
 just
 a
 few
 days
 after
 you
 quit
 your


job
 at
 Scatteren,


>> right?


>> Suddenly,
 you're
 not
 employed.
 You're


not
 getting
 any
 paychecks.


>> What
 happened
 next?


>> Uh,
 came
 on
 this
 podcast.
 [laughter]


>> I
 remember
 that
 part.
 and
 sounded
 like


people
 generally
 liked,
 you
 know,
 what
 I


said.
 And
 I
 got


so
 many
 heartfelt
 messages
 from
 people,


you
 know,
 feeling
 that
 sort
 of


hopefulness
 that
 I
 feel
 thinking
 about


these
 sort
 of
 democratic
 values,
 what
 it


means
 to
 be
 an
 American.
 Other
 people


reached
 out
 because
 they
 felt
 sort
 of


maybe
 a
 kinship,
 a
 sort
 of
 common


background,
 whatever
 it
 may
 be.
 There


were
 just
 some
 parents
 who
 were
 worried


about
 their
 kids
 and,
 you
 know,


listening
 with
 their
 kids
 and
 those
 are


some
 of
 the
 most
 touching
 ones.
 There


was
 one
 in
 particular
 that
 really
 struck


me.
 It
 was
 a


>> Can
 you
 describe
 it?


>> Yeah.
 It
 was
 a
 a
 father
 driving
 his
 kids


to
 school
 and
 they're
 listening
 to
 this


episode
 and
 he's
 asking
 kids
 his
 kids,


"What
 would
 you
 do


>> if
 you
 were
 in
 Thomas's
 position?"


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 that's
 the
 sort
 of


thing
 that,
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 I
 would


think
 about
 in
 history
 class.
 And
 I


don't
 know,
 it
 was
 a
 really
 great


feeling
 and
 it
 gave
 me
 a
 real
 it's
 like


a
 win
 in
 my
 back.


>> And
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 to
 your
 job


prospects?
 Do
 you
 end
 up
 finding
 a
 job?


>> Long
 story
 short,
 I
 do.
 I'm
 currently


working
 for
 a
 federal
 judge.


>> And
 what
 can
 you
 tell
 me
 about
 that


work,
 how
 you
 got
 it,
 and
 how
 it
 may
 or


may
 not
 fit
 into
 the
 way
 that
 your
 last


job
 ended.


>> Uh,
 I
 can't
 tell
 you
 a
 lot,
 but
 I
 can


tell
 you
 some
 things.


>> Okay.
 The
 judge
 actually
 found
 me


through
 his
 network
 and
 mine
 kind
 of


colliding.
 Uh
 I'm
 his
 the
 title
 is
 I'm
 a


law
 clerk
 and
 the
 job
 is
 essentially


analyzing
 the
 law,
 explaining
 it,
 making


recommendations
 to
 the
 judge.
 So
 you're


basically
 the
 judge's
 assistant.
 I
 know


when
 you
 clerk
 for
 a
 judge,
 this
 is
 my


sense,
 you
 may
 not
 be
 able
 to
 discuss
 a


lot
 of
 the
 intricacies
 of
 your
 work,
 but


it
 strikes
 me
 that
 if
 you're
 working
 for


a
 federal
 judge,


>> you're
 potentially
 interacting
 with


President
 Trump's
 agenda
 to
 some
 degree.


and
 federal
 judges
 are
 the
 figures
 in


our
 legal
 system
 right
 now
 who
 are
 seen


as
 really
 the
 most
 powerful
 and


important
 potential
 checks
 on
 this


president


and
 I'm
 sure
 that
 hasn't
 escaped
 you


either.


I'm
 to
 be
 honest
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 talk


about
 you
 know
 active
 cases
 that
 may
 or


may
 not
 be
 before
 my
 judge.
 because


there's
 pretty
 serious
 ethics
 concerns


about,
 you
 know,
 clerks
 typically
 don't


talk
 to
 the
 media,


>> right?


>> And


I
 want
 to
 make
 it
 clear
 that
 the
 judge's


job
 isn't
 to
 be
 a
 partisan
 actor.
 It's


to
 be
 the
 adjudicator
 of
 what
 the
 law


says.
 And
 as
 you
 know,
 my
 judge's
 clerk,


that's
 also
 my
 job
 and
 responsibility.


And
 I
 take
 that
 really
 seriously,


>> right?
 And


I
 think
 the
 true
 interpretation
 is
 that,


you
 [clears throat]
 know,
 I
 made
 this


decision
 on
 on
 ethics
 grounds.
 And
 it


was
 about
 what
 I
 thought,
 you
 know,
 the


law
 was,
 what
 the
 constitution
 demands.


And
 I
 was
 just
 hoping
 to
 explain
 my
 own


decision
 in
 a
 time
 when
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 facing
 a
 similar
 decision


and
 they
 weren't
 sure
 what
 it
 would
 look


like
 on
 the
 other
 side.


And
 I
 guess
 right
 now
 I'm
 speaking
 to


you
 from
 the
 other
 side
 of
 that


decision.
 Say


I
 was
 fine.
 I
 was
 actually
 more
 than


fine.


>> There
 is
 another
 side.


>> There
 is
 another
 side


>> to
 quitting
 a
 big
 prestigious


well-paying
 job
 at
 a
 law
 firm
 on


principal.


>> Yes.
 In
 the
 year
 2025,


you'll
 end
 up
 all
 right.
 And


specifically
 speaking
 to
 the
 lawyers,


not
 everyone
 in
 America
 can
 safely
 speak


their
 mind
 right
 now.
 Mhm.


But
 lawyers


can
 obviously
 you
 may
 be
 targeted
 and


but
 the
 law
 firms
 that
 fought
 back
 and


are
 winning
 in
 courts
 are
 doing
 fine


financially.
 You
 know
 they're
 not


they're
 not
 going
 underwater


and


this
 I
 think
 existential
 fear
 was


completely
 overblown.


>> It
 was
 overstated


>> I
 think.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 excuse.
 I
 think
 it


was
 putting
 profits
 over
 an
 oath
 that


lawyers
 swear


>> to
 protect
 the
 constitution.


>> And
 you
 know,
 if
 someone
 like
 me
 ends
 up


fine,
 more
 than
 fine,
 then
 the
 executive


partners
 and
 chairpersons
 of
 these
 law


firms


>> who
 make
 many
 millions
 more,


>> right,
 would
 [snorts]
 have
 been


completely
 fine,
 too.


And
 [music]


regardless,


I
 think
 the
 oaths
 have
 to
 mean


something.
 [music]


>> Thank
 you
 [music]
 once
 again
 for
 your


time
 and
 your
 cander.


>> The
 the
 pleasure
 and
 the
 privilege
 is


all
 mine.
 I
 really
 just
 want
 to
 say


thank
 [music]
 you
 because
 you
 were
 a


huge
 part
 of
 what
 happened
 to
 me
 a
 few


months
 ago.
 You
 changed
 my
 life.


Oh,
 well,

 you
 changed
 your
 own


life.
