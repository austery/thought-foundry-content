title: 罗伯特·沃尔丁格：为何追逐开悟反而会让你陷入痛苦

### 禅宗实践：日常生活中的深刻益处

我是一名**禅修者**（Zen practitioner: 源自大乘佛教的修行宗派，强调通过冥想和直觉来达到开悟），也是一名**授戒禅宗僧侣**（ordained Zen priest），同时还是一位禅宗老师。实际上，我是一位**老师**（Roshi: 禅宗中对资深导师的尊称），一位禅宗大师。因此，我每天都会冥想。我在美国乃至国际上教授冥想，这是我生活中非常重要的一部分。我发现，这对我思考自己的生活、他人的生活、我的研究以及如何与患者合作都带来了巨大的益处。

<p class="english-text">I am a Zen practitioner and I'm an ordained Zen priest, and I'm a Zen teacher. I'm actually a Roshi, a Zen master. And so I meditate every day. I teach meditation here in the United States and actually internationally, it's a big part of my life. And what I find is that it is an enormous benefit in terms of how I think about my own life, other people's lives, how I think about my research, how I think about working with patients.</p>
</details>

### 社区、自我觉察与慈悲心

**禅宗**（Zen: 源自大乘佛教的修行宗派，强调通过冥想和直觉来达到开悟）强调社区，在佛教语言中被称为**僧伽**（sangha: 佛教术语，指修行社区或僧团）。其核心理念是，我们通过彼此之间的关系来学习认识自己和他人，这包括在冥想期间以及在世俗生活中。因此，我们练习处理任何出现的问题。如果我对我朋友感到恼火，我就会练习处理这种情绪。我注意到这种恼火，感受它在我的身体和大脑中的感觉，并注意到我如何处理这种恼火。然后我还会注意到当我恼火时，我的朋友如何回应我。所有这些都是深入探索“我在关系中的体验是怎样的？”以及“关系中的喜悦是怎样的？”这一过程的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zen emphasizes community. It's called sangha in the Buddhist language. And it's really the idea that we practice learning about ourselves and each other by being in relationships with each other, both during meditation sessions and out there in the world. So we practice with whatever comes up for us. So if I get annoyed at my friend, I practice with that. I notice the annoyance, I feel what it feels like in my body and in my brain, and I notice what I do with annoyance. And then I notice how my friend reacts to me when I'm annoyed. All these things are part of this kind of deep dive into what is my experience like of being in a relationship? What's joy like in a relationship?</p>
</details>

冥想的原则之一是，如果我们真正审视自己的生活，会发现我们的思想是混乱无序的，我们并不总是为自己的感受或想法感到骄傲。我们逐渐接受所有这些都是人类的一部分。然后我们意识到，每个人都在经历同样的事情。每个人的思想都是混乱无序的，每个人都有不值得骄傲的想法和不喜欢的冲动。当我们意识到这一点时，我们就会对自己和他人产生更多的**慈悲心**（compassion），也会有更多的接受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the principles of meditation is that if we really look at our own lives, our minds are messy and chaotic, and we're not always proud of what we feel or what we think. And we come to accept all of that as just part of being human. And then what we realize is that everybody is having the same experience. Everybody's minds are messy and chaotic, and everybody has thoughts they're not proud of and impulses they don't like. And when we realize that, we come to have a lot more compassion for ourselves and for other people, there's a lot more acceptance.</p>
</details>

其理念是，我们从一个希望世界符合我们喜好和厌恶的地方，转向一个不再需要他人与他们本来的样子不同。我们意识到，我们每个人都只是以自己的方式出现在世界上，这是一种值得庆祝和接受的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The idea is that we move from a place of wanting the world to conform to what we like and don't like. We move from that place to not needing other people to be different from who they are, realizing that each of us is just showing up in the world as we are, and that's something to be celebrated and accepted.</p>
</details>

### 无常：减轻痛苦的关键

**禅宗**（Zen）的主要明确目标是“无”。禅宗是一种实践。然而，实践的副作用是“觉醒”。觉醒真正意味着更深入地理解生命的真相，例如，一切事物都在不断变化，包括我自己，甚至那些看起来固定和稳定的事物也总是在持续变化的过程中。这非常有帮助，因为我们常常试图固定事物。我们试图抓住事物并让它们保持不变，当我们这样做时，我们会遭受很多痛苦。因此，了解我们所说的**无常**（impermanence: 佛教核心教义之一，指一切事物都在不断变化，没有永恒不变的实体）的真相，可以减轻我们给自己带来的许多痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the main explicit goal of Zen is nothing. Zen is a practice. Now, the side effect of practice is waking up. Waking up really means understanding more deeply the truth of what it means to be alive, the truth, for example, that everything is constantly changing, including me, that even the things that look like they are fixed and stable are always in a process of continual change. That's really helpful because often we try to fix things. We try to hold on to things and make them stay the same, and we suffer a lot when we do that. So learning about the truth of what we call impermanence relieves a lot of suffering that we inflict on ourselves.</p>
</details>

我会把无常这个概念评为第一位，它是禅宗佛教最伟大的精髓。基本上，一切事物都在不断变化的概念意味着“我”没有固定的自我或身份。“我”总是流动的。我总是在变化的过程中，并且我总是与世界上其他正在变化的人和事物相连接。因此，没有什么是一成不变的。从最深层的意义上讲，没有什么可以抓住不放。这在某种程度上可能令人恐惧。另一方面，这也可以带来巨大的解脱，因为我们给自己讲了太多关于我们是谁、我们应该成为什么样的人以及世界应该是什么样子的故事。当我们真正了解无常的真相时，我们就会放下很多这些执着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would rate the concept of impermanence as number one, as the greatest hit of Zen Buddhism. Basically, the idea of everything constantly changing means that Bob has no fixed self or identity. Bob is always fluid. I am always in the process of change, and I'm always connected with other people and other things in the world that are themselves changing. And so there's nothing fixed. There's nothing to hold onto in the deepest sense. And that on the one hand, that can be scary. On the other hand, it can be an enormous relief because we tell ourselves so many stories about who we are and who we're supposed to be and how the world is supposed to be. And when we really know the truth of impermanence, we let a lot of that go.</p>
</details>

无常帮助我们理解的一件事是我们所有经验的潮起潮落。因此，当我们真正明白一切事物都会生起然后消逝时，这意味着我对这个人的恼怒只是暂时的。无论如何，它都不会保持不变。你所要做的就是足够长时间地观察一种情绪，你就会看到它会改变。当我们在不愉快的关系、不愉快的争吵或与他人发生冲突时，这会很有帮助，因为我们可以依靠这种觉知：它不会永远是这种感觉。事实上，一个小时后，肯定不是一天后或一周后，它可能就不会是这种感觉了。保持这种无常的长期视角，可以在很大程度上让我们在任何特定时刻，更接受关系中的起起伏伏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things that impermanence helps us understand is the ebb and flow of all of our experience. So when we really get that everything arises and then passes away, that means that my annoyance at this other person is only temporary. It's not going to stay the same no matter what. All you have to do is watch an emotion for long enough, and you'll see that it changes. That's helpful when we're caught in the middle of some unhappy relationship, some unhappy argument or something going on with another person where we can fall back on that awareness that it is not gonna feel this way forever. In fact, it's probably not gonna feel this way an hour from now, certainly not a day from now or a week from now. And keeping that long-term perspective of impermanence can go a long way to make us feel more accepting of the ups and downs of a relationship in any given moment.</p>
</details>

### 四圣谛与减轻痛苦

**四圣谛**（Four Noble Truths: 佛教的基本教义，阐述了苦、集、灭、道的真理）也许是佛陀最标志性的教义。它们以许多不同的方式被翻译，但都始于佛教的声明：生命是痛苦的，或者我认为更好的翻译是，生命是不尽如人意的，生活中总有我们不喜欢的地方，这是生命不可避免的一部分。然后第二个教义是，痛苦的根源是已知的，它是贪婪、厌恶或仇恨以及无明，痛苦可以被解除。这是第三个真理。第四个真理是，有一种生活方式，佛陀称之为**八正道**（eightfold path: 佛教修行方法，旨在消除痛苦，达到涅槃），可以帮助解除生命中的所有这些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The four noble truths are perhaps the most iconic teachings of the Buddha. They're translated in many different ways, but they start with the Buddhist statement that life is suffering or better translated I think, life is unsatisfactory, that there are always aspects to life that we don't like, and that that's an inevitable part of being alive. And then the second teaching is that the source of suffering is known, that it is greed and aversion or hatred and ignorance that suffering can be relieved. That's the third truth. And the fourth truth is that there is a way of life that the Buddha called the eightfold path that can help relieve all this suffering in life.</p>
</details>

人们常说佛陀教导我们可以达到一个不再受苦的境界。**禅宗**（Zen）不这样教导。禅宗不教导任何人最终会达到一个我们永远不会感到痛苦、永远不会感到担忧或不快乐的境界。相反，我们能做的是学会与生活中不尽如人意之处共处，学会与不快乐共处，甚至以一种使其更易于忍受的方式与痛苦共处，以一种不会叠加**附加痛苦**（optional suffering: 指因对痛苦的抗拒、评判或所讲述的故事而产生的额外痛苦）的方式。附加痛苦就是我们讲述的关于这一切多么不公平的故事。例如，我背痛，或者今天感冒是多么不公平，所有这些事情都是可以处理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's often said that the Buddha was teaching that you could get to a point where you never suffer anymore. Zen does not teach that. Zen does not teach that anybody finally arrives at a place where we don't ever feel pain, where we don't ever feel worry or unhappiness. Rather, what we can do is learn to be with what's unsatisfactory in life, learn to be with unhappiness, even be with pain in a way that makes it more bearable, in a way that doesn't layer on optional suffering. The optional suffering being the stories we tell about how unfair it all is. For example, that I have back pain or how unfair it is that I've got a cold today, that all of these things are workable.</p>
</details>

但禅宗教导，生活中的不满足总是存在的，我们确实有偏好，我们永远不会完全放弃我们的偏好，但我们能做的是学会不那么紧地**执着**（attachment: 佛教术语，指对事物或观念的强烈依恋和固守）于我们的偏好。换句话说，就是少一些坚持世界必须以某种方式存在。想想在关系中，我们多么努力地坚持别人必须以我们希望的方式存在，如果我们放下这种执着，我们就会少受多少痛苦。我们只是假设那个人被允许以他们本来的样子出现在世界上，而我们也被允许以我们本来的样子出现在世界上。所以，在禅宗中，减轻痛苦的理念是能够面对痛苦，审视它，并以一种不那么痛苦的方式与它共存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Zen teaches that unsatisfactoriness is always there in life, and that we do have preferences that we're never going to completely give up our preferences, but that what we can do is learn to cling less tightly to our preferences. In other words, to insist less that the world be a certain way. I mean, think about in relationships how much we try to insist that someone else be a certain way that we want them to be, and how much less we suffer if we let that go. And just assume that that person is allowed to show up in the world as they are, and we are allowed to show up in the world as we are. So this idea of relieving suffering is in Zen, the idea of being able to face towards suffering, looking at it and living with it in a way that hurts less.</p>
</details>

### 初心与正念的智慧

佛教谈论**执着**（attachment）的理念。它指的不是我们通常认为的依恋，比如仅仅与某人或某物连接。它实际上是指紧紧抓住对某物的固定看法。因此，我执着于存在一种真正的宗教，或一个真正的政党，或任何一种真正的东西的观念。禅宗中有一个关于**初心**（beginner's mind: 禅宗概念，指以开放、无执着的心态看待事物，如同初学者一般）的精彩教诲。初心是指我们放下所有我们自以为是的故事，那些我们确信自己已经成为生活专家和自我专家的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buddhism talks about the idea of attachment. And it doesn't mean attachment in the way we normally think of it, like just being connected to somebody or something. It's really about holding on tightly to a fixed view of something. So I'm attached to the idea that there's one true religion or one true political party, or one true anything. There's a wonderful teaching in Zen about beginner's mind. Beginner's mind being the idea that we let go of all the stories we tell ourselves that we're so sure of that, you know, we become an expert in life and an expert in ourself.</p>
</details>

铃木俊隆（Shunryū Suzuki）是一位禅宗大师，他有一句我非常喜欢的话。他说：“在初心之中，有许多可能性。在专家之心之中，可能性很少。”他的意思是，当我们能够对许多可能性保持开放，而不是将一切都缩小范围，并且如此确信自己知道一切时，我们就会对惊喜、对体验自己和世界的新方式保持开放，这会让我们比所谓的专家少受很多痛苦。而且我年纪越大，人们称我为专家越多，我就越意识到自己知之甚少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shunryū Suzuki was a Zen master who had a saying that I love. He said, in the beginner's mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind, there are few. And what he meant by that is when we can remain open to many possibilities rather than narrowing everything down and being so sure that we know what's what, that we become open to surprise, open to new ways of experiencing ourselves and the world that make us suffer a great deal less than when we are so-called experts. And the older I get and the more people call me an expert, the more aware I am of how little I know.</p>
</details>

拥有**初心**（beginner's mind）在人际关系中非常有帮助，因为它让我们保持好奇心。它让我们能够说：“好吧，关于这个人，我还有很多不了解的地方。让我仔细观察。让我注意我以前没有发现的关于这个人的地方。让我找到与这个人互动的新方式。”这会给关系带来一种新鲜感和开放性，否则关系很容易变得陈旧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having a beginner's mind really helps in relationships because it allows us to be curious. It allows us to say, okay, there's so much I don't know about this person. Let me watch closely. Let me notice what I haven't seen before about this person. Let me find new ways to interact with this person. And that brings a kind of freshness and openness to relationships that can otherwise easily get stale.</p>
</details>

我所知道的**正念**（mindfulness: 佛教修行方法，指有意识地、不带评判地关注当下体验）的最佳定义很简单：在当下不带评判地关注。所以，它实际上只是关注当下的一切。对我来说，现在就是与你交谈。就是椅子靠在我背上的感觉。就是空气拂过我皮肤的感觉。就是我声音在我脑海中回荡的声音，所有这些。并且简单地对当下存在的所有体验保持开放，而不仅仅是我脑海中那些小小的想法。因此，正念要求我们更加广阔，将我们的意识从思考扩展到世界上发生的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The best definition I know of mindfulness is simple. It's paying attention in the present moment without judgment. So it's really just paying attention to whatever's here. So right now, for me, that's talking with you. That's the feel of the chair on my back. It's the feel of the air on my skin. It's the sound of my voice, kind of reverberating in my head, all of those things. And simply being open to all the experiences that are here right now, not just the little thoughts going on in my head. And so mindfulness asks us to be more expansive, to open our awareness beyond thinking to everything going on in the world.</p>
</details>

你现在就可以开始练习。你可以在此刻通过简单地关注所有正在触及你的刺激来练习你的正念。它可能是你的心跳，可能是你的呼吸，可能是房间里风扇的声音，外面的交通，任何事物。并且简单地让自己保持开放，接受当下的一切。你可以在任何时刻这样做。你可以在开会时这样做。你可以在机场等飞机时这样做。你可以在开车时这样做。事实上，在开车时保持正念会非常有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can work on it right now. You can work on your mindfulness right this moment by simply paying attention to whatever stimuli are reaching you. It might be your heartbeat, it might be your breath, it might be the sound of the fan in the room, the traffic outside, anything. And simply letting yourself be open and receive whatever is here right now. And you can do that in any moment. You can do that when you're sitting in a meeting. You can do that when you're waiting for an airplane at the airport. You can do that when you're driving your car. In fact, being mindful could be really useful when you're driving your car.</p>
</details>

当我们真正知道受苦、痛苦、不快乐、恐惧是什么感觉时，我们就能更好地分辨什么是来自我内心，什么是来自外部。很多时候我们混淆了这两者。我回到家，没有意识到我的膝盖实际上很痛，然后我发现自己对伴侣更加恼火。因此，真正**正念**（mindful）地对待自己的经历所做的一件事是，它让我不太可能将发生在我身上的事情归咎于他人。当我们在谈论关系中的和谐时，这会非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we really know what it feels like to suffer, to be in pain, to be unhappy, to be scared, we're better at knowing what's coming from inside from me and what's coming from outside. Many times we mistake those two. I come home and I don't realize that actually my knee hurts and I find myself more irritated at my partner. And so one of the things that being really mindful about my own experience does is it makes me a little less likely to blame other people for what's going on in me. And that can be hugely helpful when we talk about harmony in relationships.</p>
</details>

另一种通过正念对待我的痛苦来帮助我建立关系的方式是，它帮助我意识到，哦，每个人都以这种方式受苦。如果我在身体不适时更容易烦躁，那一定意味着每个人，或者大多数人在身体不适时都会更容易烦躁。它让我记住在别人身体不适时要体谅他们，对吗？而不是仅仅因为他们对我有点不耐烦而感到恼火。所以，了解自己的不适以及我如何处理它，可以在同情他人方面提供巨大的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other way that being mindful about my suffering can help in my relationships is it helps me realize, oh, everybody suffers in this way. If I'm more irritable when I'm not feeling well, that must mean that everybody's more irritable, or most people are when they're not feeling well. And it allows me to remember to cut people's slack when they're not feeling well, right? Instead of just being annoyed that they're a little short with me. So there are these ways that knowing about my own discomfort and what I do with it can be a huge help in being empathic toward other people.</p>
</details>

佛教中有一个**慈悲心**（meta loving kindness: 佛教中培养对一切众生慈爱、友善之心的修行）的概念，有几种不同的说法。一种是我们能够培养的明确技能。你可以进行慈悲心冥想，在那里你思考另一个人，并对那个人进行冥想，然后对自己说：“愿你平安，愿你快乐，愿你内心平静。”你一遍又一遍地这样做，你就会对那个人产生不同的感受，包括对那些你不太喜欢或你生气的人。所以，这是一种积极培养技能的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a concept of meta loving kindness in Buddhism, and there are a couple of different ways that it's talked about. One is an explicit skill that we can cultivate. You can do a loving kindness meditation where you think about another person and you meditate on that other person, and you say to yourself, may you be peaceful, may you be happy, may you be at peace. And you do that over and over again, and you come to feel differently about the other person, including about people you don't like very much or you're angry at. So there's that way of actively cultivating a skill.</p>
</details>

还有另一种方式，就是通过越来越意识到自己的痛苦、自己的焦虑、愤怒的想法、自己的困难。因为当我们通过冥想等方式越来越意识到这些时，我们就会对他人产生更多的同情心。自然而然地，那种慈悲心就会产生，当我们看到一个愤怒的人时，我们会说：“哦，我不知道那个人是不是过得很糟糕”，而不是立即以自己的愤怒做出反应。这是一种培养慈悲心的不同方式。但它通过冥想相当可靠地发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's another way, which is simply by becoming more and more aware of your own pain, your own anxious, angry thoughts, your own difficulties. Because what happens when we become more aware of that through meditation, for example, is that we become much more empathic toward other people. And naturally that kind of loving kindness arises where we see an angry person and say, oh, I wonder if that person is having a terrible day, rather than immediately reacting with our own anger. That's a different way to cultivate loving kindness. But it happens pretty reliably through meditation.</p>
</details>

### 开悟：一种活动而非永久状态

关于**开悟**（enlightenment: 佛教修行目标，指彻底觉醒，洞察生命真相，摆脱无明和痛苦）有很多讨论。这是一个在佛教以及其他精神传统中都非常古老的概念。它可以意味着许多不同的事情。但在我的禅宗传统中，它实际上指的是觉醒生命的真相，以及生命中我们通常看不到的一些令人惊讶的方面。最具体地说，是万物的相互关联性，万物的本质统一性。是的，在某个层面上，一切事物都独立存在。我独立于你存在，这张椅子独立于我存在。但在最深层面上，它们都不是独立的。所有一切都完全相互关联并不断变化。这就是觉醒生命的真相。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of talk about enlightenment. It's a concept that's very old in Buddhism, but also in other spiritual traditions. And it can mean so many different things. But in my Zen tradition, it really refers to waking up to the truth of what life is and to some of the surprising aspects of life that we don't normally see. Most specifically, the interconnectedness of everything, the essential oneness of everything. That yes, on one level, everything exists separately. I exist separately from you, and this chair exists separately from me. And at the deepest level, none of it is separate. All of it is completely interconnected and always changing. That is awakening to the truth of life.</p>
</details>

现在，开悟常常被认为是我们能够“得到”的东西。事实上，你可以读到一些人长时间冥想的记载，有时是在闭关期间，他们基本上都会有这些惊人的体验。有时他们感觉像是灵魂出窍的体验，他们可以详细描述这些体验是什么样的。有时人们会觉得，如果我有了这些体验，那么我就开悟了。如果我曾经有过这些体验，我希望它们回来。所以我想努力让它们再次回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, enlightenment is often held out as a thing that we can get. And in fact, you can read accounts of people sitting in long periods of meditation, sometimes on retreats, where they essentially have these amazing experiences. Sometimes they feel like out of body experiences and they can write elaborate descriptions of what these are like. And sometimes people feel like, well, if I just have those experiences, then I'm enlightened. And if I had those experiences once, I want them back. So I want to try to get them back again.</p>
</details>

我们在禅宗中教导，这实际上是危险的。没有人能一直生活在一种不寻常的、改变了的状态中。我们大多数人从未如此。如果我们有不寻常的体验，那也是非常短暂的，例如，完全相互关联和统一的体验是无法持久的。事实上，一位禅宗老师对那些有过开悟体验的人进行了一系列访谈，并将它们整理成一本书。这本书的标题是《狂喜之后，是洗衣》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we teach in Zen is that that's actually dangerous. That nobody lives in a kind of unusual altered state all the time. Most of us never do. And if we have unusual experiences, it's very brief, an experience of, for example, complete interconnectedness and oneness cannot last. In fact, one Zen teacher did a set of interviews with people who had had enlightenment experiences, and he put them into a book. And the title of the book was "After The Ecstasy, The Laundry."</p>
</details>

他的意思是，无论我们有过多么不寻常的觉醒或开悟体验，我们总是会回到需要洗衣服、需要刷牙、需要上班的日常生活中。生活就是这样。所以，尽管我们大多数人，包括我自己，都希望有一种方法可以开悟并保持这种状态，达到一个永远幸福、永不痛苦的境界，但我从未遇到过地球上任何一个人达到那个境界。禅宗教导那是不可能的。事实上，我们会在更觉醒和不那么觉醒的状态之间来回切换，无论你作为一名精神修行者有多么进化，你都会有因为一些愚蠢的事情而完全心烦意乱的时候，就像我们所说的“被迷惑”的时候。然后你又会回到更清晰地看待生活的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what he meant by that was that no matter what kind of unusual we might have of waking up of enlightenment, we always go back to needing to do the laundry and needing to brush our teeth and needing to go to work. That that is just how life is. So, although most of us, myself included, wish that there were a way to get enlightened and stay that way, to get to a place where it's always blissful and we never suffer, I have never met a human being on this earth who gets to that place. And Zen teaching is that that's not possible. That in fact, we move in and out of states of being more awakened or less awakened, that no matter how evolved you are as a spiritual practitioner, you're gonna have times when you're just all upset about stupid stuff, when you're just deluded, as we say. And then you move back into periods where you see life more clearly.</p>
</details>

这对我来说很重要，因为如果你遇到那些自称是最终开悟的人，要非常警惕。对任何声称自己是完美进化的、开悟的人都要非常警惕。20世纪美国一位非常重要的禅宗老师铃木俊隆（Shunryū Suzuki）曾有名言：“没有开悟的人，只有开悟的活动。”他的意思是，没有人是最终完全和永远开悟的。只有当下的活动。所以，如果我做了一些善良的事情，关注了我与万物的相互关联性，那就是开悟的活动；如果我做了一些自私的事情，如果我做了一些破坏地球的事情，那就是未开悟的活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's important for me because if you meet people who hold themselves out as an ultimately enlightened person, be very suspicious of that. Be very suspicious of anybody who claims to be a perfectly evolved, enlightened human being. Shunryū Suzuki, a very important Zen teacher in the United States in the 20th century was famous for saying that there's no such thing as an enlightened person. There is only enlightened activity. And what he meant by that was that no person is finally fully and forever enlightened. There is only this moment's activity.</p>
</details>

因此，追求**开悟**（enlightenment）的理念实际上不是追求一个自我完善的项目。它是在每个当下尽可能地保持慈悲心，在生命中尽可能多的时刻追求开悟的活动。这才是目标。关于开悟的一个事实是，它不可能是永久的。如果我们真正了解**无常**（impermanence）的真相，那么当其他一切都不是永久的时候，开悟又怎么会是永久的呢？所以很明显，开悟也必须像其他一切事物一样来来去去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I do something that is kind, that pays attention to my interconnectedness with everyone and everything, that is enlightened activity, if I do something that's selfish, if I do something that destroys the planet, that is unenlightened activity. And so the idea of pursuing enlightenment really is not pursuing a self-improvement project. It's pursuing a way to be as compassionate as I can in each moment, to pursue enlightened activity in as many moments as I can string together in my life. That's the goal. One fact about enlightenment is that it can't be permanent. If we really know the truth of impermanence, then why would enlightenment be permanent when everything else is not?</p>
</details>

追求开悟是一个自我完善的项目。而在我的禅宗传统中，我们谈论的是，我们不想开始一个自我完善的项目。我们想要努力在世界上实现更大的善良与和谐，而不是迷失在孤立的、永久的自我的妄想中。所以，我们真正想要努力的是在世界上的开悟活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So clearly, enlightenment has to come and go just like everything else. Striving for enlightenment is a self-improvement project. And what we talk about in my Zen tradition is that we don't want to embark on a self-improvement project. We want to strive for greater kindness and harmony in the world, rather than being lost in the delusion of an isolated permanent self. And so really what we wanna strive for is enlightened activity in the world.</p>
