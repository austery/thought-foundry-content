### 加拿大孤独感现状

**主持人**: **Kate Mulligan**是一位公共卫生学院的副教授，也是**加拿大社会处方研究所**的创始科学总监。很高兴你能来参加节目。你最近怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Kate Mulligan is an associate professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and the founding scientific director of the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing. Kate, great to have you on the program. How are you doing?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 非常感谢你，Dan。我感觉非常好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Thanks so much, Dan. I'm doing really well. How are you?

</details>

**主持人**: 我很好。我们来聊聊关于孤独感的数据吧。在加拿大，情况是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm doing great. Let's talk about the data that talks about loneliness. What does it show here in Canada?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 嗯，至少有**1/5的加拿大人**正在经历孤独感，而**1/4**正在经历**精神疾病**或心理健康方面的挑战。有时这两者可能密切相关。对于**年轻人**来说，这些比例更高。我们知道这部分是因为他们正处于人生的一个非常重要的 formative（形成期）阶段，有很多变化正在发生，但同时也是因为当前世界正处于一个形成期和变化期，充满了不确定性和对他们现在及未来角色的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, at least 1 in 5 Canadians is experiencing loneliness and 1 in 4 is is experiencing mental illness or mental health challenges. And sometimes those can be really correlated. For young people, the rates are higher than average. And we know that that's partly because they're at a really formative time in their lives, with much change going on, but also a formative and changing time in the world right now, with a lot of precarity and a lot of uncertainty about what their roles are now and what they might be in the future.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想更深入地探讨一下这方面的人口统计学特征。我们经常听到关于孤独感疫情尤其影响年轻男性的说法，我们是否更有可能成为孤独的男性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to dig a little bit deeper into the demographics of it. We hear a lot about loneliness epidemic affecting young men specifically, are we more likely to be lonely men?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 不。现实情况是，**年轻女性**和**年轻男性**都在经历社会孤立和孤独感。事实上，许多年轻女性正在经历**焦虑**和**抑郁**。但这些经历的后果因性别而异，所以年轻女性仍然更有可能从医疗系统中寻求社会支持或健康帮助，而年轻男性则不太可能这样做。我们也知道，男性更有可能将这些经历转化为**物质滥用**、**暴力**，甚至**自杀**，在加拿大的自杀事件中，约有75%是男性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: No. The reality is that young women and young men are both experiencing social isolation and loneliness. And in fact, many more young women are experiencing anxiety and depression. But the consequences of those experiences are quite different by gender, so young women are still more likely to seek social support or health help from health systems, whereas young men are less likely to do so. And we also know that men are more likely to channel some of these experiences into things like substance use, violence, and even suicide completion, which is at about 75% of suicides in Canada, are from from men.

</details>

### 孤独感的根源

**主持人**: 你在之前的回答中略微提到了这一点。你提到的导致他们孤独感的具体原因是什么？我的意思是，如果我们看看过去几年，我们可以指出一些事情。但是的，让我们来分析一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Let's you alluded to it a little bit in your previous answer. Are there particular causes for their loneliness you had mentioned? I mean, there's a lot of if we look at sort of the last couple of years, we can point to a few things. But yeah, let's break it down.

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 是的。所以孤独感不是个人的失败。这是一个**政策问题**。它源于我们在这个世界为自己创造的结构。在**COVID**之前，谈论孤独感、社会脱节和缺乏社会凝聚力作为健康问题对我来说有点难。然后在大流行期间，我们都亲身体验了生活在更孤立环境中的感觉，而作为一个社会，我们在社会参与和互动水平上，至今仍未完全恢复到那个时期之前的水平。当然，这只是驱动因素之一。我们社区的参与和支持程度不如以往，比如在信仰社群或服务俱乐部中。年轻人使用屏幕的时间更多，他们也越来越多地转向**AI聊天机器人**来寻求心理健康和社会挑战的帮助，而不是向其他人寻求。所以这种情况似乎在加速。有许多不同的原因和诱因，但真正隐藏在所有这些之下的一个最重要因素是，那些年轻人以及许多其他年龄段的人都有一种“**我们不重要**”的感觉。我们在**加拿大医疗保健系统**中也能看到这一点，例如，当我们去预约时，感觉自己可能是在强加，或者我们认为自己可能有一些需求，因为我们知道我们的医疗系统多么紧张和压力重重，并且这是我们共同承担的。但这加剧了一种官僚式的冷漠，确实对我们产生了巨大影响。而对于年轻人，在他们人生的那个形成期，他们希望感觉自己很重要。他们希望感觉自己对这个社会做出了贡献。他们希望感觉自己对自己的生活有一定的能力和掌控力，有一定的独立性，以及一些能够带来改变的选择。这些是我们改变对这些年轻人（包括年轻男性）的结构性支持的根本原因，让他们拥有归属感和价值感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Yeah. So loneliness is it's not an individual failing. It's a policy problem. And it comes from the structures that we've created for ourselves in this world. It used to be a bit of a tough sell for me to talk about loneliness and social disconnection and lack of social cohesion as health issues prior to Covid and then during the pandemic, we all experienced for ourselves what it is like to really live in more socially isolated circumstances, and we've still never really fully recovered as a society in terms of the level of social participation and interaction that we had prior to that time. And of course, that's only just one of the drivers. We don't have the same levels of community engagement and support that we once had in things like faith communities or service clubs. We have a lot more use of screen time by young people, who are also increasingly turning to things like AI chatbots instead of other humans for help with their mental health and social challenges. So it seems to be accelerating. There are a number of different reasons and causes, but really one of the most important underlying factors beneath all of those is the feeling amongst those young people and many people of other ages as well, that we don't matter. And we see this in Canadian healthcare systems, for example, when we sort of feel like maybe we're imposing when we go for an appointment or we think we might have something of a need because we know how strained and stressed our health system is and that it's something shared between us. But that adds up to a level of sort of bureaucratic indifference that really, really impacts us. And for young people, at that formative time in their lives, they want to feel that they matter. They want to feel that they're making a contribution to the to this society. They want to feel that they have some competence and mastery over their own lives and some independence and some choices that are going to make a difference for themselves. Those are those underlying reasons that we need to change some of our structural supports for these young people, including young men, to give them a place of belonging and mattering. Again.

### 公共健康视角

**主持人**: 鉴于此，我想从公共卫生的角度来看。人们未能维持亲密联系、人际关系对社会造成的损害是什么？这种“涓滴效应”看起来是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: With that, I want to put the public health lens on here. How are people's failures to maintain close connections, relationships hurting society? What is the trickle down effect look like?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 我认为有几个方面。首先，**医疗保健成本增加**。我们开始去看医生，因为我们缺乏其他可以表达社会需求的地方。我们也去看医生，因为我们的社会需求正在我们体内以生理方式表现出来。因此，我们有更高的死亡率，所有原因的死亡率都因长期的、不断增长的孤独感和社会脱节而增加。我们是生物体，我们注定要与他人在一起。我们有更高的心理健康障碍发生率，如我之前提到的，但也有更高的身体健康挑战发生率，如心脏病、中风。许多类型的脑部疾病，以及其他由这种孤独感引起或加剧的挑战。所以它体现在我们的身体里，它体现在我们的医疗系统中，我们可以治疗它，并且可以在其他地方更有效地预防它。它也体现在我们缺乏一种**能动性**，即我们作为邻居、在我们自己的社区、在我们自己的社会中照顾彼此的能力，而不再需要依赖大型外部机构来获得那些曾经存在于社区中的基本支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: I think there are a few things. I mean, one, there are increased healthcare costs. So we start going to our health care providers because we lack other places to go to express our social needs. We also go because our social needs are being literally expressed in our bodies. So we have higher rates of all cause mortality, all reasons for death that are that because of extended and growing loneliness and social disconnection, we're biological creatures. We are meant to be around other people. We have higher rates of these mental health disorders, as I've mentioned, but also higher rates of physical health challenges, heart attack, stroke. Many kinds of brain disorders, and other challenges that are either caused or exacerbated by this loneliness. So it's showing up in our bodies, it's showing up in our health systems, and we can treat it, and we can prevent it much more effectively in other places. It's also showing up in our lack of sense of agency that we can take care of one another as neighbours, in our own communities, in our own societies, that we don't need to rely on big external institutions for some of those basic supports that used to just be in community.

### 社交处方介入

**主持人**: 好的，让我们来谈谈那些支持。你是**加拿大社会处方研究所**的创始科学总监。你做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk about some of those supports. You are the founding scientific director of the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing. What do you do?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 嗯，我寻找那些将医疗保健和社会问题联系起来的良好实践，并努力将它们呈现出来并推广到全国乃至全世界，使它们成为我们常规医疗保健系统和常规政府实践的一部分。到目前为止，看到**社交处方**在全国范围内不断发展，真是令人惊叹。我们从2018年和2019年在安大略省的11个社区卫生中心试点项目开始。现在，全国每个省份都在开展社交处方，很多是政府资助的，但并非总是如此。我工作的一个重要部分是帮助建立证据基础，帮助那些创新者找到彼此，并帮助记录他们的故事，以便我们可以使之成为我们医疗保健系统的一个常规部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, I look for good practices where people are connecting these health care and social issues, and I try to surface them and share them around the country and the world to make them part of our regular health care system and our regular government practice. And so far, it's been amazing to see the growth of social prescribing all across the country. We started with a pilot project in 11 community health centres all across Ontario back in 2018 and 2019. We now have social prescribing happening in every single province across the country, often government funded, but not always so. A big part of what I'm doing is helping to build the evidence base, helping those innovators to find one another and helping to get their story on the record so that we can make this a regular part of our health system.

</details>

### 预防激进化

**主持人**: 我们正在进行的对话之一，尤其是在本期节目中，是关于孤独感与**激进化**、**极端主义**之间的联系。我很好奇，它能帮助预防激进化吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: One of the conversations that we're having, especially on this episode, is sort of the connection from loneliness to radicalization, extremism. I'm curious, could it help prevent radicalization?

</details>

**Kate Mulligan**: 嗯，我认为是的，可以。所以我们关注的社交处方的一些内容是，再次强调，进行干预，让人们感觉自己很重要，而对年轻人进行干预意味着一生的预防。对，我们可以进行上游干预，帮助年轻男性保持参与社区、就业以及他们自身的健康和关怀，从而节省数百万美元的上游医疗成本，但也增加社会和经济参与，成为日常生活的一部分，这才是真正重要的。这实际上是关于让人们重新参与社区，这样我们就能接触到他们，你知道，年轻男性会有一种不被重视的感觉。他们将有两个选择。他们可以从这种充满希望的、面对面的、亲身实践的愿景中获得信息，或者他们可以从算法中获得信息，算法会将他们引向一条更黑暗的道路，但同时也为他们提供一种能动感和归属感。而我一直在谈论的许多相同因素也在起作用。所以我们确实需要进行干预。我们可以及早进行干预，并且在省和全国各地都有许多很好的例子正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, I do think so, yes. So some of the things that we focus on in social prescribing are around, again, intervening so that people feel that they matter, and intervening for young people means a lifetime of prevention. Right. We can intervene upstream and help young men stay engaged in their communities, in their employment and in their own sense of health and care, saving millions of dollars in those upstream health costs, but also in increased social and economic participation, being part of everyday life, which is really underlying all of this, what it's really about getting people back engaged into community so we can get to them, you know, younger men feeling that sense of not mattering. They're going to have two options. They can hear from this hopeful, in-person, hands on vision, or they can hear from the algorithm that takes them to a much darker path, but also offers them a sense of agency and a sense of belonging. And many of those same factors that I've been talking about. So we do need to intervene. We can intervene earlier, and there are many good examples of this happening all across the province and the country.

</details>

### 实践案例

**Kate Mulligan**: 所以，例如，在**斯图尔特湖（Sturgeon Lake）**，有针对年轻**原住民男性**的项目，让他们重新连接到文化上适宜的男子气概、身份和传承，从而及早与他们的文化建立联系。我们有跨省的以黑人社群为中心的社交处方项目，正在帮助年轻的黑人男性以及黑人社群的其他成员，运用**非洲中心原则**来支撑他们的集体和个人健康。全省各地都在发生许多其他例子，但我们真正需要做的是将它们编织成一个更系统的整体，而这正是我们现在正在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: So in Sturgeon Lake, for example, there are programs for young Indigenous men to reconnect with culturally appropriate sense of masculinity and identity and heritage early on to connect with their culture. We've got black focused social prescribing programs across the province that are helping young black men, and other members of the black community use Afrocentric principles to underpin their collective and individual health. Many other examples are happening all across the province, but what we really need to do is knit those together into more of a system, and that's what we're on our way to doing now.

</details>

**主持人**: 这听起来非常有希望，Kate。我非常感谢你在节目中的时间。祝你一切顺利，感谢你的见解。
