### 女性健康与经济的深度关联

您正在收听《(MIS)Treated》节目，我是Nam Kiwanuka。去年十月，**McKenzie健康研究所**（McKenzie Health Institute: 一家致力于健康研究和分析的机构）发布了一项分析报告，指出女性健康与职场生产力之间存在深刻的相互关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're listening to mistreated. I'm Nam Kiwanuka. Back in October, the McKenzie Health Institute published an analysis that showed how women's health and productivity in the workplace [music] are quote deeply interconnected.</p>
</details>

该报告审视了解决女性健康差距将如何惠及加拿大经济，尤其是在所谓的**比基尼健康状况**（Bikini Conditions: 指女性生殖健康和乳腺健康等特定部位的健康问题，常被误认为是女性健康的全部）之外的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It examined how addressing the gaps in women's health would benefit the Canadian economy, especially outside of so-called bikini [music] conditions.</p>
</details>

报告指出：“在全球范围内，性健康、生殖健康以及母婴儿童健康仅占女性健康负担的5%。然而，当我们审视加拿大人的健康状况时，前十大健康问题中有一半以上对女性的影响不同或更为严重。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The report states, quote, globally, sexual and reproductive health and maternal, [music] newborn, and child health account for only 5% of the women's health burden. But when you look at the health of Canadians, more than half of the top 10 health [music] issues impact women differently or disproportionately.</p>
</details>

此外，研究的缺乏导致女性的健康结果更差。看到这些数据令人震惊。为了将所有这些信息置于语境中，我采访了报告的作者之一Marani Belo，她表示这只是解决问题的一个起点，未来仍有大量工作要做。请听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a lack of research leads to worse [music] health outcomes for women. It's startling to see this data. So to put it all into context, [music] I spoke with one of the reports authors, Marie Renee Beaou, who says this is a starting point to address the problem, [music] but there's a lot of work still to be done. Take a listen.</p>
</details>

### 女性健康：加拿大经济的关键驱动力

Nam Kiwanuka: Marani Renee，欢迎来到播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Marie Renee, welcome to the podcast.</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 谢谢，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Thank you. It's such a pleasure to be here. Nam,</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 您能介绍一下自己和您的工作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> could you please introduce yourself and what it is that you do?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 当然。我是Marani Belo医生，是McKenzie公司在加拿大的合伙人，同时也是一名执业急诊医生，并且是McKenzie报告《弥合加拿大女性健康差距：370亿加元的机遇》的合著者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely. I'm Dr. Marani Belo. I'm a partner with McKenzie Company here in Canada and I'm also a practicing emergency physician and co-author of Mckenzie's Closing the Women's Health Gap in Canada, a $ 37 billion opportunity.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 看到这份报告我非常兴奋。在与许多女性交流后，我发现她们普遍有一种个人失败感，觉得自己无法克服健康挑战，并且真实地担心如果在职场谈论这些问题会失去工作机会。那么，加拿大女性的健康状况是如何与经济挂钩的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was so excited to see this report. Um, after speaking to so many women, there's this feeling of personal failure of not being able to push through health challenges and there there is a real fear of losing work opportunities. If you speak about these issues in the workplace, um, how is the health of women in Canada tied to the economy?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 这非常关键，Nam，您开始讨论的方式也很好。我想说，我一直被祖母的故事所感动，她讲述了争取投票权的故事；我的母亲则进入了职场，并真正推动我们实现经济和职业独立。在加拿大，我们很幸运，女性拥有工作的特权。但现在很清楚，如果我们想推动性别平等议程，就绝对需要讨论女性健康。这意味着要确保我们所有人都能获得最好的医疗服务，并获得最有效的治疗，从而为我们自身释放健康潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's so critical and naming the way you're starting the discussion. I just want to say I was always moved by my grandmother who would tell stories of getting the right to vote and my mother, you know, entering the working profession and really pushing for us to have financial and professional independence. And we are lucky in Canada, we have the privilege to work as women. But it's very clear now that if we want to push the gender parity agenda, we absolutely need to discuss women's health. And that means making sure that all of us have access to the best care and have access to the most efficacious treatment to be able to unlock health for us.</p>
</details>

### 报告发现：女性健康差距的真相

Nam Kiwanuka: 报告发现了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What did the report find?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 嗯，我希望能带来好消息。我带来的消息肯定需要采取行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I wish I could bring good news. I certainly bring news that calls for action.</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 我们发现的第一件事是，事实上，在加拿大，被定义为性健康和生殖健康的女性健康问题，仅占我们健康差距的不到5%。所以，当我们想到女性，有些人会用“比基尼健康”这个词，但这只是导致差距的一小部分。实际上，癌症、心血管疾病以及大脑和心理健康才是影响大多数加拿大女性的主要因素。如果我们能够解决这些主要健康问题，就能为所有加拿大女性每年多带来一整周的健康生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the first thing that we found is that in fact women's health issues defined as sexual and reproductive health are less than 5% of our gap in Canada. So when we think of women and you know some people will coin bikini health um that's a really small part of what drives the gap. In fact, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain and mental health are really what impacts most Canadian women. And if we were able to solve the top conditions, it could give back a full week of health for all Canadian women.</p>
</details>

请仔细思考一下：对于两千多万加拿大女性来说，如果我们能够解决这种性别差距，我们所有人一生中每年都能多享受一周的健康生活。这对整个加拿大来说都至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let that sink in. for the 20 plus million Canadian women if we were able to address this gender gap, all of us could live across our lifespan one more week of health every year. So that is really critical for Canadian as a whole.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 您提到了“比基尼健康状况”，因为谈到女性健康，我们大多数人可能认为它只与乳房或生殖区域有关，但我们忽略了所有其他状况。您的报告实际上强调，加拿大女性在健康状况不佳上花费的时间比男性多24%。这个数字让我非常震惊，难以理解。您能多谈谈这一点吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you mentioned the bikini bikini conditions because when it comes to women's health, we I think most of us understand that oh, it has to do with like the breast area or the reproductive area, but then we're missing out all of these other conditions. And your report actually highlights that women in Canada spend 24% more time in poor health than men. Um, that was a shocking statistic for me to try to wrap my head around. Could you talk a little bit more about that?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 当然，坦率地说，这令人心碎，对吗？当您真正审视这些数字和事实时，我们所有人加起来将以如此规模经历健康状况不佳，这绝对是开创性的。我只想承认，男性经历健康状况不佳同样可怕。但女性将经历更长时间，而且Nam，我想强调一个关键点是，我们常常认为女性寿命更长，因此她们整体健康状况比男性差，但事实是，这会发生在我们整个生命周期中，原因是我们刚才讨论的各种状况：癌症、心血管健康不良结果、抑郁症和焦虑症的发生率，以及荷尔蒙健康、更年期、青春期、慢性盆腔疼痛的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. And frankly, it's heartbreaking, right? When you actually look at the numbers and the facts, the fact that all of us combined will experience poor health at that scale um is absolutely groundbre. And I and I just want to acknowledge the fact that also men experience poor health is terrible. But the fact that women will live it outsides and and one critical point nam that I want to make is you know we often think of that because women lives longer live longer therefore you know we have poor health overall than men but the truth is it will happen all throughout our lifespan due to the different conditions we were discussing a minute ago cancer poor outcomes in cardiovascular health rates of depression anxiety obviously and hormonal health the impact of menopause loss, puberty, chronic pelvic pain.</p>
</details>

许多其他状况会复合叠加，使我们女性以非常不同的方式体验健康，这将对我们贡献社会、贡献家庭、贡献自身生活的能力产生有意义的影响，对吗？这非常关键，需要被讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of these other condition that compound and will make that we as women will experience health very differently and that will have meaningful life on our ability to contribute to society, to contribute to our families, to contribute to our own lives, right? And that is really critical and needs to be talked about.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 当我们谈论女性在健康状况不佳上花费更多时间，以及“女性寿命更长所以她们更健康”的观点时，这又回到了那种个人失败感——你本应克服这些状况。但我们想到，直到1993年在美国，1997年在加拿大，女性才被纳入临床试验。您的报告指出，女性健康和生产力“深度关联”，具体体现在哪些方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I you know when we talk about women spending more time in poor health and this idea that well women live longer so therefore they're more healthy and again going back to that personal failing like you're supposed to push through the conditions but then we think about the fact that women weren't included in clinical trials in uh the US until 1993 in 1997 in Canada um because your report outlines that women's health and productivity are quote deeply connected Ed in what ways?</p>
</details>

### 解决女性健康差距的三大鸿沟：数据、疗效与护理

Marani Belo: 首先，我想说我们的报告强调了三个主要差距：**数据鸿沟**（Data Gap: 指女性健康数据收集不足，或未按性别进行细分分析），这正是您所暗示的，Nam。我们不仅没有收集数据，我们根本不知道。所以，**加拿大卫生部**（Health Canada: 负责维护和改善加拿大居民健康的联邦政府部门）确实建议纳入女性并查看按性别分类的数据，但没有强制执行机制。因此，如今在加拿大，对于研究人员来说，这只是一个“锦上添花”的事情。事实上，我认为美国在强制执行这些事实方面做得更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the first thing I want to say is our report highlights three main gaps. The data gap which is exactly what you're hinting to nam is not only do we have not collected the data we just don't know. So you know Health Canada does recommend to include women and look at sex disagregated data but there are no enforcement mechanisms. So today when researchers in Canada it's a nice to have. Um so how do we think and in fact I would argue the US has done more on enforcing some of those facts. Um so addressing the data gap as a first gap is critical and then there are two other gaps.</p>
</details>

因此，解决数据鸿沟是第一个关键差距，然后还有另外两个差距。第二个差距是**疗效鸿沟**（Efficacy Gap: 指针对女性的治疗方法和药物疗效不足，或未充分考虑女性生理差异）。当我们开始深入研究时，有证据表明哮喘药物可能效果不佳，某些治疗和地理位置也是如此。例如，心脏病患者植入的支架可能对女性效果不佳，因为她们疾病的性质不同。当你开始深入研究所有这些状况时，这些问题会复合叠加。所以，我们即使获得了这些出色的治疗方法，它们对我们来说也无法发挥最佳效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second gap the efficacy gap when you start unpacking when there is data there is evidence that you know asthma medication may not work as well. Certain treatment and geography. So the the stance that you know people get in their heart when they have heart blockages may not work as well for women uh because of the nature of their diseases. When you start unpacking all these condition these things compound. So not only you know once we have access to these great treatments they don't even work as best as they can for us.</p>
</details>

第三个是**护理鸿沟**（Care Gap: 指女性在医疗护理路径中未能获得充分或适当的照护）。我们是否真的获得了能够完全改变女性状况的护理路径？我们如何看待荷尔蒙转变对产后抑郁、更年期对失眠、焦虑和其他心理健康问题的影响，以及我们长期面临的痴呆症、心血管疾病风险？所有这些都深深交织在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then third there's the care gap you know are we really getting the care pathways that fully change the way as women. So how do we think of hormonal transition impacting you know postpartum impacting depression, menopause impacting insomnia, anxiety, other mental health issues and then our longer term arc on you know dementia, cardiovascular risk. All these things are deeply intertwined.</p>
</details>

Nam，我认为关于如何将其与生产力联系起来的问题，正如我之前所说，这直接关系到我们贡献社会的能力。因为不幸的是，我们可能无法像我们应该的那样去工作，如果某些要素不到位，我们可能就没有留在劳动力市场的杠杆。此外，我们常常是社会中其他人的照护者。所以，当我们状态不佳时，我们就无法在自己的生活和他人的生活中发挥最大的影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think you know to your question nam of how do we then tie this to productivity? Well, as I said earlier, this ties directly to our ability to contribute. Uh because unfortunately, we might not be able to show up to work as we should and if some elements are not in place, well, we may not have the levers to stay in the workforce. And furthermore, we are often the caregivers to others in the society. So, when we are not at best, we are not the most, you know, impactful that we can be in our lives and the lives of others.</p>
</details>

本季早些时候，我们采访了企业家兼科技领袖Amber Mack，她说加拿大一直在讨论生产力问题，现在的主要推动力是**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）可以解决这些生产力问题。然后她说：“等等。”因为Amber Mack曾和我谈论她与子宫肌瘤的经历，这是一种未被充分研究的疾病，她告诉我这如何影响了她的工作以及她不得不做出的让步。她说答案并非人工智能，而是要关注女性健康。您能多谈谈这如何影响职场女性吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earlier in this season, we spoke to Amber Mack, who's an entrepreneur and she's a tech leader, and she was saying that Canada is uh we had these conversations about productivity and right now the big push is AI can solve these productivity issues. And then she said, "Well, wait a minute." because Amber Mack um was talking to me about her journey with fibroids, a condition that isn't studied, and she was telling me how it impacted her work and the concessions that she had to make. And she said the answer is not so much AI, but to focus on women's health. Can you talk to me a bit more about how this impacts women in the workplace?</p>
</details>

### 职场女性的健康与生产力：呼唤国家战略

Marani Belo: 解决这个问题有两个主要杠杆：扩大女性参与度，确保女性因为更健康而能够真正投入工作。这是第一步。第二步是，当我们在工作时，我们能够尽可能地提高生产力。这对于我们能够像我之前提到的那样投入工作至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Two big levers to address this are expanding women's participation. So making sure that women because they are healthier can then actually come to work. Um so that's step one and then step two when we are at work that we can be uh as productive as we can be right. So this is really critical for us to be able to then you know be able to show up as I mentioned earlier and um there are critical levers on how both as I mentioned the efficacy of intervention and then the care that we get that allows us to come back in the workplace at the right time.</p>
</details>

但我认为，您采访的同事提到的一个基本要素是数据鸿沟。我们根本不知道，因为这些状况没有被研究，这些干预措施没有被追求和投资，因此我们无法以任何有意义的方式获得这些能够释放我们在职场生产力的东西。所以，当我们考虑我们如何投入工作时，这非常关键。有很多不同的杠杆需要拉动。雇主正在采取什么措施来真正实现这一点？您提供的护理是什么？创新生态系统是否正在帮助我们开发解决方案，从而帮助我们获得护理，然后让我们的雇主确保我们能够获得这种护理？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think an underpin element that needs to come with this that you know the the colleague you interviewed mentioned is really the data gap we just don't know because these conditions are not studied these inventions are not pursued in invested in and therefore we do not have access in any meaningful way to these things that can unlock our productivity in the workplace. Um so this is really critical as we think of us showing up. There's a lot of different levers that need to be pulled. What is the employer putting in place to really enable this? What is the care that you're giving and you know is the innovation ecosystem helping us develop the solutions that will help us have the care and then be able to then our employer make sure that we have access to that care.</p>
</details>

所以，这些都是非常复杂且相互交织的要素。我们在报告中提出的一个观点，也是加拿大许多女性健康倡导者现在正在提出的观点是，这意味着我们需要一项协调、负责任的全国性女性健康战略。作为一名战略顾问，当您面对复杂的战略，涉及众多利益相关者和许多不同的杠杆时，我们需要齐心协力，我们需要协调，因为这对一个国家和女性自身的经济提升是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these are very complex intertwined elements and one of the case that we make in the paper that I think many women's health advocate in Canada are making now is that means we need a coordinated accountable national health strategy for women south in Canada as a strategy consultant when you have complex strategies that I mean a range of stakeholders with a lot of different levers to pull we need to come together we need to coordinate because the econom omic uplift for a country and for women's themselves is major.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 那样的战略会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What would that strategy look like?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 是的，它有多个杠杆。正如我们讨论的，如果我们考虑不同的差距，第一个方面是研究。目前的数据表明，大约6.8%的加拿大研究专注于女性健康。这微乎其微。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Uh it has multiple levers. So as we discussed right if we think of the different gaps the first aspect is around research. Currently data suggests that about 6.8% of Canadian research is focused on women's health. That is minuscule.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 这太少了，就像百分之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's a small that's like a percent. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 不，正是如此。所以，第一步是确保我们向研究投入足够的资金，这意味着我们的泛加拿大研究机构，以及**加拿大卫生研究院**（Canadian Institutes of Health Research: 加拿大联邦政府的健康研究资助机构），也包括慈善资金和创新资金投入到研究和试验中。然后，要确保我们进行的任何研究，如您所说，都有足够的女性参与。我们知道痴呆症是一种对女性影响比例更高的疾病。然而，我们在临床试验中的代表性仍然不足，而且出现的解决方案对女性的疗效也不尽如人意。这种情况不能继续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No. Exactly. So um so one of the first step is making sure that we are funneling sufficient uh dollars into research and that means our panadian research institutions to the Canadian you know institutes of health research but it's also philanthropic dollars and you know innovation dollars into the research and the trials then it's making sure that whatever research we do as you already mentioned have enough women in them. We know dementia is a condition that proportionately affect women. Yet we are still under reppresented in clinical trials and the solutions emerging are not as efficacious for women. That can't continue. This is done right.</p>
</details>

所以，当我们考虑研究时，我们需要让研究人员负责，确保代表性和公平性。坦率地说，当我们审视数据时，我们正在制定一个更详细的行动蓝图，数据很清楚：我们需要更多的女性研究人员、女性临床医生来倡导这一点，以及研究论文的编辑委员会，确保这些成果得到发表和激励。所有这些都与数据鸿沟紧密相连。我们提到了疗效鸿沟，我们的创新生态系统在这里扮演着巨大的角色。我们如何考虑不同的持有者，包括政府、行业、私人资本，所有这些如何结合起来，真正提升加拿大的标准？加拿大的风险投资资金持续落后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as we think of the research we need to hold researchers accountable to bring uh make sure that the representation and fair and frankly as we're looking at the data and in all trans you know all transparency we are working on a much detailed blueprint for action and the data is clear we need more female representation as researchers as clinicians to advocate for that and you [clears throat] know editorial board of research papers making sure that things get published and incentivized. So all of these thing is tied around this data gap right we mentioned the efficacy DAP well there's a huge role there for our innovation ecosystem how do we think of the different holders that's obviously government industry private capital how does this all come together to really raise the bar in Canada VC money continues to trail in Canada right.</p>
</details>

所以我们需要能够齐心协力。显然，慈善事业也扮演着角色，真正启动这项工作，并承诺我们将为此努力。作为女性，我们如何投资？我们对投资渠道有什么要求，以便能够推动这一进程？最后是护理路径。在医疗教育培训方面，在护理诊所方面，以及我们作为女性与我们的医疗服务提供者互动，并寻找新的解决方案方面，肯定还有很多工作要做。坦率地说，看到**女性科技**（Femtech: 专注于女性健康的科技产品和服务）和女性健康生态系统以及许多其他领域的发展令人兴奋。这些领域比我更了解细节，但我们如何利用这些来确保女性在需要时获得所需的护理？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we need to be able to then come together obviously there's a role to philanthropy as well uh to really kind of jumpstart this and say we will have a commitment and as women how are we investing right and what are we demanding over our investment channels to then be able to move that needle and then finally the care pathway there's definitely a lot of work thinking about medical education training thinking about you know care clinics um and us as women engaging with our healthcare providers and new solutions frankly it's really exciting to look at the feech and the health you know women's health ecosystem and many others are way better than I diverse uh to speak to the details of those but how do we use that to make sure that women are getting the care they need when they need it.</p>
</details>

所以，正如我所说，这项战略有很多支柱，只有我们作为加拿大人齐心协力，协调一致，确定几个真正关键的杠杆，才能推动它。我认为有经济产出需要追踪，有关于女性就业、雇主参与、行业投资的**关键绩效指标**（KPIs: Key Performance Indicators: 衡量业务目标实现程度的指标）。作为这项战略的一部分，我们需要衡量许多关键事项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as I mentioned that strategy has a lot of pillars and that's only us working together as Canadian um coming together coordinating defining a few set of really key uh levers that we want to move. I think there's economic outputs that we want to track there's KPIs around you know woman employment employer engagement industry investments uh there's a lot of things we need to measure that are critical as part of this strategy.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大的全球领导力与370亿加元的机遇

Nam Kiwanuka: 很高兴您提到了女性科技。我们将在下一集中讨论这个话题。我认为，无论您住在加拿大还是全球其他地方，加拿大一直被视为一个女权主义国家。您的报告强调，加拿大在全球性别平等方面排名前十。但这并不意味着女性健康是优先事项。与其他可能做得更好的司法管辖区相比，我们表现如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm glad that you mentioned FEM. are actually going to be covering that in the next episode. Um I I think if you live in Canada or even just globally, Canada has been thought of as a feminist nation. Your report highlights that Canada ranks among quote the top 10 countries globally for gender equality. But that doesn't mean that women's health is a priority. How do we fare up when we think of other jurisdictions that maybe are doing it better?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 加拿大在女性健康差距方面排名全球第五差。但这里有一个非常微妙的细微差别，我想您会理解。我们差距如此之高的原因是，作为女性，我们是社会中非常活跃的一部分，尤其是在劳动力方面。世界上许多国家，女性仍然是非正规经济的一部分，对吗？因此，使用**国内生产总值**（GDP: Gross Domestic Product: 衡量一个国家经济活动的指标）产出衡量的差距会显得小得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So Canada has the fifth worst gap on women's health in the world. But there's a very subtle nuance here um that I think you'll appreciate. The reason our gap is so high is because as women, we are a very active part of society, especially as it means uh in terms of workforce. There's a lot of countries out there where women are still part of the informal economy, right? Therefore, the gap as measured uh using a G GDP output will appear much smaller.</p>
</details>

这意味着加拿大情况更糟，因为我们正在工作，因此我们更强烈地承受着女性健康差距的后果，因为我们作为女性无法像我们应该的那样投入工作，此外，正如我所说，也无法享受健康的益处。所以我深信，这也是McKenzie、McKenzie健康研究所和我们在这里的众多合作伙伴如此深切致力于此的原因之一。加拿大可以引领解决这个问题的全球蓝图。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what that means is Canada is worse because we are working and therefore we are bearing the consequences of that woman's health gap even more sharply because us as women we are not able to show up in the workplace as we could uh in addition as I said to you know the benefit of being healthy. So I profoundly believe and that's one of the reason McKenzie and the Mckenzie Health Institute and our range of partners here are so deeply committed to this. Canada can lead the global blueprint on how to fix this.</p>
</details>

在当前的世界背景下，没有比现在更重要的时刻，我们可以崛起并说，看，投票权的前沿已经完成，打勾；经济和职业独立，我的意思是，我们仍在努力，但已经好多了。女性健康是我们作为加拿大人可以解锁、推动和发展，并指明方向的事情，这样全球所有女性都能受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no more important time in the current, you know, world context that we can rise and we can say, look, the frontier of voting done check financial and professional independence. I mean, we're still working on it, but much better. Women's health is something we as Canadian can unlock, push and develop and show the way so that all women's globally can benefit.</p>
</details>

Nam Kiwanuka: 我认为我们很多人从亲身经历中了解到，如果你没有健康的身体，它实际上会影响你获得经济自由的能力。我们在这个播客中总是寻求解决方案，这份报告的框架是，这是一个机会。这是一个370亿加元的机遇。您是如何得出这个数字的？您能向我们解释一下，为什么现在对加拿大来说这是一个机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And the thing I think a lot of us um uh learn from firsthand experience is that if you don't have good health, it actually impacts your ability to have that economic freedom. Um we always look for solutions on this podcast and um the framing of this report is that this is an opportunity. This is a $37 billion opportunity. How do you come up with that number and how if you could just explain to us more how this is an opportunity for Canada in this time right now?</p>
</details>

Marani Belo: 我完全支持解决方案，我知道有时这些数字听起来可能非常令人沮丧，但这是一个行动的号召，这是一场运动，我们作为现在拥有职业和经济独立的加拿大女性可以真正推动它。我们正在做出选择，每天我们都可以做出不同的选择，当我们与雇主讨论时，当我们在投资组合中讨论时。所以这确实非常关键，我喜欢您现在构建它的方式。

<p class="english-text">>> I'm so l I'm all for solutions and I know sometimes these numbers can sound wildly depressing, but this is a call to action and this is a movement that we as Canadian women who now have the professional and the financial independence can really move on. we are making choices and every day we can make different choices as we discuss with our employers as we discuss in our investment portfolios. So this is really something that is so critical and I love how you're framing this now.</p>

回到您关于经济分析的具体问题。我们将经济产出分为四个方面，我认为这是一个非常重要的细微差别，因为我想说的是，这只显示了这四个方面。实际上还有更多。所以当我们说370亿加元时，它至少是370亿加元。所以这只是开始。这四个方面是：

<p class="english-text">to your specific question on the economic um analysis. So we broke down the economic output in four buckets and I think that's a very important nuance because what I will say is showing that it's only these four buckets. There's actually more. So when we say 37 billion, it's at least 37 billion. So this is only the beginning. So the four buckets are as I mentioned expanded</p>

1.  **扩大参与**：确保今天可能因健康问题无法进入劳动力市场的女性能够进入劳动力市场。
2.  **提高生产力**：当我们在劳动力市场时，我们能够发挥最佳状态，充满信心，并能够追求能给我们带来更高收入潜力和更大影响力的职业。
3.  **减少疾病负担**：确保我们疾病更少，更健康，这为更广泛的社会带来了巨大的经济价值。
4.  **延长健康寿命**：我们不会过早死亡，我们将活得更长、更健康，这也为我们的社会创造了巨大的价值。

<p class="english-text">participation. So making sure that women who today may not be able to enter the workforce because of health issues be able to enter the workforce. That's one. Two, increasing productivity. So when we are in the workforce, we can show up at our best and feel confident and be able to pursue the career that will give us higher income potential and higher impact as we want. Right? So critical piece number two. Number three is making sure that you know we have fewer disease, we are healthier and that has huge that has economic value to the broader society. So decreasing these conditions really matter and that has four consequences on we don't die as early we will live longer healthier life and that too creates tremendous value for our society.</p>

未包含在内的方面是什么？例如新的市场机会。您提到了慢性疼痛、子宫肌瘤。如果我们考虑女性科技产业的增长，这些正在创造全新的市场机会，这些全新的产业正在增长，具有巨大的经济潜力，在加拿大可以对我们的创新生态系统产生巨大影响，而这并未包含在经济潜力中。所以加拿大至少有370亿加元的潜力，我们可以选择去影响它。

<p class="english-text">So the buckets that are not included in here are what about the new market opportunities you've mentioned chronic pain fibroids um there are new market opportunities being created if you think of the growth of the fem industry these are brand new industries that are growing that have enormous economic potential and that in Canada could make a huge difference in our innovation ecosystems that is not in the economic potential so Canada has at least a 37 billion and we can make the choices to influence that</p>

Nam Kiwanuka: 我非常感谢您创建这份报告，因为它会让人们停下来思考所有这些事物是如何相互关联的。这不仅仅是“你需要摆脱困境”、“你需要更坚强”、“你需要忍受痛苦”，而是这些实际上是相互关联的。我们经济中的一切都是相互关联的。我还有什么没问到而您想提及的吗？

Marani Belo: 非常感谢您，Nam。这只是一个开始。还有很多工作要做，但我们每个人在谈论女性健康方面都扮演着角色。这不仅仅是一场附带的对话，也不是鸡尾酒会上的一个“锦上添花”的话题。作为一个社会，作为女性，我们可以推动这一进程。因此，当我们思考我们的选择，我们如何投资，我们如何与雇主互动，我们如何以慈善方式回馈加拿大社会并贡献我们的时间时，所有这些都是我们的选择可以有意义地推进议程，并在这种协调、负责任的战略下共同努力，使加拿大成为世界领先国家之一的地方。

<p class="english-text">>> Thank you so much, Nam. This is only the beginning. There's a lot of work to be done, but each of us have a role to play in how we're talking about women's health. This is not just a side conversation and a nice to have in the bottom of a, you know, cocktail party. This is something that as a society, as women, we can move the needle on. So, as we think of our choices, how we're investing, how we're engaging with our employers, how we're contributing philanthropically to to Canadian society and giving our time back, these are all places that our choice can meaningfully advance the agenda and come together under this coordinated, accountable strategy to make Canada one of the leading countries in the world.</p>
