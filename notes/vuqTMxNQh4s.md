### 新闻简报开场

**Tracy Mumford**: 这是《纽约时报》新闻简报。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，星期四，1月29日。以下是我们将要报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, January 29th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

### 移民政策争议

**新闻播报**: 这不是边境安全。这不是法律和秩序。这是从顶端制造的混乱，影响到我们许多社区。参议院民主党人，由 Chuck Schumer 领导，要求对联邦移民局特工进行新的限制，以避免政府停摆。除非至少有少数民主党人加入共和党人通过一项支出方案，否则多个联邦机构的资金将在明天晚上耗尽。然而，民主党人呼吁参议院将国土安全部（包括 ICE）的资金分离开来，以便单独投票并就特工行为进行谈判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: This is not border security. This is not law and order. This is chaos created at the top and felt in so many of our neighborhoods. Top Senate Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are demanding new restrictions on federal immigration agents in exchange for averting a government shutdown. Funding for multiple federal agencies is set to lapse tomorrow night unless at least a handful of Democrats join with Republicans to push through a spending package. Democrats, however, are calling for the Senate to split off funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, so they can vote on that separately and negotiate for restrictions on agents behavior.

</details>

**新闻播报**: 我们想要摘下口罩，打开随身摄像头，不再有匿名特工，不再有秘密特工。据《纽约时报》报道，截至昨晚，Schumer 和特朗普总统似乎正在朝着达成可能的协议方向发展，但知情人士表示，仍然存在许多障碍。预计今天上午参议院将对包含 DHS 资金的支出方案进行测试投票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: We want masks off, body cameras on, no more anonymous agents, no more secret operatives. The Times has learned that as of last night, Schumer and President Trump seemed to be moving toward a possible agreement, though officials with knowledge of their discussion said a lot of hurdles remained. There's expected to be a test vote on the spending package with DHS funding still included in the Senate this morning.

</details>

### ICE 执法争议

**新闻播报**: 同时，在明尼苏达州，特朗普政府因其强硬的移民执法行动而面临来自法院日益增长的抵制。首席联邦法官昨天严厉批评 ICE，称该机构违反了近 100 份法庭命令，并且本月单独不服从的司法指令数量超过了一些联邦机构的整个历史。这包括无视法庭命令，不让 ICE 被拘留者质疑其拘留或被释放。在附上他认为 ICE 未能遵守的命令清单后，法官写道：“这份清单应该让任何关心法治的人，无论其政治信仰如何，都感到警醒。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Meanwhile, in Minnesota, the Trump administration's facing growing push back from the courts over its aggressive immigration enforcement operations. The chief federal judge there lambasted ICE yesterday, saying the agency had violated nearly 100 court orders and had disobeyed more judicial directives this month alone than some federal agencies had in their entire existence. That included things like ignoring court orders to let ICE detainees challenge their detention or be released. After attaching a rundown of the orders he said ICE failed to follow, the judge wrote, "This list should give pause to anyone, no matter his or her political beliefs, who cares about the rule of law."

</details>

**新闻播报**: 另一位联邦法官命令该州的特工停止拘留和驱逐难民。特工迄今为止已经拘留了至少 100 人，尽管他们已经经过了仔细审查。其中一些人被戴上手铐，被运到德克萨斯州，被关押了几天，然后被释放，无法回家。法官写道，拥有难民身份的人有权在美国和平生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: And another federal judge ordered agents in the state to stop detaining and deporting refugees. Agents have swept up at least 100 people so far, even though they'd already been carefully vetted. Some of them were shackled, flown to Texas, and held for days, then released with no way to get back home. The judge wrote that people with refugee status have a legal right to live peacefully in the US.

### 对伊朗的威胁与委内瑞拉石油控制

**新闻播报**: 现在，关于政府的另外三条简讯。特朗普总统强烈加剧了对伊朗的威胁，表示如果该国不同意一系列要求，美国可能会很快以“速度和暴力”发动攻击。特朗普没有说明这些要求是什么，但美国一直在推动伊朗削减其核计划，并停止支持哈马斯和真主党等代理组织。这一威胁是在美国海军将包括航空母舰在内的舰只移动到伊朗打击距离之内之后发出的。特朗普明确地将部队的集结与他在委内瑞拉附近下令的行动进行了比较，此前美国军队逮捕了该国的总统。伊朗外交部长最近警告美国，全面对抗将会混乱而猛烈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Now, three other quick updates on the administration. President Trump has sharply intensified his threats against Iran, saying the US could attack soon with quote speed and violence if the country doesn't agree to a set of demands. Trump didn't outline what those demands are, but the US has been pushing for Iran to wind down its nuclear program and stop supporting proxy groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, among other things. The threat comes as the US Navy has moved ships, including an aircraft carrier, into striking distance of Iran. And Trump explicitly compared the buildup of forces to what he ordered near Venezuela before US troops captured its president. Iran's foreign minister recently warned the US that an all-out confrontation would be messy and ferocious.

</details>

**新闻播报**: 此外，在国会山举行的听证会上，鲁比奥国务卿提供了关于特朗普政府控制委内瑞拉的细节。他说白宫将监督委内瑞拉石油的销售，然后决定将该收入返还给该国。他说这笔钱将通过卡塔尔管理的账户汇入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Also in a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave new details about how the Trump administration is exerting control over Venezuela. He said the White House will oversee the sale of Venezuelan oil, then decide what revenue from that goes back to the country. He said the money will come by way of an account managed by Qatar.

</details>

**新闻播报**: 鲁比奥说，第三方账户是必要的，因为美国对委内瑞拉实施了财政制裁。但民主党参议员质疑该安排的合法性，并批评了政府在该国的无限制参与。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Rubio said the third party account was necessary because of US financial sanctions on Venezuela. But Democratic senators questioned the legality of the arrangement and criticized the administration's open-ended involvement in the country.

</details>

### FBI 搜查与梅拉尼娅纪录片

**新闻播报**: 最后，在佐治亚州富尔顿县，联邦调查局昨天在 2020 年选举中心执行了搜查令，试图查获选票。这是特朗普政府一再强调总统毫无根据的选举舞弊指控的最新迹象。富尔顿县，压倒性地投票给乔·拜登，一直是这些阴谋论的中心，也是特朗普本人因涉嫌干预选举而受到刑事指控的地方。搜查令称，联邦调查局正在调查可能销毁与选举相关的记录，以及其他事项。然而，该县的一位民主党专员指责特朗普试图在期中选举前制造混乱，他说：“这完全是关于 2026 年 11 月的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: And last update in Fulton County, Georgia yesterday, FBI agents executed a search warrant at an election center in an attempt to seize ballots from the 2020 election. It's the latest sign that the Trump administration is doubling down on the president's baseless claims that the election was rigged. Fulton County, which voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden, has been at the center of those conspiracy theories, and it's where Trump himself was criminally charged with election interference. The warrant said the FBI was investigating the possible destruction of election related records, among other things. A Democratic commissioner in the county, however, accused Trump of trying to create chaos before the midterm elections, saying, quote, "This is all about November 2026."

**新闻播报**: 在过去一年左右的时间里，关于黄金价格上涨的消息已经司空见惯。就在本周，黄金创下历史新高，飙升至每盎司 5000 美元以上。但现在，白银的涨幅甚至更快，一些分析师称之为“黄金类固醇”。需要明确的是，它的价值不如黄金。白银的价格刚刚突破每盎司 100 美元，但其涨幅却快如闪电。其中一些动力可能来自席卷全球的不稳定浪潮，贸易紧张局势、战争或战争威胁、债务增加等。当情况变得动荡时，投资者会寻找安全的避风港来存放资金。但还有其他因素在起作用。中国今年一直在打击白银出口。而且，白银具有很高的工业需求，因为它能够导电。白银被用于从太阳能电池板到为人工智能提供动力的数据中心的一切。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Over the last year or so, news about the price of gold rising and rising has become common. Just this week, gold hit a record high, surging over $5,000 an ounce. But now silver is surging even faster with some analysts calling it gold on steroids. To be clear, it's not worth as much as gold. The price of silver just crossed $100 an ounce, but it is rising at breakneck speeds. Some of that momentum likely comes from the waves of instability that have been sweeping the globe, trade tensions, wars, or the threat of wars, rising debt, etc. When things get bumpy, investors look for safe places to park their money. But there are other factors at play. China has been cracking down on silver exports this year. And silver has a lot of very in demand industrial uses right now because of its ability to conduct electricity. Silver is used in everything from solar panels to the data centers that power AI.

</details>

**新闻播报**: 尽管如此，一些市场预测师警告说，白银的上涨可能已经超出了其合理范围。美国银行将其在最新投资列表中排名最高，称其具有“泡沫资产动态”。最后，一部新纪录片将于本周末在影院上映。纪录片通常不是票房大片，但这部电影的营销预算高达 3500 万美元，包括在 NFL 季后赛期间播放的预告片以及在时代广场投放的巨幅广告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Still, some market forecasters are warning that silver's rally may be getting ahead of itself. Bank of America gave silver the highest ranking on its recent list of investments that have quote bubblelike asset dynamics.

**News Reporter**: And finally, there's a new documentary opening in theaters this weekend. Documentaries, of course, are not typically blockbusters, but this one has a $35 million marketing budget behind it, complete with a trailer that ran during the NFL playoffs and a giant ad in Times Square.

**新闻播报**: “我们又来了。” “这是梅拉尼娅。” 这部电影讲述了特朗普就职典礼前几天第一夫人的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: Here we go again. It is Melania. The film follows the first lady in the days leading up to Trump's inauguration last year.

</details>

**新闻播报**: “您好，总统先生。恭喜您。” 您看了吗？ “我没有看。是的，我会在新闻上看到的。” 这部纪录片自制作以来就备受争议。它由布雷特·拉特纳执导，他在 2017 年被多名女性指控性侵犯后，就再也没有制作过电影。当这部纪录片被出售时，更多的人感到惊讶。亚马逊以 4000 万美元的价格购买了梅拉尼娅·特朗普的制作公司的电影版权。比第二高的竞标者高出 2600 万美元。在声明中，亚马逊表示：“我们授权这部电影只有一个原因，也只有一个原因，因为我们认为顾客会喜欢它，但许多好莱坞人士质疑该公司自特朗普以来动机，因为亚马逊不太可能收回其巨额投资。”亚马逊电影部门的前雇员称之为公然试图讨好特朗普。他说：“这怎么不能等同于行贿？” 作为比较，如果你看看另一部政治纪录片，2018 年获得奥斯卡提名的电影《RBG》，讲述了最高法院大法官的生活，它的总宣传预算约为 300 万美元，不到推动梅拉尼娅的资金的十分之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**News Reporter**: The documentary has drawn controversy ever since it went into production. It was directed by Brett Ratner, who hasn't made a film since 2017 when multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. More eyebrows went up when the documentary was sold. Amazon paid Melania Trump's production company $40 million for the film's rights. That was 26 million more than the next highest bidder. In a statement, Amazon said, "We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only, because we think customers are going to love it, but many in Hollywood have questioned the company's motivations since Amazon is unlikely to recoup its massive investment." One former senior employee at Amazon's film division called it a blatant attempt to win over the Trumps. He said, quote, "How can it not be equated with curing favor or an outright bribe?" For comparison, if you look at another political documentary, the 2018 Oscar nominated film RBG about the life of the Supreme Court justice, it had a total promotional budget of about $3 million, less than a tenth of what's being spent to push Melania.
