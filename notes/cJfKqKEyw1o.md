### 职业迷茫的轮回与AI时代的焦虑

我们不妨花些时间，回顾一下自己二十岁时的生活。想想那时你在哪里，面前有哪些工作和职业机会。我很好奇，有多少人对自己的职业生涯有了一个相当清晰的规划？嗯，不多。有多少人被所有的选择压得喘不过气？好的，我明白，我当时也是这种感觉。那么，请做好准备，因为情况只会变得更加令人不知所措。

当我二十岁时，我即将从斯坦福大学毕业，获得纯数学学位。没有人坐下来告诉我，我的纯数学专业对于潜在雇主来说，并不是最理想的资历。即使有人告诉我，我可能也不会听。于是，我沿着默认的道路继续前进，进入了加州大学洛杉矶分校的数学博士项目，至少又给自己争取了一年时间来弄清楚我的职业方向。

在我读研究生一年级的时候，雷曼兄弟公司倒闭了。这是全球金融危机的开端。我的大多数朋友，尤其是那些在金融职业中感觉最稳固的人，发现自己不得不收拾行李离开办公室，失业了。我们中的一些人开始怀疑经济是否会复苏，或者我们是否将迎来又一个长达十年的大萧条。然而，在那个时期的不确定性、悲观情绪和普遍的低迷之中，我们中的一些人找到了乐观的源泉——**iPhone**，以及尤其重要的**App Store**，就在同一年，2008年，问世了。我仍然记得 **SDK**（用于构建 iPhone 应用的说明手册）发布时的情景。我当时在家，熬了整晚阅读它，学习，试图理解。我看到了一个创造全新公平竞争环境的机会。

如果仔细想想，从那时起我所做的一切，我创立的公司，我之后的整个职业生涯，既是那个经济低迷时期的产物，也是那个时代技术乐观主义的体现。但时代已经变了。如果我从播客圈听到的问题能说明什么，那么今天的普通二十岁年轻人同样充满了恐惧。但这一次，新兴技术不是恐惧的解药，而是恐惧的根源。他们不禁自问：我正在关注的这份工作，十年后还会存在吗？人类还会编写计算机软件吗？我们甚至还会写书吗？我认为今年情况感觉不同的一个原因是，**AI**，不像 **iPhone**，是我们制造出的第一个能够“离开工具箱”的工具，而我们尚不清楚它的极限。

几年前，我创立了另一家公司，其使命是构建数学超级智能——一种能够比任何数学家更擅长推理和解决问题的**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 基于海量文本训练的 AI 系统）。你知道，在我成长过程中，我一直认为数学是人类智力活动的巅峰。如果你能解决数学问题，你几乎就能做任何事情。因此，一个在数学领域超越人类的 AI，可能在所有领域都超越人类。这是一个相当令人恐惧的想法。所以，当你想到这一点，并将其与我作为一家全球金融服务平台运营者的日常工作结合起来，我花了大量时间思考一个非常重要的问题：在一个今天的大部分工作都已消失的世界里，我们该怎么办？我想理性地分析这个问题，不带恐惧和夸张。

一种方法是回顾历史，看看我们是否曾经面临过如此程度的职业颠覆，以及我们人类是如何应对的。我应该说明一点：我是一名技术专家，不是历史学家。带着这个免责声明，让我们回到很久以前，回到一个二十岁年轻人可能非常熟悉的世界。更精确地说，是几万年前。正如你所见，那个时代的主要职业，旧石器时代，基本上已经消失了：猎人、采集者、工具制造者。但它们并没有在一夜之间消失，而是被细分成了许多其他更专业的职业。

那么，让我们继续前进到新石器时代。在这里，人类掌握了几项新技术：农业、畜牧业。我将快速带过，但这确实是一次重大的转变。事实上，这些发明的出现，使我们能够将更多时间投入到我们认为是创造性的工作中，而将更少的时间用于纯粹的生存和维持生计。这催生了许多新职业：你有像纺织工这样的工匠，当然还有农民、陶工、建筑工人。而这些职业，也大多消失了。今天在美国，农民仅占劳动力的不到 2%。

让我们继续看看青铜时代、铁器时代的职业变迁。我最喜欢的一个时期是“黑暗时代”。然后我们迎来了文艺复兴和地理大发现时代。职业多得数不清，其中很多都已消失。现在，在座有铁匠或探险家吗？（笑声）我猜没有。我曾梦想成为一名探险家。那该是多么酷的工作啊？也许随着太空探索的兴起，它会卷土重来。

我的曾祖父是保加利亚一个村庄的农民。传说他是村里第一个看到汽车的人。当他看到汽车时，他跑回村里喊道：“田野里有条龙。”（笑声）他的儿子，也就是我的祖父，也是一位从未远离村庄的农民。他的儿子，也就是我的父亲，是他家第一个去保加利亚黑海沿岸大城市瓦尔纳的人，我也就是在那里出生的。在那里，他成了一名旅游学教授，这绝对是我祖父和曾祖父从未想象过的工作。

如果你仔细想想，我们的大多数姓氏都源于我们家族不再从事的职业：陶工（Potter）、管家（Butler）、屠夫（Butcher），甚至最常见的“铁匠”（Smith）。听众中有姓“Fletcher”的吗？有人知道 Fletcher 是做什么的吗？这个周末我在准备我的演讲时，我儿子说：“爸爸，我知道 Fletcher 是做什么的。”他玩《我的世界》（Minecraft）。（笑声）旧事物又焕发新生了，对吧？Fletcher 是指制造和销售箭的人。所以，如果你认识姓这个姓氏的人，他们的祖先就是军火贩子。（笑声）

我讲这些的重点是，你可能看到媒体上任何关于职业颠覆的预测，在充裕的时间里，总有一天，那甚至会是一个低估。那甚至会是保守的。我们发现，职业颠覆是人类进化中的一个基本特质。我们希望工作消失，因为它意味着我们作为人类正在做好自己的工作，让我们的生活变得更好、更轻松。在劳动力方面，我们渴望提高每小时工作所赚取的美元数。这催生了不断改进的创新市场，为我们节省时间和金钱。

那么，对于 AI，也许让我们如此紧张的不是职业颠覆本身，而是它发生的**速度**和**加速度**。也许这才是让我们感到紧张的原因。那么，为什么我们不加速前进呢？我们将直接穿越工业革命，进入现代。在 20 世纪，一个年轻人，在公司扩张和自动化的浪潮中，经历了巨大的变化，会发现一个他们父母从未接触过的新职业菜单。所以，他们不再在工厂工作，而是可以选择各种各样的新办公室工作。而一些父母可能在想：“你整天坐在椅子上。那不算真正的工作。”

现在，让我们来看看互联网时代。好的，我们大多数人都经历过至少一部分这个时代，我们周围看到了许多以前不存在的工作。我们中的一些人可能就在其中。也许我们大多数人都是。我知道我就是。那么，这一切将我们带到了 AI 时代黎明时的二十岁年轻人置于何地？我们发现一个贯穿几代人的反复出现的特征是这种“例外论”的感觉。我们喜欢认为，不知何故，我们正处于一个历史终结的断裂点，我们身处一个没有先例的新世界。

也许这次是真的，我们真的不知道我们是在建造一个超级助手还是一个顶级掠食者。我们不知道。当然，所有的变革和颠覆都伴随着痛苦的过渡。工作将会消失。也许它们会以加速的速度消失。但同时，我们在这里所经历的是数万年的人类历史。我们看到一个不可否认的趋势：将会出现新的工作，而且数量会非常非常多。AI 研究人员谈论“奇点”——智能爆炸。但我们在数据中看到的是，我们也正处于一个工作岗位快速创造的曲线上，我称之为“**工作奇点**”（job singularity），一场不仅是新工作，更是跨越所有想象领域的“**寒武纪生命大爆发**”（Cambrian explosion）。互联网赋予了人们全球影响力，而 AI 则赋予了他们世界一流的团队。

因此，如果你看看这片工作的云，当然会有些工作是我们现在还无法预测的。但我认为我们可以做出一些预测。将会出现大量的**创业活动**，包括微型企业、独立机构和单人独角兽公司，顺便说一句，我认为我们离这些并不遥远。这个“工作奇点”的另一个决定性特征是，当你展望未来时，那些工作将看起来不像“真正的工作”。就像对我们的前辈来说，我们现在的工作看起来像是休闲一样。我们有的人靠玩电子游戏、在餐馆吃饭、旅行和通过视频与朋友聊天来赚钱。我们称那些最后一种人为“播客兄弟”。（笑声）

我们非常认真地对待我们的工作。那些做得好的人肯定不会说这很容易，但如果你把 20 世纪初那些开始思考这些问题的人带到今天，让他们看看我们的世界，他们会认为关于“**技术性失业**”（technological unemployment）的所有预测都成真了。他们会说，我们没有更多的工作了，我敢打赌，我们对我们未来的后代也会有同样的感觉。

那么现在怎么办？我们已经证明，将会有大量的工作可供选择。有些人会说太多了，而且这些工作，连同大量的创业活动，对我们来说很可能看起来像休闲，就像我们的工作对我们的祖先一样。我可以近乎肯定地告诉你，一个有能力建造超级智能 AI 的人类，同样也拥有创造力来应对这种潜在的“工作末日”情景。尽管我们永远不会停止担心它，永远不会停止担心它，因为对生存威胁的高度警惕是我们生存机制的关键部分。也是进化、使我们成为人类的关键部分。

虽然要深入探讨哪些工作是面向未来的还需要很长时间，但我可以告诉你，你不应该让关于未来职业颠覆的预测阻止你去做你非常热衷的事情。你知道，我小时候在 90 年代，老师们劝我不要成为一名计算机程序员。我不知道有多少人听过这个，但当时普遍的看法是，所有那些工作都会被转移到中国。大约在同一时间，如果你还记得，1997 年，**Deep Blue** 击败了加里·卡斯帕罗夫（Garry Kasparov）赢得了国际象棋比赛。那是 AI 第一次在被认为是纯粹人类智力活动领域取得成功。但现在，国际象棋产业蓬勃发展，比以往任何时候都更强大。所以，即使在看似显而易见的地方，我们对未来的预测有时也会完全错误。

人类总是在提供自身意义和目标方面表现出色，即使在最黑暗、最不确定的时期也是如此。所以，如果我必须猜测，我非常有信心，未来的二十岁年轻人，也许与 AI 合作，将继续建造新的事物，而这些事物同时会让我们感到恐惧，但也会让我们感到兴奋。感谢您考虑这些想法。

<summary>Original English</summary>
Let's take a moment
and reflect back upon our lives
when we were 20 years old.
Think about where you were
and the opportunities for work and career
that lay in front of you.
I'm curious, tell me,
how many of you had a pretty good idea
of what you wanted to do for your career?
OK, not too many.
How many were overwhelmed
by all the options?
OK, I know I felt the same.
Well buckle up.
It's only going to get more overwhelming.
When I was 20 years old,
I was graduating from Stanford University
with a degree in pure mathematics.
Nobody had sat me down to tell me
that my pure math major
wasn't going to be
the most desirable qualification
for prospective employers.
And I probably wouldn't
have listened if they did.
So I went off along my default path,
a math PhD program at UCLA,
buying at least one more year
to figure out my career.
Now my first month in graduate school,
Lehman Brothers went under.
The start of the global financial crisis.
Most of my friends, particularly
the ones that felt the most secure
in their financial careers,
found themselves packing up
their cubicles, out of work.
Some of us wondered whether
the economy would recover at all
or whether we were in store
for another decade-long Great Depression.
But amidst the uncertainty,
the pessimism,
the malaise really, of that time,
some of us found a source of optimism.
The iPhone,
and in particular, the App Store,
came out that very same year, 2008.
I still remember when the SDK,
which was the instruction manual
for how to build iPhone apps,
was released.
I was at my parents’ house,
and I was up all night
reading it, learning,
trying to understand.
I saw an opportunity
for a new level playing field.
And if you think about it,
pretty much everything
I've done since then,
the company that I created,
my professional career since that point
was a product, both
of the economic malaise
but the technological optimism
of the time as well.
But times have changed.
If the questions I'm hearing
on the podcast circuit are any indication,
the average 20-year-old today
also has quite a bit of fear.
But this time,
emerging technology
is not the antidote to that fear.
It's the source.
And they’re asking themselves:
Will that career I’m looking at
even be around in 10 years?
Will humans still be writing
computer software?
Will we even be writing books?
And I think one reason why it feels
different this time is because AI,
unlike the iPhone,
is the first tool that we've built
that's capable of leaving the toolbox,
and we don't yet know its limits.
A few years ago,
I founded another company
with the mission to build
mathematical superintelligence.
That's an artificial
intelligence that can reason
and solve problems
better than any mathematician.
You know, when I grew up,
I always thought of mathematics
as the pinnacle of human
intellectual activity.
If you could solve math problems,
you could do pretty much anything.
So a superhuman AI at mathematics
could potentially be
superhuman at everything.
And that's a bit of a scary thought.
So when you think about that,
and I combine that with my day job,
which is running a global
financial services platform,
it's led to me spending a lot of time
pondering one very important question:
What do we do in a world
where the vast majority
of today's jobs are gone?
And I want to analyze
this question rationally,
without fear and hyperbole.
One way to do it is to look
back through history
and see if there's been a time
where we've faced this type
of job disruption before,
at anything near these levels,
and how we as humans have navigated it.
I should say one thing.
I'm a technologist, not a historian.
So with that caveat, let's go back in time
to a world a 20-year-old
would have known very long ago.
Tens of thousands of years ago,
to be more precise.
Now as you can tell,
the main occupations of this time,
the Paleolithic era,
are largely gone.
Hunters, gatherers, toolmakers.
But they didn't disappear overnight.
Instead, they were subdivided
into lots of other, more specialized jobs.
So why don’t we move forward,
to the Neolithic era.
Now here, humans
have mastered a few new things:
farming, keeping livestock.
And I'm going to zoom through this,
but this was a big transformation.
Actually, the invention of these things
allowed us to spend more time
doing what we consider creative work
and less time on pure
survival and subsistence.
And this opened up a lot of new jobs.
You had artisans like weavers,
you had farmers, of course,
potters, construction laborers.
And these jobs, too, largely all gone.
So in the US today, we should say,
farmers make up less
than two percent of the workforce.
Let's move ahead through the changing jobs
of the Bronze Age,
the Iron Age.
One of my favorites, the Dark Ages.
Here we've got the Renaissance
and the Age of Exploration.
Too many jobs to count,
a lot of them are gone.
Now, any blacksmiths
or explorers in this room?
(Laughter)
I didn't think so.
I would have loved to be an explorer.
How cool of a job would that be?
It might come back,
with space exploration.
My great grandfather was a farmer
in a village near Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.
Now legend has it
he was the first person in his village
to see an automobile.
And when he saw it,
he ran back into the village and said,
"There's a dragon out in the fields."
(Laughter)
His son, my grandfather,
was also a farmer that didn't venture
too far from the village.
His son, my father,
was the first in his family
to go to the big city,
Varna, Bulgaria, on the Black Sea coast,
where I was also born.
There, he became a professor of tourism,
which was certainly
a job that my grandfather
and great grandfather never imagined.
If you think about it,
most of our last names are from jobs
that our families no longer do.
Potter, Butler, Butcher,
even the most common, Smith.
Any Fletchers in the audience?
Anyone know what a fletcher is?
I was going over my talk
this weekend and my son said,
"I know what a fletcher is, dad."
He plays Minecraft.
(Laughter)
Everything old is new again, right?
A fletcher is someone
that makes and sells arrows.
So if you know someone
with that last name,
their relatives were arms dealers.
(Laughter)
Now my point in all of this is
you can probably take any prediction
that you see in the media
of job disruption
and, in the fullness of time,
at some point, even that
will be an underestimate.
Even that will be conservative.
And what we find is that job disruption
is then an essential quality
of human evolution.
We want work to disappear
because it means that we're
doing our jobs as humans,
making our lives better and easier.
And when it comes to labor,
we yearn to increase
dollars earned per hour worked.
And this creates the market
for the ever improving set of innovations
that save us time and money.
So with AI,
maybe it’s not the job disruption itself
that makes us so nervous
but the speed with which it's happening
and the acceleration.
Maybe that's what makes us nervous.
So why don't we accelerate?
We’re going to go right through
the Industrial Revolution
into the modern era.
So in the 20th century, a young person,
in the wake of companies
expanding and automating,
there was a lot of change,
would have found
an entirely new menu of jobs
that their parents never had access to.
So instead of working in a factory,
they would have had the selection
of a wide assortment of new office jobs.
And some of the parents
were probably thinking,
"You sit in a chair all day.
That's not real work."
Now let’s go through the Internet Era.
OK, most of us have lived
through at least a portion of this,
and we see all around us
jobs that didn't exist before.
Some of us are probably in them.
Maybe most of us.
I know I am.
So where does all this leave
our 20-year-old
at the dawn of the AI era?
One feature that we found
is recurrent throughout generations
is this feeling of exceptionalism.
We'd like to think that somehow
we're at a discontinuity
where history ends
and we're in a new world
with no precedent.
And maybe it's true this time,
we really don't know if we're building
a super assistant or an apex predator.
We don't.
And certainly all change and disruption
brings with it a painful transition.
Jobs will disappear.
Perhaps they'll disappear
at an accelerating rate.
But at the same time,
what we've gone through here is tens
of thousands of years of human history.
And we see one undeniable trend.
There's going to be new jobs
and lots and lots of them.
AI researchers talk
about this idea of a singularity,
an intelligence explosion.
But what we see in the data
is that we're also on a curve
of rapidly accelerating job creation,
which I like to call
the “job singularity,”
a Cambrian explosion of not just new jobs
but new job families
across every imaginable field.
Where the internet
gave people worldwide reach,
AI gives them a world-class staff.
And so, if you look at this cloud of jobs,
certainly there's going to be some jobs
that we can't predict yet.
But I think we can make some predictions.
There's going to be a flurry
of new entrepreneurial activity
with micro-corporations, solo institutions
and single-person unicorns,
which, by the way, I don't think
we're very far from.
Another defining feature
of this job singularity,
is that when you look into the future,
the jobs will not look like real work.
Much like to our predecessors,
our current jobs
would have looked like leisure.
We have people getting paid
to play video games,
eat at restaurants,
travel
and talk to their friends on video.
Those last people we call podcast bros.
(Laughter)
And we take our jobs very seriously.
Those of us that do well
certainly wouldn't say it's easy,
but if you took someone
from the 20th century
when people first started
contemplating these problems
and they could peek into our world today,
they would think
that all of the predictions
around "technological
unemployment" came true.
They'd say, we don't have any more jobs,
and I bet that we would feel the same
about our descendants in the future.
So now what?
We've shown that there's going to be
lots of jobs to choose from.
Some would argue too many,
and that the jobs,
along with the flurry
of new entrepreneurial activity,
will likely look like leisure to us,
much like our jobs did to our ancestors.
And I can tell you with near certainty
that a humanity that's capable
of building a superintelligent AI
also has the creativity
to navigate through this potential
job doom-and-gloom scenario.
Although we'll never
stop worrying about it,
we'll never stop worrying about it,
because being hyper vigilant
about threats to our survival
is a key part of our survival mechanism.
Also a key part of evolution,
what makes us human.
And although it'll take a lot of time
to go into what kind of jobs
are future-proofed,
I can tell you that you
shouldn't take predictions
about future job disruption
to keep you from doing something
you feel very passionately about.
You know, when I was a kid, in the '90s,
teachers discouraged me from
becoming a computer programmer.
I don't know if many else heard this,
but back then it was a common thought
that all those jobs would be
shipped off to China.
Around the same time,
If you guys remember, 1997,
Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess.
That was the first time an AI succeeded
in what was considered a solely
human intellectual affair.
But now the chess industry
is booming, bigger than ever.
So even where it seems obvious,
sometimes our predictions of the future
end up being completely off.
Humanity has always excelled
at providing itself
with meaning and purpose,
even in the darkest
and most uncertain of times.
So if I had to guess,
I feel very, very confident
that the 20-year-olds of the future,
perhaps in collaboration with AI,
will continue to build new things
which simultaneously,
we're going to be scared of,
but also excited by.
Thank you for considering these ideas.
(Applause)
