### 门罗主义的起源与演变

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 大家好，欢迎收听《奇思妙想》播客的又一期节目。我是特蕾西·阿洛威。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 我是乔·艾森塔尔。特蕾西，我喜欢做美国历史节目，部分原因是我觉得我对美国历史的了解相当简单。我记得从高中到大学时，经历了一次巨大的文化冲击。我想我以前讲过这个故事。我去了伦敦的一所大学，我一直听说美国独立战争被称为“美国革命”，对吧？然后我一到英国，他们就称之为“美国独立战争”，这听起来感觉完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I'm Joe Eisenthal. Joe, I love doing American history episodes in part because I feel like my own knowledge of American history is fairly simplistic and I do remember a huge culture shock when I went from high school to college and I think I told this story before. So I went to college, university in London and I had always heard the American Revolution described as the American Revolution, right? And then as soon as I get to the UK, they call it I think the American War of Independence, which has a different tonality to it.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 没错，这确实表明了历史上的紧张局势、冲突和政策，根据你交谈的对象，实际上是多么主观。我们今天要讨论的不仅是一项相当主观的美国政策，而且是一项在过去被多次重新解读和修订的政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: But it definitely demonstrates just how subjective tensions, conflicts, and policies can actually be in history depending on who you're talking to. And we are going to talk about not just a pretty subjective American policy but one that has been reinterpreted and amended many many times in the past.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 对吧？对我们来说，这显然是“委内瑞拉周”，有很多直接相关的问题，我们主要讨论了市场因素，比如石油、主权债务等等。但当然，也有关于国际法以及什么是合法、什么是非法的问题。我看到那个头条新闻时简直不敢相信，我们竟然逮捕了一个外国元首。我当时惊呆了，逮捕一个外国元首的想法简直令人震惊。然后人们谈论国际法，他们会问国际法是否存在，等等。在某种程度上，这感觉像是一片真正**未知的领域**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right? So obviously for us this has been a Venezuela week and there's all sorts of immediate questions that are sort of most directly relevant to we've been talking about the market elements mostly. We talked about oil, we talked about the sovereign debt. But then there's all these questions of course about international law and what is legitimate and what is illegitimate and I mean I couldn't even believe the headline when I saw it that we had arrested. I know this I I I was flabber. I just the idea that that we had arrested a head of state from another country is just absolutely gobsmacking and then people talk about international law and then they say does international law even exist and so forth and what it feels like to some extent truly uncharted territory.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 没错，是未知领域。但人们正在引用一个先例，那就是**门罗主义**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yep. Uncharted territory. But people are drawing on a parallel. Which is the Monroe Doctrine.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yes.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: **门罗主义**，我想是1823年的，它基本上宣称美国将对整个美洲地区行使主导权。从那时起，它已经改变了很多次。但现在人们谈论它的方式是将其称为**特朗普推论**或**唐罗主义**，这在特朗普政府于去年12月发布的**国家安全战略文件**中有所描述。这个版本有些不同，所以我们不断看到对该主义的修正。顺便说一句，我应该提一下，你还记得2013年**约翰·克里**明确表示**门罗主义**已经结束，已经死了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: The Monroe Doctrine of I think it was 1823 I want to say basically said that America would assert its dominance over the entire American region. And since then it's changed a number of times. But the way it's being talked about now is as the Trump corollory or the Dawn Row doctrine which was described in the national security strategy document that the Trump administration put out back in December and that one's a little different. So we keep seeing these amendments to the doctrine. By the way, I should just say, do you remember back in 2013, John Kerry explicitly said that the Monroe doctrine was over? It was dead.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 我不记得了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I don't remember that.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 而现在它又回来了，复活了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And now it's back. It's arisen.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 某种形式的它肯定回来了。这很有趣，因为美国显然长期以来一直通过各种公开和秘密的行动，介入我们邻国的政治和内政，特别是在南美洲和中美洲。我想任何国家自然都会对其周边地区发生的事情有一些安全利益，这本身并不奇怪。我非常喜欢“**唐罗主义**”这个词，因为它包含两层意思。首先，美国长期以来一直希望在我们邻国的政治中扮演角色。但其次，**唐纳德·特朗普**本人还有一个特点，就是我们的许多政策和原则，感觉基本上就是“他是总统，他脑子里的想法，他的主意，因为是他的主意，而且他是总统，所以就是合法的”。所以，是的，有先例，有规范等等，但也有这种新奇之处，每个人都在试图揣摩他的心思。我们正处于一个非常非常奇怪的境地，这在我们最近的两期节目中也出现过，那就是总统在谈论石油。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Some version of it is certainly back. You know, it's very interesting because the US clearly has a longstanding history of various operations, overt and covert, of involving itself, shall we say, with the politics and domestic affairs of our neighbors, particularly in South and Central America and so forth. I suppose any country is naturally going to have some security interest in what's happening, its proximity. I don't think that itself is particularly weird. I really like this term, the Donroe doctrine, because there's two things. There's this long-standing history that the US wants to have a role to play in everyone else's politics among our neighbors. But then there's this other element with Donald Trump specifically where it feels like a lot of our policy and principle is essentially he's the president and what's in his head and his ideas are legitimate because they're his ideas and he's the president. So yes, there's precedents, there's norms and so forth, and then there is this sort of novelty that everyone's trying to read his mind. And we're in this very, very strange situation, which has come up on our last two episodes in which you have the president talking about oil.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 明确地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Explicitly. Yeah.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 然而人们却持怀疑态度。这非常奇怪，因为你不得不觉得“哦，他承认了，这是关于石油的”。然而每个人都在想：“除了这里，还有什么别的因素在起作用吗？”这完全颠覆了过去人们谈论我们国际干预的合法性或非合法性的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And yet people are like skeptical. It's very strange. It's a very strange situation because you have to like, oh, he admitted it. It's about oil. And yet everyone's like, is there something else at play beyond here? It's the total inversion for how people have talked in the past about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of how we involve ourselves internationally.

</details>

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 这也是最初**门罗主义**的一部分。在支持民主、反殖民主义、将欧洲列强拒之门外之间，存在一种奇怪的张力。美国基本上在建立自己的非正式殖民地。这种张力一直存在，我们应该讨论一下。我们应该讨论在**委内瑞拉**是否可能存在不同的策略和目标。我很乐意地说，我们确实邀请到了完美的嘉宾。我们将与**格雷格·格兰丁**教授交谈。他是**耶鲁大学**历史学教授，也是新书**《美国美国：新世界新历史》**的作者。格雷格，欢迎来到《奇思妙想》。非常感谢您的到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: That was part of the original Monroe doctrine as well. There was this weird tension between like pro-democracy, anticolonialism, keep the European powers out. And America basically kind of creating its own informal colonies. That tension has always been there and we should talk about that. We should talk about whether or not there might be different strategies at play in Venezuela, different goals. And I'm happy to say we do in fact have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Greg Grandon. He is a professor of history at Yale and the author of the new book America America: A New History of the New World. So, Greg, welcome to OddLots. Thanks so much for coming on.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 哦，谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Oh, thanks for having me.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: **门罗主义**在美国政策和发展史上究竟有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How important has the Monroe Doctrine actually been in the history of American policy and development?

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 嗯，它无疑具有影响力，而且多年来被反复引用。首先，我认为我们需要回顾一下，究竟是什么让它成为一个“主义”。它从未被投票通过，也没有法院批准它。它实际上直到1823年**詹姆斯·门罗**担任总统时被宣布几十年后，才获得“主义”的地位。当时，大多数西班牙裔美洲国家在成功的独立战争中脱离西班牙，这些战争比美国的独立战争持续时间更长、更拖沓。到1823年，西班牙显然即将失去其帝国。美国最终决定发表一份声明。你必须明白，该主义本身，或者说**门罗**的声明，实际上只是**国情咨文**中四五个不连续的段落，这份咨文有6000字。你需要仔细筛选**国情咨文**才能找到该主义。它犹豫不决，也十分谨慎。美国当时并不确定它想在任何特定问题上采取何种立场。**门罗**的内阁内部显然存在紧张和意见分歧。用更现代的术语来说，当时有孤立主义者、国际主义者和单边主义者。所以，不同的人对美国应该如何处理和应对南美洲、中美洲和墨西哥正在出现的新共和国，以及欧洲的前殖民统治者，有不同的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Well, it's certainly been influential and it's certainly been cited repeatedly over the years. First, I think we need to back up and say exactly what makes it a doctrine. It was never voted on. No court ratified it. It didn't actually assume the status of doctrine until a couple of decades after it was pronounced in 1823 when James Monroe was president at the time. And this was around the time that most Spanish American nations were breaking from Spain in their successful wars of independence which were much longer and dragged out than the US war for independence. By 1823, it was fairly clear that Spain was going to lose its empire. And the United States finally decided that it was going to issue a statement. And you have to understand that the doctrine itself or Monroe's statement, it's really just a kind of, you know, four or five non-ontiguous paragraphs in the State of the Union address of 6,000 words. You have to kind of cherrypick through the through the State of the Union address to find what is the doctrine. And it's hesitant. It's cautious. The United States wasn't really sure where it wanted to land on on any given issue. And there were obviously tensions and differences of opinions within Monroe's cabinet. I mean, to put it in more modern terms, you had isolationists, you had internationalists, you had unilateralists. So you had different people thinking of different ways on how the United States should address and deal with on the one hand these new republics that were coming into being in South America and in Central America and in Mexico and on the other hand their former colonial rulers in Europe.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 所以它实际上是由**约翰·昆西·亚当斯**撰写的，他是**门罗**的国务卿。正如我所说，它被插入到不同的部分。确实，它是一个有点矛盾的文件。一方面，它宣布美国认为拉丁美洲，或者当时称的西班牙裔美洲的独立是不可逆转的，并且它承认了一些已经建立有效主权并与西班牙断绝关系的国家。它警告欧洲，不仅是西班牙，还有任何西班牙可能招募来帮助他们的国家，或者**神圣罗马帝国**，或者**大英帝国**，不要试图征服或重新征服美洲的任何部分。这就是该主义的反殖民部分，再次强调，是在引号中的“主义”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And so it was actually written by John Quincy Adams who was Monroe's secretary of state. And as I said, it was inserted in different parts. And and it's true. It it is it is a bit of a contradictory document. On the one hand, it announces that the United States considers the independence of Latin America or at the time Spanish America to be irreversible and that it was recognizing a number of states that had established effective sovereignty and unbroken with Spain. And it warned off Europe, not just Spain, but any country Spain might recruit to help them or the Holy Roman Empire or a Great Britain against trying to conquer or reconquer the Americas, any part of the Americas. So that's the kind of anti-colonial part of the doctrine and again in quotation marks the doctrine.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 然后其他段落说，美国和西班牙裔美洲作为西半球的一部分，共享某些特殊利益和理想，尽管它没有具体说明这些利益和理想是什么，但人们普遍认为它们指的是君主制和共和制之间的区别。但至少，这是一种对拥有共同利益的民族兄弟情谊的姿态。所以这是**门罗主义**的另一部分。然后是提到的那一部分，它并没有赋予美国在维持半球治安方面太多的权力。它是一个模糊的句子，说美国将解释西半球任何地方发生的事件，以及它们如何影响“美国的和平与幸福”。所以，这是一个可以吸引美国国内许多不同群体的文件。比如**托马斯·杰斐逊**的扩张主义，这种认为新世界共享某种目的统一性的观念。**约翰·昆西·亚当斯**是一位著名的孤立主义者和单边主义者。所以有一种观念是，如果美国愿意，如果它看到了威胁，它就可以采取行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Then other paragraphs said that the United States and Spanish America being of the Western Hemisphere shared certain special interests and ideals although it didn't specify what those interests and ideals were but people kind of presumed they meant the difference between monarchy and republicanism but at least there was a kind of gesture to a kind of shared fraternity of nations that had common interests. And so that's another part of the Monroe Doctrine. And then there was the part that was referenced that it didn't exactly grant the United States much power in terms of policing the hemisphere. It was a vague sentence that said the United States would interpret events that happened anywhere in the Western Hemisphere on how they bear on the quote peace and happiness of the United States. It was you. So, so it was a document that could appeal to a lot of different constituencies within the United States. Like Thomas Jefferson's expansionism, this notion that, you know, the new world was shared a certain unity of purpose. John Quincy Adams was a famous isolationist and unilateralist. And so there was this notion of the United States could act if it wanted, if it saw a threat.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 你看，像**亨利·克莱**这样的人，他设想了一个庞大的美洲体系，一个重商主义体系，其中美国将成为一个巨大的制造业基地，而拉丁美洲、西班牙裔美洲将提供资源，以对抗**英国**和欧洲帝国。但重点是，它当时并没有多大作用。拉丁美洲人确实喜欢它。他们当时有很多时间阅读，那是一个不同的时代，没有iPhone，人们会仔细阅读，然后说：“哦，这个段落很有趣。”他们主要阅读和喜欢的是，他们认为这是一种对他们自己反殖民主义的“法庭之友意见书”。西班牙裔美洲人非常强烈地表达了他们的观点，即征服主义不再有效，发现主义也不再有效。新世界没有未被发现的土地等待欧洲人偶然发现并据为己有。他们认为**门罗主义**在很大程度上支持了这一立场，特别是警告欧洲不要试图重新征服任何已宣布独立的国家的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And you have somebody like Henry Klay who imagined a kind of large American system, a mercantile system in which the US would be a great manufacturing base and Latin America, Spanish America would supply resources in order to rival the United Kingdom and the empires of Europe. But the point being, it really wasn't much of anything. Latin Americans did like it. I mean, they had a lot of time to read. It was a different period. There were no iPhones. People read closely and said, "Oh, well, that that's an interesting paragraph." And what they read and liked mostly was they thought it was a they read it as a kind of amicus brief for their own anti-colonialism. Spanish Americans were very much vocal in their idea that the doctrine of conquest was no longer valid. The doctrine of discovery was no longer valid. There was no undiscovered land in the new world waiting for Europeans to stumble upon and claim as their own. And they read the Monroe Doctrine as largely supporting that position, especially the part that warned Europe against trying to reconquer any countries that had claimed their independence.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 但多年来，它被以不同的方式解读。政治家和外交官，特别是在与欧洲（比如**大英帝国**）的冲突中，当**大英帝国**想在中美洲修建运河时，那些模糊、零散的言论就被提升到了“主义”的层面，它变成了**门罗主义**。从那时起，它逐渐被纳入我们可能称之为**习惯法**的东西。我的意思是，再次强调，是什么让一个“主义”成为一个“主义”，谁来执行它？这真的只是一个权力问题，这回到了你在引言中谈到的国际法是什么以及如何执行的问题。我的意思是，大多数国家都有原则声明。美国有自己的“主义”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: But over the years, it was interpreted in a different way. Politicians and diplomats, particularly in skirmishes with with Europe, say Great Britain, when Great Britain wanted to build a canal through Central America. That was around the time that those kind of vague scattered remarks were elevated to the level of doctrine and it became the Monroe Doctrine or the doctrine of Monroe. And from that point forward, it was progressively incorporated into something we might call customary law. I mean, again, what makes a doctrine a doctrine and who gets to enforce it? It really is just a question of power goes to what you were talking about in the introduction about what is international law and and and how is it enforced. I mean, most countries have statements of principles. The United States gets its own doctrine.

</details>

### 美国在拉美的干预历史

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 是的，这真的很有趣，不是吗？因为在某种程度上，当我想到美国的干预时，感觉就像是我们在世界各地，在任何时候，只要我们觉得有必要，就会与**共产主义者**作斗争，这似乎是一个非常普遍的现象，并为民主而战，或者为任何与我们政府方式相似的国家而战。我们似乎原则上必须是干预者，或者我们觉得有义务进行干预。然后这里又有一个地理因素，这看起来非常不同。你能谈谈这种地理上的冲动，即在邻国之间施加影响，以及它如何与另一种原则或主义相交织吗？在这种原则或主义下，我们就是不喜欢某些领导人，当他们掌权时，我们就会尽力将他们清除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. It's really interesting, isn't it? Because like to some extent when I think about American involvement it's like all around the world at any time we sort of feel the need to fight against communists right that seems to be a very common thing and fight for democracies or any country that sort of has something similar to our way of government or something like that we seem to be on principle we have to be the ones or we feel compelled to intervene and then here is this geographical element that seems very different. Can you talk a little bit about the intersection of the geographical impulse to sort of exert your influence among your neighbors and how that intersects with this other I don't know we call it principle a doctrine etc where there are just certain kinds of leaders that we don't like and when they're in power we do what we can to eliminate them.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 是的。这涉及到美国的历史，它与自己半球的关系，以及它对拉丁美洲、西班牙裔美洲和**巴西**所施加的权力，以及它有时努力走向全球，成为一个更强大的全球超级大国。在很长一段时间里，美国曾多次试图摆脱其半球的限制，在不同时期成为世界大国，然后又退回到西半球。这种情况反复发生。它发生在**大萧条**时期，也发生在**越南战争**之后，美国又转向了拉丁美洲。当然，在灾难性的**反恐战争**之后也发生了。我的意思是，现在**特朗普**所做的事情在很多方面就是这种模式的一个例子。**特朗普**有他自己的问题，很多错误都是他造成的。但他确实继承了一个因灾难性的**反恐战争**、**金融危机**、以及政治家无法处理企业财富和不平等而陷入深刻危机的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Yes. And this goes to the history of the United States, its relationship to its own hemisphere and the power that it has exerted over the Latin America and Spanish America and Brazil and then its efforts at times to go global to become a more global superpower. There's been, you know, there's long different iterations of this in which the United States kind of tries to escape the boundaries of its hemisphere and become a world power at different moments and then and then it falls back to the Western Hemisphere. This has happened over and over again. It happened with the Great Depression. It happened in some ways with after Vietnam, the United States turned back to Latin America. It happened after the certainly after the catastrophic war on terror. I mean in many ways what's happening now with Trump is an example of this this kind of you know Trump is his own problem and a a lot of the things that are wrong is is of his doing. But he did inherit a country that was in profound crisis as a result of the catastrophic war on terror, the financial crisis, the inability of politicians to deal with the corporate wealth and inequality.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 所以，有一种回归拉丁美洲的趋势，如果我们愿意，稍后可以再谈这个。但**特朗普**在**委内瑞拉**的行动，完美地说明了当美国走向全球的尝试失败，不得不回到自己的半球时会发生什么。这就是为什么**门罗主义**如此重要。拉丁美洲是美国首次感受到自己作为海外强国的地方。它能够将其权力、金融权力、文化权力和军事权力投射到自己的边界之外。即使这样说也有点复杂，因为美国的边界一直在变化。我的意思是，美国的边界，其扩张性，它实际上夺取了**得克萨斯州**和**墨西哥**。所以，它不仅仅是与拉丁美洲打交道，它实际上是在通往太平洋的路上吞噬拉丁美洲。但撇开这一点不谈，在半球内运作并学习如何与其他国家打交道，拉丁美洲对此绝对至关重要。这也是**门罗主义**重要性上升的原因之一，因为它据说为此提供了一种指导方针。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And so there is a kind of turning back to Latin America and we can get to this a little bit later if you want, but Trump's actions in Venezuela are a perfect example of what happens when, you know, the United States, you know, its bid to go global fails and it has to return to its hemisphere. And that's why the Monroe Doctrine is so important. Latin America is the first place in which the United States got a sense of itself as an overseas power. You know, was able to project its power, its financial power, its cultural power, its military power beyond its own borders. And even saying that is a little bit tricky because the United States borders were always changing. I mean, the United States borders the expansive nature of the United States where it actually took Texas and took Mexico. So, it wasn't just that it was dealing with Latin America, it was literally gobbling up Latin America on its way to the Pacific. But setting that aside, working within the hemisphere and learning how to deal with other nations, Latin America is absolutely central to that. And that's one of the reasons why the Monroe doctrine rises in importance because it supposedly provides a kind of guideline for that.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 多年来，**门罗主义**本身也得到了扩展。总统们在**委内瑞拉**和**圭亚那**的边界争端中明确地扩展了它，当时美国支持**委内瑞拉**，而**大英帝国**支持**英属圭亚那**。**格罗弗·克利夫兰**宣布**门罗主义**赋予美国对整个西半球的绝对主权。这从“我们将解释任何影响我们和平与幸福的事件”跳跃到“通过法令，我们的意志在半球就是法律”，这是一个相当大的飞跃。然后在1904年，沿着类似的路线，**西奥多·罗斯福**担任总统时，他用自己的**推论**扩展了该主义，将其称为“国际警察权力”，以**镇压拉丁美洲的长期不法行为**。我必须说，这些长期不法行为大多是由**美国银行**、**美国雇佣兵**和**美国石油开采商**挑起的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Now over the years the Monroe doctrine itself has expanded. Presidents explicitly expanded over a boundary dispute in Venezuela and Guyana in which the United States was supporting Venezuela and Great Britain was supporting British Guyana. Grover Cleveland declared that the Monroe Doctrine granted the United States absolute sovereignty over the whole Western Hemisphere. That's a that's a pretty big jump from, you know, we're going to interpret any event that happens somewhere on our peace and happiness, our bears on our peace and happiness to by fiat, our will is law in the hemisphere. And then in 1904 along similar lines Theodore Roosevelt when he was president he expanded the doctrine with his own coralary to what he called international police power to suppress chronic wrongdoing in Latin America. Now I I must say that most of that chronic wrongdoing was provoked by US banks and US mercenaries and US oil extractors.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 有很长的历史，比如强迫国家接受它们无法偿还的贷款，这导致了各种不稳定，然后是内战，然后美国政府被召来解决这些私人利益制造的问题。所以**罗斯福**将**门罗主义**扩展成一种常设的普遍警察令，允许美国随时随地采取行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And there's a long history and of like forcing loans on countries that they can't pay off and it leads to all sorts of instability then civil war and then the US government is called in to settle the problem that these private interests created. So Roosevelt expands the Monroe Doctrine into a kind of standing universal police warrant that will allow the United States act whenever it will and whenever it wants.

</details>

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 那么，**富兰克林·罗斯福**难道没有重新解释它吗？但那并没有持续多久。是另一个**罗斯福**的重新解释吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, didn't FDR also reinterpret it, but it didn't last long. Another Roosevelt reinterpretation?

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 不，不完全是。但**富兰克林·罗斯福**实际上是180度大转弯。在1933年，他放弃了美国干预的权利。拉丁美洲的法学家、政治家和外交官长期以来一直要求放弃征服权。我的意思是，美国在整个19世纪一直坚持征服权。它基本上为**美墨战争**和**印第安人迁移**辩护。征服权在美国的教科书中一直教授到20世纪20年代。拉丁美洲在独立后就废除了征服权，因为西班牙裔美洲国家作为一个国家联盟共同诞生。七个国家必须在一个拥挤的大陆上学会彼此相处。美国作为一个单一国家诞生在广阔大陆的东海岸，它想象这片大陆是空旷的。显然，它并非空旷。有**美洲原住民**，有**墨西哥人**，有**西班牙人**，但美国毫无疑问会抵达太平洋，它坚持并利用征服主义来证明夺取所有这些土地是正当的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: No, not really. But FDR actually reversed course 180 degrees. And in 1933, he renounced the right of the United States to intervene. There's long-standing demands by Latin American jurists and politicians and diplomats to give up the right of conquest. I mean the United States continued to hold on to the right of conquest throughout the 19th century. It basically justified the war with Mexico, Indian removal. The right of conquest was taught in US textbooks up until the 1920s. Latin America had revoked the right of conquest with its independence because Spanish American nations came into the world together already a league of nations. Seven nations that had to learn to live with each other on a crowded continent. The United States came into being a single nation on the eastern coast of a great landmass that it imagined as empty. Obviously, it wasn't empty. There was Native Americans, there was Mexican, there was Spaniards, but the United States, there was no doubt that the United States was going to reach the Pacific and it held on and used the doctrine of conquest in order to justify taking all of that land.

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 拉丁美洲不断试图迫使美国接受征服主义已被废除、无效。直到1933年才实现，而正是**罗斯福**做到了这一点。他承认了拉丁美洲国家的绝对主权，并放弃了干预权。这是美国权力的一次巨大转变。它丝毫没有削弱美国的权力，实际上反而加强了它，因为它使其更加集中。它教会了美国如何更有效地行使权力，并组织了拉丁美洲。那是十年的善意，真正让拉丁美洲为即将到来的反法西斯战争做好了准备。**富兰克林·罗斯福**政府内部的战略家们非常担心，整个拉丁美洲可能会走上**西班牙**的道路。我的意思是，导致**西班牙**法西斯主义或长枪党崛起的许多社会变量在拉丁美洲也存在。有大量的农奴农民，一小部分土地所有者，贵族保守的天主教徒，以及日益好战的工会和农民威胁着地主阶级的权力。**西班牙**是如此，但广义上的拉丁美洲也是如此。如果拉丁美洲落入长枪党之手，那么美国就会被**纳粹主义**、**法西斯主义**和**长枪党**夹在中间。

**Greg Grandon**: Latin America was constantly trying to force the United States to accept that the doctrine of conquest was abregated, was void. And it wasn't until 1933 that it did. And it was Roosevelt who did that. And he he recognized the absolute sovereignty of Latin American nations. And he gave up the right of intervention. And that was an enormous turnaround in US power. It didn't weaken US power by any means. It actually strengthened it because it focused it. It taught the United States how to exercise power more efficiently and it and it organized Latin America. It was 10 years of goodwill that really got Latin America kind of on board for the coming war against fascism. There was a lot of fear among strategists within the Franklin Roosevelt administration that all of Latin America could have gone the way of Spain. I mean a lot of the sociological variables that led to the rise of fascism or philangism in Spain were present in Latin America. There was large group of surviile peasants, a small group of land owners, patrician conservative Catholics, an increasingly militant unions and peasants threatening the power of the landed class. That was Spain but it was also Latin America writ large and if Latin America fell to philanism then United States would be kind of cornered between Nazism, fascism and philangism.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: **罗斯福**对拉丁美洲放弃干预权的要求，基本上使拉丁美洲的政治倾向于左翼。**罗斯福**容忍了经济民族主义者。他允许**墨西哥**的革命者将**标准石油公司**国有化，并征用大量美国拥有的财产，这创造了巨大的善意，并为美国以实力和大陆团结的姿态进入**第二次世界大战**奠定了基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Roosevelt's conceding to Latin America's demand to give up the right to intervention basically tilted the playing field to the left in Latin America. Roosevelt tolerated economic nationalists. He let revolutionaries in Mexico nationalize Standard Oil and and appropriate massive amounts of US-owned property and it created enormous goodwill and and and set the stage for the United States's entrance into World War II from a position of strength and continental unity.

### 国际法的本质与权力关系

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 那么你提到了，在不同时期，拉丁美洲的法学家们反对美国绝对主权的概念以及这些斗争。这引出了一个问题，我经常在**推特**上看到有人争论：“国际法不存在。”“国际法是什么？国际法不存在。”这个词有用还是没用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So you mentioned okay at various times the jurists in Latin America they push back against this notion of American absolute sovereignty and these fights. This gets to a question. I see it debated on Twitter a lot. What do you say to someone who says international law doesn't exist? What is international law doesn't exist? And how is this term useful or not useful?

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 嗯，我是一名历史学家，不是律师或法学家。所以我倾向于从权力关系的角度看待事物。我认为法律是一个道德场所，它创造了一套规范性原则，人们可以在其中进行斗争。所以，国际法显然不是存在于某种绝对正义会发生的虚空中。最强大的国家决定例外情况。美国这样的国家在多大程度上服从国际法体系，通常是在弱势时刻，比如**罗斯福**在1933年**大萧条**最严重、**法西斯主义**崛起时所做的那样。但它确实创造了这些规范和原则，人们为此而斗争和争论。所以，是的，自1945年**联合国**成立以来，所谓治理世界的自由国际法秩序，其虚伪、差异和例外情况很多，总是有变通方法。美国和**苏联**当然找到了规避国际法对其施加的任何限制的方法。但它确实创造了一个场所，一个道德舞台，在其中可以理解和争论对错。贫穷和弱小的国家几乎没有其他办法来保护自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Well, I'm an historian. I'm not a I'm not a lawyer or a jurist. So, I tend to see things in terms of power relations. So I think I see law as a moral venue that is created that creates a set of normative principles in which people can fight over. So obviously the international law doesn't exist in some void in which absolute justice is is going to happen. The most powerful country decides the exception. And the United States to the degree that countries like the United States submit to a system of international law, it usually was during moments of weakness like when Roosevelt did it in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression and and with fascism on the rise. But it does create these norms and these principles that people fight and argue over and so yes and the liberal international law order that has supposedly governed the world since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. The hypocrisies and the variances and the exceptions are many and there's always workarounds and and the United States and and the Soviet Union certainly found ways to skirt, you know, any kind of limits that were placed on them by international law. But it does kind of create a venue, right, a moral arena in which right and wrong could be understood and argued over. There's very other very little recourse for poor and weak nations to defend themselves.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 我们可以回到**修昔底德**的观点，强者为所欲为，弱者逆来顺受。认为国际法某种程度上超越权力关系的概念，可能只是一种自负，但它至少为国家间相互交往创造了条件。拉丁美洲和美国就是一个完美的例子。拉丁美洲对主权和合作关系的承诺，很大程度上是在与当时正在成为世界历史上最强大国家（当它横跨太平洋，夺取**得克萨斯**、**墨西哥**、**古巴**、**波多黎各**、**巴拿马**时）的关系中形成的。所以，你看到这些法学家撰写法律书籍，提出这些法律原则。然而，它们实施的方式往往与权力息息相关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: I mean we can go back to ducidities right the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must and the conceit that there is such a thing as international law that is somehow transcendent of power relations is you know it might just be a conceit but it's still at least creates terms on which nations could deal with each other and and you know and and again Latin America and the United States is absolutely a perfect example of that for Latin America's commitment to sovereignty and to cooperative relations was largely forged in relationship to living under what was becoming the most powerful nation in world history as it moved across the Pacific as it took Texas, as it took Mexico, as it took Cuba, as it took Puerto Rico, as it took Panama. So you had these jurists like writing law books and coming up with these legal principles. And the way they get implemented though often is really about power.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 例如，20世纪初，当**意大利**、**英国**和**德国**的军舰出现在**委内瑞拉**试图追讨债务时，阿根廷的法学理论家**路易斯·德拉戈**提出了一个原则，即**德拉戈主义**，规定不能使用胁迫手段来追讨债务。现在，美国通过胁迫手段追讨了大量债务。我们可以看看**唐纳德·特朗普**和**委内瑞拉**现在发生的事情。但美国有点喜欢**德拉戈主义**，因为他们不希望**意大利**、**德国**和**英国**的军舰在**加勒比海**四处游荡，轰炸**哥伦比亚**或**委内瑞拉**的海岸，试图夺取海关以获取收入。他们认为“好吧，我们会支持**德拉戈主义**。这将给我们一个筹码，将欧洲挡在我们的后院之外。”所以你看到了法律作为一种超越社会权力的道德原则，但它显然又受制于社会权力并通过社会权力实施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: So Argentine legal theorists for instance Luis Drago for instance at the early 20th century when Italian and British and German warboats were showing up at Venezuela trying to collect debt. Debt that had gone back to the colony that European banks were claiming that Venezuela owed because the Spanish crown contracted loans in 1776 and whenever whenever they did, Luis Drago issued a principle, the Drago doctrine that you cannot use coercion to collect debt. Now, the United States collected plenty of debt through coercion. And we could we could look at Donald Trump and what's going on in Venezuela right now. But the United States kind of liked the Drago doctrine because they didn't want Italian and German and British warships flitting around the Caribbean bombing the coast of Colombia or or Venezuela trying to seize hold of the customhouse to get the receipts. They thought that okay, so we'll support the Drago doctrine. This this will give us a leverage in keeping Europe out of our backyard. So you you kind of see the back and forth between law as a kind of moral principle that transcends social power, but then it's, you know, it's obviously subordinated and implemented through social power.

### 委内瑞拉行动的真实目标

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 你对**委内瑞拉**行动背后的实际目标有什么看法？因为如果你看**国家安全战略文件**，他们谈到美国在西半球重新确立其优势地位。我不知道你如何衡量优势地位，对吧？这似乎是一个相当宽泛的术语。与此同时，**特朗普**非常明确地谈到**委内瑞拉**的石油属于美国。目前没有政权更迭的迹象，他们也没有为此施压。那么，所有这一切的最终目标是什么？他们想达到什么目的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What's your sense of the actual goals behind the Venezuela move? Because if you look at the national security strategy document, they talk about the US reasserting its preeeminence in the Western Hemisphere. And I don't know how you measure preeeminence, right? That seems a pretty broad term. Meanwhile, Trump has talked very explicitly about Venezuelan oil belonging to the US. There's no regime change on the horizon. They're not pressing for that. So, what is the ultimate goal of all of this? What are they aiming for?

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 嗯，很难说。正如我之前所说，**特朗普**正在做他的许多前任在美国世界影响力衰退时所做的事情。他们转向拉丁美洲。但在某些方面，这纯粹是**特朗普主义**，对吧？这只是一种戏剧性的表演。他说这是为了石油。嗯，首先是为了移民，然后是为了帮派，然后是为了**芬太尼**和毒品，然后他才落脚到石油，夺回我们的石油。石油价格正处于历史低点，也许不是历史最低点，但相当低。市场充斥着石油，要让**委内瑞拉**恢复生产需要巨大的资本投资，并没有多少石油公司急着涌入**委内瑞拉**做这件事。我认为**特朗普**只是在迎合他的基本盘。我认为他的基本盘喜欢**特朗普**作为海盗、作为殖民掠夺者的想法。是的，我们会夺回我们的石油。就像2003年的**伊拉克战争**一样，总是有办法获得石油的，对吧？有很多方法可以获得石油。你不需要发动一场全球**反恐战争**来确保**伊拉克**的石油。你本可以与**萨达姆·侯赛因**达成协议，获得石油。你也可以对**委内瑞拉**做同样的事情。所以物质利益总是通过意识形态的棱镜来理解的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Well, you know, it's hard to say. As I said earlier, Trump is doing what a number of his predecessors have done during moments of of US kind of recession of US power in the world. They turn back to Latin America. But in some ways it's pure Trumpism, right? It's just this theatrical spectacle. You know, he said it was about oil. Well, first it was about immigration, then it was about gangs, then it was about fentanyl and drugs, and then he then he landed on oil, getting our oil back. Oil is trading at an all-time low. Maybe not an all-time low, but it's pretty low. The market is filled fluttered with oil and to get Venezuela back online is going to cost an enormous amount of capital investment and there's not a lot of oil companies that are rushing. They're going to rush into Venezuela then do that. You know, I think Trump there was just playing to his base. I think he was he was, you know, I think his base likes the idea of Trump as a pirate, Trump as a colonial plunderer, you know, and and yeah, yeah, we'll get our oil back. You know, just like with the Iraq war in 2003, there's always ways to get oil, right? There's many ways to get oil. Like, you don't have to start a a global war on terror in order to secure Iraqi oil. You could have just, you know, made a deal with Saddam Hussein and got the oil. You could have did the same thing with, you know, so material interests are always understood through a prism of ideology.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 所以，其中一部分原因是**委内瑞拉**长期以来一直处于危机之中。这是一个完全不同的故事，适合另一期节目。一个像美国这样的霸权国家不能容忍这种危机。数百万**委内瑞拉**人正在逃离这个国家。你不需要支持**特朗普**的本土主义和他的边境政策，就可以说这种混乱和动荡不能在一个地区霸权的腹地永远持续下去。所以你必须做点什么。问题是，你要做什么？**特朗普**似乎喜欢这些有针对性的袭击，对吧？无论是**伊朗**，还是**尼日利亚**，这些“一次性”的袭击。我认为他被说服了，认为只要除掉**马杜罗**，并保持**马杜罗**政权完好无损，因为它已经深深植根于**委内瑞拉**社会。我认为**马可·卢比奥**的**国务院**里有几个聪明人，他们不想看到2003年**伊拉克**“去复兴党化”后完全混乱的重演。所以**特朗普**被说服了，认为你只要做这种“一次性”的事情，然后继续威胁这个国家。这符合他的行事方式。没有道德，没有规范感，没有理想主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And so, part of it was that Venezuela has been in crisis for a long time. I mean, that's a whole another story for a whole another show. And you know, a hedgeimon like the United States can't have that kind of crisis. I mean, millions of Venezuelans were fleeing the country. I mean, you don't have to be carrying water for Trump's nivism and his border policies at all to say that that kind of disruption and that kind of chaos can't go on forever in a regional hegeimon's hinterland. And so, you have to kind of do something. The question is, what are you going to do? And Trump seems to like these targeted attacks, right? Whether they're in Iran, whether in the in Nigeria, these oneanddone attacks. And I think he was sold on the idea that, you know, if they just took out Maduro and left the Maduro state intact, because it is very much ingrained and embedded in Venezuelan society. I think there were a couple of intelligent people in Marco Rubio's State Department that didn't want to see a repeat of 2003 with what happened after debatification in Iraq, the complete chaos. So Trump was convinced that you, you know, you do this one and done thing and then you just kind of continue to threaten the country in order to it it corresponds to his way of being. There's no morality. There's no normative sense. There's no idealism.

### 特朗普主义与“美国优先”

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 通常情况下，当总统在全球危机后转向拉丁美洲以重组或再平衡时，他们会提出新的世界观，以扩大他们的选民基础，深化他们的联盟，他们会试图创造一种霸权感。所以**富兰克林·罗斯福**利用拉丁美洲提出了一种社会民主的**大陆新政**，而**里根**在**越南战争**后提出了一种强硬的反**共产主义**自由主义，但这是从道德角度理解的，是对美国目的的重新肯定，美国将自己定位为世界自由的捍卫者。这些都成为了持久的执政意识形态。我的意思是，**新政联盟**持续了几十年，直到20世纪70年代。**里根主义**至少持续到**巴拉克·奥巴马**时期，甚至更久，就世界观而言。我的意思是，**特朗普**甚至没有试图拼凑出一种新的世界观，对吧？**特朗普**没有提出任何形式的，他不是为了自由而这么做，他不是为了个人权利而这么做，他当然不是为了社会民主而这么做。他是在要求进贡，对吧？他只是想把**委内瑞拉**变成一个附庸国。但我认为这说明了他和他的政治运动的道德空虚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Normally when presidents turn back to Latin America to kind of regroup or rebalance after global crisis, they kind of come up with new kind of world views to widen their electoral base to deepen their coalition to, you know, they try to create a sense of hijgemony. Right? So you had FDR using Latin America to put forth a kind of social democratic continental New Deal and Reagan after Vietnam a kind of muscular anti-communist liberalism but understood in moral terms a kind of reassertion of American purpose American sets of itself as a defender of world freedom and and these become kind of governing ideologies that are durable able they last. I mean, the New Deal coalition lasted for decades up until the 1970s. Reaganism lasted, you know, at least until Barack Obama, if not if not even even further in terms of the world view. I mean, Trump isn't even trying to cobble together a new world view, right? Trump isn't coming up with any kind of, you know, it's he's not doing it for freedom. He's not doing it for individual rights. He's not he's certainly not doing it for social democracy, you know, he's demanding tribute, right? He's just trying to turn Venezuela into a vassal state. But I think that speaks to the moral emptiness of him and his and and his political movement.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: **里根**和**富兰克林·罗斯福**都主持了多数派运动，对吧？他们在选举中取得了压倒性胜利。**特朗普**基本上是在运作一个少数派运动，之所以掌权，仅仅是因为美国的**反多数派政治结构**和**特朗普**对**共和党**的控制。所以，他似乎根本不感兴趣将**特朗普主义**转变为一个执政联盟。他只是想继续煽动**文化战争**，继续煽动“**美国优先**”民族主义者的不满情绪，因此才有了**门罗主义**。我的意思是，回到**门罗主义**，**门罗主义**和“**美国优先**”民族主义之间一直存在着强烈的关联。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: And Reagan and FDR presided over majoritarian movements, right? They won overwhelmingly at the electoral. Trump pretty much is running a minority movement that is only in power because of the anti-majoritarian political structure of the United States and Trump's dominance of the Republican party. So, he doesn't seem interested at all in turning Trumpism into a governing coalition. He just wants to continue to stoke the culture wars, continue to, you know, stoke the grievances of tribal nationalism of the American firsters and hence the Monroe Doctrine. You know, to bring it back to the Monroe Doctrine, the Monroe Doctrine and American First Nationalism, there was always a strong kind of correlation between the two.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: “**美国优先**”民族主义者，即使是**特朗普**之前的那些，20世纪20年代直到**第二次世界大战**的那些人，他们也喜欢**门罗主义**，因为它不是普世主义的，它不是国际法。它是专门与美国在其半球内的权力相关的**习惯法**。所以**门罗主义**，**特朗普**作为当今“**美国优先**”民族主义的旗手，会抓住**门罗主义**作为**自由国际主义**的替代品，这很合理。是的，我认为这可能是所有这些中最引人入胜的元素，完全缺乏伪装，对吧？显然，你提到在不同时期，国际政策都有一些故事情节。我们都知道我们打算把**伊拉克**变成一个民主国家，然后这会在中东蔓延，然后会有其他民主国家，然后会变得富裕和稳定等等。总有一些故事。我认为**特朗普主义**，或者至少是这次特定的行动，最引人注目的是完全缺乏一个更宏大的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: American first nationalists, right? Even the the pre-Trump ones, the ones from the 1920s and leading up into World War II, they liked the Monroe Doctrine because it wasn't universalist. It wasn't international law. It was customary law specifically related to US power within its hemisphere. And so the Monroe Doctrine, it makes sense that Trump as the standard bearer of today's iteration of America first nationalism would latch on to the Monroe Doctrine as a kind of substitute for liberal internationalism. Yeah, I think this is maybe the most fascinating element of all the complete lack of pretense really, right? And obviously you mentioned at various times international policy has had some storyline. We all know what the story we were going to turn Iraq into a democracy and then that would spread throughout the Middle East and then there would be other democracies and then be rich and be stable etc. There's some story. I think that is so striking about Trumpism or at least this particular move really just sort of the complete lack of like a broader story.

</details>

### 历史先例与“一次性”干预

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 你还提到了，当然，我认为**特朗普**外交政策值得注意的是，这种“一次性”行动的吸引力。因为**伊拉克战争**后，似乎出现了一种全国性的反弹，或者至少在**阿富汗战争**后，对“地面部队”、“长期战争”、“永久战争”等产生了反弹。但似乎也存在一种冲动，就是“是的，但我们仍然想做一些有影响力的事情。我们仍然想展示我们很强硬。”所以他们解决问题的方式就是这些“一次性”行动。我们将在**伊朗**进行一次轰炸。我们将逮捕一位外国领导人。这有任何先例吗？或者当你想到这些外交政策的轨迹时，这真的感觉像是一片**未知领域**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: You mentioned also of course which I think is notable about Trump foreign policy this appeal of these sort of oneandone things because okay there seems to be post Iraq this sort of national backlash towards or certainly post Afghanistan this backlash towards boots on the ground long wars forever wars etc. But there also does seem to be this impulse of just, yeah, but we still want to do something powerful. We still want to show that we're tough. And so then the way that they solve the problem is by these one-offs. We're going to do a one bombing run in Iran. We're going to arrest a foreign leader. Is there any precedent for that or is this truly like sort of feel uncharted territory when you think about these arcs of foreign policy?

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 是的。在拉丁美洲，有两个先例。一个是1989年的**曼努埃尔·诺列加**，当时**老布什**派了大约3万名海军陆战队员去逮捕**诺列加**。这被视为一次**警察行动**，并以此作为法律依据。**诺列加**是美国的盟友，是20世纪80年代**中央情报局**的资产。他深度参与了**伊朗门事件**的复杂性，但他玩弄各方。我认为他向**古巴**出售情报，也与**摩萨德**合作。当**冷战**结束，**柏林墙**倒塌时，他的利用价值基本消失了，美国决定除掉他。**《纽约时报》**有一篇**中央情报局**报告，详细描述了他深度参与贩毒，这再也无法忽视。所以他们进去逮捕了他。这是一个先例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: Yeah. Yeah. Well, in Latin America, there are two precedents. One is obviously Manuel Noriega in 1989 when George H.W. Bush sent about 30,000 Marines in to capture Noriega on a on a warrant basically to arrest him. It was considered a police action and and that's how it was legally justified. Noriega was an ally of the United States. He was a CIA asset in the 1980s. He was very much involved in the complexities of Iran Contra, but he played all sides against the other. I think he was selling information and intelligence to Cuba. He was also working with Mossad. And when the cold war ended and the Berlin wall fell, his usefulness had largely come to an end and the United States decided that they were going to take him out. There was a Saiy report in the New York Times that detailed his deep involvement in drug running and and it couldn't be ignored anymore. And so they went in and they arrested him. So that's one president.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 另一个较少被讨论的先例是2005年**海地**的**让-贝特朗·阿里斯蒂德**。他是**海地**总统，发生了一场美国支持的政变，但这是一场由**民主促进组织**（由援助和**国家民主基金会**资助）实施的政变，这些组织使国家动荡不安，以至于**阿里斯蒂德**无法执政。**小布什**派海军陆战队员进去，基本上用枪指着他的头，然后把他送到了**刚果**，他至今仍在那里流亡。所以，这种情况以前发生过。我认为前所未有的是，我们只是接受**委内瑞拉**的石油进贡，我们只是向**委内瑞拉**政府发出这些指令，他们就会照办。我的意思是，我们谈论国际法。所有这些都只是美国单方面投射其权力。我的意思是，美国对**委内瑞拉**实施了制裁。那不是国际法。新闻报道说**委内瑞拉**试图通过寻找变通方法出售石油来违反制裁。这就像，“为什么不呢？那是他们的石油。”美国只是实施制裁，并不是世界各国投票决定对**委内瑞拉**实施制裁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: A lesser discussed one is in Haiti in 2005. Jean Petron Adersteed was president of Haiti and there was a USbacked coup but it was one of these coups that were kind of carried out by democracy promotion organizations that were funded by aid and the National Endowment for Democracy that destabilized the country to the point where Irish couldn't govern and George W. Bush sent Marines in and basically put a gun to his head and and and flew him to the Congo where he still lives now where is in exile. So So it's happened before. I think what is unprecedented is this idea that we are just going to accept oil tribute from Venezuela that we're just going to give these directives to the Venezuelan government and they're going to send I mean I mean we talk about international law. All of this stuff is just unilateral US projections of its power. I mean, the United States placed sanctions on Venezuela. That's not international law. I mean, news the papers talk about it as, you know, Venezuela is trying to violate sanctions by finding workarounds to sell its oil. It's like, why not? It's their oil. It's the United States just putting the sanctions on just because it's not like it's not like the nations of the world voted on putting sanctions on Venezuela.

</details>

**格雷格·格兰丁**: 但无论如何，我认为前所未有的是他们正在摸索出的东西，他们似乎是在“走一步看一步”。他们似乎没有一个明确的计划。你说得对，他们不想重演2003年的**伊拉克战争**。他们不想要地面部队。他们知道**特朗普**的支持者对伤亡的容忍度很低，“**美国优先**”民族主义也不想参与**国家建设**。但我认为你看到的是两种不同的轨迹。一方面，他们设想某种系统，让**委内瑞拉**通过石油继续向美国进贡。但当**马可·卢比奥**谈论此事时，他说：“我们已经为**委内瑞拉**的重建和向民主过渡规划了不同的阶段。”这暗示了在政治上更直接地推动国家走向某个方向，而不仅仅是只要它继续输送石油，就让它保持原样，就像殖民时代一样。殖民地将装满黄金的船只送往**西班牙**。现在他们将装满石油的船只送往**德克萨斯州亚瑟港**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg Grandon**: But in any case, I think what is unprecedented is what they're working out and they seem to be working it out on a as you go basis. It doesn't seem like they have a clear plan. You're right. They don't want it to be 2003 Iraq. They don't want boots on the ground. They know the rank and file of Trump. It has a very low tolerance for for casualties and and fatalities and America first nationalism doesn't doesn't want to be involved in nation building. But what you're seeing is, I think, two distinct trajectories. On the one hand, they're imagining some system in which that Venezuela just continues to kind of pay a tribute to the United States through oil. But then when Marco Rubio talks about it, he says, well, we have these different phases of reconstruction and transition to democracy planned out in Venezuela. So that kind of suggests more of a direct role in pushing the country in a certain direction politically, not just leaving it as it is as long as it continues to send the ships, you know, just like during colonial times. I mean, the colony sent the ships filled with gold to Spain. Now they're sending the ships filled with oil to Port Arthur, Texas.

**特蕾西·阿洛威**: 而且很有趣的是，美国存在这样一种历史模式：当我们在内部虚弱时，我们就会去拉丁美洲施加主导。当然，我认为人们会同意，美国在许多方面都感到特别虚弱。显然，存在一种生存威胁，对**中国**崛起的焦虑等等。所以也许就是这种事情。好吧，我们至少暂时不会再是曾经的全球大国了，但在这种缺失的情况下，至少我们仍然可以确立，我们有权决定各个拉丁美洲国家的总统是谁。

**Tracy Alloway**: And it's very interesting that there's this pattern, this historical pattern in the United States that essentially Latin America is where we go to dominate when we're internally weak. And of course, I think people would agree that the US is feeling particularly weak on a number of angles. There's obviously the sort of existential threat, anxiety about the rise of China, etc. So maybe it's this kind of thing. Okay, we are not going to be at least for the moment the global power that we once were, etc. But in the absence of that, at least we can still establish that we get to decide who the president of various Latin American states are.

**乔·艾森塔尔**: 对吧？拉丁美洲的主导力量。顺便问一下，你见过**马可·卢比奥**的那个表情包吗？他身上盖满了各种拉丁美洲国家的旗帜，基本上对所有事情负责。

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right? Latin American dominant power. By the way, have you seen the Marco Rubio meme where he's like covered in all these different flags from Latin America basically responsible for everything?

So, he gets to be involved in taking out a Latin American leader, which he finds to be hostile, but the idea that like it does not feel like this administration is going to have much follow through in terms of, okay, now we really want to set Venezuela on a new political course,
