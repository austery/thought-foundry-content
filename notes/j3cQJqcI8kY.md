title: 为何我们如此怀旧？心理学家的深度解析
---

### 怀旧的本质：慰藉与逃避现实的联系

有时你就是想和一些老电视朋友一起度过时光。他们会像过去一样在你身边，但他们也能让你产生向往。怀旧并非总是令人愉悦的。那么，我们为什么会为了慰藉、为了向往，或是两者兼而有之而观看旧的喜爱节目呢？我从心理学家和认知科学家那里获得了一些见解。

<p class="english-text">Sometimes you just want to hang out with some old TV friends. They'll be there for you like they've been there before, but they can also make you yearn. Nostalgia isn't only pleasurable. So why do we watch the old favourites for the comfort, for the longing or both? I got insights from psychologists and cognitive scientists.</p>

### 研究背景：不确定性如何驱动怀旧

乔治·E·纽曼（George E Newman），多伦多大学罗特曼管理学院的管理与营销学副教授。乔治，很高兴能请到您。您最近怎么样？很高兴能邀请到我。当然，我想请您先为我们梳理一下思路。怀旧在这里，逃避现实在那里。它们是如何联系起来的？是的。在我们工作中发现，怀旧能提供一种逃避现实的方式，尤其是在时局感觉不确定的时期。所以，如果感觉世界有点摇摇欲坠，人们就更有可能抓住怀旧不放。请您谈谈这项研究的背景以及你们想探讨什么。当然。在我们的实验中，我们把人们带到校园里的一个实验室。然后让他们进来，那里有一个黑胶唱片播放器，播放着西蒙与加芬克尔（Simon Garfunkel）的唱片。我们说，好了，我们想让你听这张唱片，然后告诉我们你享受它的程度，这次体验有多好。但我们有两种不同的研究版本，在其中一个版本中，在他们听唱片之前，他们读到的是现在情况可能有些不确定，但如果看看很多统计数据，其实情况并没有那么糟。而在另一种情况下，他们读到的是，嗯，现在情况很糟糕，而且确实如此。它们非常不确定。我们发现，在人们读到当前时期不确定或不稳定的情况后，他们实际上更喜欢听唱片的体验。

<p class="english-text">George E Newman, an associate professor of management and marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. George, great to have you. How are you doing? Great, great. Thanks so much for having me. Of course, I want you to first start off with connecting the dots for us. Nostalgia over here, escapism here. How are they connected? Yeah. So in our work, what we find is that nostalgia provides this kind of escapism, especially when times are feeling uncertain. So if it feels like the world is a bit shaky, people are more likely to cling to nostalgia. Tell us a little bit about the context of the study and what you wanted to look at. Sure. So in our experiment, what we did is we brought people into a laboratory on campus. And then we had they came in and there's a vinyl record player and it's Simon Garfunkel record. And we said, okay, we want you to listen to this record and tell us how much you enjoy it, how good the experience is. But we had two different versions of the study, and in one study before they listened to the record, they read about how well things seem maybe uncertain right now, but if you look at a lot of statistics, it actually it's not so bad. And then in the other condition they read, well, things seem bad now and they really are. They're very uncertain. And what we found is that in the situations in which people had read about how the current times were uncertain or unstable, they actually liked the experience of listening to the record more.</p>

### 追溯过去：我们寻找的是什么？

在那些我们寻找黑胶唱片、老电视节目等事物中，如今你可以在任何流媒体服务上轻松找到它们，然后说：“哦，那是美好的旧时光。”当我们回顾过去时，我们具体在寻找什么？是的，这确实很有趣，因为很多这种联系似乎是关于一种集体的怀旧感，也许不是你童年时期必然存在的东西，而是我们与更广泛文化相关联的事物。而这正是对我们具有吸引力的，尤其是在这些不确定的时期。您说“集体的”，我们指的是什么？请举个例子。所以，集体感，你知道，可能是一些事物，比如打字机或黑胶唱片。有趣的是，我们发现，你知道，老产品，比如说，过去的答录机，尽管它们是过去的一部分，但它们并没有那种怀旧感。对于那些看着怀旧事物的人来说，他们是否一定亲身经历过，还是这是他们产生共鸣和联系，然后说，“哦，我认为这是过去发生的事情”，或者这是一种直接联系，比如打字机或其他任何东西？这是一个很好的问题，我们对此感到非常惊讶。但在我们的工作中，我们实际上发现，这与那些可能不是你童年一部分的事物有关。比如黑胶唱片，销量第一的黑胶唱片是泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift）的。你知道，所以这表明是年轻消费者，年轻的音乐听众，他们可能从未体验过黑胶唱片，尤其是在他们自己的童年时期。但这种联系和依恋感确实很有吸引力。

<p class="english-text">In terms of the things that we look for vinyl records, old TV shows, which nowadays you can just pop on, you know, any streaming service and be like, oh, the good old times. What are we looking for specifically when we are looking into the past? Yeah. So it's really fascinating because a lot of that connection seems to be about like a communal sense of nostalgia, maybe not something that was necessarily part of your own childhood, but things that we associate with the broader culture. And that's really what becomes attractive to us, especially in these times of uncertainty. Well, you mean communal. What are we talking about? Give us an example. So communal, you know, it could be things like typewriters or vinyl records. And interestingly, we find that, you know, older products, let's say, from the past, like answering machines, even though they were part of the past, they don't have that same kind of sense of nostalgia. Is it fair to say that for people who are looking at something that's nostalgic, have they necessarily lived through it themselves, or is this something that they have that they kind of sort of resonate and connect with and be like, oh, I think that is something that happened in the past, or is it a direct connection to something like a typewriter or anything else? It's a great question, and we were really surprised by this. But in our work, we actually found that it's about things that maybe weren't part of your own childhood. So like vinyl records, the number one selling vinyl record is Taylor Swift. Okay. You know, so it's suggesting that it's younger consumers, younger music listeners who probably never experienced a vinyl record, certainly as part of their own childhood. But there's something about that connection and attachment that makes it really attractive.</p>

### 复古风潮：怀旧如何驱动文化与消费

我们经常听到“复古”这个词，人们说：“哦，那太复古了。”事物又回来了。怀旧是如何驱动文化潮流的？您提到了消费主义。归根结底，这如何影响人们的看法和购买行为？是的，在这些不确定的时期，人们都在回顾过去。这不仅仅关乎产品。它关乎我们所认为的过去的图像、联想和生活方式。所以，最终，这是关于试图连接到另一个时代，也许是我们认为更稳定的时代。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We hear the word retro a lot and people are like, oh, that's so retro. That's so in things have made their way back. How does nostalgia drive cultural trends? You mentioned consumerism. How does that help what people view, what people buy at the end of the day? Yeah. So what we find in these times of uncertainty and people are kind of looking back to the past. It's it's not just about products. It's kind of images, associations, ways of life that we think about in the past. So, you know, ultimately it's about trying to connect to a different time period, maybe one that we think about as being more stable.</p>

### 过去的“简单”与“真实”：一种“玫瑰色眼镜”的视角

我要变得个人化一些了。对您来说，有没有什么事情是您会回顾并说：“好吧，在不确定的时期，您会倾向于怀旧吗？”完全有。嗯，你知道，当我们做这项研究时，我们研究的一部分是让本科生在实验室里听黑胶唱片，我小时候也曾收藏黑胶唱片，这让我重新对它产生了兴趣，然后意识到黑胶唱片非常昂贵。是的，是的。但但你知道，所以我也收藏了一些。我真的很喜欢老照片。拥有那张实体照片，感觉很特别。所以不是黑白的，我们说的是彩色的，但仍然是。是的，是的，是的。我认为拥有一张实体照片，对我个人来说，它起到了同样的作用，这真的很不错。有一种观点或看法认为，过去更简单、更真实。这是我们追求过去的一个因素吗？在某些方面，这是真的吗？我认为这是大多数人都有的看法，我们认为那些时代更简单，但它们真的真实吗？这非常有趣。所以那里的研究表明，我们戴着一副“玫瑰色眼镜”。当我们回想过去时，我们倾向于过滤掉所有的负面因素，所有的困难，你知道，预期寿命更短，获得医疗护理更困难，所有这些我们可能不常想到的事情。我们认为过去是一个简单、快乐的时光。所以我们可能会忽略一些负面细节。

<p class="english-text">I'm going to get personal with you. Is there something for you that you kind of look back at and go like, okay, in times of, you know, uncertainty that you lean into the nostalgia of totally. Well, you know, when we were doing this research, part of the studies that we were doing is we were having undergraduate students listen to vinyl records in the lab, and I used to have a vinyl record collection as a kid, and it got me interested in it again, and then realised that vinyl records are very expensive. Yeah, yeah. But but you know, so I've done a little bit of collecting. I also really like old photographs. There's something about having the, the tangible photo. So not black and white. We're talking coloured but still. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think there's something that's really nice about having that, that physical photo that for me personally kind of serves the same function. There is this idea or perception that the past was simpler, more authentic. Is this a factor in sort of our reach for for the past? In some ways? Is it true? I think is what most people kind of we have this perception that those times are were simpler, but are they actually true? It's really interesting. So the research there suggests that there's a bit of rose coloured glasses. When we think about the past that we tend to filter out all of the negatives, all the difficulty, you know, life expectancies were shorter, it was harder to get medical care, all of those kinds of things that we don't maybe normally think of. We think about the past as this simpler, happy time. And so we might kind of gloss over some of those negative details.</p>

### 简单时代与个人责任

但可以说，在某些情况下，简单时代也意味着年轻时责任较少。所以我们可以回顾那些日子，然后说，“当然，它们很简单。”你知道，我们不必支付账单或房贷，或者，你知道，跑腿。是的。你知道，集体怀旧感和个人怀旧感之间有一种模糊。我认为你说得完全正确，当我们想到过去时，我们可以把这两件事混淆，然后说，对我来说，那要简单得多。我只需要四处跑跑玩耍，那一定是一段美好的时光。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is it fair to say, though, simpler times were also probably in some cases younger didn't have a lot of responsibility. So we can look back at those days and kind of go like, well, of course they were simpler. You know, we didn't have to pay bills or a mortgage or, you know, run errands. Yeah. You know, and there's kind of like the blurring between a communal sense of nostalgia and our own personal nostalgia. And I think you're exactly right that when we're thinking about the past, we can kind of mix those two things up and say, it was a lot simpler for me. I just had to run around and play outside, and it must have been a nice time.</p>

### 真人秀的真实性悖论

我发现有趣的是，人们说他们也想见证真实性，但同时我们又有一种观看真人秀（Reality TV）的冲动。我很好奇，为什么我们会 binge 看那些似乎违背真实性渴望的真人秀节目？我认为那也很有趣。我的意思是，真实性在不同的意义上存在，对吧？它就像是人们私人生活的窗口。也许是那些他们会有点羞于展示的事情。所以，我认为真人秀的刺激之处在于看到那种幕后的景象。所以这是另一种意义上的真实性。它可能不是关于我们文化的真实性，而是关于某些类型的人或某种生活方式的真实性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What I find fascinating is people say they want to witness authenticity as well, but then we have this sort of urge to watch shows like reality TV. And I am curious, you know, why do we binge reality TV shows that seem to sort of defy that desire of authenticity? I think that's really fascinating, too. I mean, there's authenticity in a different sense, right? That that it's kind of a window into people's private lives. Maybe the things that they would be a little bit ashamed of showing it. So that's part of the excitement, I think, of reality TV is seeing that behind the scenes look. So it's a different sense of authenticity. It's maybe not authenticity with respect to our culture, but authenticity more having to do with, you know, certain kinds of people or a certain kind of lifestyle.</p>

### 从历史中汲取灵感：创新如何发生

您有一本名为《伟大的想法是如何产生的》（How Great Ideas Happen）的书，这本书着眼于过去以及它如何驱动创新想法。请告诉我，回顾历史书籍是如何做到这一点的？《伟大的想法是如何产生的》这本书，其中很大一部分确实是着眼于过去，并能够借鉴过去的想法来激发新的想法。所以，你知道，一个家喻户晓的成功故事，比如Instant Pot（即时锅），你知道，回顾一下Crock-Pot（慢炖锅），它已经存在了很长时间，但你知道，把它拿过来，重新配置它，创造出新的东西；或者像Hamilton（汉密尔顿），它打破了百老汇的记录。但那实际上是关于关注一段可能被忽视的历史，或者至少没有被充分讨论的历史，并将其推到前台，并赋予它非常独特的个人视角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have a book out called How Great Ideas Happen, and that looks at sort of the past and how it can drive innovative ideas. Tell me, how can taking a look back through the history books do that? So how great ideas happen is definitely a big part of it is looking towards the past and being able to draw on past ideas to fuel new ones. So you know a hometown success story, the Instant Pot, you know, looking back to crock pots, which had been around for a very long time, but, you know, taking it and reconfiguring it and making something new or Hamilton, you know, which just kind of smashed Broadway records. But that was really about focusing on a piece of history that maybe had been overlooked, or at least not talked about quite as much, and bringing that to the fore and putting a very unique individual spin on it.</p>

### 发现未来的伟大想法

有没有一个伟大的想法正在等待被发现，您认为它正处于我们回顾过去的过程中？我的意思是，在整本书中，我确实试图提出这样一个观点，即创造力和创新是我们所有人都可以获得的，而且伟大的想法就在我们脚下。它真的只是关于关注、响应、审视你的环境，在这种情况下，也审视你的过去。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is there a great idea that is waiting to be discovered that you think is just on the cusp of us kind of looking in the past? I mean, throughout the book, I really try to bring up this idea that that creativity and innovation is something that's available to all of us and that there are great ideas underneath our feet. It's really just about paying attention, being responsive, looking to your environment and in this case, also looking to the past.</p>

### 个人怀旧偏好：80年代的约翰·休斯电影

您会推荐什么？在不确定的时期，您想回到怀旧的时光，您会怎么做？对我来说。作为一个80年代的孩子，一切都围绕着80年代的电影，比如约翰·休斯（John Hughes）的电影，对我个人来说，这是一种真正的怀旧感。是的。好的，乔治，我们就聊到这里。非常感谢您。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">What would you recommend? What is your go to in times of uncertainty? And you want to sort of to back into a time of nostalgia. What do you do? Well, for me. As a as a child of the 1980s, it's all about those 1980s movies like the John Hughes movies is a real sense of nostalgia for me personally. Yeah. All right, George, we're going to leave it there. Thank you so much. >> Thank you.</p>
