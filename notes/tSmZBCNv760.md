### 委内瑞拉打击行动与美对联合国机构的警告

**Tracy Mumford**: 大家好，这里是《纽约时报》的头条新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 12 月 30 日，星期二。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, December 30th. Here's what we're covering.
</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 《纽约时报》获悉了上周美国在**委内瑞拉**发动的一次袭击的最新细节，这次袭击是**特朗普总统**一直大肆宣扬的。

**Unknown Speaker**: 发生了一场大爆炸，地点是在他们装载毒品的码头区域。他们装载毒品。所以，我们打击了所有船只，现在我们打击了这个区域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Unknown Speaker**: There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. They load the boats up with drugs. So, we hit all the boats and now we hit the area.
</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 据向《纽约时报》简报的人士称，**CIA** 使用了一架**无人机**袭击了一个港口设施，美国官员认为该设施是**Trend Ara** 帮派储存**毒品**以及可能准备将毒品运上船只的地方。虽然美国几个月来一直在海上拦截船只，声称它们走私毒品，但这次码头袭击标志着美国首次在**委内瑞拉**境内采取行动。这表明特朗普政府已对其针对该国总统**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**的施压行动开启了激进的新阶段。白宫声称马杜罗与 Trende Aaragua 关系密切，尽管美国自己的**情报机构**对这些说法表示怀疑。就马杜罗政府而言，尚未直接评论此次码头袭击。但昨天，委内瑞拉内政部长谴责了数月来的所谓“帝国式的疯狂、骚扰、威胁、袭击、海盗行为和谋杀”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Tracy Mumford**: People briefed on the strike tell the Times that the CIA used a drone to hit a port facility where US officials think the gang Trend Ara was storing narcotics and potentially preparing to move drugs onto boats. While the US has been targeting vessels at sea for months, claiming they're smuggling drugs, the dock strike marks the first known American operation inside Venezuela. It suggests the Trump administration has launched an aggressive new phase of its pressure campaign against the country's president Nicholas Maduro. The White House has alleged that there are close ties between Maduro and Trende Aaragua even though the US's own intelligence agencies have cast doubt on those claims. For its part, Maduro's government has not directly commented on the dock strike. But yesterday, Venezuela's interior minister denounced months of quote imperial madness, harassment, threats, attacks, piracy, and murders.

### 美军东太平洋打击行动

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，美军昨天在**东太平洋**发动了另一次致命袭击，打击了涉嫌的**贩毒分子**，击中了一艘船只。五角大楼官员表示，**国防部长皮特·海加斯**指挥了此次袭击，造成两人死亡。他们说，这艘船正沿着一条“已知的贩毒路线”航行。这是自 9 月初以来军方宣布的此类袭击中的第 30 次。这些袭击已造成至少 107 人死亡，并遭到法律专家和国会议员的谴责，他们称之为“法外处决”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, the US military carried out another deadly strike yesterday against alleged drug traffickers, hitting a boat in the Eastern Pacific. Pentagon officials said Defense Secretary Pete Hegath directed the attack, which killed two people. They said the boat was traveling along a quote known narot trafficking route. It was the 30th attack of its kind announced by the military since early September. The strikes, which have killed at least 107 people, have been condemned by legal experts and members of Congress who have called them extrajudicial killings.

### 俄乌无人机事件与和平谈判

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**俄罗斯**，官员们指责**乌克兰**袭击了**弗拉基米尔·普京**的一处住所，称乌克兰周一在普京一处最隐秘的藏身地附近发射了一系列**攻击无人机**。

**Unknown Speaker**: 采取攻势是一回事，因为他们确实采取了攻势。但攻击他的住所是另一回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Unknown Speaker**: It's one thing to be offensive because they were offensive. It's another thing to attack his house.
</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普总统表示，他对所谓的袭击感到非常愤怒，尽管俄罗斯尚未提供确凿证据证明袭击发生。

**Unknown Speaker**: 去查清楚。我的意思是，你可能说袭击没有发生。我想，这有可能。但普京总统今天早上告诉我，袭击发生了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Unknown Speaker**: Find out. I mean, you're saying maybe the attack didn't take place. It's possible to, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did.
</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 俄罗斯的指控是在特朗普接待了**弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基**讨论结束乌克兰战争的可能协议之后提出的。泽连斯基称袭击的说法是“完全捏造”，并表示俄罗斯捏造此事是为了破坏谈判。俄罗斯官员现在发出了一个严厉的威胁，表示将采取更强硬的立场进行和平谈判，并称他们对结束战争的先前协议的立场将被“修改”。在 2 年前的一次事件中，乌克兰否认发射了两架在克里姆林宫普京住所上空爆炸的无人机，但美国官员认定乌克兰很可能就是幕后黑手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Tracy Mumford**: Russia's accusation came just after Trump hosted Blloimir Zilinski for talks about a possible deal to end the war in Ukraine. Silinski called the claims of an attack a complete fabrication and said that Russia had invented it as a pretext to undermine the negotiations. Russian officials have now issued a dramatic threat to harden the country's stance in peace talks and said that their position on previously reached agreements about ending the war would be quote revised. In an incident 2 years ago, Ukraine denied sending a pair of drones that exploded over Putin's residence in the Kremlin, but US officials determined the country was likely behind it.

### 联合国援助项目资金危机

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普政府宣布，将在来年为**联合国**的援助项目提供首批 20 亿美元。尽管特朗普总统已大幅削减了援助资金，但这仍可能使美国成为最大的国际援助捐助国。过去十年，美国通常承担联合国人道主义援助总额的三分之一或更多。今年这一比例降至约 15%。特朗普经常批评外国援助浪费且充斥欺诈。此次新的援助承诺伴随着对联合国的严厉警告。**美国国务院**告知该组织，必须消除美国所谓的“官僚主义开销”和“意识形态渗透”，并表示，联合国各机构将需要“适应、缩小或消亡”。在全球范围内，随着许多其他西方政府也削减开支，**国际救援机构**正面临资金危机。一位前联合国人道主义援助官员告诉《纽约时报》：“有记录的需求与可用资金之间的差距从未如此严重。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Tracy Mumford**: The Trump administration has announced that it will provide an initial $2 billion for United Nations aid programs in the coming year. That will likely keep the US as the biggest international aid donor, even as President Trump has drastically scaled back funding. Over the last decade, the US regularly used to cover a third or more of the UN's total humanitarian efforts. This year that dropped to about 15%. Trump has frequently criticized foreign aid as wasteful and rife with fraud. And the new pledge came with a stark warning for the UN. The State Department told the organization it must cut out what the US called bureaucratic overhead and ideological creep and said individual UN agencies will need to adapt, shrink or die. Across the globe, international relief agencies are facing a funding crisis as many other Western governments make cuts, too. One former UN humanitarian aid official told the Times, quote, "Never has the gap between recorded need and available funding been so severe.

### 青少年体育的压力与倦怠

**Tracy Mumford**: 为什么这些孩子会有三套全套的制服，上面还有迷彩渐变和金属字母，就像参加 **MLB** 全明星赛一样？

**Unknown Speaker**: 对美国的一些家庭来说，**青少年体育**已经变得令人应接不暇。

**Unknown Speaker**: 听着，周六早上 6 点的青少年体育比赛，会让你开始讨厌你孩子所在的队伍。日程安排紧凑，周末整天的比赛，甚至还有跨国飞行，再加上巨额的财务投入。

**Unknown Speaker**: 我估算了一下，我们每年在这上面要花大约 2.5 万美元，也就是每个月略高于 2000 美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Unknown Speaker**: Why do these kids have three full sets of uniforms complete with camo gradients and metallic lettering like they're in the MLB All-Star game? For some families in the US, youth sports have become allconsuming. Listen, a 6 a.m. youth sports tournament on a Saturday will have you starting to root against your kids' team. There are demanding schedules, weekendl long tournaments, even cross-country flights on top of huge financial investments. The nearest I can figure we're spending about 25 grand a year on the, you know, a little over two grand a month on these sports. And I

**Tracy Mumford**: 虽然体育运动已被证明有助于孩子建立自尊和自信，但越来越多的研究也表明，孩子们正在迅速“烧尽”。研究表明，来自过度严厉的**教练**和**家长**的压力会损害儿童的情感福祉，而过度训练年轻运动员则会导致伤病。要求过高的教练和在场边尖叫的家长显然不是新鲜事，但随着越来越多的青少年体育联赛开始以营利性企业的方式运营，这种压力只会不断升级。为了应对这种新强度，现在出现了一个广泛的运动，旨在加强对教练的培训，使他们能更好地了解**心理健康**问题。据一位专家告诉《纽约时报》，过去几年里，已有七个州开始要求教练接受心理健康培训。一些联赛也开始自己采取行动，聘请顾问来与家长谈论他们在潜在倦怠问题中的作用。一位曾是 MLB 球员并进行此类讲座的人士告诉《纽约时报》：“很多家长是体育迷，他们想看青少年体育比赛的方式就像看职业体育比赛一样。”他说，家长需要退一步，帮助减轻这种压力。

**Tracy Mumford**: and while sports have been shown to help kids build self-esteem and confidence, a growing body of research also shows that kids are burning out fast. Studies have shown that pressure from overbearing coaches and parents can stunt children's emotional well-being and that overtraining young athletes is leading to injuries. Demanding coaches and parents screaming on the sidelines aren't new, obviously, but the pressure has only ramped up as a growing number of kids sports leagues are now being run as for-profit businesses. In response to the new intensity, there's now a broad movement to increase training for coaches so they're more informed on mental health issues. In the last few years, one expert told the Times, seven states have begun requiring coaches to receive mental health training. And some leagues are taking it into their own hands, bringing in consultants to talk to parents about their role in the potential burnout. One former MLB player who gives these talks told the Times, quote, "You have a lot of parents who are sports fans that want to watch youth sports the same way they watch pro sports." He said parents need to take a step back and help turn down the pressure.

### 测量山峰高度的工程项目

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，几年前，两位身为**双胞胎兄弟**的**登山者**出发去攀登每个州的最高峰。完成之后，他们开始着眼于攀登每个国家的最高峰。但他们对数据产生了疑问。他们爬的山越多，就越怀疑这些山峰是否被正确测量了。他们现在运营一个名为“**Country High Points**”的项目，亲自进行核查。在最近的一篇论文中，他们确定了五个国家的新最高峰。为了进行测量，他们与其他几位合作者一起，不仅携带食物、水和急救用品，还携带了先进的**测量设备**。基本上，这是比智能手机中安装的 GPS 更精确的版本。手机的“查找我的手机”功能可以精确到几英尺，而这种设备则能精确到英寸。这两兄弟都是机械工程师，这可能很有帮助。他们的项目现已帮助完善或纠正了**冈比亚**、**乌兹别克斯坦**、**多哥**、**几内亚比绍**等地的地形记录。当然，要让任何地图被官方更新是另一项艰巨的任务。可能需要经过同行评审过程，而且不同国家有不同的标准，但兄弟俩正在按收集到的信息进行发布。他们告诉《纽约时报》：“我们这一切的目标是找到真相。”

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, years ago, two mountain climbers who are twin brothers set out to climb the highest peak in every state. Once that was done, they started looking at the highest peak in every country. But they had questions about the data. The more mountains they climbed, the more they wondered if the peaks had been measured correctly. They now run a project called country high points where they check for themselves. And in a recent paper, they established new high points in five countries. To make their measurements, they along with a few other collaborators climb with not just food, water, and first aid, but also advanced surveying equipment. Basically, more accurate versions of the GPS installed in smartphones. Where the find my phone dot can be accurate down to a few feet, this equipment measures down to the inch. It probably helps that the two brothers are mechanical engineers. Their project has now helped fill in or correct the topographical record in Gambia, Usuzbekiststan, Togo, Guineasau and more. Of course, getting any maps officially updated is a whole other feat. There can be peerreview processes and different countries have different standards, but the brothers are publishing their info as they collect it. They told the Times, "Our goal in all this is to find the truth."
