### 开场与经济增长概览

**主持人**: Dawn，非常感谢您邀请我们。您好吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dawn**: Dawn, thank you so much for having us. How are you doing?
</details>

**嘉宾**: 我很好。您好吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: I'm good. How are you?
</details>

**嘉宾**: 我很好。我想从加拿大经济增长的图表开始。过去一年，第二季度GDP下降了1.8%，然后反弹。第三季度增长了2.6%。这是我们目前掌握的最新数据。但对第四季度和全年的预测都是积极的。您能告诉我们推动这些增长的主要因素是什么吗？我们称之为适度的扩张。

**Guest**: I want to start with a chart of Canadian economic growth. Over the past year, GDP contracted 1.8% in the second quarter, then bounced back. It was up 2.6% in quarter three. That's the last period for which we have data. But the forecast are positive for Q4 and right through the year. Can you tell us what are the main drivers of this? We'll call them modest expansion.

### 消费、人口结构与商业投资

**嘉宾**: 嗯，短期内，我认为更重要的是什么没有推动我们，那就是消费者。加拿大的**人口结构**在过去几年发生了显著变化。所以当我们思考2026年发生的事情时，我们将看到一个没有从**人口增长**中获得推动的经济。因此，我们认为至少在短期内，这可能是一个消费活动和**房地产市场**活动疲软的情况。这取决于您居住的地方，情况略有不同。但总的来说，这将是一个积极因素。但再次强调，速度不会很快。我认为我们面临的一个主要问题是，在我们的预测的至少第一部分中，商业方面的情况如何。我的意思是，企业**极度不确定**，这是有道理的，因为全球经济正在发生变化。所以我们还没有看到任何**商业投资**。这在2025年已经显现出来。我们认为在2026年初，情况仍然会如此。

**Guest**: Well, in the near term, I think it's more a question of what's not really driving us, and that will be the consumer. The demographics for Canada have changed significantly over the last couple of years. And so when we think about what's happening in 2026, we're going to see an economy which isn't getting that talk, if you will, from that population growth. And so we think that in the near term anyway, it's probably going to be a situation where you have weak consumption activity, housing market activity. It's a bit mixed depending where you live. And so that two on net will be a bit of a positive. But again, not super quick. I think one of the big issues that we're confronting as we go through, at least the first part of our forecast, is what's happening on the business front. I mean, businesses are extraordinarily uncertain, and it makes sense because of what's happening in the global economy. So we haven't seen any business investment. And that's certainly played out in 2025. And we think in the early part of 2026, that's still going to be the case.

### 2026年经济增长预测与利率

**主持人**: 好的。既然这样，正如您提到的，我们预计2026年的增长率为1.5%。考虑到您提到的挑战，这是一个乐观的数字还是悲观的数字？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. With that being said, as you mentioned, net overall, we expect in 2026 a growth rate of 1.5%. Is that an optimistic number or pessimistic one, considering the challenges that you sort of laid out?
</details>

**嘉宾**: 嗯，我认为当我们看到这个数字时，对于今年来说，它看起来并不那么好。但我想我们把它看作一年有两个部分，这意味着上半年可能感觉迟缓而疲软。但当我们进入2026年下半年时，我们认为有很多理由相信我们将看到更强的活动。首先，我们相信**利率**将保持在2.25%的低位。这比2024年中期的5%低得多。这将是好事。它将帮助消费者，因为它仍然有很多**抵押贷款**将在今年进行再融资。2021年，当人们申请这些抵押贷款时，利率非常低。现在虽然没有那么低，但肯定比我们经历高利率时低得多。这将提供一些缓解。而且请记住，过去几年我们经历了大量的**就业增长**和**工资增长**。这将帮助这些消费者度过这段时期。另外，我希望这只是一个乐观的预测，但我们将在7月进行Kuzma审查。在那里，我们正在消费。再次强调，这是一个相当大的假设，即我们将保持对美国市场的基本**免关税**访问。现在，这并不一定意味着**木材**、**钢铁**和**铝**以及成品汽车可能不会发生很多变化。所以我们已经将此纳入了考量。变化不大。这意味着经济的这些部分将保持相对疲软。但经济的其他部分，我们可以免关税地向美国出口，这可能高达90%到95%的出口额，这些领域可能会有优势，因为我们的利率低于其他国家。

**Guest**: Well, I think when we look at that number, it doesn't look all that hot for the year. But I think we're looking at it as a year in two halves, meaning first half probably going to be feeling sluggish and soft. But as we round out 2026, we think there's lots of reasons to believe we're going to see stronger activity. First of all, interest rates we believe will remain low at 2.25%. That's much lower than the 5% of where we saw in mid 2024. So that will be good. And it's going to help consumers and it's going to help consumers, because we still have a lot of mortgages that are going to refinance this year. In 2021, when people took those mortgages, the rates were really low. Now it's not as low, but it certainly is a lot lower than what we saw when we had those high interest rates. So that's going to provide some relief. And remember, we've had lots of employment growth over the past few years. We've had lots of wage growth. So that's going to help those consumers navigate through this period. The other and I hope this isn't a hopeful prediction, but we do have the Kuzma review excuse me in July. And there what we're consuming. And again this is a pretty big assumption for our forecast is that we will retain our access to the US market basically tariff free. Now it doesn't necessarily imply that lumber, steel, and aluminium finished autos may not see a lot of change there. So we baked that in. Not a lot of change. That means that those parts of the economy will remain pretty weak. But the other parts of the economy where we can actually export to the United States tariff free, and that can be up to 90, 95% of our exports. Those are really going to be areas where conceivably we might even have an advantage, because they're lower rate than other countries.

### 政府支出与政策变化

**主持人**: 好的。既然这样，正如您提到的，我们预计2026年的增长率为1.5%。考虑到您提到的挑战，这是一个乐观的数字还是悲观的数字？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. With that being said, as you mentioned, net overall, we expect in 2026 a growth rate of 1.5%. Is that an optimistic number or pessimistic one, considering the challenges that you sort of laid out?
</details>

**嘉宾**: 是的，2025年，其中一部分是因为我们看到**国防**方面的大幅增加，主要通过工资和薪金。这确实提供了一些推动力。而且，随着今年的发展，我们将继续看到一些支出。这会是一个巨大的推动力吗？可能不会，因为所有这些都是大额项目，资金需要一段时间才能到位。但话虽如此，从长远来看，肯定会有帮助。我们认为政府投资方面，而不是消费方面，将有所提升，因为我们知道政府劳动力将面临大量削减。因此，我们认为2026年将从政府投资方面获得提升。我想说的是，我们将看到一些对企业希望投资的政策变化。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Yeah, 2025, some of it because we did see a significant increase in the defence side, mainly through wages and salaries. So that did give a bit of a lift. And as we go through the course of this year, you know, we're going to continue to see some spending now. Is it going to be an enormous lift. Probably not because all of these are big ticket items and it takes a while for that money to flow through. But having said that, on the margin definitely going to be the case. We think that the investment side of government spending, not so much the consumption side, because we know there's going to be a lot of cuts to government workforce, for example. So we say that we will get a lift in 2026 from the government investment side. The other thing I guess I'd say is we're going to have a lot of other changes in policy that we think will be helpful for businesses who are looking to invest.

**主持人**: 像什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Like what?
</details>

**嘉宾**: 嗯，我们将看到，再次强调，这是我们的假设，即消除或至少减少**省际贸易壁垒**。这将为全国许多公司打开大门，这真的非常棒。我们还认为我们将看到一些**监管**的减少。你知道，当我们看到开始投资的公司时，他们会看到巨大的延误、大量的法规和大量的官僚主义。好吧，在政府承诺减少这些的情况下，我认为这将减轻商业方面的压力。因此，虽然这不是直接的政府支出，但减轻这些阻碍，我认为这对商业方面来说是好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Well, we're going to see and I mean, again, this is what our assumptions are elimination or at least a reduction in inter-provincial trade barriers. So that opens up for a lot of companies across the country, which is really quite amazing. We also think we're going to see some reduction in some of the regulation. You know, when we look at companies who are starting to invest, they're looking at big delays, lots of regulations, lots of red tape. Well, to the extent that we have a commitment from governments that they will reduce this, we think that's going to alleviate some pressure from the business side as well. So while it's not direct government spending per se, the alleviation of some of these, these real impediments, I think that's going to be good for the business side.
