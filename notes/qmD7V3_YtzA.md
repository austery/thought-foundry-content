title: 如何在加拿大职场中管理政治言论：法律、政策与同理心
---
### 职场政治言论：美加差异与后果

在美国，许多雇主几乎可以以任何理由解雇员工。但在加拿大情况并非如此。但这并不意味着你不会因为在办公室或互联网上发表的言论而面临后果。**Peninsula Canada**（一家提供雇佣法和人力资源咨询服务的公司）的资深雇佣法和人力资源顾问**Charlie Herrera Vacuor**对此进行了解释。

<p class="english-text">In the US, many employers can fire people for almost any reason. That's not the case in Canada. But that doesn't mean you can't face consequences for what you say in the office or on the internet. Charlie Herrera Vacuor, an employment law and HR senior consultant at Peninsula Canada explains.</p>

查理，欢迎来到节目。我们来谈谈职场中的政治言论。与种族、性别、宗教相比，它受到怎样的保护？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Charlie, welcome to the program. Uh let's talk political speech in the workplace. How is it protected compared to race, gender, religion?</p>
</details>

### 加拿大政治言论的法律保护与雇主责任

这是一个很好的问题，也是我们在**Peninsula**（指**Peninsula Canada**）不断向客户澄清的问题。政治言论并非在所有加拿大司法管辖区都受到特别保护。例如，联邦人权立法和安大略省的立法并未明确保护政治言论。然而，许多其他省份则有此保护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a great question and something that we constantly clarify to our clients at Peninsula. Uh political speech is not specifically protected in all Canadian jurisdictions. For instance, the federal human rights legislation and Ontario's do not protect specifically political speech. However, many other provinces do.</p>
</details>

那么，这意味着什么呢？我能明确且公然地禁止职场中的政治言论吗？不能。作为雇主，你可以做的是设定具体的指导方针，明确职场中何为尊重的政治言论，以及哪些情况可能被视为不尊重。我认为最近我们看到很多人因为自己的言论而面临后果，我们看到他们被解雇或开除。雇主可以基于什么理由因政治言论解雇某人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what does this mean? Uh can I specifically and blatantly ban political speech from the workplace? No. Uh what as an employer you can do is set specific guidelines of what is respectful political speech in the workplace and which instances will be considered possibly uh you know something that is not respectful. I think what we see of late is a lot of people uh seeing the consequences of something that they have said and what we see is them being terminated from their job or fired. On what grounds could an employer terminate someone for political speech?</p>
</details>

### 解雇风险与渐进式纪律处分

因此，在**Peninsula**，我们告诉客户，没有哪次解雇是零风险的，因此，这类决定应该经过深思熟虑。就像我之前提到的，政治言论在某些司法管辖区作为一项受人权保护的特征，因此，根据具体情况，解雇可能会导致歧视索赔。因此，重要的是我们始终要建立具体的指导方针，明确哪些政治言论是被接受的，以及如何以尊重其他员工的方式进行这类对话，以便每个人都能在了解和理解预期行为规范的情况下行事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at at Peninsula what we say to uh our clients is that no termination is risk-free and therefore uh these kind of decisions should be well thought. Um as I mentioned political speech is protected and in some jurisdictions as a human rights uh protected characteristic and therefore depending on the circumstances uh a termination could lead to a discrimination claim. Therefore it is important that uh we always establish specific guidelines of what is accepted political speech, what is respectful to other employees in how to have these kind of you know conversations. so that everyone operates uh with uh knowledge and understanding of what is the um expected conduct.</p>
</details>

如果我们将解雇视为一个极端，那么还有其他雇主可以采取的行动。从一开始，他们还可以考虑哪些措施？我们建议客户制定具体的政策。这些政策通常会明确预期行为，以及在何种情况下可以采取纪律处分。当然，正如立法和判例法通常会告诉雇主如何操作一样，始终要遵循所谓的**渐进式纪律处分**（progressive discipline approach: 一种逐步升级的纪律处分方式，从口头警告开始，逐步升级到书面警告、停职，最终可能导致解雇）方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Termination if we look at a spectrum is on one end. There are other things that could be done other actions that employers can do. What what else could they be looking at at at the get-go? What we advise our clients is to have specific policies in place. These specific policies will usually determine what is the expected conduct and under which circumstances could discipline uh follow. Of course uh as legislation and case law um you know usually uh tells employers uh how to operate is to always follow what is called a progressive discipline approach.</p>
</details>

因此，除非情况特殊，解雇绝不应是首要措施。所以，通常你会先进行口头警告，然后是书面警告，接着是最终或第二次书面警告，最后才可能考虑解雇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So of course termination never being the first instance unless circumstances merit. So, um, usually you want to follow first a verbal warning, then a written warning, a final or second written warning, and then possibly a termination.</p>
</details>

### 线上言论与职场政策

好的。我想谈谈，你知道，很多人在家工作，以及技术的影响。很多人在朝九晚五的工作结束后，五点以后就过自己的生活了。我想区分一下，或者说是否存在这样一种区别：一个人在家线上使用社交媒体讨论有争议的话题，与在办公室里讨论这些话题有什么不同？是的，这是一个很好的问题，鉴于最近围绕某些政治人物言论发生的一切，这个问题最近被频繁提及。有两种处理方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I want to talk about um sort of, you know, a lot of people work from home, but also the the sort of the influence of technology. You know, a lot of people after if they're working a 9 to5 after 5:00, they're they're living their lives. And I I want to make a distinction or is there a distinction between um someone who is you know using social media talking about something that could be controversial uh at home online versus in the office. Yeah, that's that's a great question and you know something that has come up a lot lately given uh everything that has happened around certain political figures expressions and and you know um so there's two approaches.</p>
</details>

第一种方法是，如我之前所说，制定一项职场政策，告知员工在工作场所的最佳行为规范。第二种方法是始终与员工保持透明和持续的沟通，讨论如何处理具体情况。今年对加拿大人来说是艰难的一年，因为我们举行了多次选举。我们正在经历或即将走出与我们最亲密邻国关系动荡的时期。而且，你知道，人们有很多话想说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first approach is um having as I mentioned before a workplace policy that uh tells employees what is the best practice conduct for their workplace. The second one is uh always to have a transparent and constant communication with your employees about what what how to go over specific situations. So in this year it's been it's been a hard year for Canadians because we had plenty of elections. We are coming out or we're going through you know um turmoil of a relationship with our closest neighbor. Uh and you know folks have the you know in they want to say something have a lot to say.</p>
</details>

是的，没错。我们是人，你知道，所以在这方面，雇主总是需要强调：在你想要发表言论之前，请确保你真的有必要这样做；如果确实有必要，请确保有某些警示或保护措施到位。你的社交媒体是否显示了你的公司隶属关系？你的社交媒体上是否有你的具体姓名？诸如此类的事情。当然，我们应该努力节制自己的表达方式。你知道，仇恨言论不仅会给自己带来麻烦，如果你的公司隶属关系与此相关联，还可能给公司带来声誉问题，而职场政策正是处理这类情况的最佳方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Exactly. Um I mean we're people we're you know uh and and so in that regard um it's always important to for employers to say before you want to say something make sure if if you really have to if you really have to and if you really have to make sure that there are certain caveats or there are certain protections that are in place. Is your social media does your social media have uh your company affiliation? Is your like a specific name there? You know, those things. And and then of course, let's try to moderate the way that we express ourselves. you know um hateful uh speech you know can always bring problems not only for oneself but also if you know if you are having your company affiliation attached to that uh it could bring reputational problems for the company and that is where a a workplace policy best addresses that those kind of instances.</p>
</details>

### 真实案例与同理心的重要性

好的，我想谈谈一些真实的例子。我们询问了市场研究公司**Advanced Symbolics Inc.**（一家使用人工智能技术进行市场研究的公司），该公司利用名为**Poly**（**Advanced Symbolics Inc.**开发的人工智能技术）的人工智能技术，来了解人们在职场中害怕谈论哪些话题。而排名第一的话题是**Charlie Kirk**（一位右翼评论员，上个月在犹他州校园内被杀），不是Charlie U，而是**Charlie Kirk**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right I want to talk uh about some real uh life examples. Uh we asked the market research firm Advanced Symbolics Inc. uh which uses artificial intelligence technology known as Poly to find out what topics uh people are afraid to talk about in the workplace. And the number one topic came up as Charlie Kirk, not Charlie U, but Charlie Kirk, which for people who don't know, a uh right-wing um commentator who was killed in Utah uh on campus uh last month.</p>
</details>

他们发现，任何围绕**Charlie Kirk**的对话都迅速升级为激烈的争论或指责，并且有一种明显的感觉，即任何评论都可能被持不同意见的同事歪曲或武器化。针对这个具体例子，人们是否需要害怕谈论他？你知道，这种说法本身非常危险。当人们对自己的思想和表达感到恐惧时，似乎此前已经有很多事情出了问题。现在我们正试图找出如何解决这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what they found was that any conversation around Charlie Kirk quickly escalated into heated arguments or accusations and there was a palpable sense that any comment could be misrepresented or weaponized by colleagues with opposing views. With this specific example, do people need to be afraid of what they say about him? You know that statement in itself is is very dangerous. Uh when people live with fear about uh what their thoughts are and their expressions, it seems like there are many things that have gone wrong before. Now we're trying to figure out how to address them.</p>
</details>

我之前在我们的部分出版物中提到，雇员和雇主都在经历巨大的变化，而且这些变化的速度是前所未有的。新的立法正在出台。新的事情正在发生。紧张局势正在加剧，然后人们只是做出反应。而在这种反应中，问题和紧张随之而来，雇员和雇主双方都会产生恐惧。在这些情况下，我承认存在很多紧张和不确定性，不知道如何管理这些情况。但我认为关键是同理心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um what I've said before um in in part of the publications that we do is that uh both employees and employers uh have are going through a lot of changes and the velocity of these changes is like unprecedented pace. Legislation is being coming up. New things are happening. Uh you know there's tension growing and then people just react. And in this reaction is where you know the problems the tension comes and the fear ensues both for the employee and the employer. Uh in these situations uh I acknowledge that there is a lot of you know um tension and um just uncertainty about how to manage these situations. Um but I think the key one is empathy.</p>
</details>

我的表达会被对方如何接受？如果另一个人说了一些我完全不同意的话，我应该如何接受？我认为这是所有雇主都应该传达的关键信息之一，那就是在表达自己的方式上要有更多的同理心，因为无论你可能伤害到别人，你也可能成为被伤害的对象。如果我们不这样做，问题在于情况会升级，而且我们不希望职场中出现暴力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how how is my expression going to be received by the other person and if another person were to say something that I completely disagree with, how should I how will I receive that? Um, and I think that that is one of the key messages that all employers should be putting out there is, you know, have more empathy in the way that you express yourself because however you may be hurting other people, you may also be subject to that. And when when if we don't do that the problem is that situations will escalate and you know may that never happen that you know we have violence in the workplace.</p>
</details>

我们告诉所有雇主和客户的关键一点是，他们有义务提供一个相互尊重的工作环境。这是一项实际的法律义务。因此，如果雇主无法保证这一点，员工就可以有充分的理由来对抗他们的企业。这也解释了为什么雇主也感到非常紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the key things that we tell all our employers our our clients is that um they have an obligation to have a respectful work environment. That is an actual legal obligation. And so if employers cannot guarantee that you know employees can have uh a good resource to go against their businesses. So this also clarifies why employers are also feel very tense.</p>
</details>

### 应对“猎巫”文化与建立清晰政策

您能否描述一下我们目前所处的这种氛围？您现在从雇主和员工那里听到了什么、看到了什么关于这些对话的情况？情况是否正在转变？你知道，有时在社交媒体上，我们看到的是一种“猎巫”行为，当有人发表了在政治言论光谱上被视为有争议的言论时，就会演变成一场“猎巫”，试图找到他们的雇主，以此来表明他们不能那样说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you give us a sense of what in this moment you describe the sort of the climate that we are in. Um what are you hearing and seeing from employers and employees about sort of those conversations right now? are is it turning? You know, I sometimes it feels like on social media what we see is sort of a witch hunt sometimes when someone says something um that may be deemed you know on one side of of the spectrum on the political speech spectrum um as controversial. It turns into a witch hunt to find their employer as a way to uh show them that they can't say that.</p>
</details>

我很好奇，您是否处理过那些不得不处理“好的，这话是说了，但法律后果是什么？”这类情况的雇主和员工？这是一个很好的问题。是的，确实，我们许多客户都曾就这个问题向我们咨询。我们首先看到的是，雇主们无疑感到紧张和恐惧，因为他们发现许多员工在社交媒体上公开了他们的公司隶属关系。因此，他们担心他们的公司也会成为“猎巫”的对象。所以，整个大环境根本不允许有一个“冷静期”。每个人都在做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I am curious have you dealt with employers and employees who are having to navigate you know okay yes this was said but legally what are the ramifications so great question uh yes indeed many of our clients have reached out about this specific issue uh what we first see is that employers are definitely tense they are fearful because they see that their employees many of them have their affiliation in their social media so they are they are fearful they they're fearful that they're also their companies are going to be subject to the witch hunt. So there is a whole um context that just doesn't allow for there to be a moment of um you know u cooling off period. Everybody's reacting.</p>
</details>

我们告诉雇主并为他们的成功做好准备的是：确保你制定了政策，并且已经与员工就如何处理这些情况进行了沟通和透明化。例如，当我们知道中东地区发生冲突，人们会谈论此事时，我们会预先告知他们：“请避免使用仇恨言论。避免使用你不想被别人说出口的仇恨表达或言论。”这种沟通和透明度是寻找前进道路的最佳方式。它不会是最终解决方案。事情需要不断调整。这不是那种，你知道，说了一次就再也不碰的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh what we do tell our employers and we prepare them for success is make sure that you have your policies in place that you have communicated and been transparent with your employees about how to handle these situations and that you know when we know for instance when we know that there is a conflict in the Middle East and that people will talk about this. We tell them, we preempt this by saying, "Please refrain from using hateful words. Refrain from using hateful expressions or expressions that you wouldn't like to be told to yourself." These kind of communications and transparency are the best way to just try to find a path forward. It's not going to be the end solution. Things will have to be tweaked. This is not something that, you know, uh, it's said once and never touched again.</p>
</details>

### 何为仇恨言论？

我能否澄清一下，什么会被视为仇恨言论？嗯，就像你提到的，关于**Charlie Kirk**被杀的事件，我认为试图将我们刑法规定为错误的行为合理化的评论，无疑会制造或可能制造一些敌意，比如他是否活该去死之类的言论。所以，我认为这类言论最好在其他场合发表，比如晚餐对话、酒吧或其他非工作场所的场合，而不是在你需要与同事反复互动的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I get some clarification as to what what would be deemed a hateful comment? Um, well, like as as you mentioned that with the assassination of Charlie Kirk, you know, I think that comments that try to contextualize something that our criminal code says that it's wrong to do is definitely something that um will create some hostility or may create some hostility whether he deserved to die or something like that. Mhm. Okay. So those kind of things I would say it's better better to you know have them somewhere else uh in a dinner conversation um at a pub or or or other in a context that is not in a place where you are going to have repeated iterations with the people that you have to work with.</p>
</details>

### 员工的追索权

嗯。我想从员工的角度更好地理解一下。我们谈到了“猎巫”现象。我们谈到了雇主必须发表声明的压力。如果一名员工因为发布了关于**Charlie Kirk**或以色列和巴勒斯坦的冒犯性言论而被解雇，该员工有什么追索权来挑战他们的解雇？有时，雇主似乎行动迅速，因为他们必须做出回应。我们正处在一个时代，如果你看不到有人因言论被解雇的回应，那么就会觉得事情没有得到处理。但从员工方面来说，他们能做些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hm. I want to get a better understanding from the employee uh side of things. We talk about sort of the witch hunt. We talk about the pressure that employers, you know, have to put out a statement. Um if an employee is fired for posting something offensive about Charlie Kirk or uh Israel and Palestine, what recourse does the employee have to challenge their termination? Sometimes it it may seem that employers are um being quick because they have to respond in a in a we're in a time and age where if you don't see a response where someone has been fired from their job, then something is not being done. But on the employee side, is there something that they can do?</p>
</details>

在**Peninsula**，我们非常谨慎，总是告诉我们的雇主：你的员工拥有权利，你的员工拥有你需要尊重的保障。言论自由就是其中之一。而且在某些司法管辖区，正如我之前提到的，政治言论受到特别保护。这意味着通过解雇或不合理的纪律处分来操作，可能会导致人权索赔。我们告诉客户与员工沟通的是，如何在允许他们拥有自由的同时，也让他们意识到他们的言论及其表达方式可能会受到审查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're very careful at Peninsula to always tell our employers, your employee has rights, your employee has guarantees that you need to respect. Uh freedom of speech is specifically one of them. And in certain jurisdictions, as I mentioned before, political speech is specifically protected. So that means that operating through termination or um unreasonable disciplinary action can warrant you a human rights claim. Uh what we do tell our employ uh um our clients to communicate with their employees is um how to manage this in a situation that allows them to have the freedom but also makes them aware that their speech and the way that they uh voice it uh can be put under scrutiny.</p>
</details>

### 模糊的界限与言论的细微差别

很明显，界限是模糊的。是的。我们正在讨论的是，有时很清楚什么是政治言论，什么可能被视为仇恨言论，但言论在多大程度上取决于旁观者的看法？我想给你举个例子，你知道，“从河流到海洋，巴勒斯坦将获得自由”（“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”: 一句与巴以冲突相关的口号，对某些人来说具有解放意义，但对另一些人来说则被视为煽动性或反犹太主义）这句话可能对某些人来说是冒犯性的，但对另一些人则不然，雇主如何处理这种细微差别？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very clear that there are blurred lines. Yes. uh this is we're talking this is a in sometimes it's very clear as to what is political speech and and what could be considered hateful but to what extent is speech in the eye of the beholder I want to give you an example you know the phrase from the river to the sea Palestine will be free might be offensive to some people but not to others how do employers navigate the nuance of that</p>
</details>

所以每个人都有权对特定的紧张局势持有特定的观点，对吗？嗯，当我们谈论战争时，总会有灰色地带。具体的方法是确保整个工作场所能够向前发展，无论言论如何表达，无论说了什么。因为对某些人来说可能具有冒犯性的言论，对其他人来说可能并非如此，反之亦然。所以这里的问题是，我们如何才能以一种方式共同前进，让人们不至于分裂，不制造暴力，不制造紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so everybody is entitled to uh a specific view on a specific tension, right? Um, and when we're talking about war that uh will always have gray areas, the specific way is uh to ensure that the workplace as a whole is able to move forward no matter how it's being said, no matter what is being said. because what can be offensive to somebody may not be offensive to others and vice versa. So the issue here uh is how can we move together in a way that you know people don't separate people don't create violence people don't create uh tension</p>
</details>

我总是说，在最明确的方式下，当我们谈论**LGBTQ+群体**（Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and others: 指女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别者、酷儿/疑问者等性少数群体）时，像代词这样的东西对那个群体来说意味着一切，因为它不仅关乎他们的身份，也关乎他们表达自己的方式。而且，对很多人来说，对此发表评论可能只是一句不经意的话，但对那个群体来说，这代表着一切，不尊重这一点简直就是否定他们的存在。因此，“从河流到海洋”的表达对某些人来说可能意味着完全正当和值得捍卫的东西，但对另一些人来说，它也关乎他们的生存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I always say that uh with the most clear-cut ways uh when we're talking about the LGBTQ plus community something like a pronoun means everything right for that community because it's talking about not not only their identity but the way that they express themselves. Uh, and having a comment about that may be like something in passing for many folks, but for that community it's everything and not being respectful and about that it's literally negating their existence. So expressions from the river to the sea may mean, you know, something totally uh rightful and champion for some, but for the other ones has to do with their existence as well.</p>
</details>

查理，我们就谈到这里。非常感谢。这对雇员和雇主来说都是很好的思考。谢谢邀请。
