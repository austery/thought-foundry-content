summary: 特拉华州长期以来是美国公司注册的首选地，以其专业的衡平法院和稳定的公司法体系著称。然而，埃隆·马斯克因薪酬方案纠纷将特斯拉迁往德克萨斯州，引发了对特拉华州主导地位的质疑。本文探讨了特拉华州如何建立其公司法优势，以及当前面临的“逐底竞争”风险，即各州可能通过削弱股东权利来吸引公司注册，这可能对公司治理和股东保护产生深远影响。

### 特拉华州：美国公司注册的“事实标准”

**Tracy Alloway:** 你知道吗，特拉华州的人口大约只有105万，是美国人口最少的州之一，甚至比很多大城市的人口都少。然而，特拉华州却有210万家注册企业，基本上每两个人就有一家企业。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, I have a fun fact for you. Go on. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay. So, Delaware has a population of about 1.05 million. A little over a million. Okay. It's one of the least populous states. Yeah. I think it has fewer people than a lot of big cities in the US for sure. However, Delaware has 2.1 million businesses registered in the state. So, basically two businesses for every person.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这真是一个有趣的冷知识！我确实不知道这一点。我只知道特拉华州人口不多，而且很多公司都在那里注册。但这种2:1的比例，真是太棒了，Tracy，干得好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a legit fun fact. This is like a legit I did not know this. I mean, I knew that it was not a very big state population wise. I know that so many corporations or businesses or whatever uh incorporate in Delaware. But this sort of 2:1 ratio, excellent fun fact, Tracy, well done.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，下次晚宴你可以把这个拿出来说。当然，你可能会争辩说特拉华州的人民都非常有创业精神，但正如你所说，事实并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. For your next dinner party, you can shout that one out. But I mean, obviously maybe you could argue that Delawarians are just phenomenally entrepreneurial. But as you mentioned, no, as you mentioned, no more than any I'm not dismissing them. I just know that that's not really what's going on, right?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我不是在贬低他们，我只是知道这并非事情的真相。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No more than any I'm not dismissing them. I just know that that's not really what's going on,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 对，这里面还有别的原因，那就是特拉华州已经成为公司注册的**事实标准**（de facto standard: 约定俗成的标准，尽管没有官方规定）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? There's something else going on here which is that Delaware has become the de facto state for companies incorporating.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，这是我们对特拉华州最主要的认知。我们很少听到关于特拉华州的其他消息，除非是其法院正在处理某种公司纠纷。当然，它有一个专门处理公司纠纷的法院系统。多年来，我们看到了一些著名的案例，从中了解了**衡平法院**（Chancery Court: 专门处理公平和公正而非严格法律条文的法院）是什么。人们似乎喜欢它那简化、流线型的公司法律系统，而且这似乎也带来了相当不错的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this is like the main thing that we know about Delaware and we don't really I mean chicken farms the chickens, right? Not the the chickens. But you don't hear much about Delaware except typically when there is some sort of corporate fight playing out in its courts and of course it has a dedicated court system for corporate fights and so forth. There's some been prominent examples over the years where we learn about what the chancery is and then I forget what the chancery is or where that word comes from but people seem to like their uh simplistic streamlined legal system for corporate things and it seems to have paid off reasonably well.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 人们似乎喜欢它，但这可能正在改变。你提到了公司纠纷，最近我们有一个非常突出的例子，就是埃隆·马斯克在特斯拉的薪酬纠纷案。最终，埃隆表示他将把公司迁往德克萨斯州并在那里注册。事实上，我们看到一些公司选择离开特拉华州，迁往德克萨斯州或内华达州等地。我知道这可能不是很多人目前最关注的新闻，因为事情很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People seem to like it but that might be changing. So you mentioned corporate fights. We had a very prominent example of this relatively recently when there was the court fight over Elon Musk's compensation at Tesla and eventually Elon just said, you know, I'm going to pick up my company and move it to Texas and incorporate there. And in fact, we are seeing a few examples of companies choosing to move away from Delaware and to places like Texas or Nevada. And I know this isn't maybe a top of mind news development for many people right now. There's a lot going on.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 但我认为这真的很有趣。它是一种缓慢的变动，但却对股东权利有着深远的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think it's really interesting. It's kind of slowm moving and it does have implications for shareholder rights.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 完全同意。我实际上认为这是一个非常重要且相关的话题，原因如下：从某种意义上说，法律系统是一种**网络效应**（network effect: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量的增加而增加的现象）。人们尊重这个法律系统，即使有些判决可能对他们不利，他们也会认为这是一个高质量的法律系统。在其他地方重建这样的系统非常困难。如果其他地方有吸引力，那么看看需要什么才能将实体从这个网络中撬走就很有趣了，因为这个网络是在多年的成千上万的判决基础上建立起来的，形成了一种共享的法律。所以，当我思考美国，思考这些关于如何将资金、实体、行业转移到可能更年轻、没有相同历史判例的司法管辖区时，也许特拉华州的历史、它是如何建立起来的，以及它在中期面临的任何威胁，可以作为一个微观故事来讲述。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. I actually think it's a very important relevant topic and I'll say this is the reason why which is that in a sense a legal system is this network effect and people respect the legal system and even if maybe there are decisions that go against them they're like okay this is a high quality legal system. it is very hard to rebuild that somewhere else. It also is the sort of thing that if there is some pull elsewhere then it's interesting to see what does it take to pry entities away from this network where there is years and years and thousands and thousands of uh decisions upon which to build something resembling a shared law. And so, you know, when I think about the United States, when I think about these bigger questions about how do you move dollars, how do you move entities, industries to other jurisdictions that are maybe younger and don't have the same level of historical juristprudence, maybe there is a microcosm, a story to be told about the Delaware history, how it built up, and if there are any threats to it over the medium term.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 绝对如此，说得非常好。所以，我很乐意地说我们请到了完美的嘉宾，我们将与安妮·利普顿教授交谈。她是科罗拉多大学的法学教授，也是劳伦斯·W·德穆斯讲席教授。安妮，非常感谢您加入我们。

### 特拉华州如何成为公司注册的首选地？

**Tracy Alloway:** 我想从一个显而易见的问题开始：为什么特拉华州会成为公司注册的**事实标准**（de facto place: 实际上的地方）？为什么是特拉华州？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll start with the obvious question which is how did we end up with Delaware as the deacto place for corporate incorporation? Why Delaware?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 因为特拉华州实际上制定了策略，希望吸引公司注册。这可以追溯到19世纪末20世纪初。当时，许多州都认为可以通过让公司在其州内注册并支付费用来赚钱。那时你甚至可以在报纸上看到“来X州注册公司”的广告。特拉华州做出了一个有意识的决定，使其州和法律对那些希望在那里注册的公司友好。因此，在当时，企业主要关注的问题之一是公司法可能被政治化，规则会为了实现某种政治政策而改变。所以特拉华州通过了一项宪法修正案，规定其法官必须在政治上保持平衡。也就是说，一个政党的成员不能超过半数，或者不能超过一个微弱多数。例如，在一个由七名成员组成的法院中，一个政党的成员不能超过四名。他们还通过了一项宪法修正案，规定对公司法的任何修改都需要立法机构三分之二的投票通过。因此，他们试图将公司法与政治压力隔离开来，然后他们使公司法变得非常灵活，并且对管理者非常友好。管理者可以随心所欲地处理事务，从那时起，特拉华州的公司注册量就一路飙升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because Delaware actually strategized that it wanted to attract incorporations. And this was back in oh the late 1800s, early 1900s. A number of states actually thought that they could make money by having corporations incorporate in their state and pay fees. You could actually open a newspaper at that time and see advertisements for come incorporate in Xstate. And Delaware made a conscious decision to make its state and its law friendly to corporations that wanted to incorporate there. So among other things at the time, one of the main concerns of businesses was that corporate law would be used politically, that the rules would change to effectuate some kind of political policy. So Delaware adopted a constitutional amendment that its judges would have to be politically balanced. So you couldn't have more than half uh more than a bare majority of one party or the other. So for a seven member court, no more than four can be a member of one party or another. They also put a constitutional amendment that any changes to the corporate code required a twothirds vote of the legislature. So trying to insulate their corporate law from political pressures and then they just made their corporate law very flexible and very manager friendly. Managers could kind of do what they wanted with it and it just sort of took off from there.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这种将公司法律系统置于一个“玻璃罩”中，使其免受政治系统影响的想法，真是引人入胜。这个主题似乎反复出现。我们谈论美联储及其名义上或事实上的独立性时也提到过。我们与阿拉斯加主权财富基金的人交谈时，也提到了政治系统难以触及“谷种”（corn seed: 比喻核心资产或储备）的困难。请您再详细谈谈这些结构，以及它们如何强大地将法院系统与政治隔离开来，这些“玻璃墙”有多么坚固和厚实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is really fascinating this idea of creating the corporate legal system in this sort of glass enclosure through which the political system cannot break. And this is a theme that seems to come up over and over again. We talk about it when we talk about the Federal Reserve and its nominal or de facto independence. This came up when we talk to the Alaska sovereign wealth fund guys and the difficulty that the political system has in accessing the corn seed, so to speak. talk to us a little bit more about the structures in place and how strong they are to insulate the court system from politics and how durable and thick those glass walls are.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的，所以他们无法将法院与立法机关的政治行为等完全隔离开来。这正是我们最近看到的。但他们确实在很大程度上与党派政治隔离开来。党派政治在特拉华州不像在其他地区那样运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, they can't insulate the court from politics in the sense of the legislature acting and so forth. And that's actually what we've just been seeing. But they are fairly insulated from partisan politics. Partisan politics doesn't play out in the same way that we would understand it in other parts of the country or other areas.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 或者其他地区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of the country or other areas.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 这里的想法是，首先，特拉华州显然是一个非常“蓝”的州（blue state: 指倾向于民主党的州），其法官除了审理公司案件外，还会处理其他事务。我们确实会忘记这一点，但他们确实有其他事情要裁决。尽管如此，法官们在政治上是平衡的，以利于这个公司系统。所以，特拉华州公司法的制定方式是，它实际上并不真正来自立法机关，因为大多数立法者都不是公司法专家。他们不一定对公司法了解很多，他们只是立法者。因此，实际情况是，特拉华州律师协会有一个公司法部门，他们实际上负责起草拟议的法规，理论上他们可以以一种非党派的、非常技术官僚的方式来完成这项工作，然后立法机关往往会“橡皮图章”式地批准公司法部门提出的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so the idea here, well, first of all, I mean, one thing to note though is that Delaware is obviously it's very blue state voting behavior and judges do things other than decide corporate cases. We do forget that, but they do in fact have other things to decide. But still, the judges are politically balanced in order to benefit this corporate system. So what happens with the way law is made in Delaware, corporate laws made, is that it actually doesn't really come from the legislature, which really most of the legislature isn't, they're not corporate experts. They don't know much about corporate law necessarily. They're just legislators. So what happens is there's the Delaware State Bar Association has a corporation law section and they actually generate the proposed statutes on the theory that they can do it in a sort of nonpartisan very technocratic way and then the legislature tends to sort of rubber stamp the stuff that comes out of the corporation law section.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 乔之前提到了**网络效应**（network effect），我认为这在法律领域尤为重要，因为很多法律诉讼都基于**判例**（precedent: 以前的法律判决，作为未来类似案件的指导）。所以，特拉华州作为事实上的公司注册州，拥有几十年的判例供法官和律师参考。这种判例或**先发优势**（first-mover advantage: 率先进入市场所获得的优势）是如何帮助特拉华州的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, Joe mentioned that sort of network effect earlier and I think this is really important in law especially because a lot of legal battles are based on precedent, right? And so we have Delaware as the deacto incorporation state and decades and decades of precedent for judges and lawyers to actually look at. How does that sort of I guess precedent or first mover advantage help Delaware?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 嗯，一直以来都认为这会帮助特拉华州，因为你有了法规，还有几十年的判例，所以公司会知道如果出现问题，如何解决。在很多领域，其他州根本没有关于法院如何处理特定类型的索赔或纠纷的信息。一些显而易见的情况是像**激进投资者收购**（activist takeovers: 激进投资者通过购买大量股份来影响公司管理层和战略）或**委托书争夺战**（proxy contests: 股东通过争取其他股东的投票权来影响公司决策）以及**收购防御**（takeover defenses: 公司为避免被敌意收购而采取的策略），因为我们知道这些在特拉华州是如何运作的，因为特拉华州注册了大多数发生这类斗争的上市公司。我们不知道这些在其他州是如何运作的，因为在那些州，激进投资者的情况往往没有那么多。所以，这一直被认为是特拉华州的一个优势，即所有事情都在那里发生。而且大多数其他州在决定自己的公司法时，也常常会参考特拉华州。有时他们会将自己的公司法与特拉华州进行对比，但特拉华州始终是他们处理这些问题的参考对象。这一直被认为是特拉华州的一个真正优势：你至少知道会发生什么。但这也意味着，由于这是**判例法**（case law: 由法官判决而非立法机关制定的法律），它主要不是或一直不是法规中的内容，而是法官逐案裁决的。这有时也可能意味着它很难理解，因为你必须阅读这个判决，然后不要忘记那个判决，也不要忘记这个判决。如果你是第一次接触，这可能很难弄清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's always been assumed that that would help Delaware because you would have the statute and you have a decades of precedent so that companies would kind of know how questions would be answered if they came up. So, there are a lot of areas where other states you just simply do not have information on like how a court would treat particular kinds of claims or particular kinds of disputes. Some of the obvious things are things like activist takeovers or or proxy contests and takeover defenses because we know how that looks in Delaware because Delaware incorporates most of the public companies where you have those kinds of fights. We don't know how that looks in other states because you don't tend to have as many activist situations in those other states. So that's always thought to be sort of an advantage of Delaware that everything plays out there. And most other states, they very often look to Delaware when they're deciding their own corporate law. Sometimes they contrast their corporate law with Delaware, but Delaware is always kind of where they look to deal with these questions. And that's always considered to be a real advantage of Delaware. You at least know what's going to happen. But it also means that because this is case law, it's mostly not in the or hasn't been mostly in the statute. It's judgeby judge decisions. And that can also mean that sometimes it's sort of hard to penetrate because it's really you've got to read this decision. Well, don't forget this other decision and don't forget this decision too. And that can be sort of hard to figure out if you're just looking at it for the first time.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，我对这种张力非常感兴趣。因为理论上，法律写在纸上，都是可见的，而且是一致的，我们知道会发生什么。但同时，判决是由法官做出的，人们会对此提出争议。否则，他们一开始就不需要打官司了。如果法官不需要行使某种**裁量权**（agency: 在此指法官的自主判断和行动能力）。法官在审理这些案件时，如何看待自己的责任，以考虑特拉华州公司法的一致性或深层原则，以及对特拉华州长期影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I'm really interested in this tension, right? Because in theory, okay, you write down laws on paper and they're all visible and say, okay, this is consistent. We know what's going to happen. But also, decisions are made by judges and people dispute them. Otherwise, they wouldn't have to have cases in the first part. if uh if judges didn't have to exercise some sort of agency. How do the judges feel about their own responsibility when deciding these cases to think about consistency or the underlying deep principles of Delaware corporate law and the long-term implications for the state of Delaware and for the state of when they make their decisions?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的，这里存在一种张力。你刚才指出了特拉华州与一般公司理论和公司法之间的张力。我认为，除非你真正欣赏法律并乐在其中，否则你不会成为法官或进入这个领域。特拉华州的法官对公司法以及公司应如何运作有着极其深刻的思考。他们不总是持有完全相同的理论，但他们肯定有自己的观点，并且非常关心公司法如何运作。但是，这也是目前一些张力所在。如果公司董事会一次又一次地对他们的判决不满，那么特拉华州可能会失去公司注册给其他州。这种对公司法应有愿景的忠诚，与如果管理者不满意并到其他地方注册，特拉华州就无法再做太多事情的直接现实之间的博弈，这种张力在特拉华州开始吸引公司注册以来就一直存在。我的意思是，我从不认为法官通常会根据这种张力有意识地做出决定，或者他们肯定会努力避免这样做，但这种张力始终存在，并且过去也一直存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, there's a tension there. So you just identified like a tension a tension between the state of Delaware versus general corporate theory and corporate law. And I think you don't become a judge and you don't go into this area unless you really do appreciate the law and enjoy it and and have I mean the Delaware judges are extremely thoughtful about corporate law and what the right answer is and how corporations should work. They don't always have exactly the same theories, but they definitely have a point of view and they care very much about how corporate law operates. But, and you know, this is where some of the tension is today. If corporate boards are unhappy with their decisions over and over and over again, then Delaware may lose incorporations to other states. And how that plays out between sort of fidelity to a vision of what corporate law should be, coupled with the straightup reality that if managers are unhappy and incorporate elsewhere, Delaware doesn't have doesn't get to do much anymore. That's a tension that's been playing out for just as long as Delaware's been incorporating companies. I mean that's always I don't think judges are usually consciously making that decisions based on that or they're certainly trying not to but that tension is always present and has been present in the past.</p>

### 衡平法院：历史与职能

**Tracy Alloway:** 在我们讨论为什么一些公司目前对特拉华州不满之前，我想先问乔的经典问题，每当提到这个话题时他都会问：什么是**衡平法院**（Chancery Court: 专门处理公平和公正而非严格法律条文的法院）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we get to why companies some companies seem unhappy with Delaware at the moment I'm going to go ahead and ask Joe's classic question whenever this comes up which is what is a chancery court?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 嗯，它只是特拉华州审理公司案件的法院的名称。这是一个非常技术性的法律问题，但从历史上看，世界上有两种类型的法院：**普通法法院**（courts of law: 遵循严格法律规则的法院）和**衡平法院**（courts of equity: 侧重于公平和正义的法院）。普通法法院遵循严格的规则，而衡平法院则字面上是关于公平和处理“正确答案”以及伸张正义，而不是按照既定的技术规则行事。所以当时有两种独立的法院，这起源于英国，在美国也是如此。然后，美国在20世纪30年代左右在联邦层面将这两种法院合并，大多数州也做了同样的事情。所以只有一个法院审理所有案件，包括普通法案件和衡平法案件。但特拉华州从未这样做。所以它仍然有独立的普通法法院和衡平法院，也就是**衡平法院**。所以它的历史渊源本质上植根于公平和命令人们采取适当行动的理念。它没有陪审团。案件只由法官审理。法官会查明事实，而通常陪审团会做这些，但在特拉华州衡平法院，法官会查明事实。他们非常专业。他们都是在担任法官之前从公司实践中选拔出来的。这就是他们的工作。我的意思是，他们除了公司案件外，还会审理其他案件。其他事情也属于衡平法的范畴，但主要当然是公司案件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well it's just the name for the Delaware courts that hear corporate cases. So I mean the f this is a very technical legal point but historically there were two types of courts in the world. There were the courts of law and the courts of equity. The courts of law followed sort of these stringent rules and the courts of equity were literally sort of about fairness and dealing with what's the right answer and doing justice as opposed to according to technical rules that were laid down. And so there was two separate courts and that was from England and that was true in the United States. And then the United States in the 30s or so melded the two courts at the federal level and most states did the same. So there would just be one court that heard all the cases, law cases and equity cases. But Delaware never did that. So it still has this separate court of law and the court of equity which is the chancery court. So its historical origins are essentially rooted in this idea of fairness and commanding people to take the proper actions. And it doesn't sit with a jury. The cases are heard just by the judges. The judges find facts would otherwise juries would do that, but the judges find facts in the Delaware Court of Chancery. They're very expert. They are, you know, they're all drawn from corporate practice before they get on the bench. And that's what they do. I mean, they hear other things besides corporate cases. Other things fall into this category of equity, but the main thing obviously is the corporate cases.</p>

### 特拉华州公司法面临的早期挑战

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我想最终我们会谈到埃隆的薪酬案，也许会听听您的看法。但在那之前，您提到这不是什么新鲜事。关于特拉华州及其持久性，一直存在一些长期的问题。您能给我们讲讲历史，或者在埃隆的案件之前，有哪些案件曾让人们质疑特拉华州系统的持久性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I want to eventually get into the Elon Pay case and maybe get your read on it, etc. But before we do that, you mentioned that this is nothing new. Some of these there are these longstanding questions about the Delaware and its persistence. Can you give us a little history or what are you know what were the Elon cases pre the Elon cases that sort of maybe had people questioning the sort of durability of the Delaware system</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 很久很久以前，在埃隆之前，那是在80年代，当时发生了两件大事。所以有一个案例，如果你上过任何基础公司法课程，你都会学到这些基本法律案例。其中一个案例叫做**本戈古姆**（Ben Gorgum: 可能是对“Smith v. Van Gorkom”案的口误，该案确立了董事在出售公司时有义务尽职调查）。基本上，一家公司正在出售自己，他们确定了一个价格，但股东起诉称董事会在定价时没有尽到适当的注意义务。没有人暗示他们有恶意，但他们只是没有花时间确保获得最好的价格。特拉华州最高法院同意了，并裁定董事可能因未能为公司获得合理价格而对损害承担个人责任。这让董事会感到非常恐慌，因为这些董事会可能在善意行事，但仍然可能因为没有以足够的价格出售公司而承担责任。这涉及巨额赔偿。所以特拉华州修改了其公司法，允许公司在其章程中添加一项条款，规定董事不对因**过失**（negligence: 未尽到合理注意义务）造成的金钱损失承担责任。这之后也确实促进了公司在特拉华州注册。现在，每个州都采用了类似的规定。但在当时，这样做主要是因为他们知道自己已经把董事会吓坏了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The long long long ago before Elon Elon Avant it's it's in the 80s it was that long ago it was the 80s there were two big incidents so one case of like these are the basic law cases that you learn if you're in any kind of basic corporate law class so one case was called Ben Gorgum Basically, a company was selling itself and they settled on a price and shareholders sued claiming that the board didn't take proper care in setting this price. Nobody suggested they were acting in bad faith, but they just didn't take the time to make sure that they got the best price. And the Delaware Supreme Court agreed and it held that the directors could be held personally liable for damages for essentially not getting the right price for the company. And that terrified boards because these boards could be acting in good faith and still could be I mean not selling the company for enough. That's serious money and damages. So Delaware amended its corporate code so that companies can now add a provision to their charter that says directors will not be held liable for monetary damages for negligence. And that really also boosted companies incorporating in Delaware after that. And by now every state has adopted a similar thing. But at the time that was done essentially because they knew that they had just scared the be Jesus out of boards.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 另一个问题也出现在80年代，那是在**敌意收购**（hostile takeover: 未经目标公司董事会同意而进行的收购）时代。那是一个“交易十年”，发生了大量的敌意收购尝试。当发生敌意收购尝试时，董事会通常会设置障碍，比如**股东权利计划**（shareholder rights plans: 也称“毒丸计划”，旨在阻止敌意收购）或**毒丸计划**（poison pills: 一种公司防御策略，使敌意收购变得昂贵或难以实现），以阻止敌意收购。当时有一个真正的问题是，董事会在抵御敌意收购者方面能走多远，即使股东希望达成这笔交易。起初，特拉华州法院对此非常严格。在某个阶段之后，他们会说：“听着，你们必须让股东决定。如果股东想要，董事会不能仅仅阻止有利的收购提议。”再一次，出现了公司会离开的威胁。他们会离开特拉华州，以便能够抵御敌意收购尝试。在那时，特拉华州最高法院退让了。它采用了新的标准，允许董事会在抵御敌意收购尝试时获得更大的**裁量权**（deference: 尊重和顺从）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And another issue that came up, this was also in the 80s, was during the hostile takeover era. This was like, you know, the deal decade. There were lots and lots of hostile takeover attempts. And when there's a hostile takeover attempt, boards put up barriers, usually shareholder rights, plants, poison pills, to prevent hostile takeovers. And there was a real question as to how far boards could go to fend off a hostile acquirer, even if the shareholders wanted this deal. And at first, the Delaware courts were pretty strict about it. They after a certain point, they were saying, "Look, you got to let shareholders decide. The board can't just block beneficial proposals to buy the company if the shareholders want it." And once again, there were threats to that companies would leave. They would leave Delaware so that they could protect against hostile takeover attempts. And at that point, the Delaware Supreme Court backed off. It adopted new standards that allowed much more deference to boards when they are fighting off hostile takeover attempts.</p>

### 特拉华州主导地位的动摇与“冲突交易”

**Joe Weisenthal:** 那么快进到今天，我只是想确保我们的**先验知识**（priors: 在贝叶斯统计中指对事件的初始信念或假设）是正确的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, fast forward to today, I just want to make sure we have our priors correct.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们喜欢在这个播客中建立我们的先验知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We love establishing our priors on this podcast.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但是，抛开这些例子不谈，现在是否感觉有更多关于特拉华州替代方案的讨论，或者有更多公司似乎正在迁离？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, those examples aside, does it feel like nowadays there is perhaps more discussion of alternatives to Delaware or more companies that seem to be moving away?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的。所以，我不知道从统计数据上看，这些数字是否真的会产生影响。我们确实看到了一些备受瞩目的公司宣布计划搬迁，但我们现在还没有足够的数据来判断这是否是一次严重的实际**出走潮**（exodus: 大规模离开）。但肯定有更多的讨论，而且肯定有更多的董事会或律师在考虑是否要在特拉华州注册，而以前这根本不是一个问题。所以，这确实正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, I don't know if statistically the numbers really move the needle. We've seen definitely some high-profile announcements of companies planning to move, but we just don't have enough data right now to see whether this is a serious like actual exodus. But there's definitely a lot more discussion and there's definitely a lot more boards thinking or lawyers thinking they have to council boards whether you want to incorporate in Delaware when before that wouldn't wouldn't even have been a question. So, that's definitely something that's happening.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 为什么呢？那是什么原因？如果律师在为董事会提供咨询，不要仅仅因为我认识一些曾创办初创公司的人，他们认为在特拉华州注册是理所当然的，马上就做了。但是，律师可能会说什么，让他们觉得也许应该多考虑一下？到底是什么发生了变化导致了这种情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, why? So, what is it? If a lawyer is counseling boards, don't just because I, you know, I've known people who have launched startups at times and the idea of incorporation in Delaware. That was just obviously what you did, right? You just did it right away. Absolutely. But so what is it that a lawyer might say, well, maybe take a few beats and think about this. What has actually changed that's caused that?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 嗯，特拉华州已经反击了，它最近修改了法律以应对这种情况。但本质上，大部分问题是股东责任或对股东的责任，以及面临股东诉讼的脆弱性。而这种脆弱性大部分是由于**冲突交易**（conflicted transactions: 交易一方的个人利益与公司利益发生冲突）引起的股东诉讼。这是主要的头条新闻。还有其他一些问题出现，但主要的头条新闻是董事会认为特拉华州让股东太容易起诉冲突交易了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Delaware understand has fought back and it's changed its law very recently to sort of fight this off. But essentially the issue most of the issue is shareholder liability or liability to shareholders and vulnerability to a shareholder lawsuit and most of that vulnerability is vulnerability to a shareholder lawsuit over conflicted transactions. That's the main headline thing. There are a few other issues that have come up, but the main headline thing is boards feeling as though Delaware has made it too easy for shareholders to sue over conflicted transactions.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 什么是**冲突交易**（conflicted transaction: 交易一方的个人利益与公司利益发生冲突）？为了让我们了解这些术语，能举一个例子吗，无论是形象的还是实际的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's a conflicted transaction? Just so we know these terms. What is an example of one either figurative or actual?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 实际的例子是特斯拉收购**SolarCity**（SolarCity: 埃隆·马斯克联合创立的太阳能公司，后被特斯拉收购）。埃隆·马斯克在这笔交易中身兼两职。他是特斯拉的董事会成员，也是SolarCity的董事会成员和运营者。所以特斯拉正在利用其资源收购埃隆·马斯克的公司。这是一个典型的**冲突交易**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh actual Tesla buying Solar City. Elon Musk was on both sides of that transaction. He's on the board of Tesla and he's on the board of and running Solar City. And so Tesla is using its resources to buy out Elon Musk company. So that's a classic conflict transaction.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这让我想起了埃隆。特斯拉从特拉华州迁往德克萨斯州有多大的影响？因为我们谈到了**网络效应**（network effect）。是不是一家备受瞩目的公司搬迁了，突然所有其他公司都会说：“我们也要这样做”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That actually reminds me, just speaking of Elon, but how big a deal was Tesla moving from Delaware to Texas? Because we talk about this network effect. Is it the case that one high-profile company moves and suddenly all these other companies are like, "We're going to do that, too."</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的，我认为影响很大。首先，我们都知道这次搬迁是受薪酬方案案启发的，但我认为对特拉华州的一些抱怨更为广泛。但我认为这是一件大事，仅仅因为埃隆·马斯克受到很多首席执行官、风险投资家和硅谷的钦佩。他们把他视为真正的榜样。所以当他公开宣布受够了特拉华州，并表明一家上市公司有可能获得股东支持，从特拉华州迁出时，即使他很特殊，他与股东的关系可能不被其他公司共享，但我认为这会促使董事会开始考虑这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's a big deal. I mean, first of all, you know, we all know that it was inspired by the that move was inspired by the pay package case, but I think some of the grumblings about Delaware are broader. But I think that was a big deal if for no other reason than Elon Musk is very admired by a lot of CEOs, a lot of venture capitalists, a lot of Silicon Valley. They look to him as a real role model. And so when he publicly announces that he's had it with Delaware and shows that it's possible to take a public company and gets shareholder support for moving out of Delaware, even if he is special and he has a particular relationship with the shareholders that may not be shared by other companies, I think that's the kind of thing that has boards thinking putting it on the table.</p>
</details>

### 埃隆·马斯克薪酬案的争议

**Joe Weisenthal:** 让我们谈谈薪酬方案案。我不太懂法律，对这些事情一无所知。但我会说：“嘿，这是他同意的薪酬方案。这个法官凭什么说他不能获得报酬？”直觉上，这对我来说似乎是离谱的。为什么这个法官要取消他的薪酬方案？但这只是我这个“傻瓜”的粗略看法，我可能甚至没有读过那篇文章。所以，我坦诚地说，您作为真正了解这些事情的人，能告诉我我们应该如何理解这个案件的全部内容吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about the pay package deal. I don't know. Like, look, I I really don't know much about the law or anything about this stuff at all. But I say, but I say, "Hey, this was the compensation package he agreed to. Who is this judge to say that he can't get paid?" Intuitively to me, it seems outrageous. Why is this judge cancelling his pay package? But this is my dumb guy just reading a head. I didn't even read the article, probably. So, why don't you I'm being honest here. So why don't you tell me as someone who actually understands this stuff how we should read what that case was all about.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 好的。所以请记住，这里的问题是**冲突交易**（conflicted transactions）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So remember the issue here is conflicted transactions.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 马斯克的薪酬是一个标准的**冲突交易**，因为董事会正在决定支付给其首席执行官的薪酬，这在董事会的自由裁量权范围内。但董事会成员包括埃隆·马斯克和他的兄弟。所以这属于典型的冲突交易。很多首席执行官都在自己的董事会中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Musk's pay was a standard conflicted transaction in the sense that the board was deciding what it was going to pay its CEO which is very much well within the board discretion. But the board included Elon Musk and his brother. So therefore this was your classic conflict transaction. It was a board A lot of CEOs are on their board.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 好的，继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Keep going.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 所以，根据特拉华州法律，一般规则是，**冲突交易**（conflicted transaction）将受到法院的严格审查，除非它被“净化”。如何净化呢？你需要在决策过程中加入一个独立的决策者，然后法院会说：“好吧，我将遵从这个独立的决策者。”你有两个选择来作为独立的决策者：未冲突的董事会成员或股东。通常，我的意思是，这种情况不会发生。你必须了解这个案件是多么不寻常。通常，这已经足够了。你让未冲突的董事会成员决定薪酬，或者让无利害关系的股东对薪酬进行投票，到那时特拉华州就会说：“我不管了，祝你们好运。”这里的问题是，未冲突的董事会成员并非未冲突。所以他们都像是他用基本上是他的“死党”来充实特斯拉的董事会。他们成立了一个委员会，本应是委员会的独立成员，但该委员会仍然与马斯克关系密切。然后委员会又成立了一个工作组，负责制定薪酬方案，他们选了与马斯克关系最密切的人加入工作组。所有这些事实都表明他干预了委员会的审议，而委员会只是顺从了他。因此，鉴于法院认为他们没有在董事会层面设置实际独立的决策者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, under Delaware law, the general rule is a conflicted transaction will get close scrutiny by a court unless it's cleansed. And how do you cleanse it? You put an independent decision maker in the mix and then the court will say, "Well, I'll just defer to the independent decision maker." And you have two options for an independent decision maker. The unconlicted board members or the shareholders. And usually, I mean, this doesn't happen. You have to understand how unusual a case was. Usually that's more than sufficient. You have the unconlicted board members decide the pay or you have the disinterested shareholders vote on the pay and at that point Delaware says I'm out you guys. You God bless. The problem here was that the unconflicted board members were not unconlicted. So they were all like he stocks Tesla's board with people who are basically his bestest buds. And they created a committee that was supposed to be the independent members of the committee. and the committee still had close ties to Musk. And then the committee formed a working group that would really do the compensation package and they picked the people with the closest ties to Musk to put in the working group. And there were all these facts about how he interfered with committee's deliberations and they just deferred to him. So given that the court felt that like they didn't put actual independent decision makers at the board level.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 所以他们把它提交给股东，并进行了股东投票。但在**委托书声明**（proxy statement: 公司向股东发出的文件，包含投票信息和公司治理细节）中没有充分披露。股东没有被充分告知，而且显而易见，除非股东拥有充分的信息，否则他们无法净化任何东西。所以，在董事会不独立于马斯克，且股东未被充分告知的情况下，法院认为它必须评估薪酬方案，因为没有独立的决策者参与其中。然后，法院裁定薪酬过高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then they took it to the shareholders and they did a shareholder vote. But there was not full disclosure in the proxy statement. the shareholders were not fully informed and for obvious reasons shareholders can't cleanse anything unless they have full information. So left with a situation where the board was not independent of Musk and the shareholders were not fully informed. That's why the court felt well I have to evaluate the pay package because no independent decision maker was put in the mix and then from there she decided it was too much.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这可能是一个很难回答的问题，但既然我们正在讨论，如您所说，这场讨论或辩论围绕着股东责任展开，我们是否有任何研究能告诉我们，当一家公司表示将迁离特拉华州或实际迁离时，其股价会发生什么变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this might be a tough question to ask, but since we're talking, you know, this discussion or debate centers on shareholder liability as you laid out, do we have any research that actually tells us what happens to share prices and stocks when a company signals that it's going to move away from Delaware or when it actually does it?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 我们有非常混杂的证据。事实上，学者们一直在争论这是否会产生影响，一些人发现，根据公司类型，这可能是有益的。我的意思是，特拉华州很昂贵。特拉华州拥有这种特许经营业务的全部意义在于，这是该州为自己筹集资金的方式。它25%的收入来自注册费。没有其他州能做到这一点。所以对于资源较少的小公司来说，迁离特拉华州可能是有益的。但大多数情况下，这是不同学者会得出不同结论的问题。我们只是不确定。这可能是因为特拉华州长期以来一直占据主导地位，至少对于上市公司而言，很难判断是否有真正的迁离趋势。现在我们就会知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have incredibly mixed evidence. The fact is that scholars have been fighting about this forever whether it makes a difference and some have found that maybe it's beneficial depending on the type of company. Like I mean Delaware is expensive. I mean the the whole point of Delaware having this chartering business is that's how the state funds itself. It gets 25% of its revenues from incorporation fees. No other state does anything like that. So for smaller companies with less resources, it can be beneficial to move away from Delaware. But mostly this is something where different scholars will come up with different things. We just don't know for sure. And that's probably because Delaware has been dominating for so long, at least for public companies, that it's hard to tell if there's a serious movement away. Now we'll know.</p>
</details>

### 德克萨斯州的吸引力与“逐底竞争”

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这很有趣。那么我们来谈谈在德克萨斯州重新注册的吸引力。你知道，我能理解这可能只是出于某种氛围和模糊的意识形态。埃隆想去德克萨斯州，我并不惊讶。那里的政客们可能会说：“埃隆，快来吧。”股东们可能会说：“我们要远离那些对你实行共产主义、不让你获得数十亿美元薪酬的‘蓝州’。”话虽如此，对我来说，人们喜欢特拉华州的目标或原因，正是这种平衡的理念。因为虽然可能有一个埃隆·马斯克崇拜者群体乐意给他钱，但并非所有股东都希望与他们的首席执行官建立这种关系，随意支付大量金钱。所以在我看来，德克萨斯州可能适合埃隆和他的股东，但在许多情况下，某种法院系统能够维持首席执行官、董事会和外部股东之间的权力平衡，这仍然是大多数公司所期望的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's interesting. So let's talk about the allure of say reinccorporating in Texas. You know, I could see just sort of for vibes and vague ideological things. Elon wants to go to Texas. I'm not surprised. and they're probably the politicians or yeah, Elon, come on down. The shareholders are like, "We're going to get get away from those blue states that impose communism on you by not letting you get your billion dollar pay package or whatever." All that being said, the goal it seems to me or why people like Delaware is right this idea of balance because while there may be an Elon Musk cult that loves to hand him money and not every shareholder wants to have that relationship with their CEO where they're just forking over a lot of money. And so it seems to me that okay, maybe Texas is a good fit for Elon and his shareholders, but that's still in many cases some sort of court system that imposes maintains a balance of power between the CEO, the board, and the outside shareholders is still what's going to be desirable for most companies.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的，这是一个复杂的问题。这正是特拉华州一直以来的“卖点”。它基本上维持了一种平衡，它给了董事会极大的灵活性和极大的**裁量权**（difference: 在此指尊重和顺从），但最终为股东提供了基本的保护底线。问题是，或者说有双重问题。首先，最终的公司管理者是决定初创公司注册地的人。我的意思是，一旦你上市，如果你想搬迁，你需要股东投票。但在那之前，你可以选择任何你想要的公司。即使你上市后需要股东投票，正如我们在特斯拉案例中看到的，如果你是像Meta那样拥有控股股东的公司，股东投票就非常容易，就是控股股东想要什么。所以搬迁并不难。因此，你之所以不这样做，本质上是如果你真的认为你会为此付出股东的代价。目前尚不清楚股东会为在保护较少的州注册而付出多大的代价。所以理论上一直认为，如果你在一个保护较少的州，**资本成本**（cost of capital: 公司为筹集资金而支付的成本）会更高。但目前尚不清楚这会产生多大影响。正如你刚才问的，搬到另一个州真的会带来股东价值的代价吗？目前尚不清楚股东是否有能力反击，而且特拉华州也看到了这种趋势，削弱了许多导致像马斯克薪酬案那样判决的股东保护措施。所以现在我们真的不知道是否有区别了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So this is a complicated question. Um, that is exactly how Delaware has sold itself. That essentially that it maintained a balance that it mostly gave boards incredible amounts of flexibility and incredible amounts of difference. But ultimately there was um some basic floor of protections for shareholders. The issue well there are twofold issues. The first is that ultimately corporate managers are the ones who make decisions about where to incorporate when they do a startup. I mean once you're actually publicly traded, if you want to move, you need a shareholder vote. But before then you can pick any company you want to. And even if you need a shareholder vote once you're publicly traded, as we saw with Tesla, if you're a Meta or where you have a controlling shareholder, the shareholder votes really easy. It's just what the controlling shareholder wants. So moving is not hard. And so the only reason essentially that you wouldn't do it is if you really thought you were going to pay a price with shareholders. It's not clear how much of a price shareholders are going to inflict for being in a state with fewer protections. So the theory has always been the cost of capital will be higher if you're in a state with fewer protections. But it's not clear how much that plays in. As you just asked, like is there really a shareholder value price for moving to a different state? It's not clear shareholders really have the power to push back and Delaware also seeing this move weakened a lot of the shareholder protections that led to verdicts like the Musk pay package case. So now we really don't know if there's a difference.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 为什么少数股东会同意迁往一个表面上权利较少的司法管辖区？因为请记住，90%的问题都与股东诉讼有关。可能存在冲突交易以及因冲突交易而提起诉讼。这正是这场争论的大部分内容。它不是唯一的问题，但却是大部分。关于股东诉讼是否是解决这个问题的最佳方式，存在着巨大的争议。我的意思是，人们对**敲诈性诉讼**（strike suits: 旨在通过和解而非实际审判来获取金钱的诉讼）有很多担忧。有人担心这只是律师驱动的诉讼。在**托内塔案**（Tornetta case: 指“Tornetta v. Elon Musk et al.”案，是马斯克薪酬方案纠纷的法律名称），即埃隆·马斯克薪酬方案案中，请记住，那里的股东只持有九股特斯拉股票，真的只有九股。所以，关于股东诉讼是否真的值得付出努力，存在着一个真正的问题。毫无疑问，存在真正有问题的交易，股东诉讼可以为股东赢得巨额赔偿，但通常这些赔偿来自公司自己支付的保险，通过这些巨额和解金。而这是否最终是处理冲突交易情况的最佳方式，这是一个非常有争议的问题。所以股东们很可能会认为他们可以迁往一个保护较少的司法管辖区，理论上认为，最终减少诉讼对公司更有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why would a minority shareholder actually approve to move to a jurisdiction where ostensibly they have fewer rights? Because remember 90% of this is about shareholder litigation. There may be a or and conflict transactions and suing over conflict transactions. That is most of what this fight is about. It's not the only thing it's most of it. There is a huge debate about whether shareholder litigation is in fact the best way to handle this problem. I mean there are all kinds of concerns about strike suits. There are concerns that, you know, that this is just lawyer driven litigation. In the Tornetta case, the Elon Musk pay package. Remember, the shareholder there held nine shares, literally nine shares of Tesla stock. So, there's a real question about whether shareholder litigation is in fact a game that's worth the candle. Unquestionably, there are real problematic transactions and shareholder litigation can win very huge payouts for shareholders, but usually those payouts come from the insurance that the company itself paid for in these huge settlements. And whether or not that ultimately is the best way to handle a conflict transaction situation is is a very debated question. So shareholders may very well think they can move to a jurisdiction with fewer protections on a theory that ultimately less litigation is better for the company.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这是一个非常奇怪的情况，因为本质上，你再次看到了这样一种情况：股东对州政府不满，因为州政府不允许更多的股东资金流入某个人的口袋。这是一个非常奇怪的情况。股东诉讼总的来说对我来说是一个有点有趣的领域。我记得25年前，我有时会买卖个股，当一只股票业绩不及预期时，突然你会收到一封电子邮件，上面写着这家公司正在提起诉讼。我当时想，我为什么要参与一场针对我共同拥有的公司的诉讼呢？这真的对我有利吗，还是只对律师有利？我对此也一直不太清楚。即使抛开这些冲突问题不谈，总的来说也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a very strange situation because essentially again you have this situation in which the shareholders were upset at the state for not allowing more shareholder money to go into the pocket of one individual person. That's a very strange situation etc. Shareholder lawsuits always strike me as a little bit interesting field in general. I remember back 25 years ago when I sometimes used to buy and trade individual stocks and a stock would miss earnings and then suddenly you get an email it's like this company is filing suit. It's like why do I want to take a part in a lawsuit against this company that I am a co-owner of. Does this actually benefit me or does this benefit anyone other than the lawyer? I've never been totally clear on that either. Just in general even setting aside sort of these conflict questions.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的，我的意思是，这是一个非常有争议的问题，但对于大多数这类诉讼来说，欺诈诉讼和根据联邦证券法提起的诉讼，以及特拉华州处理的违反**信义义务**（breach of fiduciary duty: 董事或高管未能以公司最佳利益行事）的州法律诉讼之间存在差异。在那里，我的意思是，当发生这样的诉讼时，任何赔偿都应该从董事支付给股东或公司。所以这是理论上的金钱利益，但董事通常不会自掏腰包。他们有保险。所以如果他们支付，那是保险公司支付的。你猜谁支付保险费？公司支付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean that's it's a very debated question but for most of these suits I mean there is a difference between a suit for fraud under the federal securities laws and a state law suit for breach of fiduciary duty which is what Delaware handles and there I mean when there's a lawsuit like that any payment is supposed to come from the directors to the shareholders or to the company. So that's the that's the theoretical monetary benefit but directors usually don't pay out of pocket. They've got insurance. So if they pay, it's the insurance. And guess who pays for the insurance? The corporation does.</p>

<p class="english-text">Okay, keep going.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的，你之前提到了这一点，但特拉华州并没有坐视不理，眼睁睁看着公司迁往他处。这是否会导致一场**逐底竞争**（race to the bottom: 各方通过降低标准来竞争，最终导致整体水平下降），即各州会说：“好吧，如果你降低标准或改变这里的平衡，我也会这样做”，然后所有人都竞相降低标准？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so you touched on this earlier, but Delaware isn't exactly standing still while it sees companies move elsewhere. Is this just going to result in a sort of race to the bottom in terms of shareholder rights where states are just like, well, if you drop your standards or if you alter the balance here, I'm going to do the same thing and everyone just kind of races to the bottom.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 我认为这正是我们正在看到的。我的意思是，内华达州和德克萨斯州本质上正在推销他们的法律，声称可以为股东诉讼设置障碍。而特拉华州也这样做了。它修改了法律，设置了更多障碍。现在，它做得更巧妙，这正是为什么我认为他们仍然在进行这场竞争，因为特拉华州不想公开宣称：“不，就这样了。我们只是禁止股东诉讼。”所以他们写了很多复杂的文字，但最终它们都归结为同一件事。所有三个州都使得股东几乎不可能提起诉讼，除非是在最欺诈性的情况下。所以，我认为我们正处于这场竞争中。我们现在正在目睹它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's what we're absolutely seeing. I mean, Nevada and Texas are essentially selling their law as creating barriers to shareholder lawsuits. And that's what Delaware did. It changed its law to put up more barriers. Now, it did so more subtly, which is exactly why I think they're still like this race because Delaware didn't want to like openly say, "No, that's it. We're just barring shareholder lawsuits." So, they wrote a lot of words and they're complex words, but ultimately they they all come out to the same thing. All three states have made it much much harder, if not virtually impossible, for anything but in the most fraudulent circumstances shareholders to bring claims. So, I think we're at that race. We're watching it right now.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我能理解为什么一家上市公司董事会或一家上市公司会说：“好吧，我们希望在一个股东提起诉讼更困难的司法管辖区。”等等。那么，根据公司的成熟度，计算方式是否不同？比如说，一家早期阶段的初创公司？就像我说的，我认识一些初创公司的人，他们做的第一件事就是去特拉华州注册。在那种情况下，也许从法律角度来看，风险投资公司（VCs）对公司的拥有程度是否比上市公司股东更深？即使名义上他们都只是股东，并且有一个独立的董事会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I could understand why a public company board or a public company would say okay we want to be in a jurisdiction where it's much harder for shareholders to bring lawsuits etc. Is the calculus different depending on the maturity of the company? And could you say like an early stage startup? Like I said, I've known people in the startup space first, one of the first things they do is incorporate in Delaware. In those situations, maybe from the legal perspective, did the VCs own the company in a more deep way than public company shareholders do? Even though nominally they're all just shareholders and there's a separate board.</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 是的。这种股东诉讼在风险投资支持的或较小的公司中极为罕见。这是因为股东的身份。我的意思是，股东主要是内部人士或风险投资家的朋友。他们不想惹恼他们。他们可能已经签署了**仲裁协议**（arbitration agreements: 规定争议通过仲裁而非诉讼解决的协议），无论如何都会阻止任何形式的诉讼。所以，诉讼问题更多是上市公司的问题。话虽如此，特拉华州也解决了一些真正困扰初创企业社区的问题。例如，许多初创公司喜欢签订**股东协议**（shareholder agreements: 股东之间关于公司治理和权利的合同），其中一个股东被赋予了实质性的治理权利，不是因为他们是股东并可以投票，而是因为他们有合同权利说：“董事会，除非我批准，否则你不能合并。董事会，除非我批准，否则你不能承担债务。”几年前，特拉华州的一个法院判决，我认为在当时的特拉华州法律下非常正确，说：“嗯，你在公司中不能这样做。董事会必须管理公司。你不能仅仅通过说‘这是你的合同。你可以批准所有董事会的决定’，就把治理权交给一个股东。”这真的吓坏了风险投资界。特拉华州立即通过授权这类股东协议做出了反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And a shareholder litigation, this kind of shareholder litigation is extremely rare in VC back or smaller companies. And and that's because who the shareholders are. I mean, the shareholders are largely insiders or friends of VC. They don't want to anger them. They may have signed arbitration agreements that would prevent any kind of lawsuit anyway. So, this issue of litigation is much more of a public company problem. That said, there were some issues that were really bugging the startup community that Delaware fixed as well. For example, a lot of startups like to have shareholder agreements where one shareholder is given essentially governance rights, not because they're a shareholder and they can vote their shares, but because they have a contractual right to say, "Board, you're not allowed to merge unless I approve. Board, you're not allowed to take on debt unless I approve." And Delaware a couple years ago, a court decision, I think very correctly under Delaware law at the time, said, "Well, you can't do that in a corporation. The board has to run the company. You can't just hand over governance rights to a shareholder by saying, "Well, here's your contract. You get to approve all board decisions." That really scared the VC community. And Delaware reacted immediately by authorizing those kinds of shareholder agreements.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** Tracy，我认为将会出现一些非常有趣的公司治理问题。你知道，我们讨论过的一些案例，比如人工智能初创公司被**收购兼并**（aqua hired: 指公司被收购，主要目的是获得其人才而非产品），并非所有价值都归属于股东，或者根据员工身份，归属于不同类别的股东。我敢打赌，这会产生一些非常有趣的公司治理法律。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tracy, I think there's going to be some very interesting questions of corporate governance that come up. You know, some of these episodes that we've discussed where AI startups the company gets aqua hired and not all the value gets accured to shareholders or different class of shareholders depending on what employee are. I bet there will be some very interesting corporate governance law that comes out of this</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 当然。你知道，肯定会有某个州试图将自己打造成人工智能初创公司的注册地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For sure. And you know there's going to be some state that tries to pitch itself as like the place to incorporate AI startups.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 一个人工智能初创公司。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An AI start. Yeah.</p>
</details>

### 公司注册地的选择与国际比较

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。那么，说到初创公司，如果乔和我打算注册成立**OddLots**（Odd Lots: 播客名称），我想我们可能会是一家**有限责任公司**（LLC: Limited Liability Company: 一种结合了公司和合伙企业特点的商业实体）。也许不是有限责任公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, speaking of startups, if Joe and I were going to incorporate and become OddLots, I guess we'd be an LLC. Maybe not LLC.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，很可能是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, probably would be.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的，OddLots有限责任公司，如果您是我们的律师，为我们提供法律建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Oddlots LLC, and you were our lawyer, our hypothetical lawyer giving us legal advice.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 假设的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hypothetical.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 您会建议我们怎么做？我们应该在哪里注册？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What would you advise us to do here? Where should we incorporate?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 嗯，首先，**有限责任公司**（LLC）不是公司。所以，我只是想说，你不会是注册公司。你会是组织一个有限责任公司。但实际上，我不会建议你们去特拉华州、内华达州或德克萨斯州，因为特拉华州在上市公司和风险投资支持的专业化初创公司中占据主导地位，但它在小型公司，比如普通的家族企业、普通的本地企业中并不占据主导地位，它的法律也不是为此设计的。所以，如果你们，我的意思是你们是专业人士，但在小型、关系型公司中，特拉华州的法律在某些方面过于无情，其他州对那些基本上是非律师的家族式、朋友式企业有更多的保护，这可能更合适。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so first of all, an LLC is not a corporation. So, I just want to You would not be incorporating. You would be organizing an LLC. But actually I would tell you not to go to Delaware uh Nevada or or Texas because te uh Delaware dominates in public companies and VC backed companies like professionalized startups but it doesn't dominate in small like you know your average family business your average local business it does not dominate there at all and its law is not designed for that. So if you I mean you guys are professionals but you know in a small relationshipbacked company Delaware law is in in some ways too ruthless the other states have a lot more protections for essentially non-awyer familyish friendish businesses that might be more appropriate.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我不知道，我们可能会……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I don't know we might it might be more</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这可能是一个专业的运营。我还有一个问题。美国拥有这种拼凑而成的公司系统有多罕见？如果我们去另一个国家，是否也有类似的**司法管辖区选择**（jurisdiction shopping: 公司选择最有利的法律管辖区进行注册或运营）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It might be a professional operation. I just have one more question. How rare is the US for having this patchwork of corporate systems? Like if we went to another country, is there jurisdiction shopping the same way?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 不。嗯，你看，要知道我们就像50个不同的国家。在欧洲，以前你不能像我们在美国那样，在特拉华州注册，但所有业务都在其他地方运营。在欧洲，以前基本上是按国家划分的。如果你的总部在一个国家，你就应该在那个国家注册，不能混搭。欧洲修改了法律，但仍然是理论上你可以在欧洲国家之间进行**司法管辖区选择**（jurisdiction shop）。你知道，你的总部和所有业务都在一个地方，但在另一个国家注册。但他们没有那种规范。这只是被视为有点奇怪。所以对他们来说，你的业务所在地很大程度上会与管辖你实体的公司法相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Well, see, understand we're like 50 different countries. In Europe, it's like, you know, so so Europe, you used to be that you couldn't do what we do in the United States where you incorporate in Delaware, but all your business operations are somewhere else. It used to be in Europe that essentially it was but as country by country. If you had your headquarters in a country, you were supposed to organize in that country and you couldn't mix and match. Europe changed the law, but it's still so that you could theoretically jurisdiction shop among European countries. You know, organ have your headquarters and all your operations in one place and organize in another place, another country. But they don't they don't really have that norm. It's just viewed as sort of weird. So for them, where your operations are are largely going to be with the law, the corporate law that governs your entity.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是否存在跨国**司法管辖区选择**（transnational jurisdiction shopping: 跨国公司选择最有利的法律管辖区进行注册或运营）？比如说，一家外国公司想在美国注册？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there transnational jurisdiction shopping? Could you get, you know, like a foreign company that wants to incorporate in the US?</p>
</details>

**Anne Lipton:** 嗯，是的，但美国公司更有可能选择在爱尔兰或其他国家注册。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, yes, but you it's much more likely that a US company wants to incorporate outside the country in Ireland or something.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。所以对于其他类型的原因，你知道，以前出于税收等原因，这是一个大问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So for other kinds of, you know, t that used to be a big deal for tax reasons and so forth.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 乔，这太有趣了。我真的觉得一般的商业新闻或金融新闻对法律方面的报道不够。马特·莱文已经证明了这一点，因为他的时事通讯需求量很大，正是因为他是少数真正谈论衡平法院和所有这些事情的人之一。但正如你所说，这证明了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, that was so interesting. I really I think business journalism in general or financial journalism doesn't cover legal stuff enough. Well, Matt Lavine has proved it because there's a huge demand for his newsletter precisely because he's one of the few destinations that actually talks about the chancery and all this stuff. But to your point, this proves the point.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 他是证明整个观点的例外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's the exception that proves the entire point</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 会计也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And accounting as well, too.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 还有保险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And insurance.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。等等，我不会只批评我们在金融新闻界的同事。不，这太引人入胜了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Wait, I'm not going to just criticize our colleagues in financial journalism. No, that was fascinating.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我确实觉得**逐底竞争**（race to the bottom）的想法有点令人担忧，原因显而易见。我想这有点像你之前讨论的**网络效应**（network effect），但一旦球朝着那个方向滚动起来，就真的很难阻止了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do find the whole race to the bottom idea a little bit concerning for obvious reasons. And I guess like it's sort of that network effect that you were discussing earlier, but once the the ball gets rolling in that direction, it just seems really hard to stop.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我同意，我认为这非常重要。埃隆的巨大影响力以及所有视他为榜样的人都非常有趣。另一方面，你知道，没有多少首席执行官拥有如此强大的“邪教”追随者，以至于人们渴望给他钱。所以，其他公司的股东是否愿意在那些州注册，他们是否真的会，不像目前的研究那样，对非特拉华州注册的公司施加某种**资本成本惩罚**（cost of capital penalty），这将是一个有趣的问题。但这个趋势正在形成。一旦样本量变大，你就能看到对股价的实际影响，那将非常有趣。所以，我理解你的观点，但有些股东可能会说，如果一家公司不必处理一个持有……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just I agree and I think this is something very the sheer influence that Elon has and all the people who look to him and see him as the model is very interesting. On the other hand, you know, there are not many CEOs out there for whom the cult is so strong that people thirst to give him money. And so the question of whether shareholders of other companies want to be incorporated in states, whether they would actually, unlike the current research, inflict some sort of cost of capital penalty for non-D Delaware incorporated states is going to be an interesting question. But the ball is rolling. that's going to be so interesting once the sample size gets bigger and you can see like the actual impact on stock prices. So, I take your point, but there are shareholders who potentially would say, well, if a company doesn't have to deal with a lawsuit from like a shareholder who has</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 九股的股东提起的诉讼，也许这是一件好事，这是一个值得做的权衡。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nine shares. Maybe that's a good thing and that's like a tradeoff worth making.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，我不知道。我的意思是，九股股票，他却得到了这个薪酬方案。看起来他签了一份协议。我会非常恼火。你能想象吗？你能想象如果你的薪酬方案因为某个持有九股股票的股东而被取消，你会多么恼火吗？我无法想象。
