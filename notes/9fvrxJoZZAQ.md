</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：爱现在，坠入爱河。我爱比任何事物都更强大的爱。为了爱，我爱你胜过一切。仍然有很多爱。

</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：来自《纽约时报》，我是安娜·马丁。这里是**《摩登情爱》**（Modern Love: 《纽约时报》的著名情感专栏）。每周，我们都会为您带来受《摩登情爱》专栏启发的故事。我们谈论爱情、欲望、心碎以及人际关系中的种种混乱。

<p class="english-text">[music] >> From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. Each week, we bring you stories inspired by the Modern Love column. [music] We talk about love, lust, heartbreak, and all the messiness of relationships.</p>
</details>

### 童年梦想与初次心碎

主持人安娜·马丁：当克莱尔·科里还是个小女孩时，她在蒙大拿州的一个农场长大，梦想着坠入爱河。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When Claire Corey was a young girl growing up on a farm in Montana, she dreamed about falling in love.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我们住在一个单排拖车里。有点拥挤，所以我睡在沙发上，我常常看着窗外美丽的满月，我会看着月亮划过天空。而我，作为一个无可救药的浪漫主义孩子，我曾幻想，在那个同一月亮下的某个地方，有属于我的男人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We lived in a single wide trailer. It was a little bit crowded, so I slept on the couch and I would often look out the window at the full moon and it's very beautiful and I would watch the moon sail across the sky. And me being the hopeless, romantic child that I was, I envisioned that somewhere out there under that same moon was the man for me.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：大学毕业后不久，克莱尔订婚了。但在婚礼前夕，她的未婚夫取消了婚约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[music] Just after she graduated college, Clare got engaged. But then right before the wedding, [music] her fianceé called it off.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：在那之后，她花了数年，甚至数十年，试图维系各种关系。但没有一段成功。所以最终，她不再为此烦恼，决定专注于自己的事业。在她50岁生日后，她回顾自己的人生，感到很幸福。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After that, she spent years, decades [music] even, trying to make various relationships work. But none of them did. So eventually, she stopped worrying about it and decided to focus on her career. After her 50th birthday, she looked back on her life and felt happy.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：你知道，你会想：“哇，我的人生已经走了很长一段路，而且还有很长的路要走。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you think, "Wow, I've come a long way in life and I still have a long way to go."</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：这种感觉促使克莱尔给《摩登情爱》专栏写信，说她终于坠入爱河，但不是和某个男人。相反，那是对生命本身的爱。她以为自己的爱情故事可能已经结束了。但随后，发生了一系列最不可思议、最离奇的事件。其中一些离奇事件令人恐惧。她的健康状况急剧恶化。但有些事情却美得超乎她的想象。今天，我们为您讲述克莱尔爱情故事的其余部分。请继续关注我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> [music] That feeling led Clare to write into the modern love column, saying she'd finally fallen in love, but not with some guy. [music] Instead, it was a love for life itself. She thought maybe her love story was over. But then the most improbable, bizarre series of events occurred. Some of those bizarre events were scary. Her health took a dramatic turn. But some [music] were beautiful beyond anything she could have ever imagined. [music] Today, we tell you the rest of Claire's love story. Stick with [music] us.</p>
</details>

### 早期浪漫与“魔法”的缺失

主持人安娜·马丁：克莱尔·科里，欢迎来到《摩登情爱》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> [music] Claire Corey, welcome to Modern Love.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：非常感谢，我真的很感谢这次机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you so much and I really appreciate this opportunity.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：克莱尔，我们今天来谈谈你的爱情故事。其中有曲折，有转折，事情并没有如你所愿。但我想从头开始。当你还是个孩子的时候，你梦想着坠入爱河。请为我描绘一下那幅画面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Claire, we're here to talk about your love story. There are twists, there are turns, things do not go as you expect. But I want to start at the beginning. When you were a kid growing up, you dreamed about falling in love. Paint a picture of that for me.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：是的。我是七个孩子中最大的，我们在蒙大拿州的一个小农场长大。所以我记得在那些早年，很多浪漫的想法在我脑海中盘旋。我和我妹妹，我们骑着我们用树枝做的假马，基本上就是我们的木马。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, um I'm the oldest of seven children and um we grew up on a little farm in Montana. So, I remember a lot of thoughts of romance rolling through my brain in those early years. And um my sister and I, we were out on our our fake horses, you know, and that we had made out of sticks, our stick horses basically,</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：当然。所以我们俩都有丈夫陪伴着。我的叫吉姆，她的叫史蒂夫。所以我只是想象有一天，我会和吉姆一起开着卡车四处兜风，我们会过上幸福快乐的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> of course. And so we both had husbands along for the ride. And uh um mine was Jim and hers was Steve. And so I just imagined that one day, you know, I was going to be riding around in a truck with Jim and we were going to have a happily ever after. [laughter]</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：我的意思是，我知道多年后，当你20多岁的时候，你确实和一位男士短暂订婚了。他的名字不叫吉姆。他的名字叫罗杰。但那次订婚没有成功。告诉我，你爱罗杰什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I I I know that years later when you were in your 20s, you did have a brief engagement to a man. His name was not Jim. His name was Roger. But that engagement didn't work out. Tell me, what did you love about Roger?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：哦，罗杰真是个有趣的人。他总是笑，总是乐于冒险。他非常幽默，我们从事的领域非常不同。他在工程领域，我在心理学领域，但我们互相支持着度过了研究生院。所以，你知道，我以为我们在一起真的很好。我们非常稳固。你知道，我相信我们会一起变老。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, Roger was just a ton of fun. He was always laughing and he was always up for adventure. Um, he was very funny and we were in very different fields. He's in engineering and I was in psychology, but we supported one another through grad school. And so, um, you know, I thought I felt like we were really good together. We were really solid. You know, I I believe that we would grow old together.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：这种确定性从何而来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Where did that certainty come from?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：好问题，因为显然我错了。我们的婚礼定在五月，我们花了很多时间准备。所以我们一切都安排好了，三月底，罗杰半夜醒来，他说：“我不能这样做。”我说：“你什么意思，你不能做什么？”他说：“嗯，你知道，我不能结婚。我不能举行这个婚礼。”那开始了很多，我们姑且称之为痛苦的讨论，关于为什么。我从来没有得到一个真正好的答案，直到一年后，我们在公园里见面，因为我当时要去卖那件婚纱。我实际上最后把它送给了别人，但我们在公园里见面，我说：“你想看看那件婚纱吗？”你知道，所以我把婚纱拿出来，他说：“哦，天哪。”他说：“它太美了。”他说：“你知道我们缺少什么吗？”我说：“不知道。”他说：“我们缺少魔法。我们没有魔法。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Good question, because apparently I was wrong. [laughter] Um, so our wedding was scheduled in May and we had spent a lot of time um preparing for that. And so we had everything lined up and at the end of March, Roger woke up in the middle of the night and he said, "I can't do this." I said, 'What do you mean you can't do what?' And he said, 'Well, you know, I I can't get married. I can't go through with this wedding. And that began a whole lot of uh shall we say uh painful discussions about why. And I never got a really good answer as to why um until a year later when we actually met in a park because [snorts] I was going to um I was going to sell the dress. I I I actually ended up giving it to somebody, but we met in a park and I said, "Do you want to see the dress?" You know, and so I pulled the dress out and um and he said, "Oh my gosh." He said, "It's so beautiful." And he said, "Do you know what we were missing?" And I was like, "No." And he said, "We were missing the magic. We didn't have the magic."</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：当他说我们缺少魔法时，你明白他的意思吗？你认同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you know what he meant when he said we were missing the magic? Did that track for you?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：在某种程度上，是的。我的意思是，在某种程度上，我仍然试图理解到底出了什么问题。但是的，我确实明白，因为在那段时间里，我实际上已经遇到了唐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It it did. I um to some degree, yes. I mean, to some degree, I was still trying to understand what had gone wrong. But yeah, I I did um because [laughter] in between that time, I actually had met Don.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：好的。唐是谁？他是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Who's Don? Who's he?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我去参加了一个培训，培训师是一个名叫唐的男人。所以我记得我是一个害羞的人，但我确实在培训中走上前去问他一个问题，我们进行了一次简短的谈话，我没怎么在意，但我当时想：“哇，那真是个很酷的家伙。”但我想那次培训持续了两天，所以当培训结束时，我记得他对我说了一些话，他说：“嘿，你什么时候想一起吃晚饭吗？”我们有很多共同点。我们在相似的领域工作。我们之间有一种非常深刻的联系。我经常对人们说，那是我生命中最美好的日子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I went to a training and the trainer was a man named Don. And so I remember I'm a shy person, but I did approach him at the training to ask him a question about something and we had a brief little conversation and I I didn't think much of it, but I thought, "Well, wow, that's a really cool guy." But um I think it was the training was a couple days and so when the training ended, I remember he said something to me and and he said, "Hey, do you want to um get together for dinner sometime?" And we had a lot in common. We work in similar fields. We just had a very deep connection. And I've often said to people that it was the best days of my life.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：当这一切发生时你在想什么？你觉得那些日子是最美好的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And what were you thinking as that was happening? Did you feel like those were the best days?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我对自己说：“哦，现在我明白了。这就是为什么和罗杰的关系没有成功，因为实际上真正适合我的人，那个真正属于我的人还在外面。我只是还没有遇到他。”所以那段浪漫就这样开始了，那是一段美好的浪漫，但也是一段短暂的浪漫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I thought to myself was, "Oh, now I understand. This is why the relationship with Roger didn't work out because actually the real person for me, the real the man who really was the one for me was still out there. and I just hadn't met him yet. And so that's how that uh romance began, which was a wonderful romance, but was also a brief romance.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：你能告诉我它为什么结束吗？你们为什么不再联系或见面了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Can you tell me why it ended? Why did you guys stop being in contact or seeing each other?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：它被很多事情复杂化了。你知道，他经常出差，我有我的工作，所以它基本上就结束了，你知道，因为缺乏沟通和信件，你知道，这又是在电子邮件和手机出现之前的日子。所以我记得给他写了一封信，说我有多受伤，然后我非常沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It was complicated by a lot of things. you know, he was traveling a lot and I had my job and um so it it ended basically but you know by lack of communication and um letters you know again this is in the days before email and cell phones and that kind of thing. So I remember writing him a letter and saying how hurt that I was and um I then was very depressed. [laughter]</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：你当时有没有尝试重新开始约会，或者那根本不是你的优先事项？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you try to get back out there dating wise at this time or was that not at all a priority?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：不，不是。我当时太心碎了，甚至无法考虑那些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, it was not. I was way too brokenhearted um</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：甚至无法考虑那些。你知道，我以为我找到了罗杰关系失败的全部原因的答案。而现在我真的找到了一段充满魔力的关系。然后它结束了，我真的觉得这种事怎么会发生在我身上两次？这两次心碎相对而言如此接近，几乎是接踵而至。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> to even think about that. And you know, here I thought that I had found the answer to the whole reason why my relationship with Roger hadn't worked out. And now I really had found a relationship that was magical. And then it ended and I really felt like how could this happen to me twice? These two heartbreaks relatively close to each other almost back to back in the in the grand scheme.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：你觉得你的心变硬了吗？你是不是觉得就这样了，我不会再这样做了，不值得？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you feel your heart harden? Were you like that's it. I'm I'm not doing this anymore. It's not worth it.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我想说当时没有，我还没有准备好放弃。大概又过了一十年左右，你知道，在那些年里，我生命中确实有一些男人，他们真的是好男人，但关系没有持续。我想说，也许到我40多岁的时候，我真的开始问自己：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say at that time no I was not ready to be done. It took probably another decade or so, you know, and in the intervening years, you know, I did have some men in my life who were truly good men and but the relationships didn't last. I would say maybe by the time I was in my mid4s and I really started asking myself,</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：你到底想在这里做什么？你知道，回顾过去，我可以看到我的生活在那时改变了轨道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> what are you trying to do here? you know, um, looking back, I can see that my life shifted tracks at that time</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：从一个关于建立婚姻、家庭和未来的未来，转向更多地成为一个事业型的人，专注于我的事业，而不是那么多地专注于人际关系。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> from a future that was about creating marriage and a family and a home to my being more of a career person, focused on my career and not so much a relationship. Hm.</p>
</details>

### 拥抱单身与热爱生命

主持人安娜·马丁：你当时对自己说了些什么，让你对这种新的未来版本感到满意？这种你不会找到伴侣的版本。它是如何变得可以接受的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What were some of the things you were telling yourself that made you okay with this new version of your future? This version where you wouldn't find someone. How did it become all right?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，因为我不得不问自己：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, because I had to ask myself,</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：你的生活中缺少什么？你知道，我生活中有很多美好的事物，我的生活过得很好。是的，我心里确实有一个空缺，或者说我心里有一个空位，我觉得一段关系会填补它，但我想，你的生活中真的缺少什么吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> what are you missing in your life? You're, you know, I have a lot of good things in my life and my life is going along very well. And yeah, I sort of had this empty spot in my heart or this empty place in my heart where I felt like a relationship would fill it up, but I thought, is something really missing in your life?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：当我开始环顾四周时，我想，我对自己的现状和我是谁感到非常满足。不，真的什么都不缺。感觉我多年来一直在撞墙，试图弄清楚如何让这种关系的事情发生。在某个时候你会想，等一下，你为什么总是撞墙？你知道，这真的值得吗？当你不再撞墙时，你错过了什么？嗯，你错过了生活。你错过了生命本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And as I started looking around, I thought, I'm very content with where I am and and who I am. And no, there's really nothing missing at all. And it felt like I had been beating my head against a wall for years trying to figure out how to make this relationship thing happen. And at some point you think, wait a minute, why are you beating your head all the time? You know, is this really worth it? And what are you missing when you're not beating your head? And well, you're missing living. You're missing life itself.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：但你有没有感到孤独？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Did Did you ever feel lonely, though?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：不。真的吗？真的。是的，我从未感到孤独。也许那是因为我有很多兄弟姐妹和朋友。不，我没有感到孤独。我是否想念生命中有一个浪漫伴侣？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No. [clears throat] Really? Really? Yeah, I've never felt lonely. And maybe that's because I have a lot of siblings and and friends and things. No, I did not feel lonely. Did I miss having a romantic partner in my life? Yes.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Huh.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：你知道，我只是想澄清，这不是一个容易的过程。我放下的每一样东西都留下了抓痕。所以，嗯，我可以说，嗯，这种对一段充实浪漫关系的渴望，上面布满了抓痕。它被撕成了碎片，我才能放手。是的。所以是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, and I just want to, you know, be clear that this was not an easy process. [snorts] Everything I let go of has claw marks all over it. So, um, I can say that, um, this was this idea of a fulfilling romantic relationship had claw [laughter] marks all over it. It was clawed to pieces um before I could let go of it. Yeah. [laughter] So yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：当你真的放下了这个带着抓痕的东西时，它是否让你感到解放？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And when you did let this claw marked thing go, was it liberating?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：是的。绝对是。我意识到这其中有一种自由，而且我确实感到解放，因为我想，嘿，我不需要寻找任何人。但是把希望放回篮子里并盖上盖子是很难的。希望，拥有浪漫的希望，拥有我一直梦想的那种充实关系的希望。我只是把它塞进篮子里，盖上盖子，但每隔一段时间，希望就会冒出来，你知道，它会从篮子里探出头来向我招手。我就会说：“回去！盖上！”当你达到这种与单身生活和解的境地，把对浪漫伴侣的希望放进篮子里，你知道，你当时有没有回顾自己的人生并进行评估？如果回顾了，你看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Absolutely. And I realized that there is a freedom in that and that um I I did feel liberated and because I'm like, hey, I don't need to be looking for anybody. And and but it was hard to put hope back in the basket and shut the basket. hope, hope of having a romance, hope of having um that fulfilling relationship that I'd always dreamed of. And I just stuffed it in the basket, shut the lid, and but every now [laughter] and again, you know, hope it just keeps coming and it would uh, you know, stick its head out of the basket and be waving at me. I'm like, "Get back in there. Shut that thing." when you hit this kind of coming to terms with being single for the rest of your life, kind of putting hope in the basket for the rest of your life, this hope for a romantic partner, you know, did you take a look back on your life at this at that point and and assess it? And if so, what did you see?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，我记得我50岁那年也是我第一次去欧洲旅行。我的哥哥和他的妻子住在德国，我和妈妈去了欧洲。那是我一直以来的梦想。我记得当时我想，你知道，我的生活非常充实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I remember the year that I turned 50 was also the first time I ever traveled to Europe. And um my brother and his wife were living in Germany and my mom and I went to Europe. And that was [clears throat] a a dream that I'd always had. And I remember thinking that, you know, my life was very full.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：一切都很好。我期待着一个充满无限可能性的未来。你知道，不一定是浪漫的可能，因为希望，你知道，希望还在篮子里。好吧。但是一个关于继续工作的未来，你知道，总有一天我会退休，那时我将做什么，你知道，我为自己设定了目标，还清我的房子，诸如此类的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Things were good. And I was looking forward to a future that, you know, that seemed wide open with possibility. You know, not the possibility necessarily cuz again, hope is, you know, stay in the basket hope. All right. And um but a future of you know continuing to work and you know someday I was going to you know retire and what was I going to do then and you know I had goals for myself pay off my house you know those kinds of things.</p>

### 直面癌症：生命的收缩与爱

主持人安娜·马丁：50岁是一个美好的时光，然后就在你52岁之后，你发现自己患上了一种罕见的乳腺癌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> 50 was a beautiful time >> and then just after you turned 52 >> you found out you have a rare type of breast cancer.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：那一刻对你来说是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was that moment like for you?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，它永远改变了你的生活。毫无疑问。嗯，它是最具侵袭性的乳腺癌形式。它被称为**炎性乳腺癌**（Inflammatory Breast Cancer: 一种罕见且侵袭性强的乳腺癌）。所以，我当时就知道我的生命正在收缩。发生的事情是，我的生活从展望未来十年甚至更久，变成了活在当下，一天一天地过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, well, it changes your life forever. There's no doubt about it. Um, it's the most aggressive form of breast cancer. It's called inflammatory breast cancer. And so, I knew then that my life was contracting. And what happened was my life went from looking a decade or more ahead to looking a day at a time. [music]</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：克莱尔，当你得到这个诊断时，它为你改变了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> [music] Claire, when [music] you got this diagnosis, what did that change for you?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：你知道，这真的很有趣，因为我学到了很多关于我自己的东西。你真的不知道你会如何反应，直到那些情况发生。所以我对自己说了几件事。嗯，我只会继续工作，直到我不能再工作为止，我只会继续锻炼，直到我不能再锻炼为止，我只会继续做我正在做的事情，直到我不能再做为止。所以，你知道，他们安排化疗的方式是让你的休息日落在周末。所以我能够继续工作，我会去化疗，然后去工作，然后，你知道，周末休息，到周日下午，我又恢复了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, it's really interesting because I learned a lot about myself. You really don't know how you'll react until those situations happened. So, I said a couple things to myself.

主持人安娜·马丁：我的意思是，你把这一切说得好像只是例行公事，你知道，我做这个，我做那个，但这其中一定有艰难的部分。

<p class="english-text">I mean, you're saying all of this like it's just a routine, you know, I'm doing this, I'm doing that, but there had to be hard parts of this.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：哦，是的。它有艰难的部分。炎性乳腺癌是一种野兽。它是一个挑战。我要说的是，炎性乳腺癌会使你的乳房肿大。癌症会使乳房变成紫色。它像石头一样硬。我能感觉到它变得坚硬。它很丑陋，你每天都必须带着它生活。所以你开始意识到，今天就是你所拥有的一切。如果今天就是我所拥有的一切，那么我最好把今天过好，因为我不会放弃我现在所拥有的一切。所以发生的事情是，我意识到我爱上了生命本身。

And I will say this, inflammatory breast cancer, um, your breast enlarges. Um, the cancer turns the breast purple. It was hard as a rock. Um, I could feel it turning hard. It's ugly and you have to walk around with it every single day. And so you start to realize that today is all that you've got. And if today is all that I've got, then I damn well better make this a good day [snorts] because I'm not giving up what I got right now. And so what happened is that I realized that I have fallen in love with life itself.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我记得我得知自己进展到**四期转移性乳腺癌**（Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer: 癌症已扩散到身体其他部位的晚期阶段）的那一天。我回到家，打开家门，环顾我所有的财产，我想：“哇，总得有人进来把这些东西都送走。”所以，嗯，我开始环顾我将要错过的一切。我想：“哇，我真的会错过那个日出。我会错过那个日落。我会错过工作中的同事。我会错过我的侄女和侄子长大。这对我来说仍然很难。”

And so, um, I started to look around at all the things that I was going to miss. And I thought, "Wow, I'm really going to miss that sunrise. I'm going to miss that sunset. going to miss my colleagues at work. I'm going to miss my nieces and nephews growing up. That's still real hard one for me.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：我会错过这些日常时刻，比如散步时看到一朵美丽的花，遇到某人，很多很多这样的事情。我有一个朋友也被诊断出患有炎性乳腺癌，她现在已经去世了。但她对我说：“如果我能回到过去改变这一切，我也不会。”她说：“它给了我太多。”我哭着说：“你怎么能这么说？我肯定我永远不会有那种感觉。”但如果我能回到过去，我不会改变它。它给了我太多。它让我对生命有了感激。你知道，我九月份出院了，由于各种原因，他们不让我洗澡，哦，天哪，我回到家，跳进淋浴间，我能够开车去上班。

主持人安娜·马丁：克莱尔，在你30多岁和40多岁的时候，你一直希望坠入爱河。然后在你50多岁的时候，你面临着绝症。听起来你确实找到了爱，只是方式出乎意料。你找到了对生命的热爱。我觉得我现在都能看到标题了。就像“女人爱上生命”，这会是你故事一个美丽的结局，但这不是你故事的结局，对吗？

It's like woman falls in love with life which would be a beautiful end to your story except it's not the end to your story right</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：是的，没错。所以我的心完全是满的，我想说的是，因为我找到了对生命的热爱，但在我生命中最意想不到的时刻，当我对自己身体感觉不好，我无法想象任何人会觉得我有吸引力，当然是作为浪漫伴侣。突然间，非常出乎意料地，我再次找到了浪漫。而那个人恰好是唐。他就是我们之前听说过的那个人。唐。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> So, Don was a person that I had a relationship with 27 years ago [laughter] >> and I was completely heartbroken when it ended, but I had gone on and, you know, made my peace with that. Yeah.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：是的，你知道，我是一个总是和人保持朋友关系的人，所以我们在相似的领域工作，我们彼此在对方的圈子里，但我们不怎么说话。也许一年几次。我确实记得我发现自己得了癌症时给他打了电话，让他知道。

<details>

Maybe a couple times a year. I do remember I called him when I found out that I had cancer and let him know.</p>
</details>

主持人安娜·马丁：那么唐是什么时候重新出现在你的生活中的？在你诊断出癌症多久之后？另外，我只是想让听众们知道，每次我说他的名字，你都会露出美丽的笑容，让你容光焕发，也让我容光焕发。在你诊断出癌症多久之后，他重新进入了你的生活？

克莱尔·科里：嗯，那是一年前，当时我已经处于**四期转移性乳腺癌**（Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer: 癌症已扩散到身体其他部位的晚期阶段）的情况了。所以，那不是你会在约会档案上写的那种东西。

克莱尔·科里：有点难。是的。你知道发生的事情是，他要去凤凰城参加一个会议。他说：“哦，天哪，我们应该一起吃晚饭。”你知道，我很久没见到他了。所以，嗯，我们确实一起吃了顿不错的晚餐，诸如此类。当我向他告别时，我心里真的想，我可能再也见不到他了。我想这就是结局了。但后来发生了一件非常奇怪的事情。这有点令人尴尬，但我的雇主正在举办员工圣诞派对。

But then this really weird thing happened. And [laughter] it was kind of a little bit embarrassing, but um so my employer was having the employee Christmas party</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：多年来，我每次员工活动都是独自一人参加的。所以我想，你知道吗，我想和喜欢的人一起去。我只是想和某人一起去一次员工圣诞派对。我记得我开车去上班时，脑子里突然冒出问他是否愿意和我一起去。我当时想：“不，不，不，不，不，不，不。”因为他甚至不住在同一个州。但是它一直困扰着我。所以我不得不说，我感觉自己像个高中女生，你知道，在萨蒂·霍金斯舞会（Sadie Hawkins dance: 一种女生邀请男生参加的舞会）上，当你打电话邀请男生和你一起去的时候。所以我给他打电话，我说，你知道，嗯，你知道，我一直想和某人一起去圣诞派对，你愿意和我一起去吗？你知道，还有几周。他说：“是的，当然。”我们玩得很开心。

And I was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no." Cuz he doesn't even live in the same state. [snorts] And um but it just kept bugging me and bugging me. And so I have to say that I felt like a high school girl, you know, at the Satie Hawkins dance or whatever, you know, when you call and you ask the guy to go with you. And so I called him up and I said, you know, um, you know, I've always wanted to go to the Christmas party with somebody and [snorts] would you go with me, you know, and you know, it's in a few weeks.

克莱尔·科里：嗯。这是我们在一起的六周美好时光之一，事情相对正常，然后一切都崩溃了，我得了重感冒，然后我进了医院，癌症进展了，我的状况在纸面上看起来很糟糕，他一直陪我在医院里，睡在椅子上，这让我很困扰。我想：“不，我不想你睡在椅子上。”但我的妹妹从外地赶来，然后我对他说：“回家睡你自己的床一晚。”因为那时他已经陪我在医院里四五晚了。所以他回家了，那天我的脑部核磁共振结果出来了。

And that's one of the things that we had about six good weeks [laughter] of of things being relatively normal and then it all crashed and um I got really sick with the flu and then next thing I was in the hospital and the cancers progressed and I'm looking really bad on paper and uh he was staying in the hospital with me and sleeping in a chair and that bothered me. I'm like, "No, I don't want you sleeping in a chair." But my sister came from out of town and then I said to him, "Go home and sleep in your own bed for one night." Because by now he'd been at the hospital with me for probably four or five nights. So he went home and that was the day that the results of my brain MRI came back. And</p>

克莱尔·科里：我的妹妹，我们当时在医院的花园里散步，她说：“嗯，你的核磁共振结果出来了。”我从她脸上的表情看到了，她说：“是的，你大脑里有一个病灶。”那是我最不想听到的消息。我觉得我能应对任何事情，除了脑转移。

### 当下即永恒：爱与生命的新篇章

主持人安娜·马丁：在你生命的中期，你做了很多努力来摆脱对浪漫伴侣的渴望。而现在你拥有了，你拥有了唐，你拥有了一个浪漫伴侣。我只是想知道，重新开启这种可能性并让它实现，感觉如何？那是什么感觉？

<p class="english-text">[music] You did so much work in the sort of middle part of your life to move on from your desire to have a romantic partner. And now you have that, you have Don, you have a romantic partner. I just want to know like what does it feel like to to open back up that possibility and to let it be fulfilled? What does that feel like?</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，一方面，这有点吓人，因为你再次敞开心扉，但我也认为，你知道，带着封闭的心生活是不值得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, on the one hand, it's kind of scary because you're opening your heart again, but I also think that um you know, it's not worth it to walk around with a closed heart.</p>
</details>

克莱尔·科里：那种安全感和归属感的重要性，我们都在寻找，而且我可能一生都在寻找，这种感觉很难言喻。找到它，嗯，这有点像，你知道，你像在旋转木马上转来转去，想着这里刚刚发生了什么？这也很难理解。我的生活和八个月前，一年前非常不同。它非常不同，因为它是一种全新的生活方式，我已经习惯了。我们没有住在一起，但我们在一起度过了很多时间。我真的以为我们开玩笑说，如果他总是呆在我身边，我会被窒息。所以他一直问我，你知道，你需要独处时间吗？你需要独处时间吗？令我非常震惊和惊讶的是，我发现我真的可以接受，你知道，他在这里，你知道，或者我在他家，或者其他什么。我得告诉你，我对我有多喜欢它感到有点惊讶。

<p class="english-text">It's it's hard to overstate the importance of that feeling of safety and belonging that I think that we all look for and that I'd probably been looking for for for so much of my life.

My life is very different than it was 8 months ago, a year ago. It's very different cuz it's a whole different way of than [snorts] I've been used to living. And we're not living together but we spend a heck of a lot of time together. And I honestly thought we had this joke that I would be um smothered if he was around too much. And so he kept asking me, you know, do you need some alone time? Do you need some alone time? So much to my utter shock and surprise, I have found that I really I'm okay with, you know, him being here, you know, or me being at his place or whatever. I got to tell you, I'm a little surprised at how much I've enjoyed it. [laughter]</p>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，你知道，现在我正在接受治疗，情况很好。但这可能很快就会改变。我非常清楚这一点。我希望它不会，但它可能会。当然，你知道，他也不是年轻人，他自己的健康状况也可能很快改变。事实是，我们不知道我们有什么样的未来，如果有的话。所以，我发现我不太担心谁去倒垃圾之类的事情。我们并不是在建立一段能持续几十年的关系，因为我们不太可能拥有几十年。所以，这真的只关乎今天。

And so, I find that I'm not very troubled about who's taking out the trash kind of thing. It's not like we're building a relationship to last through decades because we're not likely to have decades.

主持人安娜·马丁：我假设当你第一次被诊断出癌症并开始思考自己的死亡时，那对你来说是某种样子，然后你遇到了唐，在过去的几个月里，随着事情的发展和深化，你对死亡的看法一定有所不同，我想知道它是否为你改变了，如果是的话……

</details>

克莱尔·科里：嗯，你知道，我把自己看作是一个现实乐观主义者，所以我很乐观，我会接受他们提供给我的每一次治疗。我会做一切事情。但我也很现实，所以我知道有一天可能会到来，那时我没有更多的治疗方法可用，我将不得不优雅地，我希望我能优雅地接受那一刻。我说过我希望在我离开这个世界时，神能善待我。我也觉得我不想让任何人失望。嗯，特别是我的家人，现在坦率地说还有唐，因为我的去世。你知道，我觉得，哦，天哪，我会让他们经历很多。所以我确实和他谈过，他说：“我与你同在，无论如何我都会在那里。”

I also feel that I don't want to let anybody down. Um my family in particular and now Don frankly by dying, you know, and I feel like, oh jeez, I'm going to put them through a lot.

克莱尔·科里：自从我第一次被诊断出癌症以来，我对自己说的一件事，字面上是第一周，嗯，有数百万其他女性也面临过乳腺癌，如果她们挺过来了，我也能做到。有数百万其他女性接受过化疗。如果她们挺过来了，我也能做到。或者手术，放疗。有，你知道，许多女性患有四期转移性乳腺癌。如果她们能做到，我也能做到。同样真实的是，有许多许多女性死于四期转移性乳腺癌。如果她们做到了，嗯，我也能做到。我只希望我能优雅地做到。嗯，我希望，嗯，天哪，我真的希望我不会让任何人失望，因为我真的想继续活着。

主持人安娜·马丁：克莱尔，我确实认为这体现了你是什么样的人，当我们谈论你自己的死亡时，你首先想到的是其他人。是你爱的人。我只想说，我觉得唐非常幸运能被算作你爱的人群中的一员。你知道，当你给《摩登情爱》写信时，实际上是在你和唐重新联系之前。
