### 政府言论风波

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是“头条新闻”。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 1 月 30 日，星期五。我们今天报道的内容有：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, January 30th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 过去几个月，《泰晤士报》一直在追踪，越来越多的来自**特朗普政府**的社交媒体帖子，是如何呼应**白人至上主义语言**，影射**种族清洗**，并引用**新纳粹文学**的。这种极端主义语言出现在联邦账户的数十篇帖子中，包括**白宫**和**国土安全部**。这些信息被用来庆祝**特朗普总统**的移民政策，并招募人员来执行这些政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: For the past few months, the Times has been tracking how a growing number of social media posts from the Trump administration have echoed white supremacist language, alluded to ethnic cleansing, and referenced neo-Nazi literature. The extremist language has appeared in dozens of posts from federal accounts, including the White House and the Department of Homeland Security. The messaging has been used to celebrate President Trump's immigration policies and recruit agents to carry them out.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 例如，DHS 的一篇帖子包含一个加入 **ICE** 的链接，以及一句话：“美国男人，你往哪边走？”（"Which way American man?"）。这个口号几乎与 70 年代一本反犹主义书籍的标题相同，该书名为《西方人往哪边走》（Whichway Western Man），是白人至上主义团体的一份关键文本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: For example, one post from DHS included a link to join ICE along with the phrase, "Which way American man?" That slogan is nearly identical to the title of an anti-semitic book from the 70s titled Whichway Western Man, which is a key text for white supremacist groups.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 而在本月早些时候，白宫和 DHS 发布了一则 ICE 招聘广告，其中有一句：“我们将重获我们的家园。”（"We'll have our home again."）这是由一个自称“亲白人兄弟会”的组织成员写的一首歌的名字，该组织在**骄傲男孩**（Proud Boys）等极端主义团体中很受欢迎。当《泰晤士报》的一名记者就此语言询问一位国土安全部发言人时，她否认这与歌曲有关。但如果你在 Instagram 上点击该广告，歌曲就会开始播放。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And earlier this month, the White House and DHS posted an ICE recruitment ad with the line, "We'll have our home again." That's the name of a song written by members of a self-described pro-white fraternal order that's popular with extremist groups like the Proud Boys. When a Times reporter asked a Homeland Security spokeswoman about that language, she denied it had anything to do with the song. But if you tapped on the ad on Instagram, the song started playing.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 当记者指出这一点时，该发言人表示：“我告诉你，它不在那里。”（"I'm telling you it's not there."）并指责《泰晤士报》在散布一个左翼阴谋论。一小时内，该 Instagram 帖子就消失了。不过，大多数社交媒体帖子仍然存在。**反诽谤联盟**（Anti-Defamation League）的一位极端主义专家表示，帖子中的语言只有两类人能识别出来：研究白人至上主义者的人，以及白人至上主义者本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: When the reporter pointed that out, the spokeswoman said, quote, "I'm telling you it's not there." and accused the Times of pushing a left-wing conspiracy theory. Within an hour, the Instagram post disappeared. Most of the social media posts are still up, though. One expert on extremism at the Anti-Defamation League said that the language in them would be recognizable to just two groups. People who study white supremacists and white supremacists themselves.

</details>

### 移民执法影响

**Tracy Mumford**: 一名拘留中心内的个人说，他是一名建筑工人，有四个孩子，现在他的抵押贷款支付被推迟了，他不知道他的家人将如何保住他们的房子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: One individual in the detention center said he's a construction worker and he has four kids and now his mortgage payments are delayed and he doesn't know how his family's going to stay in his house.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在**明尼苏达州**，居民们在州议员面前作证，讲述了近几周来联邦执法人员激增所造成的恐惧和混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Minnesota yesterday, residents testified in front of state lawmakers about the fear and chaos that's been caused by the surge of federal agents there in recent weeks.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “无论你是否持有部落身份证，它都会被忽视和不被承认。我们的社区正在目睹公民和部落成员被拘留和骚扰。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "It does not matter if you have a tribal ID. It is being disregarded and not honored. Our community is witnessing citizens and tribal members being detained and harassed."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **美洲原住民**组织者描述，部落成员因外貌被执法人员“画像”，执法人员误以为他们是移民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Native American organizers described tribal members being profiled based on their appearance by agents who mistook them for immigrants.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “在我们许多医疗系统中，急诊室和诊所的就诊人数下降了 20% 到 25%，这还是保守估计。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "Emergency room and clinic visits are down 20 to 25% across many of our health systems and that's a conservative estimate."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 一位医生说，人们因为担心离开家园而被拘留，而避免就医。议员们还听取了一位独立记者的证词，她描述了自己如何作为一种实验，申请成为一名 ICE 探员，并在未能完成基本文书工作或通过药物测试的情况下被录用。她告诉议员们，她认为自己的经历证明了 ICE 在其全国业务扩张之际，并没有对新招聘人员进行适当的背景审查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And a physician said that people were avoiding medical care because they were worried about leaving their homes and being detained. Lawmakers also heard from an independent journalist who described how she applied to become an ICE agent as a kind of experiment and was hired despite having failed to complete basic paperwork or take a drug test. She told lawmakers she felt her story was evidence that ICE was not properly vetting its new hires as it ramps up its operations around the country.

</details>

### 参议院与ICE限制

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，在华盛顿，参议院民主党人与特朗普总统和共和党人达成了一项协议，该协议可能允许他们就 ICE 探员的新限制进行谈判。随着潜在的政府关门危机迫近，他们同意为本财年的大部分政府运作提供资金，但只给了国土安全部两周的资金。他们表示，希望利用这段时间推动限制措施，例如禁止执法人员佩戴口罩。参议员们表示，他们希望今天就支出计划进行投票，但众议院议长**迈克·约翰逊**表示，众议院最早可能在周一采取行动，这意味着政府仍可能在周末部分关闭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, in Washington, Senate Democrats have struck a deal with President Trump and Republicans that could allow them to negotiate new restrictions on ICE agents. With a potential government shutdown looming, they agreed to fund much of the government for the rest of the fiscal year, but only gave 2 weeks of funding to the Department of Homeland Security. They say they want to use that time to push for limitations, like a ban on officers wearing masks. Senators said they'd hope to vote on the spending package today, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said the earliest the House could act would be Monday, meaning the government could still partially shut down over the weekend.

</details>

### SNAP 规则调整

**Tracy Mumford**: 全国范围内，关于食品券（SNAP）可以购买和不能购买的商品，出现了一系列令人眼花缭乱的新规定。作为特朗普政府“让美国更健康”（Make America Healthy Again）议程的一部分，联邦监管机构越来越多地允许各州自行制定 SNAP 福利标准。他们表示，这将有助于限制美国人的垃圾食品消费。但杂货店和 SNAP 受益人表示，结果是令人困惑和沮丧，对看似随意的规定感到不满。例如，在爱达荷州，你可以用食品券买一块 Twix 巧克力棒，但不能买无花果燕麦棒。而在爱荷华州，你不能买士力架（Snickers），但可以买士力架冰淇淋棒，因为它需要冷藏并且含有牛奶。杂货店表示，他们正努力跟上，但这成了一场后勤噩梦，员工需要手动检查数千种商品以遵守新规定。如果他们出错，商店可能会被完全取消 SNAP 计划资格。尤其是在农村地区，这可能会导致 SNAP 受益人没有任何当地的杂货购物选择。反饥饿组织表示，各州尚未充分准备商店或消费者。其他批评者则认为，这些规定相当于对低收入美国人的攻击。一位依赖 SNAP 福利的爱荷华州居民告诉《泰晤士报》，官员们实际上是在说，他们“不信任他们所代表的民众能为自己的健康做出决定”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Across the country, a dizzying array of new rules have gone into place around what food stamps can and cannot be used to buy. As part of the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda, federal regulators have been increasingly letting individual states set their own standards for SNAP benefits. They say it will allow them to limit how much junk food Americans consume. But grocery stores and SNAP recipients say the results have been confusion and frustration over what can seem like arbitrary rules. In Idaho, for example, you will be able to use food stamps to buy a Twix bar, but not a flowerless granola bar. And in Iowa, you can't buy a Snickers, but you can buy a Snickers ice cream bar because it's refrigerated and has milk in it. Grocery stores say they're trying to keep up, but it's a logistical nightmare with employees trying to manually check thousands of items to comply with the new rules. If they screw up, the stores could be removed from the SNAP program altogether. In rural areas in particular, that could leave SNAP recipients without any local grocery options. Anti-hunger groups say the states haven't done enough to prepare stores or consumers. And other critics argue that the rules amount to an attack on lowincome Americans. One Iowa resident who relies on SNAP benefits told the Times that officials are effectively saying they quote don't trust their constituencies to make decisions around their own health.

### 欧洲数字自主

**Tracy Mumford**: 在法国，政府昨天宣布将停止使用**Zoom**，这家美国拥有的视频会议软件，并将其会议转移到一个法国制造的平台。如果你想到 Zoom，法国 Zoom，它们都一样。此举实际上是欧洲领导人更广泛努力的一部分，旨在减少对美国数字基础设施的依赖。随着美欧在贸易、格陵兰等问题上日益分歧，欧洲正试图在技术等战略领域变得更加独立。法国总理表示，依赖非欧洲制造的工具意味着他们缺乏对其数据的控制，并面临网络安全风险。最近，法国官员还被要求开始使用政府设计的消息应用程序，而不是外国拥有的应用程序，这包括 **Meta** 旗下的 **WhatsApp** 或一家美国非营利组织旗下的 **Signal**。德国政府也一直在采取类似举措，甚至开发自己的 **Microsoft Office** 替代品，以努力建立数字自主权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In France, the government announced yesterday that it will stop using Zoom, the Americanowned video conferencing software, and move its meetings over to a Frenchmade platform instead. If you're thinking Zoom, French Zoom, it's all the same. The move is actually part of a broader effort by European leaders to reduce their dependence on American digital infrastructure. As the US and Europe have found themselves increasingly at odds over the last year over trade, Greenland, etc., Europe is trying to be more independent in strategic fields like technology. France's prime minister said relying on non-European-made tools meant they lacked control over their data and faced cyber security risks. Recently, French officials were also asked to start using a government-designed messaging app instead of foreignowned ones, which would include WhatsApp owned by Meta or Signal owned by a US-based nonprofit. The German government's been making similar moves, even developing its own alternative to Microsoft Office in an effort to build up digital autonomy.

### 寿命与基因研究

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，关于长寿的关键，我指的是活到 90 岁甚至 100 岁，一直以来都有研究、争论和理论。专家说，你需要活动身体。多吃水果蔬菜。保证充足睡眠。不吸烟。不过量饮酒。确保与朋友见面。然而，本周发表在《**科学**》（Science）杂志上的一项新研究，又确定了另一个因素：你的基因。根据这项新研究，你潜在的寿命就写在你的 DNA 里。健康的生活方式当然有帮助，但基本上，如果你想知道自己是否能活到 100 岁，你需要赢得长寿的基因彩票。研究人员查看了**瑞典双胞胎**的数据。他们还查看了超过 400 位活到 100 岁美国人及其所有兄弟姐妹的数据。他们排除了事故或感染等外部因素，发现就寿命差异而言，最大的单一因素似乎是基因。一位未参与该研究的公共卫生教授告诉《泰晤士报》，这项研究有一个强有力的信息：你并没有你想象的那么大的控制力。他说，基本上，结果是有些人开着梅赛德斯，而有些人则没那么幸运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, the key to living a long life, I'm talking cracking 90 or even 100 years old, has been studied, debated, theorized about. Experts say you got to move your body. Eat your fruits and vegetables. Get enough sleep. Don't smoke. Don't drink too much. Make sure you see friends. A new study out this week in the journal Science, though pins down another factor, your genes. According to the new research, your potential lifespan is written in your DNA. A healthy lifestyle can help, of course, but basically if you want to know if you could live to be 100, you need to have won the genetic lottery for longevity. The researchers looked at data from sets of Swedish twins. They also looked at data from over 400 Americans who lived to be a 100 and what happened to all of their siblings. They controlled for outside factors like accidents or infections and found that the biggest single factor when it comes to differences in lifespans seems to be genes. One public health professor who was not involved in the study told the Times that the research has a powerful message. You don't have as much control as you think. He said, basically, it turns out some of us are driving a Mercedes and some of us aren't quite that lucky.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Those are the headlines. If you'd like to play the Friday news quiz, stick around. It is just after these credits. This show is made by Will Jarvis, Yan Stewart, and me, Tracy Mumford. Original theme by Dan Powell. Special thanks to Isabella Anderson, Lissa Anderson, Miles McKinley, Zoe Murphy, and Paula Schuman. Now, time for the quiz. I've got a few questions for you about stories the Times has been covering. Can you get them all?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 首先，我们面临的核武器、气候变化和颠覆性技术的风险都在不断增加。自 1947 年以来，每年都有一个科学家团体更新他们称之为“**末日钟**”（doomsday clock）的装置。这个象征性的时钟，被批评者称为有点“噱头”，旨在强调人为灾难（如核战争）的潜在末日风险。他们最初将时钟设定在午夜前 7 分钟。午夜，你知道，意味着……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: First up, the risks we face from nuclear weapons, climate change, and disruptive technologies are all growing. Every year since 1947, a group of scientists has updated what it calls the doomsday clock. The symbolic time piece, which critics have called a bit of a stunt, is designed as a way to highlight the potentially apocalyptic risks of man-made disasters like nuclear war. They originally set the clock at 7 minutes to midnight. midnight being, you know,

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: ……而本周，人类在应对威胁我们所有人的生存风险方面，没有取得足够进展。他们将其调至了午夜前 85 秒。这是一个残酷的真相，但这就是我们的现实。这是人类自我毁灭最近的时刻。但时钟并非总是向前跳。在过去的 70 多年里，它实际上一直在来回摆动。那么你的问题是，在哪个十年里，它离午夜最远？也就是说，根据时钟，世界最安全的时候是何时？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: >> and this week, humanity has not made sufficient progress on the existential risks that endanger us all. >> They moved it to tminus 85 seconds. >> It is a hard truth, but this is our reality. That's the closest point ever to humans wiping ourselves out. But the clock doesn't always tick forward. It's actually gone back and forth over the last 70 plus years. So your question, in what decade was it farthest from midnight? Essentially, when according to the clock, was the world the safest?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 答案是：20 世纪 90 年代初，当时**苏联**正在衰落，并刚刚与美国签署了一项主要军备控制条约，这确实缓解了核对抗的恐惧。从那时起，它基本上一直在不断地向末日逼近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The answer, the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union was fading and had just signed a major arms control treaty with the US, which really tamped down fears of a nuclear showdown. Since then, it's basically just been ticking closer and closer to doom.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 下一个问题，本周，一个以休闲舒适而非正式著称的著名品牌宣布，它将很快推出一个新娘系列。新产品将采用珍珠、象牙色缎面，甚至雪纺花饰。你的问题是，这是哪个品牌？别担心，我这里有一个来自公司 CEO 的提示。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And the next question, this week, a famous brand known more for casual comfort than for being formal announced that it will soon release a bridal collection. The new products will feature pearls, ivory colored satin, even chiffon blooms. Your question, what brand is it? Don't worry, I've got a hint for you from the company's CEO.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们想确保人们穿着舒适，这是自然的、预期的穿着。所以，这是一个使命。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "We wanted to make sure that people are walking the tour the skin, which is natural intended walking. So, that was a mission."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 答案是：**勃肯鞋**（Birkenstock）。这个“嬉皮”鞋履品牌说，几年前它收到了一位美国婚纱设计师的电子邮件，于是“新娘勃肯鞋”就诞生了。价格相当不嬉皮，设计起价为 660 美元。我不是说你不能自己做，我只是说，如果你有一些塑料花，并且知道如何使用热熔胶枪的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The answer, Birkenstock family was exactly sitting on the Birkenstock and said the hippie footwear brand said it got an email out of the blue a few years ago from an American wedding dress designer and the bridal burks were born. The prices are decidedly unhippy. The designs start at $660. Now I'm not saying that you could make them yourself. I will just say that if you have some plastic flowers and you know your way around a glue gun.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 接下来，**格莱美奖**（Grammy Awards）就在本周日。我们将看看你是否能猜出一些大奖提名者，不是根据他们的歌曲，而是根据我们为你准备的一些小谜题。我给你举个例子。如果我说“裁缝快速移动”（seamstress moving quickly），我寻找的艺术家是**泰勒·斯威夫特**（Taylor Swift）。明白了吗？好的，我们来试试。第一个，“腐烂的头发”（rotten hair）。那是头发，H-A-R-E。跳，跳。是**坏痞兔**（Bad Bunny）。下一个。“十几岁的女巫，木匠”（teenage witch, woodworker）。是**萨布丽娜·卡彭特**（Sabrina Carpenter）。第三个。“高贵的女人。婴儿语”（Noble woman. Baby talk）。是**Lady Gaga**。第四个。“一个小小的崇拜场所和一个主要的法国河流”（A small place of worship and a major French river）。那是 Chapel Ran。最后一个。“驯化的雪佛兰车型”（domesticated Chevy model）。那是**Tame Impala**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Moving on, the Grammy Awards are this Sunday. We're going to see if you can name some of the big nominees, not based off of their songs, but based off some little puzzles we have for you. I will give you an example. If I say seamstress moving quickly, the artist I'm looking for is Taylor Swift. Got it? Okay, let's give it a shot. First one, rotten hair. That is hair. H A R E. Hop hop. It's Bad Bunny. Next. Teenage witch, woodworker. Sabrina Carpenter. Third one. Noble woman. Baby talk. Lady Gaga. Number four. A small place of worship and a major French river. That is Chapel Ran. And last one domesticated Chevy model. That is tame Impala.
