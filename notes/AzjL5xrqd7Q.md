### 市场周报开篇

**主讲人**: 朋友们，大家好。今天是2月28日，本期是《市场周报》。今天早上，我们醒来时得知**中东**地区爆发了战争。昨晚，**以色列**和**美国**对**伊朗**发起了攻击。在我们录制节目时，伊朗正在进行报复，战斗仍在进行中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Hello my friends. Today is February 28th and this is Markets Weekly. So this morning we woke up to war in the Middle East. Last evening, Israel and the United States began their assault on Iran. And as we record, Iran is retaliating and the fighting is ongoing.

</details>

**主讲人**: 因此，今天，我们首先来谈谈**中东**正在发生的事情，并回顾一下** prior Gulf Wars**，看看这对市场可能意味着什么。其次，我们得稍微谈谈**Catrini**关于**AI**颠覆的病毒式传播的文章，并提出一些反驳观点。好了，我们先从**中东**开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So today, first let's talk about what's happening in the Middle East and look at prior Gulf Wars to see what that could mean for markets. And secondly, we have to talk a little bit about Catrini's viral piece on AI displacement and note some counterpoints as well. All right, starting with the Middle East.

</details>

**主讲人**: 今天早上，总统发布了一段8分钟的录音视频，阐述了他对与**伊朗**开战的理由及其目标。他指出，**伊朗**是一个糟糕的政权，过去曾攻击过**美国**，袭击了**美国**大使馆，劫持了人质。它还可能拥有能够威胁到**美国**的**弹道导弹**，并可能拥有**核武器**，这对**美国**构成了巨大威胁。因此，他们正在攻击**伊朗**的**能力**，并推动**政权更迭**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So this morning, the president released an 8-minute recorded video uh basically stating out his rationale for war with Iran and his goals. He noted that Iran is a bad regime. in the past has attacked the United States, taken their uh attacked US embassy, taken hostages, also could have ballistic missiles that could reach the US, could potentially have nuclear weapons, a great threat to the US. And so what they're doing is that they are attacking their capabilities and also pushing for regime change.

</details>

**引述者**: 最后，对于**伊朗**伟大而骄傲的人民，我今晚要告诉你们，你们自由的时刻即将来临。待在室内，不要离开家，外面非常危险。炸弹将四处落下。当我们完成时，你们将接管你们的政府。这将是你们几代人可能仅有的一次机会。多年来，你们一直寻求美国的帮助，但从未得到。没有一位总统愿意做我今晚愿意做的事。现在，你们有了一位总统，他将给予你们想要的。所以，让我们看看你们如何回应。美国正以压倒性的力量和毁灭性的武力支持你们。现在是时候抓住你们的命运，释放你们触手可及的繁荣和辉煌的未来。这是行动的时刻。不要让它溜走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don't leave your home. It's very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations. For many years, you have asked for America's help, but you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now, you have a president who is giving you what you want. So, let's see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.

</details>

**主讲人**: 所以，这是**美国**可能采取的绝对最强硬的立场。这不应该让你们中的任何人感到意外。我们已经看到**美国**在过去几周内集结了军事力量。**世界上最大的航空母舰“杰拉尔德·福特”号**于周五就位。如果你了解**美国**的政治结构，你就会明白这肯定会发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So this is the absolute maximus position the US could have taken. Now this should not be a surprise to any of you. We've seen the US build up military forces over the past few weeks. The USS Gerald Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, went into position on Friday. And if you understand the US's political structure, you can see that this was definitely going to happen.

</details>

**主讲人**: 现在，总统的借口非常明显是胡说八道。**伊朗**确实袭击了**美国**大使馆，那发生在1979年。那是很久以前的事了。如果你追溯那么久远来找借口攻击某人，你就是在编造。**伊朗**确实拥有**弹道导弹**，**高超音速弹道导弹**，这对该地区的**人民**构成了巨大威胁，但并非对**美国**的威胁。周五，《**纽约时报**》发布了一篇文章，其中情报界人士表示，那个人所说的根本不属实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, the president's excuses are very obviously nonsense. Now, Iran did attack the US embassy that happened in 1979. So, quite a way back. And then, you know, if you're reaching that far back to find excuses to attack someone, you are just kind of making it up. Iran does have ballistic missiles, hypersonic ballistic missiles that are a great threat to people in the region um but not a threat to the US. Uh on Friday, uh the New York Times released a piece where people in the intelligence community basically said that uh that is just not what the person said was just not true.

</details>

**主讲人**: 至于**伊朗**拥有**核武器**的能力，**美国**情报部门也认为他们没有，并且**不接近拥有核武器**。但我也想给你们看这个。如果不加以阻止，**伊朗**可能在很短的时间内生产出**核武器**。可能是一年，也可能在几个月内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, with respect to Iran's capacity to have a nuclear weapon, US intelligence also suggests that they don't and are not close to having a nuclear weapon. But I'd also show you this. If not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months.

</details>

**引述者**: 他们有能力，有储存的、保存的知识，可以很快制造出一枚炸弹，如果他们想这么做的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They have the wherewithal, the stored up, preserved knowledge to make a bomb very quickly uh if they wanted to do it.

</details>

**引述者**: **伊朗**非常危险，距离拥有制造一整套核弹所需的材料仅几周之遥。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Iran is so dangerous, weeks away from having the file material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs.

</details>

**引述者**: 他们非常接近，距离拥有制造原子弹所需的浓缩铀约90%还有6个月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: They're very close. They're 6 months away from being about 90% of having the rich uranium for an atom bomb.

</details>

**引述者**: **伊朗**正准备每年生产25枚原子弹，十年内生产250枚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Iran is gearing up to have to produce 25 bombs, atomic bombs a year, 250 bombs in a decade.

</details>

**引述者**: 女士们先生们，时间不多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Ladies and gentlemen, time is running out.

</details>

**引述者**: **伊朗**将在3到5年内能够独立生产核弹，无需进口任何东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Speaker**: Iran will be capable of producing alone without importing anything nuclear bombs within 3 to 5 years.

</details>

**主讲人**: 所以，正如你们所见，**以色列**总理**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**已经说了大约30年，**伊朗**即将拥有**核武器**，所以我们需要攻击他们。**伊朗**是**以色列**认为其最大的地区威胁，如果你是以色列，并梦想在中东拥有更多影响力，你必须除掉**伊朗**。所以他们一直在尝试这样做一段时间了。他们无法做到，但也许在美国的帮助下，他们可以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So as you can see uh Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been saying for uh 30 years that Iran is about to have an nuclear weapon imminently and so we need to attack them. So Iran is what is who Israel perceives to be their greatest regional threat and if you are an Israel with dreams of having more influence in the Middle East you really have to take Iran out. And so they've been trying to do this for some time. They cannot, but maybe with the US's help, they could.

</details>

**主讲人**: 那么，对于那些了解情况的人来说，**以色列**游说团体在美国**外交政策**上拥有巨大的影响力。我可以举一个个人例子，几个月前，我注意到**以色列**正在杀死大量的**巴勒斯坦人**。有人可能称之为种族灭绝，有人可能称之为种族清洗，随便你怎么说。在那段视频发布后不久，我收到了各种各样的电子邮件，告诉我那不是真的，那不是真的。然后我会指出，这是**联合国**和**红十字会**的说法，但他们就是充耳不闻，就像对着墙说话一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, for those of you who know, the Israel lobby has tremendous influence on foreign policy in the United States. I can tell you from a personal example that a few months ago, I noted that Israel was killing tremendous amounts of Palestinians. Again, some could call that to be a genocide. Some could call that to be ethnic cleansing, whatever. And right after making that video, I got all sorts of emails telling me that, you know, that's not true, that's not true, you know, and then I would point out, you know, this is what the UN and the Red Cross are saying, and they just turn around and uh it's like talking to a brick wall.

</details>

**主讲人**: 然后，我当时被安排在几周内的一个会议上发言。会议组织者实际上给我发了电子邮件，告诉我很多人试图让我被取消发言资格，因为我评论了**以色列**在**加沙**的行为。如果你在网上搜索，你会注意到这种情况非常普遍。普通人对**以色列**在**加沙**或其他地方的行动、**以色列**的政策发表评论，他们就会受到恐吓。有些人甚至会丢掉工作。所以，这种情况在美国实际上相当普遍。我并不那么重要，这些普通的白领工人也不那么重要。但当你在**政治**和**国会**等领域时，压力会加剧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And then I was scheduled at that time to speak to a conference in the coming weeks. And the conference organizer actually sent me emails and told me that a lot of people were trying to get me cancelled because of my comments of what Israel was doing in Gaza. If you if you research on the internet, you'll notice that this is actually very common. Uh people just ordinary people who make comments about Israeli actions, Israeli policy uh in in Gaza or elsewhere, uh they get intimidated. Some of them lose their jobs. So this is something that is actually quite widespread in the US. And we are not I'm not that important and these general white collar workers are not that important either. But on but the pressure intensifies when you are actually in u in politics and congress or so forth.

</details>

**主讲人**: 最近发生的事情是，如果你不支持**以色列**，你就不会得到**以色列**游说团体的捐款，他们会资助你的竞争对手来试图扳倒你。所以**以色列**对**美国**的**外交政策**以及在**机构**和**媒体**等方面拥有巨大的影响力。如果你不支持**以色列**，他们可以毁掉你的职业生涯。因此，在表面之下，存在着一股非常强大的压力运动，以支持**以色列**的事业。所以，你知道，我理解**特朗普总统**可能承受着他一生中最强烈的压力，这似乎足以促使他実際に对**伊朗**发动袭击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What would happen actually uh recently actually is that if you are not supportive of Israel uh you would not get donations from the Israeli pi and they would actually fund your challengers to try to take you out. So there's tremendous influence of by Israel on US foreign policy and in the institutions in the media and so forth. If you are not supportive of Israel, they can do things to uh ruin your career. So there is very much below the surface a very strong pressure campaign uh to support Israeli causes. So you know I understand as President Trump was probably uh of course under the most intense pressure of his lifetime and it seemed like that was enough to push him to actually launch the strike uh on Iran.

</details>

### 地缘冲突与市场反应

**主讲人**: 现在，这事如何发展下去将非常非常难以预测。首先，让我们想想过去**美国**在中东的战争。在20世纪90年代，发生了一场名为“**沙漠风暴行动**”的事件。当时**伊拉克**袭击了邻国**科威特**。**即时市场反应**是石油价格**巨大飙升**。那时，**中东**对石油至关重要，而**美国**是主要的石油进口国。市场当然出现了**抛售**，并且不喜欢这种局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now how this goes forward it's going to be very very difficult to say. So first let's think about what happened in prior US middle eastern wars. So uh in 1990s there was something called operation desert storm. At that time Iraq attacked a smaller neighbor Kuwait and the immediate market reaction for that was of course huge huge spike in oil. At that time the Middle East was super crucial for oil and the US was a major oil importer. The markets of course sold off and did not like it.

</details>

**主讲人**: 在接下来的几个月里，**美国**建立了一个国际联盟，旨在解放**科威特**，击退**伊拉克**等等。在这次集结期间，当**资产**调动到**中东**时，这是非常明显的，就像我们过去几周看到的集结一样。有趣的是，在集结期间市场表现不佳，但在**罢工**开始的那一刻，**石油价格**完全**崩溃**，市场**疯狂反弹**。所以这是一个经典的“**卖出新闻**”事件。也许市场认为这将**非常容易获胜**，而且会**非常短暂**。也许市场已经消化了新闻，所以在之前的几个月里一直在**抛售**，而在事件真正发生时则**反弹**，这种情况有时会发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In the following months, the US built an international coalition aiming to uh free Kuwait, repel Iraq and so forth. And during that buildup, it was very obvious, of course, when you move assets to the Middle East, it's it's basically in your face, similar to the buildup we're seeing uh the past few weeks. And so interestingly the markets did poorly into the buildup but at the moment the strikes commenced oil totally totally imploded and the markets rallied furiously. So it was a very classic uh sell the news event. Uh so it could be that the markets saw that this would be very easy to win. It would be something that was very brief. It could be the markets had already digested the um uh digested the news and so they were selling off in the months before and rallied a at the actual realization of the event that happens sometimes.

</details>

**主讲人**: 另一个最近的例子是2003年的**伊拉克**入侵。那次入侵也是公开进行的。**美国**建立了一个“**盟国联盟**”，投入了大量**资产**到**伊拉克**，然后入侵并推翻了**萨达姆·侯赛因**。在事件发生前的集结期间，市场表现不佳。每个人都有些担心。**石油价格**飙升，**股市**则**下跌**。但**攻击**开始的那一刻，**石油价格**就**崩溃**了，市场再次**疯狂反弹**。那是一次非常迅速的打击。几周内，**美国**就占领了**巴格达**。当然，**战后**的混乱持续了很多年，但**战斗**本身很快就结束了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now another recent example is in 2003 we had the Iraq invasion. So that invasion was also something that was very much out in the open. The US built an international coalition of the willing, launched tremendous assets into Iraq and then uh invaded and overthrew Saddam Hussein. Now into the buildup of that event uh the markets did poorly. Everyone was kind of worried. Oil was spiking and equity markets selling off. But uh the moment that attack began oil prices imploded and again markets rallied furiously and that was a really very quick strike. In a few weeks the US had taken down Baghdad. Of course the aftermath took many many years but the battle was over very quickly.

</details>

**主讲人**: 所以，你们看到的是，历史上这些**地缘政治事件**通常是**可以被规避**的。**俄乌战争**也是如此。**石油价格**在开始时**急剧上涨**，但随后又**大幅下跌**。我认为这基本上是正确的，历史上你应该**规避**这些**地缘政治事件**。但是，我认为现在有点不确定的是，这场冲突将如何发展，因为市场似乎没有消化这一点，或者至少看起来没有消化。**股市**在很大程度上忽略了它。**石油**确实出现了一个**地缘政治溢价**，虽然不是特别高，但确实存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So what you see is historically these geopolitical events are something that you would fade. Same thing actually in the Russia Ukraine war for example. Oil spiked tremendously at the beginning but again uh it's went down a lot. Now the I think that is basically true. You historically want to fade these geopolitical events. Uh but I think what's a little bit uncertain is that just how this conflict would play out because the market did not price this in or at least it didn't seem like it was pricing it in the equity markets largely ignored it. Oil you do see a geopolitical premium. It's not super high but it is there.

</details>

**主讲人**: **伊朗**与**伊拉克**不同，原因有几个。首先，**伊朗**在地理和人口上都大得多。其次，他们拥有更**先进的武器**，并且据说得到了**俄罗斯**和**中国**的一些援助，尽管很难确定援助的程度。所以，目前**伊朗**似乎正在打击**石油设施**或**军事资产**，主要是该地区的**邻国**。在战争迷雾中很难说清楚，但他们声称并且似乎正在做的一件事是试图**扰乱全球石油供应**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So Iran is different from Iraq in that uh for for a couple reasons. One is that Iran is much much much bigger and also uh in geography and in population. Also, they have more sophisticated weapons and word is that they have some assistance from Russia and China, though it's hard to know how much. So, at the moment, what Iran seems to be doing is that they are striking um oil facilities or military assets, basically neighbors in the region.

</details>

**主讲人**: 如果是这样，并且**伊朗**确实拥有我们可能不完全了解的**军事资产**，比如**高超音速弹道导弹**，它们非常有效，并且不易被拦截。这可能是一场比我们预期的更长的战争，而且可能不像过去的军事行动那样容易。再次，**美国**在这里拥有大量**资产**，上次好像有五艘航母，这次只有两艘。所以，这存在高度的不确定性。但有一点很清楚，这不会在周末结束。如果你真的想要**政权更迭**，这需要几天时间，而**美国**似乎为此做好了准备。总统明确表示，这里会有**伤亡**。所以他准备好承担这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's really hard to know, fog of war and all that, but one of the things that they have said they're doing and appear to be doing is to try to disrupt global oil. So, if that's the case, and if Iran does have these military assets that maybe we don't fully know about, the ballistic missiles, the hypersonic ones are are very effective uh and cannot easily be intercepted. This could be a longer war than we anticipate and it may not be as easy as um as the market well as past military action has been. Again, whereas US has a lot of assets here, last time I think they had like five carriers, this time there's only two. So this is very much a high degree of uncertainty. But what I think is pretty clear though is that this will not be something that is over by the end of the weekend. If you really want regime change, this is going to take days and the US seems to be prepared for that. The president noted very clearly that uh there will will be casualties here. So he's prepared to do that.

</details>

**主讲人**: 一个限制因素是，**美国**实际拥有的**弹药**并不多，所以它不能在这里停留很长时间，最多几周。它最终可能会耗尽**弹药**，据我所知，这些**弹药**不易补充。所以，这不一定需要几个月，但可能需要几周。因此，这首先也是最重要的将是**不稳定的**。这将是**风险规避**的一天，但我预计最终这会是**值得规避**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: One limiting factor is that the US actually doesn't have that many munitions and so it really can't be here for a very long period of time in the matter of weeks. It could eventually run out of munitions and as I understand those are not easily replenished. So this is not something that's necessarily going to take months but it could take weeks. So uh this is something that first and foremost is going to be destabilizing. It's going to be a big riskoff day, but I expect that eventually this is something that uh would be worth fading.

</details>

**主讲人**: 现在，这对**美国经济**最直接的影响当然是通过**石油价格**。请记住，**美国**实际上是当今世界上最大的**石油生产国**。所以，它对**美国**的影响不会像过去那么大。但这对其他国家并非如此。想想**日本**，想想**欧洲**。所以，这对它们的影响会更大，而不是对**美国**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now the most direct impact that this would have on the US economy is through oil prices, of course. Now, recall though that US is actually the largest oil uh producer in the world today. So, it's not going to have as much of an impact on US as it would in the past. But that's not true for other countries. Think about Japan. I think about Europe for example. So that's going to have a much bigger impact on them uh than um than the US.

</details>

**主讲人**: 更广泛地看，这将对**共和党**在**中期选举**中的**政治前景**产生重要影响。他们将失去众议院。他们也有可能失去参议院。所以，失去整个国会，将是对总统议程的重大打击。这会引发对总统及其内阁成员的各种调查，你知道，他们中的一些人甚至可能坐牢。所以，如果你指望实现“**美国优先**”议程，或者进一步放松管制等等，那么如果总统失去国会，这些都将变得更加困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: More broadly looking out, this is going to have an important implications on the political prospects of the Republicans uh in the midterms. They're going to lose the House. There is some probability that they could lose the Senate as well. So losing all of Congress uh would be a very big blow to the president's agenda. It opens up all sorts of investigations on the president and his cabinet members and you know maybe some of them would might possibly go to jail. So if you're banking on having a America first agenda or maybe further deregulation and all that other stuff that becomes much more difficult should the president lose Congress.

</details>

**主讲人**: 从更长远来看，这也会影响**JD·万斯**的**总统竞选机会**。**共和党**内部的一个重要群体反对战争，而他们却打破了所有的承诺。所以，这使得他们更有可能在2028年选举中失利。当然，如果我们迎来一个**民主党**政府，那将意味着**税收政策**和**移民政策**等方面的重大改变。所以，这是我们绝对应该关注的事情。拥有这场战争是非常不幸的，但再次强调，现在还很早，让我们看看事态如何发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Looking beyond that it also impacts JD Vance's um chances for presidency as well. a big constituency in the Republican party is against war and they basically broke all their promises and so this is something that that uh makes it much more likely that they would lose the 2028 election and of course uh if we have a Democratic party there that suggests significant changes in things like tax policy and immigration policy as well. So this is something that we should definitely focus on. It's um very unfortunate to have this war and so um but again it's it's early so let's see how this plays out.

</details>

### AI颠覆与经济影响

**主讲人**: 好了，第二件我想谈的事情，当然是那篇引起巨大反响的文章，它描绘了**AI**可能带来的潜在的末日情景，即**AI**大规模颠覆**白领工人**，导致**失业率**急剧上升，可能出现**通货紧缩**，可能影响大量的**抵押贷款**、**贷款**等等。我们也会稍微谈谈一些反驳的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, the second thing that I want to talk about is of course the huge viral piece had on AI sketching out a potential uh kind of a doomsday scenario where AI massively massively displace white collar workers uh leads to tremendous rise in the unemployment rate uh maybe deflation maybe it impacts a lot of um mortgages loans and so forth and we'll also talk a little bit about uh some counter examples to this. So the scenario that

</details>

**主讲人**: **Centruni**描绘的情景，我认为我们以前讨论过，并且现在可以看到它正在发生。就在上周，**Block**的**Jack Dorsey**解雇了他10,000名员工中的4,000名，理由是**AI**让他们中的许多人变得不必要。现在，反对者会说**Jack Dorsey**过度招聘，他只是想用**AI**作为借口来缩减员工数量。我认为这确实也起到了作用。但最终的问题是，今天的**自主AI**是否有能力取代一些**白领工人**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Centruni sketches is something that I think we've talked about before and we can kind of see happening today. So this past week, uh, Jack Dorsey of Block fired 4,000 out of his 10,000 employees, saying that AI basically has made a lot of them unnecessary. Now, the naysayers will say that Jack Dorsey overhired and he's trying using AI as an excuse to shrink headcount. I think that definitely plays a role as well. But the ultimate question is is agentic AI as it is today capable of replacing some white collar workers.

</details>

**主讲人**: 在使用**Anthropic**并听取了更广泛的观点后，我认为这是肯定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now after having using anthropic and listening to wider perspectives I think that is definitely true.

</details>

**主讲人**: 现在，**Sutrini**的例子更进一步，指出可能存在更广泛的颠覆，那么这些**白领工人**会怎么样呢？他们都会涌入**蓝领**工作，比如开优步，直到我们实现**自动驾驶**。这会压低**蓝领工人**的工资，我们就会陷入一种巨大的**通缩螺旋**。在这种情景下，在我看来，**债券**将是终极的**AI交易**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now Sutrini's example takes that and takes it a step further and notes that you know maybe there's much more widespread uh displacement and what happens to these white collar workers? Well, they all tumble into blueco collar jobs like uh driving Uber until we get autonomous driving of course compressing wages for blue collar workers and in sense we get into this huge u kind of a deflationary spiral and in that scenario of course in my personal view bonds would be the ultimate AI trade.

</details>

**主讲人**: 当然，对此的一个反驳观点是回顾过去100年、200年，我们一直有技术进步，对吧？每一次进步，从电力、蒸汽机到互联网等等，我们都看到就业市场出现了一些摩擦，但最终并没有出现大规模失业，人们找到了新工作，比如成为**YouTube博主**之类的。最终，我们都变得更富裕了。这是一个非常明显的历史观察。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now a counterpoint to that of course would be uh looking past over the past 100 years 200 years we've always had technical logical advancement right and what we've seen after every advancement from electricity steam engines internet and so forth is that yes there is some friction in the employment market but at the end of the day there's no mass spread unemployment right people find new jobs you know people become I don't know YouTubers or something like that and at the end of the day we are all wealthier here. So that is of course a very obvious historical observation.

</details>

**主讲人**: 但有一点我想指出，我认为这并不完全正确。在过去的几十年里，我们确实看到了大规模失业，只是没有被衡量出来。让我解释一下。部分由于**全球化**和**制造业自动化**的提高，**美国**的**制造业**工作岗位大大减少。这并不一定会体现在较高的**失业率**上，因为实际上发生的是，成千上万、数百万**人**基本上退出了**劳动力市场**。他们没有被计入**失业率**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now one thing I'll note though is that I think that's not fully true. So one is that over the past few decades we actually do see mass unemployment but it's just not measured and let me explain. So one of the things that we saw partially through globalization and partially through increased automation in manufacturing was that you the US has much fewer manufacturing jobs. Now that doesn't necessarily show up in the higher unemployment rate because what happened actually is that hundreds uh thousands millions of of people basically dropped out of the labor force. So they're not counted in the unemployment rate.

</details>

**主讲人**: 所以，如果你看**劳动力参与率**，特别是对于没有大学学位的人，那些过去通常会在**蓝领制造**业工作的人，随着**自动化**和**全球化**的进行，他们的**劳动力参与率**急剧下降，并且至今没有恢复。所以，一部分**人口**确实被**永久地**落在了后面，他们没有出现在**失业率**中，因为他们退出了**劳动力市场**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So if you look at the labor force participation prime age among cohorts you can see that uh people without a college degree people who usually in the past would have worked in say bluecollar manufacturing jobs their labor force participation rate dropped precipitously as automation and globalization were going on and just has not retire recovered. So a portion of the population does get left behind permanently. they don't show up in the unemployment rate because they drop out of the labor force.

**主讲人**: 其次，**技术**无疑使我们都更富有。显然，比如说我现在使用**AI**，我可以毫不费力地创作一张有趣的**照片**或**视频**。这就是生产的**商品和服务**，对吧？你实际上拥有了更多的**财富**。**AI**在**研究**等方面也能做很多事情。所有这些都非常重要。如果将其计入**GDP**，生产更多的**商品和服务**，肯定会**提振GDP**。但这并非全部。它不一定会**增加收入**，因为所生产的**产品**存在巨大的**通货紧缩**。

**Host**: Now the second thing to note is that the technology definitely makes us all wealthier. Obviously, let's say that I'm using AI now. I can create a funny uh photo or funny video effortlessly. That is goods and services produced, right? You are basically in real terms having uh more wealth and AI can do a lot in research and so forth. All that stuff is super important. And if you were to count it into GDP, more goods and services produced, that is definitely going to boost GDP. But that is not the whole story. it doesn't necessarily boost income because of massive deflation in in the products produced.

**主讲人**: **名义收入**很重要，因为很多人有**债务**。所以，如果你有巨大的技术**创新**，让你能够以更低廉的价格生产**商品和服务**。是的，总的来说我们都更富裕了，但这并不一定意味着你赚得更多钱。如果你有固定的**名义义务**，比如**抵押贷款**或**公司债务**等等，那对你来说实际上是很大的麻烦。所以，我最好的猜测是，最终，**AI**会让我们都更富裕，但没有人会赚到钱。

**Host**: Now income nominal income is important because a lot of people uh will have debt and so if you have massive massive technological innovation that allows you to produce goods and services much cheaply. Yes, overall we are all wealthier but that doesn't necessarily mean you make more money. And if you have fixed nominal obligations like a mortgage or like corporate debt and so forth, uh that that's actually big trouble for you. So my best guess is actually at the end of the day, AI will make us all wealthier, but no one will make any money.

**主讲人**: 所以我们看到一些迹象进入了**债务市场**。令人担忧的是，我们在**债务市场**看到了一些**压力**。比如**高级贷款市场**，或者看**私人信贷**，很多**BDC**（商业发展公司），这些基本上是公开交易的**信贷**和**私人信贷基金**。这些公司正在承受巨大的**股权**价格损失，因为它们是**软件技术**的大型贷款方。

**Host**: So we're seeing some of that creep into the debt markets. So what's kind of alarming is that we saw some stress in the debt markets. So the senior loan market or if you look at private credit a lot of the BDC's these are basically publicly traded credit private credit funds uh these guys are taking huge huge haircuts on their equity prices because they're are big lenders to software technology.

**主讲人**: 随着这种颠覆的持续，它正在渗透到**债务市场**，已经渗透到**股票市场**。所以很难说这会如何发展。但我确实认为，**AI**绝对可以取代，比如说，一名**助理**或**分析师**。因此，**对劳动力的需求**将**结构性地降低**。这将是一条颠簸的道路，我认为政策的反应将是更多的**降息**。

**Host**: So as this disruption goes on it's creeping into the debt markets it's creeped into the equity markets. So it's it's hard to say how this would play out. I do think though that this can definitely uh re AI can definitely replace let's say an associate or an analyst. So there is going to be structurally lower demand for labor.

**主讲人**: 另外，上周我们看到的**通胀数据**高于预期。但这真的只是在看后视镜。我们正在经历的**颠覆**即将发生，尚未完全显现。**《华尔街日报》**的**Greg Ip**有一篇很好的文章指出，实际上**软件工作**正在增加。所以也许**AI**的说法只是危言耸听，这可能是真的，但我认为我们还处于这个过程的早期。此外，如果放眼更广泛的**技术行业**，其他**技术行业的工作**实际上一直在**下降**。

**Host**: Um it's going to be a bumpy road and the way that I think policy would react to this is going to be more rate cuts. Um just one other note, we did have inflation data last week that was higher than anticipated. Uh but really that's kind of looking at the rear view mirror. the disruption that we're having is just about to occur and it's not yet in full force. Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal has a really good article on this noting that actually software jobs are are increasing. So maybe this AI stuff is just doom and that could be true but I think we are early in this process. Also if you look at other more broadly other technology sector jobs they've actually been declining.
