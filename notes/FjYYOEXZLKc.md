title: 特朗普政府移民执法：强硬策略背后的关键人物及其影响
summary: 本播客深入探讨了特朗普政府在移民执法方面的强硬策略，特别关注边境巡逻队负责人格雷格·博维诺（Greg Bovino）及其军事化执法方式。文章分析了ICE在驱逐效率上的困境，以及边境巡逻队如何被赋予更大权力，将执法范围从边境扩大到美国内陆。博维诺的“回邮行动”和在洛杉矶、芝加哥的激进突袭引发了巨大争议，包括种族定性指控和法律挑战。尽管面临反对，博维诺及其支持者坚信其方法的有效性，并得到最高法院和特朗普政府的法律及政治支持，预示着未来移民执法将更加激进。

### 特朗普政府的移民执法升级

来自《纽约时报》，我是娜塔莉·基特罗夫（Natalie Kitroeff），这里是《每日播客》（The Daily）。

随着特朗普政府加大对非法移民的打击力度，它转向了一个机构和一个人，官员们相信这个人能帮助他们大幅增加驱逐出境的人数。这个人就是边境巡逻队（Border Patrol: 美国海关及边境保护局下属的执法机构，负责边境安全）总长格雷格·博维诺（Greg Bovino）。

<p class="english-text">As the Trump administration ramps up its crackdown on illegal immigration, it's turned to one agency and one man officials believe can help them dramatically increase deportations. Border Patrol Chief Greg Bevino.</p>
</details>

“逮捕所有你想要接触的人，这是普遍命令。”他是一位执法人物，现在正处于美国城市中采用的最激进的突袭和策略的中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Arrest as many people that touch you as you want to. Those are the general orders." He's the law enforcement figure who's now at the center of the most aggressive raids and tactics being employed in American cities.</p>
</details>

今天，我的同事哈梅德·阿莱阿齐兹（Hamed Aleaziz）与博维诺对话，并解释了为什么他的军事化方法可能会持续下去。今天是11月12日星期三。

<p class="english-text">Today, my colleague Had Ali Aziz speaks to Bo and explains why his militaristic approach may be here to stay. It's Wednesday, November 12th.</p>
</details>

哈梅德，特朗普政府对移民的打击已经进行了近10个月。在此期间，你曾多次来到节目中，并告诉我们，尽管我们看到了许多关于ICE（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）突袭、逮捕和这些非常激进的执法策略的视频，但政府内部实际上对驱逐出境的缓慢速度感到沮丧。你最近一直在报道他们为解决这个问题而正在做出的改变。那么，让我们从那里开始，请你详细说明一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hammed, we're now almost 10 months into the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. And over the course of that period, you've come on the show at several points. And you've told us that despite all of the videos that we're seeing of these ICE raids and these arrests and these very aggressive enforcement tactics, the administration is actually frustrated internally with the pace, the slow pace they see of deportations. And you've been reporting recently on the changes that they are making to try to address that. So let's start there. Walk me through that.</p>
</details>

是的，特朗普政府上任时承诺进行大规模驱逐。作为其中的一部分，今年早些时候曾大力推动每天逮捕3000人，这是他们的目标。然而，ICE远未达到这个目标。在全国范围内，ICE通常在工作日平均逮捕约1300人。由于无法达到这些数字，ICE内部一直在不断进行调整，不仅是最近，而是贯穿全年。他们更换了局长，更换了多名高级官员。几周前，他们甚至解雇了全国近一半的高级领导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the Trump administration when they came in, they promised mass deportations. And as part of that, there was this massive push earlier this year to arrest 3,000 people a day. That was the goal. And ICE has gotten nowhere near that goal. Across the country, typically ICE on a weekday is averaging around 1,300 arrests. And because of the inability to get these numbers, there have been constant changes at ICE. And not just recently, but throughout the year. They've replaced their director. They've replaced multiple senior officials. And a couple weeks ago, they got rid of almost half of the senior leaders across the country.</p>
</details>

### ICE的执法困境与策略转变

请在这里深入探讨一下，政府到底对什么不满？根据政府的说法，这些领导人做错了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just to drill down here for a second, what is it that the administration is actually taking issue with? What are these leaders doing wrong according to the administration?</p>
</details>

我认为这里的主要问题之一是，ICE历来执行移民执法的方式非常耗时。ICE的做法是，他们会花很长时间监视一个人。他们会派出几个人去逮捕那个人。有时那个人不在。所以需要投入大量的资源，花费大量的时间，却只能逮捕少数人。而现在，政府、国土安全部（DHS: Department of Homeland Security）和ICE正面临着ICE工作方式中固有的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think one of the main issues here is that the way ICE has historically conducted immigration enforcement is really time inensive. What ICE does, they spend a long time surveilling a single individual. They send out several people to go arrest that person. Sometimes that person's not there. So there's so many resources. There's so much time just to get a small number of people. And right now the administration and DHS and ICE is running into really kind of a inherent issue with the way ICE does its work.</p>
</details>

听起来你是在说，他们认为ICE实际上过于按部就班，这与我们看到的那些特工擒拿、摔倒在地、拆散家庭的画面确实有些难以调和。但话又说回来，几个月前我们确实和你谈过一次ICE突袭，你和我们的一位制片人亲身参与了那次突袭，那是一次大规模的白天突袭，他们只拘留了三个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like you're saying they see ICE as actually too methodical, which honestly is sort of hard to square with the images that we've seen of these agents tackling people, slamming people to the ground, breaking families up. But then again, we did talk to you a couple months ago about an ICE raid that you and one of our producers went on and that was this big dayong raid where they only detained three people.</p>
</details>

是的，我的意思是，有无数的视频。你看到ICE砸碎窗户抓人。我们也看到涉及ICE的警员枪击事件。有这些非常戏剧性的视频，显示ICE在全国范围内进行移民搜捕。但对于ICE来说，那种戏剧性是他们想要避免的。通常，他们想要做的是确保现场安全。他们想要迅速进出。他们为以这种方式进行移民执法感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, there have been countless videos. You see ICE smashing windows to get people. We've seen officer involved shootings involving ICE. There are these really dramatic videos of ICE conducting immigration sweeps in the country. But for ICE, that's the type of drama that they want to avoid. Typically, what they want to do is they want to secure the scene. They want to get in and out. And they take a lot of pride in conducting their immigration enforcement in this manner.</p>
</details>

但当然，要顺利完成一次突袭，需要时间和计划。特工们必须在前期一丝不苟。而就政府而言，ICE根本没有时间。所以他们转向了另一个机构，那就是边境巡逻队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course, to pull off a smooth raid, it takes time and planning. And the agents have to be meticulous in the leadup. And as far as the administration is concerned, time is something that ICE just doesn't have. So they've looked to another agency and that's Border Patrol.</p>
</details>

### 边境巡逻队总长博维诺的崛起

边境巡逻队通常在美国南部边境附近行动。他们负责阻止非法越境者，并且在许多方面更愿意采取直接的、军事化的方式。他们的做法非常激进，并且是许多病毒式视频的幕后推手，包括人们在“家得宝”（Home Depot: 美国大型家居建材零售商）被追捕、公寓楼被突袭、人们在洗车店被捕。这些都是边境巡逻队的行动，而不是ICE。现在政府希望他们做得更多，真正站在美国移民执法的前沿。而负责这一切的人，这次行动的指挥官，就是格雷格·博维诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Border Patrol typically operates near the southern border. They are in charge of stopping people who cross into the country illegally and they're more willing to be in your face to be more militaristic in many ways. And they are very aggressive in their approach. and they've been really behind some of the videos that have gone viral, including, you know, people being chased at Home Depot, raids on apartment buildings, people being arrested at car washes. These are border patrol, not ICE. And now the administration wants them to do more and to be really at the forefront of immigration enforcement in the United States. And the guy that's overseeing all of this, the person who is the commander of this operation is a guy named Greg Beavino.</p>
</details>

“嘿，总长。你好吗？”“我很好。你怎么样？”“我很好。”所以，我最近和他谈了谈，以了解他的职业生涯，他来自哪里，以及为什么他被特朗普政府赋予了权力。当你听到他的故事时，很明显他的整个职业生涯都在为这一刻做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Hey, Chief. How are you?" "I'm doing good. How you doing?" "I'm doing well. So, I recently spoke with him to understand his career, where he came from, and why he's been empowered by the Trump administration. And when you hear his story, it's pretty clear that his whole career has been leading up to this point.</p>
</details>

他的故事从何开始？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And where does that story start for him?</p>
</details>

嗯，实际上在他很小的时候，他就通过书籍和电影被这个机构吸引了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, really at a young age, he's somebody who was drawn to the agency through books, through film.</p>
</details>

“我确信我不会告诉你任何你不知道的事情。这里的游戏有点不同。”事实上，他有一个远房亲戚，他称之为叔叔，是好莱坞的制片人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I'm sure I'm not going to be telling you anything you don't know. The game's a little different around here." In fact, he had a distant relative. He calls him an uncle who was a producer in Hollywood.</p>
</details>

他从未见过他，但他制作了一部由杰克·尼科尔森（Jack Nicholson）主演的电影，叫做《边境》（The Border）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Never knew him, but he produced a movie called The Border with Jack Nicholson.</p>
</details>

“边境，它分隔了土地，它分隔了人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"The Border, it divided the land, it divided the man."</p>
</details>

我记得，我相信我大约八九岁的时候，我的父母带我去看那部电影，因为尼尔叔叔制作了它。对于来自北卡罗来纳州农村地区的人来说，看到这样的事情是件大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember, I believe I was approximately 8, 9 years old, and my parents took me to see that movie because Uncle Neil produced it. It was kind of a big deal from back in rural North Carolina to see something like that.</p>
</details>

“你正在杀害司机。别告诉我我不知道我在说什么，因为如果我不知道我在说什么，你今天带进去的司机在哪里？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"You're killing drivers. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about because if I don't know what I'm talking about, where's the driver you took in there today?"</p>
</details>

所以，我们去看了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we went and watched it.</p>
</details>

“看到这条线了吗？就是这条线。我不会越过这条线。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"See this line? This line right here. I don't cross. This line right here."</p>
</details>

它让我从小就对边境巡逻队产生了兴趣，我将其与70年代和80年代许多来自边境巡逻队的作家所写的书籍进行对比。他们写了很多书。我认为他受到了一个机构的启发，在这个机构中，人们监管着广阔的土地，他们独自一人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It got me interested in the Border Patrol from an early age, and I juxtaposed that against the many authors from the 70s and 80s that were from the Border Patrol. Um, they wrote a lot of books. I think he was inspired by an agency in which people are overseeing these vast swaths of land. They're by themselves.</p>
</details>

那些边境巡逻队特工（当时他们被称为检查员）所面临的极端暴力。这让我震惊，哇，那是一个非常艰难的组织，独自一人在外，没有支援。我开始意识到，那个叫做美国边境巡逻队（US Border Patrol）的机构可能非常特别。所以我多年来一直记在心里，当有机会的时候，我就提交了申请，被接受了，剩下的就是历史了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The extreme amount of violence that those border patrol agents or they were called inspectors back then were up against. And it struck me, wow, that was a pretty tough organization to be out there alone with no backup. And I began to realize that that thing called the US Border Patrol is probably something pretty special. So I kept it in mind through the years and when I had the opportunity I put my application in and was accepted and the rest is history.</p>
</details>

他于1996年加入该机构，并在加利福尼亚州南部边境附近的埃尔森特罗（El Centro）地区开始工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he joins the agency in 1996 and he starts at the El Centro sector this area near the southern border in California.</p>
</details>

“你知道，当我开始在埃尔森特罗工作时，美国和墨西哥之间只有一片开阔的沙漠。我记得当时有很多我们称之为‘驾车闯关’（drive-thru）的情况。那就是有人开着车越过边境，无论是载着非法外国人还是毒品。三十年前，那里非常猖獗。现在，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"You know when I started there in El Centro there was just open desert between the United States and Mexico. And I remember the amount of what we would call a drive-thru. That's when someone takes a vehicle and drives across the border, whether it's with a load of illegal aliens or a load of narcotics. That was quite rampant back in the day there 30 years ago. Now,</p>
</details>

很快，他几乎就被置于他年轻时所想象的场景中。你知道，这片广阔的土地，没有多少特工在那里。很多时候都是特工独自一人。所以他就在那里做着他年轻时浪漫化的工作，逮捕人口走私犯，逮捕非法越境的移民，真正被推入这些激烈的场景中，而这些场景在几年前他还在书中读到。从那时起，他得以在机构中晋升，在全国各地担任领导职务，包括在新奥尔良，最终在2020年，也就是第一届特朗普政府接近尾声时，他回到埃尔森特罗，担任边境巡逻队代理负责人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and pretty quickly, he's almost put into the scenario that he imagined as a young man. You know, this area that's vast swats of land. There's not a lot of agents out there. It's often times agents by themselves. And so he's out there doing the work that he romanticized as a young man, arresting human smugglers, arresting migrants crossing the country illegally and really being thrust into these intense scenarios that just years before he was reading in books. And from there he was able to rise up in the agency, take on leadership roles across the country, including in New Orleans, and ultimately in 2020 toward the end of the first Trump administration, he returns to El Centro and he takes over as border patrol agent in charge.</p>
</details>

“能够回到我开始的地方，那非常特别。所以，边境有一个区域我以为我非常了解。但当我到达那里时，我甚至认不出它了。它几乎面目全非。所以，我注意到有更多的基础设施。特朗普总统修建了新的30英尺高的墙。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Well, being able to return where I started, that was pretty special. So, there was one area of the border that I thought I knew quite well. And once I got down there, I couldn't even recognize it. It was almost unrecognizable. So, uh, I noticed there was a lot more infrastructure. President Trump had put the new wall in, the 30ft wall.</p>
</details>

现在有了一堵墙，有道路，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's now a wall. There are roads,</p>
</details>

道路、技术以及特朗普总统执政期间在那里进行的改进。所以，我注意到边境变得更加安全了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the roads, the technology, the improvements that were made there under President Trump's administration. So, that's something I noticed is a much more secure border.</p>
</details>

也许最重要的是，政策大相径庭。特朗普政府在2020年此时颁布了一项全面的边境政策，允许特工迅速遣返人们，在没有任何程序或寻求庇护的机会的情况下驱逐他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And perhaps most consequentially, the policies are much different. The Trump administration at this time in 2020 has enacted a sweeping border policy that allows agents to quickly turn back people, deport them without any process or access to asylum.</p>
</details>

“我们终于得到了我们所要求的。就像他们终于听取了边境巡逻队的意见。”当然，这是政府的理由，是为了保护美国公众免受新冠病毒（CO: COVID-19）传播的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"We finally got what we were asking for. Uh it's like they finally listened to the border patrol. And of course, this was in the administration's reasoning as a result of protecting the American public from the spread of CO.</p>
</details>

没错。这就是**第42条法案**（Title 42: 一项公共卫生紧急权力，允许美国政府在疫情期间迅速驱逐非法越境者），这项措施允许他们因公共卫生紧急情况而立即驱逐试图越境的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. This was Title 42, the measure that allowed them to immediately deport people who tried to cross the border because of the public health emergency.</p>
</details>

正是如此。

<p class="english-text">Exactly.</p>

### 拜登政府时期的政策逆转与博维诺的反击

所以，听起来博维诺对特朗普政府全面强硬的执法方式感到兴奋。他如何看待拜登上任？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it sounds like Bo is excited by the Trump administration's fullthroated approach to enforcement. How does he experience Biden coming to office?</p>
</details>

他不喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was not a fan.</p>
</details>

“就像关掉电灯开关一样。在这种情况下，就像关掉了电灯开关。我们回到了黑暗时代。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"It was like turning a light switch on and off. In this case, it was like turning the light switch off. We went back to the dark ages."</p>
</details>

所以，在拜登政府时期，值得注意的是，拜登政府在早期继续使用第42条法案。但发生了一件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So during the Biden administration, it's important to note that the Biden administration continued to use Title 42 during the early years. But one thing that happened was</p>
</details>

“我记得当时华盛顿特区的领导层下达了命令，叫做‘吞吐量和减压’（throughput and decompression）。有太多人越过边境，以至于政府采取的策略之一是‘减压’他们的边境设施。换句话说，就是将人们释放到国内，让他们等待移民法庭听证会，或者收到通知去见ICE。因此，在这个过程中，成千上万的人在非法越境后被允许进入美国。这简直是数百万非法外国人的大规模涌入。你意识到，你知道，这样的政策会造成多大的破坏，以及它可能会推翻多少工作。它基本上在24小时内推翻了数十年的工作，这就是它所需要的一切。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I remember the order was given there from that leadership in DC. It was called throughput and decompression. There were so many people crossing the border that one of the strategies the administration took was to quote unquote decompress their border facilities. In other words, to release people into the country with immigration court hearings or with notices to go see ICE. And so during that process, many people, hundreds of thousands of people were allowed into the country after they had just crossed illegally. Um, and it's just a massive onrush of millions of illegal aliens. You realize that, you know, a policy like that, how damaging that can be and how much work it could undo. It undid a lot of work, decades of work, all in a 24-hour period basically, and that's all it took.</p>
</details>

对于边境巡逻队来说，这确实令人士气低落和沮丧。格雷格·博维诺（Greg Bovino）确实体现了这一点，对吧？我们当时都报道了这件事，哈梅德。我作为外国记者在墨西哥一侧的边境报道，你在美国。博维诺将他所称的“完全开放的边境”描述为一种过度简化，但确实，我们在拜登政府时期看到了一个更脆弱的边境，并且有大量人员涌入，政府没有将所有人都遣返，而是将其中许多人释放到国内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for Border Patrol, that was really demoralizing and upsetting. And Greg Bevino really kind of embodies that, right? We both actually covered this at the time, Huh. I was covering this from the Mexican side of the border as a foreign correspondent. You were in the US. Bino describes what he calls a totally open border. That is an oversimplification, but it's true that we saw a more poorest border under Biden and there was this huge influx of people and rather than turning all of them away, there was this release into the country of many of these people.</p>
</details>

是的，我认为这是对的。我的意思是，我认为在拜登执政期间，边境并非完全开放。当然有人非法越境并被遣返。但是

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I think during the Biden years, there was not an open border. There were certainly people who were crossing illegally and being turned back. But</p>
</details>

在那段时间里，有太多人越境，以至于许多人都成功进入了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">during that time, there were so many people crossing that many people got through.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

对于其他移民来说，有一种观念，一种信息被传递出来，那就是拜登政府不会像特朗普政府那样，不惜一切代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for other migrants, there was this kind of idea, there was a message being sent that the Biden administration wasn't going to go to the lengths that the Trump administration was willing to go to, you know,</p>
</details>

阻止他们入境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to stop them from entering.</p>
</details>

正是如此。结果，你开始看到成千上万的人越境，并愿意冒着可能被驱逐出境的风险，因为他们知道有很大的机会不会被驱逐，并且会被允许进入美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. And as a result of that, you started to see hundreds of thousands of people crossing and willing to take the risk of potentially being deported because they knew there was a good chance that they wouldn't be and they would be allowed into the United States.</p>
</details>

所以，博维诺身处这场行动的前沿，在很多方面都是如此。他就在边境线上，他说拜登政府要求他的机构做与其使命相反的事情。那么，他对此有何回应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here's Bovino. He's on the forefront of this in many ways. He's right on the border and he's saying the Biden administration is asking his agency to do the opposite of its mission. So how does he respond to that?</p>
</details>

是的，对他来说，他觉得他不会顺从边境其他地区正在发生的事情。他将在自己的区域尝试自己的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, for him he feels like he's not going to go along with what's happening in other parts of the border. He's going to try his own approach in his area.</p>
</details>

“我们在埃尔森特罗地区所做的一件事是，我们没有进行‘吞吐量和减压’。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"One of the things we did in El Centro sector is we didn't do throughput and decompression.</p>
</details>

“我们继续对那些越境的人施加后果。有趣的是，当你确实对一个非法越境的外国人施加后果时，你猜怎么着？他们就不想在你施加后果的地方越境了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We continued to give consequences to those who would come across the border. And one of the interesting things is when you do provide a consequence to an illegal alien that comes across the border, guess what? they don't want to cross the border where you're providing consequences.</p>
</details>

因此，尽管他认为拜登政府的立场是将移民释放到美国，但他表示，在他的辖区内，他们继续在边境遣返移民并将其驱逐出境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So despite what he sees as the Biden administration stance of releasing migrants into the United States, he says that in his sector, they kept on turning back migrants at the border and deporting them.</p>
</details>

在那段时间快结束时，当他对拜登政府的政策以及其他有同感的边境巡逻队特工越来越感到沮丧时，他决定进一步加大力度。他做了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And toward the end of that time, as he's getting more and more frustrated with the Biden administration's policies alongside other Border Patrol agents who felt the same, he decides to amp things up even more. What does he do?</p>
</details>

首先，他在这项行动中使用的策略，在人们开车上班途中拦下他们，在此过程中还逮捕了一些美国公民。这与我们当时看到的情况相比，确实是一次升级。但也许同样重要的是这项行动发生在哪里。它不在边境。他正在进入国家的内陆。我想知道你是否认为这是一次测试，博维诺正在开始扩大边境巡逻队的工作范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, the tactics that he's using in this operation, pulling people over on their drives to work, sweeping up some American citizens in the process. That's a real escalation from what we were seeing at the time. But maybe just as important is where this operation is happening. It's not at the border. He's going into the interior of the country. And I'm wondering if you see this as a test where Bovino is starting to expand the idea of where the Border Patrol does its work.</p>
</details>

是的，绝对如此。我认为对他们来说，这里的想法是边境执法不应止于边境。那些非法越境进入这个国家的人，我们会在任何地方找到他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, definitely. And I think for them it's the idea here is border enforcement doesn't stop at the border. People who cross illegally into this country, we're going to find them wherever they are.</p>
</details>

哈梅德，这有多不寻常？因为我只在边境与边境巡逻队打过交道。他们以前是否曾进入内陆并以这种方式开展工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How unusual is that, Hammed? Because I've only interacted with Border Patrol at the border. Is it something they've done before to go into the interior and do their work that way?</p>
</details>

是的，我的意思是，以前有过逮捕人口走私犯的零星事件。边境巡逻队过去也曾提供帮助，但这种他们基本上充当ICE官员的行动方式，是非常不寻常的。在我报道移民问题的这些年里，我从未见过这种事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean, there have been arrests of human smugglers, you know, one-off events. Border Patrol has helped in the past, but this type of operation in which they are acting as essentially ICE officers, that type of thing is very unusual. That is something that I have not seen in my years of covering immigration.</p>

<p class="english-text">And so what's the reaction like? Is there fallout? What happens?</p>
</details>

是的，当然。社区成员感到不安，移民倡导者和律师也感到不安，美国公民自由联盟很快就提起了诉讼，指责格雷格·博维诺及其特工的工作，基本上是说他们随意拦下并逮捕人们，没有达到与他们交谈并最终逮捕他们所需的合理怀疑程度。他们认为这是一次针对农场工人外貌的全面行动。一名联邦法院法官裁定边境巡逻队和格雷格·博维诺在加利福尼亚州中央谷地的行动方式实际上违反了法律。但尽管如此，博维诺仍将那次行动视为一次明显的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, definitely. you know, community members are upset, immigrant advocates and lawyers are upset, and pretty quickly the ACLU files a lawsuit, calling out the work of Greg Beino and his agents, basically saying that they were stopping people at random and arresting them without the level of reasonable suspicion that is needed to talk to them and to ultimately later to arrest them. They believe that this was sweeping operation targeting farm workers based on their appearance. And a federal court judge found that Border Patrol and Greg Bevino had actually violated the law and the way they operated in California's Central Valley. But despite that, Bevino sees that operation as a clear success.</p>

你认为当时，尽管对行动的合法性存在疑问，博维诺是否可能将“回邮行动”视为即将上任的特朗普政府如何执行执法的模式？我们不确切知道，但很明显，博维诺认为这是处理移民执法的正确方式。这种不道歉、进入社区、围捕人群、并在公共场所采取激进行动的方式，正是特朗普总统在他的竞选活动中承诺的那种事情。

This kind of no apologies, going into communities, rounding up people, and operating really aggressively in public spaces is exactly the kind of thing that really President Trump promised in his campaign.</p>

<p class="english-text">And what does Bo say about the huge outcry that these tactics elicited?

“当然，哈梅德。我不会过多地谈论战术，但是，嗯，甚至在我们去一个城市之前，我们通过许多不同的方式收集情报。我们姑且这么说吧。所以，我们已经知道在某些地方有坏人坏事。我们去那里。我们收集情报。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Sure, Hammad. And I'm not going to go too much into the tactics, but um even before we go to a city, we gather intelligence from many different means. Let's just say that.

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what is often referred to as collaterals. Right.</p>

正是如此。这些人是移民行动目标周围的人。当你去“家得宝”，当你去一个人多的公共场所时，获得更多附带逮捕的可能性会大大增加。作为其中的一部分，你将有可能获得更多数字，逮捕更多人，并朝着政府一直努力实现的目标迈进，那就是每天逮捕3000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. These are people who are around targets of an immigration operation. And when you go to a Home Depot, when you go to a public place where there are a lot of people, the prospect of getting more collateral arrests goes way up. And as part of that, you're going to have the potential to get more numbers to to arrest more people and go towards that goal that the administration has strived toward, which is 3,000 arrests a day.</p>
</details>

没错。对于特朗普政府来说，博维诺的方法的吸引力显而易见，特别是与ICE更具针对性的执法方式相比，通过进入大型公共区域而不是，你知道，单个人的家。你更有可能拘留一群人。也许他们不是你最初寻找的人，但这可能有助于政府实现其尽可能多地驱逐出境的目标。所以，我的问题是，边境巡逻队在现场如何准确决定拦下谁？他们使用的标准是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And for the Trump administration, it's kind of easy to see the appeal of Bo's approach, especially compared to ICE's more directed version of enforcement by going into big public areas instead of, you know, a single person's home. It's more likely that you're going to detain a bunch of people. Maybe they're people that you weren't originally looking for, but that might help the administration meet its goal of working to deport as many people as possible. So, my question is, how exactly does Border Patrol decide who to stop when they're there? What's the criteria they use?</p>
</details>

嗯，他向我描述的方式是一个叫做**合理怀疑**（reasonable suspicion: 低于“可能原因”的执法标准，允许警察在有特定、可具体说明的事实支持下，短暂拘留和盘问个人）的过程。合理怀疑低于“可能原因”（probable cause）。你的许多观众可能理解什么是可能原因。合理怀疑是一个更低的标准。所以为了获得合理怀疑，我们查看被称为**可明确事实**（articulable facts: 执法人员可以具体说明的、支持其怀疑的客观事实）的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the way he describes it to me is a process called reasonable suspicion. that reasonable suspicion is below probable cause. Many of your viewers probably understand what probable cause is. Reasonable suspicion is an even lower standard. So to get that reasonable suspicion, we look at things called articulable facts.</p>
</details>

一个人的种族自然也是一个可明确事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And someone's ethnicity is is is naturally an articulable fact as well.</p>
</details>

这可能是，但那是具体情况具体分析的，哈梅德。没有一个一概而论的、可明确事实的清单，我们会去查看并说，嗯，你知道吗？那个人有所有这些，或者那个女孩有所有这些，然后去抓他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It could be, but that's a case by case basis. Hammad, there's not a blanket um articulable fact sheet that we're going to look and say, well, you know what? um that guy's got all these or that girl's got all these and go get them.</p>
</details>

基本上，移民官员必须有合理怀疑某人非法居留在美国，才能拦下他们并询问他们的身份。但正是这种合理怀疑的基础，导致了边境巡逻队特工在洛杉矶**种族定性**（racially profiled: 基于种族或民族特征进行执法）的指控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basically, immigration officers must have a reasonable suspicion that somebody's in the country illegally to be able to stop them and question them about their status.

格雷格·博维诺和美国边境巡逻队对此提出异议。

<p class="english-text">That's something that Greg Bevino and the US Border Patrol disputed.</p>

哈梅德，你对这个回应怎么看？因为当你听到边境巡逻队特工出现在“家得宝”并因为人们看起来像拉丁裔而逮捕他们时，很难不认为这不是种族定性。当然，我们听到他们逮捕的人往往是美国的拉丁裔公民。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What do you make of that response, Hamemed? Because when you hear that Border Patrol agents are showing up at a Home Depot and picking people up because they look Latino, it's hard to see how that isn't profiling. And of course, we're hearing that the people they're picking up are often Latino citizens of the United States.</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，现实是，我们在洛杉矶和其他地方看到的逮捕行动中，他们逮捕的人往往是拉丁裔。而这些关于边境巡逻队和移民执法特工何时何地可以逮捕人的核心问题，一直上诉到最高法院。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, the reality is that in the arrests that we've seen in Los Angeles and elsewhere, they are picking up people often times who are Latino. And these core questions of when and where Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents can make arrests went all the way to the Supreme Court</p>
</details>

告诉我们那里发生了什么。一名联邦法院法官曾限制国土安全部在洛杉矶的行动方式，但最高法院暂时阻止了这项命令。在布雷特·卡瓦诺（Brett Kavanaugh）大法官的意见中，他表示联邦法院法官无权告诉政府在移民执法方面可以做什么，不可以做什么。事实上，卡瓦诺说移民官员至少可以将种族作为在街头拦下某人决定的一个因素。当然，我认为这项裁决确实鼓励了国土安全部和格雷格·博维诺继续在洛杉矶和其他地方采取行动。这基本上是卡瓦诺同意博维诺的论点，即种族是一个合法的因素，可以在特工在街头决定盘问谁时使用。所以博维诺至少暂时获得了最高法院的法律认可。他得到了政府的支持。他会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and tell us what happened there. So, a federal court judge had limited the way Department of Homeland Security could operate in Los Angeles, but the Supreme Court blocked that order temporarily. And in his opinion, Justice Kavanaaugh said that it wasn't the role of the federal court judge to tell the government what it could and could not do when it came to immigration enforcement. And in fact, Kavanaaugh said that immigration officers can use ethnicity at least as a factor in the decision to stop someone on the streets. And of course, I think this ruling really kind of emboldened the Department of Homeland Security and Greg Bavino to continue with their actions in Los Angeles and elsewhere. This is Kavanaaugh basically agreeing with Bovino's argument that ethnicity is a legitimate factor that can be used as agents are out there deciding who to question on the streets. So Bo gets this legal validation from the highest court at least temporarily. He's got the administration's backing. What does he do with that?</p>

“那是一次非常成功的行动，哈梅德。记住，那栋公寓楼里有很多美国公民被暴力帮派成员盯上。所以他们，我为那次大规模行动感到非常自豪。”

你知道，他认为这次行动成功地清除了坏人，这正是他们应该做的工作。这是一次成功。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, he sees the operation as one in which they got rid of bad people and this is exactly the type of work that they should be doing. This was a success.</p>
</details>

“嗯，向那里的特工致敬。他们让那个城市的一部分变得更安全了。而且，你知道，我认为很多人都会同意这一点。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Um kudos to the agents there. They've made that part of the city a safer place. And you know, I think a lot of folks would agree there with that.</p>
</details>

那它真的成功了吗？我们对此了解多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And was it a success actually? like what do we know about that?</p>
</details>

是的。所以，就像我们之前谈到的附带逮捕一样，这里也发生了。在我做的一些报道中，我发现至少有几名被捕者没有犯罪记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, like we talked about before with collateral arrests that happened here. In some of the reporting that I've done, I found at least a few of the people who are arrested had no criminal background.</p>
</details>

也有家庭被捕，但政府在过去的几个月里没有给我们任何关于发生的事情和被拘留者的细节或分类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There were families who were arrested as well, but the administration uh has not in the months since given us any breakdown or any details of what happened and the individuals who were detained.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，你知道，这次行动在许多方面象征着这个国家的移民辩论。你知道，对于国家的一部分人来说，这是一次越权。执法特工从直升机上绳降，有时随意逮捕一群人，完全不合适。而对于博维诺和特朗普政府的支持者来说，这正是应该发生的事情，如果你非法居留在美国并被逮捕。这正是应该发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think you know this operation in many ways symbolizes the immigration debate in the country. You know for for one portion of the country this was an overreach. Law enforcement agents repelling down from helicopters arresting a bunch of people at random at times completely inappropriate. Whereas for Bavino and supporters of the Trump administration this is exactly what should happen ultimately if you're in the country illegally and you're arrested. That's the exact thing that should happen.</p>
</details>

是的。这与白宫的**零容忍政策**（zero tolerance policy: 对非法越境行为采取不妥协的执法态度）非常一致。你知道，如果你犯了非法越境的罪行，政府就会追捕你，他们说：“看，这就是人们投票支持的。博维诺只是在贯彻这一点。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. This is very much in line with the White House's policy of zero tolerance. You know, if you committed the crime of crossing the border illegally, the administration is going to go after you and they say, "Look, this is what people voted for. Bo is just following through on that."</p>
</details>

是的。博维诺、国土安全部、ICE、政府，当他们谈论对移民的打击时，他们首先想谈论有犯罪记录的人。但当你指出没有犯罪记录的人时，他们会说：“嗯，那些人是非法越境的，他们没有合法身份居留在美国，他们也应该被逮捕。没有宽恕。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Bevino, DHS, ICE, the administration, when they're talking about their crackdown on immigration, at the forefront, they want to talk about people with criminal records. But when you point to people who don't have criminal records, they say, "Well, those people crossed illegally and they're in the country without any form of status, they should be arrested as well. There's there's no forgiveness."</p>
</details>

### 政治与法律挑战

那这些策略面临的法律挑战呢？法院对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what about any legal challenges to these tactics? Where are the courts on this today?</p>
</details>

是的，伊利诺伊州目前正在就边境巡逻队特工在那里使用武力提起诉讼，这确实是他们行动的一个标志。博维诺最近实际上被传唤到该案中作证，法官似乎特别怀疑特工在行动期间在街头使用武力是否必要。我认为到今年年底，我们应该会看到最高法院以某种方式对边境巡逻队的策略做出裁决，与此同时，我认为对于博维诺和国土安全部来说，他们认为他们所做的一切是完全适当和必要的。你是否曾担心自己做得太过火，人们会说，你知道，你所做的行动的描述，一些武力的使用，你是否曾担心任何过度执法？这是否曾出现在你的脑海中？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there are lawsuits in Illinois right now over the use of force by border patrol agents there, which has really been a hallmark of their operation. Bevino was recently actually called to testify in that case where a judge uh seemed particularly skeptical that it was necessary for agents to use force on the streets during their operations. I think by the end of the year uh we should expect that the Supreme Court will weigh in one way or another on Border Patrol's tactics and in the meantime I think for Betheino and DHS they believe what they're doing is completely appropriate and necessary. Do you ever worry that you're going too far that people are saying you know the descriptions of the operations you're doing some of the use of force do you ever worry about any excess enforcement? Does that ever come into your mind?</p>
</details>

“不，没有，因为特别是芝加哥的那些内城居民，他们被普利兹克州长和约翰逊市长压制了声音，那些内城居民出来说，请留下来，请做得更多。所以，”他声称洛杉矶和芝加哥的居民拦住他，说他们支持他所做的事情，他相信那些反对、抗议的人实际上是少数。我们所知道的是，他的方法完全符合特朗普政府的意愿。诺姆部长、特朗普政府、特朗普总统的领导层，你有没有听说人们，你知道，支持并满意你在这个国家所做的工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Uh, no it doesn't because especially those inner city residents here in Chicago who have been silenced been silenced by the governor pritzers and the mayor Johnson's those inner city residents come out and say please stay please do more. So, he's claimed that he's been stopped by residents in Los Angeles and Chicago who've said they support what he's doing and he believes that the people who are opposed, who are protesting, they're actually in the minority. What we do know is that his approach is fully in line with what the Trump administration wants. the leadership that the Secretary Gnome, the Trump administration, President Trump, have you heard that that people are, you know, supportive and happy with the work that you're doing in the country?</p>
</details>

“嗯，是的。你说的那个领导层，我称之为‘领导梦之队’。我说的上届政府期间熄灭的电灯开关，在本届政府期间又亮了起来，只不过它太亮了，我现在甚至需要戴墨镜才能看清。所以我问他，你知道，这次行动，你会把它带到其他城市吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Well, yeah. Um, that leadership you're talking about, I called that the the leadership dream team. That light switch that I said went off during the last administration went back on on this administration, except when it went on, it's so bright that I have to put sunglasses on just to even see now. And so I asked him, you know, is this operation, are you gonna take it to other cities?</p>
</details>

这是个百万美元的问题。这是个百万美元的问题。我只能说，嗯，敬请期待。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That's the million-dollar question here. That's the million-dollar question. All I can say is, uh, stay tuned.</p>

你知道，他有点含糊其辞，但看起来确实是肯定的。

</details>

好的，我理解他提出的论点，但这似乎与我们开始看到的那些关于这些策略反应的民意调查相冲突。因为尽管政府赋予了博维诺权力，但越来越多的迹象表明，许多选民并不喜欢这些方法。是的，他们可能支持驱逐出境，但他们不一定赞成这种方式，这些我们看到的激进场景，尤其是在芝加哥。所以我想知道你是否认为特朗普和他的政府在政治上冒着任何风险，如果他们继续支持博维诺和他的风格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I hear the argument that he's making, but that does seem to be in conflict with all this public polling that we're starting to see that gets at the response to these tactics. Because while the administration has empowered Bovino, there are growing signs that many voters really don't like these methods. Yes, they might support deportations, but they're not necessarily in favor of this approach, these aggressive scenes that we're seeing play out, especially in Chicago. And so I wonder if you think there's any risk politically here for Trump and his administration in doubling down on Bo and his style.</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，嗯，我们最近看到总统上了《60分钟》（60 Minutes: 美国一档电视新闻杂志节目），他说事实上特工们做得还不够。所以，对他来说，他似乎肯定支持更激进的方法。但你说得对，我认为这在选民中如何演变将是关键。我们可能会在明年的中期选举中看到一些结果，因为这些画面无处不在。我们每天都在看到它们。所以，除非法院或通过选举发生变化，否则我认为博维诺的风格和他的影响力只会越来越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, uh, we recently saw, uh, the president go on 60 Minutes and say that in fact, agents aren't going far enough. So, certainly for him, it seems like he's supportive of a more aggressive approach. But you're right, I think how this plays out with voters is going to be key. We'll probably see some of that in the midterm election next year because these images are everywhere. We're seeing them on a daily basis. So until something changes either in the courts or through an election, I think Bevino's style and his influence is only going to grow.</p>
</details>

我之前提到ICE内部的一些空缺，他们更换了一些机构内部和全国各地的高级领导。事实上，其中一些人已经被前CBP官员取代。所以那些在监督边境巡逻队的机构工作过的官员现在被任命领导ICE。哈梅德，你是否认为这表明你所描述的ICE更深思熟虑、更系统化的方法正在被淘汰？这有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mentioned earlier some vacancies within ICE, them replacing some senior leaders inside the agency and across the country. In fact, some of those people have been replaced with ex CBP officials. So officials who worked at the agency that oversees the border patrol are now being put in a position to lead ICE. Do you hamemed take that as a signal that what you described as ISIS's more considered approach, more methodical approach is on the way out? What are the implications of that?</p>
</details>

嗯，目前尚不清楚，但我认为有一件事是肯定的，那就是ICE面临着要取得更多成果的压力。特朗普政府希望有更多的逮捕，他们希望有更多的驱逐出境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's unclear right now, but one thing I think is for sure, which is that ICE is under pressure to deliver more results. The Trump administration wants more arrests. They want more deportations.</p>
</details>

所以，ICE受到了警告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, ICE is on notice.</p>
</details>

但我认为结果可能是城市中抗议者与联邦政府之间的暴力和冲突会增加。

<p class="english-text">But I think as a result there could be increased violence and confrontation in cities between protesters and the federal government.</p>

### 今日其他新闻：美国海军在加勒比海部署

以下是您今天还应该知道的其他消息。周二，美国海军最大、最先进的航空母舰进入加勒比海地区。此举代表着美国军事力量的大幅升级，因为特朗普政府正在权衡采取军事措施，旨在推翻委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicholas Maduro）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Here's what else you should know today. On Tuesday, the US Navy's biggest and most advanced aircraft carrier moved into the Caribbean region. The move represented a substantial escalation of US military might as the Trump administration weighs taking military steps aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro.</p>
</details>

这艘名为“杰拉尔德·R·福特”号（Gerald R. Ford）的航空母舰抵达的消息是在国防部长皮特·赫克西斯（Pete Hexith）宣布在东太平洋对走私毒品的船只进行打击，造成六人死亡的一天后传出的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">News of the arrival of the carrier called the Gerald R. Ford came a day after Defense Secretary Pete Hexith announced that six more people had been killed in strikes on boats that he said were smuggling drugs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
</details>

自九月以来，这些袭击已使该行动的死亡人数达到76人。
