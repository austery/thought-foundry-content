### 语音技术演进

**Interviewer**: 我们尝试制造出逼真的人声，这已经有了literally几个世纪的历史了，从1700年代就开始了。然后在1900年代初，我们有了第一批数字合成器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: We've been trying to make these human voices for literally since the 1700s. Then in the early 1900s, we had the first digital synthesizers.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 它是…… um……它没有跨越那个界限，真正听起来像一个人，并且真正让你产生某种感觉。然后它转向了 **Siri**，Siri 有点来回的对话，听起来更真实，但同样，它没有跨越那个界限，真正听起来像一个人，并且真正让你产生某种感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Are you um that it doesn't cross that threshold of actually sounding like a human and actually making you feel something. Then it shifted into Siri, which has kind of a bit of back and forth. that sounds more realistic, but again, it doesn't cross that threshold of actually sounding like a human and actually making you feel something.

</details>

### 语音作为新界面

**Interviewer**: Marty，非常高兴你能来到 **Anderson Haritz** 的总部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Marty, it's so great to have you here at the headquarters of Anderson Haritz.

</details>

**Marty**: 不，非常感谢你们的邀请。能来到这里，能一起谈论我们所做的一些工作，感觉太不可思议了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: No, thanks so much for having me. It's incredible to to be here and speak here together about some of the work we do.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 你曾说过，**语音**有望成为人类与计算机交互的下一个基础界面，就像键盘和触摸屏一样。请为我们描绘一下它的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: You have said voice is uh poised to become the next fundamental interface for humans interacting with computers just as mouth touch screens and keyboards. Help us imagine what it looks like.

</details>

**Marty**: 很多事情都是“屏幕优先”的。大多数人一天中大部分时间都会把笔记本电脑、手机放在眼前。我认为很多事情会转移到后台，让你能够更加身临其境。我想象一下，比如在未来的教室里学习，你戴着耳机，可以有最聪明的物理学家、数学家、历史学家来帮助你学习这门学科。这将是一个有趣的转变，语音将成为技术的重要组成部分。而今天，当你前往其他国家、体验其他文化时，如果你不懂语言，就无法完全沉浸其中。有了语音和技术，这突然就会成为可能，你可以说世界上任何一种语言，并完全理解，不仅理解说了什么，还理解它是如何说的，感觉更亲近。这将是一个令人难以置信的未来，真正的语言障碍，以及文化障碍或我们从未了解过的事物，都将变得可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: A lot of things are screen first. Most people will have the laptop, the phone most of the day in front of them. I think a lot of that will move into the background where where you will be able to be a lot more present. When I imagine say studying in a classroom in the future, you have on headphones you can have the most smart physicist, mathematician, a historian helping you through learning the the subject. There will be an interesting shift where voice will be a big part of the technology where today when you go to other countries, other cultures, you you cannot fully immerse inside the culture unless you know the language. And with voice and with technology suddenly this will will become possible where you can speak any language in the world and fully understand the not not only what is said but how it's said kind of feel a closer part which which will be just incredible future where the the true language barriers but also the cultural barriers or the things that we have never learned will become possible.

</details>

### ElevenLabs 的起源

**Interviewer**: 让我们从头开始。你和 **Peter** 在 **波兰** 长大。能告诉我们是什么经历激发了 **11 Labs** 的想法吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Let's start at the beginning. You and Peter grew up in Poland. Tell us the experience that sparked idea of 11 labs

</details>

**Marty**: 在波兰。如果你看一部外国电影，所有的声音，无论是男声还是女声，都是由一个单一的角色配音的。所以，一个声音说所有的台词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: in Poland. If you if you watch a foreign movie, all the voices where it's a male or female voice are narrated with one single character. So, one voice speaks all the lines.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 它们应该能让这一天……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: They ought to make the day that

</details>

**Interviewer**: 什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: what?

</details>

**Interviewer**: 嗯，现在是8点，不是个好日子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Well, it's 8:00 and it's not a good day.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 所有的情感、所有的语调都消失了。然后回到2021年，我们意识到这种情况仍然存在。K在 **Google** 工作，我在 **Palanteer** 工作。我们会在周末一起探索不同的项目，然后我们邀请了第一批用户，开始更深入地迭代，然后我们开始得到关于哪些用例会真正引起共鸣的良好信号。所以，当我们1月份推出时，我们已经有几千人排队等候，我们知道他们非常想使用这个产品。但当然，这几千人变成了几十万用户，这可能比我们最初预期的规模要大得多。推出了 **voice design V3**。推出了 **11 Labs** 的图像和视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: All the emotionality, all the inonation just just disappears. And then back in 2021, we realized that it's still happening. K was at Google, I was at Palanteer. We would explore different projects together on the weekends and we invited the first group of users then and started kind of iterating a little bit deeper and then we started getting good signal on what are some of the use cases that that that will really resonate. So when we launched in early January we already have a a few thousand people lined up that we knew are very interested in actually using the product but then of course the few thousand turned into a few hundred thousand of users and that was a magnitude probably higher than like we expected in the first order. Introducing voice design V3. Introducing 11 Labs image and video.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 自豪地推出 **studio 3.0**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Proudly introduces studio 3.0.

</details>

### 产品哲学与增长

**Interviewer**: 产品哲学的指导原则是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: What has been the guiding principle of the product philosophy?

</details>

**Marty**: 始终是结合了我们认为可以通过一些研究工作交付价值的地方，然后在此之上构建产品。第二，我们认为哪里存在真正的问题。有些公司有研究，有些公司有产品，而我们试图兼顾两者。我认为我们做到了，这很棒，因为产品可以直接与研究部门沟通，提供所需反馈，研究部门就能立即进行迭代。他们也可以直接在产品上测试他们的模型，通过这种方式，你知道，两者都在加速。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: It always was a combination of a where do we think we can deliver value with some of the research uh uh work but then layering the product on top. Two, where do we think there's actually real problem? Like there are companies who have the research, there are companies who have the product and we try to have the both and I think we have it's great because product can directly talk to the kind of provide the feedback what is needed to the research research then immediately is able to to iterate on that they can also test their models directly on the product and with this way you know it just like the both kind of accelerates.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 谈到团队，你们从最初的两个人发展到A轮融资时大约七个人，然后迅速发展到一年后几十人。你们是如何着手组建团队的？招聘时看重哪些品质？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Talking about the team you went from just the two of you around the pre time to I believe seven people when you're raising the series A and did the launch and then quickly to a few dozen a year later. How did you approach imbuing the team? What qualities are you looking for when you're hiring?

</details>

**Founder 2**: 我们在早期，尤其是在早期，从非常非传统的背景中招聘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Founder 2**: We were like, especially in the early days hiring from very non-traditional backgrounds.

</details>

**Team Member 1**: 我本科读的是**天体物理学**，硕士读的是**应用物理学**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Team Member 1**: So I did astrophysics in my undergrad and then applied physics in my masters.

</details>

**Founder 2**: 是的。我第一次见到 **Matty** 是在我们21岁时一起参加一个黑客马拉松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Founder 2**: Yeah. So I first met Mattie when we did a hackathon together when we were 21.

</details>

**Team Member 2**: 我当时在**白宫**为**总统拜登**工作，一位 **11 Labs** 的投资人告诉我，我应该尽我所能去那里工作。我一直很有野心，但我的大部分野心都花在了电子游戏上。我玩了大约12000小时的 **Dota** 之类的游戏。我在欧洲排行榜上排名大约是250名左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Team Member 2**: I was working at the White House for President Biden and an 11 Labs investor told me that I should do everything in my power to try to go work there. I was always pretty ambitious, but like most of my ambition I put into video games. I have like 12,000 hours of Dota or something. I was actually like ranked 250 or something on the on the European leaderboard.

</details>

**Founder 1**: 在早期，我们试图招聘那些能证明自己有卓越能力的人，他们做过什么，可以是一个开源项目，也可以是工作之外的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Founder 1**: We were like, especially in the early days trying to hire for some proof of excellence that that people would do and and it could be an open source project. It could be doing something outside of work.

</details>

**Team Member 3**: 是的，我当时在读硕士学位。我并没有真正去上大学。我当时在开发这个**文本转语音**项目，然后就像彼得一样，我通过吉他接触到了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Team Member 3**: Yeah, I was doing my master's degree. I wasn't really going to university much. I was developing this text of speech project and like kind of like Peter wore me through a guitar.

</details>

**Founder 2**: 我完成论文后，在网上发布了一个**音乐生成模型**的样本，P看到了这个例子并联系了我。我刚加入时，我们只有一个11个座位的房间。现在我们在11个以上的城市设有办事处，拥有300多名员工。我们每6个月翻一番。但因为我们是远程优先的，并且在非常小的团队中工作，拥有高度自主权，你实际上会忘记公司有多大。我们想雇佣世界上最优秀的人，我们认为世界上顶尖的研究者并不多，尤其是在语音领域，可能只有50到100人。所以我们想在哪里都能招到他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Founder 2**: When I finished my thesis, I posted online one of the samples of the music generation model and P saw this this example and contacted me. So when I first joined, we had a 11 desk room. Now we have offices in over 11 cities, over 300 employees. We're doubling every 6 months. But because we're remote first and we work in very small teams with high autonomy, you actually forget how big the company is. We wanted to hire the best people in the in the world and we don't think there's that many researchers in the world that are at that top level especially in in voice maybe 50 maybe 100. So we we wanted to hire wherever wherever they are.

</details>

### 公司文化与愿景

**Interviewer**: 如你所知，存在一种非常强烈的文化，即偏爱面对面交流。你如何对比这两种不同的模式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: There is as you know this like very strong cultural obsession to be in person. How do you contrast these two different setups?

</details>

**Founder 2**: 当我们开始时，我们的愿景非常全球化，无论是在我们想要创造的技术方面。我们希望它能跨越所有语言，跨越所有地理区域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Founder 2**: When we started the aspiration was very global both in in what we wanted to create as as a technology. We wanted to make it available across all languages, across all geographies.

</details>

**Marty**: **11 Labs** 在我加入时就有一种文化，我认为这也是吸引我的地方。我理解 **Matty** 和 **Peter** 对于他们想建立什么样的公司以及他们是什么样的人的愿景，而这基本上反映在文化中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: 11 Labs had a culture when I came in and I think that was also what enticed me. I understood the vision that Matty and Peter had for what type of company they want to build and the type of people that they are, which essentially is reflected in the culture.

</details>

**Investor**: **Matty** 和 **Peter** 是童年最好的朋友。他们非常了解彼此。他们都是了不起的运营者，并且非常值得信赖。老实说，真正让我们对投资这家公司感到兴奋的是与创始人 **Maddie** 和 **Podor**（可能是Matty和Peter的口误）的交谈。他们对未来世界可能的样子有一个非常独特的愿景，这是很多人还没有看到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Investor**: Matty and Peter, they're childhood best friends. They know each other super well. They're both incredible operators and they're high trust. Honestly, what really got us excited about investing in the company was was chatting with the founders, Maddie and and Podor. They had a really unique vision of like what the world could look like in the future that a lot of people didn't see yet.

</details>

**Marty**: Matty 和 Peter 就像是阴阳。Peter 非常专注于研究，他是这个领域的绝对天才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Matty and Peter are like ying and yang in a way. Peter is very focused on the research. He's an absolute genius in that space.

</details>

**Marty**: 和他一起工作非常好，因为他在技术上可以深入挖掘。我认识的第二聪明的人，比他聪明程度差远了。就这么说吧。有点像好警察坏警察。也许 Matthew 是好警察，Peter 是坏警察。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Working with him is is is very nice because he's is very technically can go very technically in depth. The second smartest person I know is significantly less smart than him. Like let's let's put it like that. It is a bit like good cop bad cop. Maybe maybe kind of like Matthew is the good cop and Peter as the bad cop.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 好的，我们先感谢你来到这里。你很难约到。你现在在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: Well, we'll start a little bit with uh thanking you for being here. You're hard guy to catch. So uh where are you today?

</details>

**Marty**: 我现在在 **迪拜**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Now I'm in Dubai.

</details>

**Interviewer**: 随着团队规模扩大和远程化，你的角色是如何演变的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: How has your role evolved as you became larger more remote team? Yeah, it's definitely you don't know all engineers which is definitely sad that you at some point you just will not know all these people in the company. Matthew knew everybody at the previous offsite already on on the previous offsite when there were 100 people already failed. If you have great people, there's very little effort needed to to run the company because you can just trust these many founders. People that that really take ownership and care about the company because you because you love working here and you love the product. When the product is built out of love, then users can see that

</details>

**Marty**: 是的，你肯定不认识所有的工程师了，这确实令人难过，因为你最终会不认识公司里的所有人。Matthew 在上次线下聚会时还认识所有人，那时公司有100人。如果你拥有优秀的人才，管理公司所需的精力就非常少，因为你可以完全信任这些创始人。那些真正承担责任并关心公司的人，因为你热爱在这里工作，热爱产品。当产品是出于热爱而构建时，用户就能感受到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Yeah, it's definitely you don't know all engineers which is definitely sad that you at some point you just will not know all these people in the company. Matthew knew everybody at the previous offsite already on on the previous offsite when there were 100 people already failed. If you have great people, there's very little effort needed to to run the company because you can just trust these many founders. People that that really take ownership and care about the company because you because you love working here and you love the product. When the product is built out of love, then users can see that

</details>

**Marty**: 大家都有很高的自主性。低官僚主义，非常扁平、模糊的层级。他们会做任何需要做的事情来为客户取得进展并快速交付。我们取消了所有的头衔，这最初是一种很好的方式来筛选掉那些非常没有个人英雄主义的人。所以，如果你进来时想着“我想成为XX的副总裁”，你不会得到这个头衔。这实际上会把那些人挡在外面。但我认为这是一件好事。没有隐性偏见，可以随意提问、寻求帮助、给出建议或提出想法，因为没有明确的层级。你可以获得一个训练集群的访问权限，并训练你构思的模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: everyone's very high autonomy. They're low bureaucracy, very flat, fuzzy hierarchy. They're doing whatever is needed to move the needle for the customers to ship quickly. We removed all the titles and it's a great way both initially of filtering for people who are very low ego. And so if you're coming in, yes, I want to be VP of blahy blah, you're not going to get VP. And so it actually will turn off those people. But I'd argue that's a good thing. No implicit bias of asking a question or asking for help or giving advice to someone or proposing ideas because there's no explicit hierarchy. Get access to a training cluster and train a model that you have an idea for.

</details>

**Marty**: 我们在引入任何人之前，都会进行严格的筛选以确保文化契合。我认为这对于能够快速扩展并仍然保持文化至关重要。事实上，当我第一次公开谈论此事，我们推出了取消头衔的想法时，我的一位前同事联系我说：“我听说你们取消了头衔。我喜欢这个想法。你们有什么职位？我想加入。”她现在负责招聘，取得了巨大的成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: We are apply rigorous screen for ensuring a cultural fit before we bring someone in. And I think that's essential to being able to scale this quickly and still preserve culture. In fact, when I first spoke about this publicly and we we kind of launched the idea that we got rid of titles, I had someone that I used to work with reach out and she said like, "I heard that you got rid of titles. I love that notion. What roles do you have? I want to join." And she's now leading hiring, incredibly successful.

</details>

### AI 音频的未来

**Marty**: 目前，我们有专门针对音频、音效和音乐的模型。我认为声音的未来将是拥有一个能够生成任何类型音频的模型。你可以想象看到一些声音被转换成音乐，或者像唱歌一样，将歌声变成音效。我们为自己设定的新挑战是：我们能否成为第一家跨越“声音图灵测试”的公司？如何创造一个真正听起来像人类，你可以与之进行来回互动，但又超级聪明、超级富有同情心的AI？我认为会有一个时刻，我们与机器的大部分交流将通过音频进行，因为音频沟通更快，而且信息更丰富。现在有些东西是机器或 **LLMs** 无法捕捉的。如果你用文本训练模型，你基本上是在使用人类创建的文本单元（tokens）；而如果你训练一个通用的音频生成模型，你是在原始音频上进行训练。如果你能创建一个在音频方面很智能的模型，你就可以想象你可以创建一个在任何原始数据领域都很智能的模型。我认为这是最有趣的事情之一。声音是唯一能真正让你产生情感的AI模态。所以，当你拥有文本时，是的，你可以写一首诗或一个故事，但它不会给你带来同样的情感体验。而当你听到一个声音时，无论是像 **ASMR** 的耳语声，还是深沉的、震撼的电影配音，它都能真正地将你带入其中，让你感觉充满活力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Currently, we have specialized models for audio, for sound effects, and for music. And I think the future of sound is kind of like having one model which can generate any kind of audio. You could imagine seeing something with voice that is converted to music or like singing something changing the the singing into sound effects. The new challenge we've really set ourselves is can we be the first company to cross this threshold of the vocal cheuring test. How do you have an AI which really sounds like a human that you can interact back and forth with but is super smart, super empathetic? I think there's going to be a point where most of the communicate we do with machine might be through audio because one is faster to communicate but also because it's more information rich. There's things now that machines or LLMs are not capturing. If you train a model on text, you're basically using text units tokens that are uh created by humans where if you train a general audio generation model, you're training on on raw audio. If you can make a model that is smart in audio, you can imagine you can make a model that is smart in any raw data domain. That I think is one of the most interesting things. Voice is the only AI modality that can actually make you feel something. And so when you have text, yes, you can have a poem or a story, but it doesn't give you that same kind of emotive feel. Well, as when you hear a voice, whether it's like a ASMR whispering voice or whether it's a deep booming cinematic voice, it can really kind of transport you and make you feel make you feel alive.

</details>

### 个人驱动力

**Interviewer**: 我喜欢用这个问题结束对话。是什么驱动你个人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Interviewer**: I love to end the conversation with this question. What drives you personally?

</details>

**Marty**: 看到人们的反应绝对是其中最美好的时刻之一。但我感觉自己处于一个非常幸运的位置，我能和我的好朋友们一起创业。现在感觉我们拥有一个了不起的团队，介于运动队和家庭之间，每个人都怀揣着同样的热情和愿景。但我想，尤其是现在，你很少有机会成为变革的代言人或技术的代言人，并站在前沿，定义语音将如何成为我们周围每个人的界面。这是一个创造……的机会，我们很幸运也很高兴能参与其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marty**: Definitely seeing people react is is one of the always the best moments. But I I feel like I'm in just such a lucky position where you know I can I can work on a company with my best friends. But now it feels like we have this this incredible team of somewhere between sports team to family where just everybody is driving on the same passion and and and and vision. But I think now especially it's it's just so rare that you get a chance to be the voice of the change or voice of the technology and be able to be at the frontier and and define how voice will be that interface for everybody around us. It's just such an unique opportunity to to create a bike that uh that we are lucky and happy to to be able to to be part of it.
