### 早年经历与职业起步

**Nicolai Tangen**: 大家好。我是挪威主权财富基金的 CEO **Nicolai Tangen**。今天我在纽约的 **Bloomberg L.P.**（彭博社）办公室。通常我来这里是见记者或主播，但今天我要见的是这位传奇人物本人——**Michael Bloomberg**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Hi everyone. I'm Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm in New York and I'm in the Bloomberg offices. Now, normally when I'm in the Bloomberg offices, I see a journalist or an anchor, but today I'm seeing the man himself, Michael Bloomberg.

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我非常小心地避免成为一名记者。[笑] 如果你想拥有优秀的新闻报道，唯一不能做的就是自己介入新闻工作。所以，有一个叫 John Micklethwait 的人在负责这块业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I'm very careful to not be a journalist. [laughter] Um, the one thing you can't do is get involved in the journalism if you're going to have good journalism. So, there's one guy, John Micklethwait, who runs it.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Mike，你在美国商界有着非凡的经历：创办彭博社，担任了12年的市长，并成为最重要的慈善家之一。也许我们可以从头回顾一下……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Mike, uh, you just have one of the most extraordinary journeys in American business, starting uh, Bloomberg, being mayor for 12 years, being one of the most important philanthropists. And so perhaps we can just go all the way back the day that you...

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我很小的时候就出生了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I was born at an early age.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 噢是的，你确实是。[笑] 不，让我们从 **Salomon Brothers**（所罗门兄弟）开始吧。奇怪的是，你在某个阶段被解雇了，然后第二天你就创办了彭博社。你当时是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Oh yeah, you would [laughter] absolutely. Uh, no, let's start with Salomon Brothers because Bloomberg, you know, strangely enough, you were at some stage laid off and then the next day you started Bloomberg. So what do you what do you think then?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我在马萨诸塞州长大。父亲是个记账员，他一生中最好的一年赚了6000美元。我是个童子军。我是个拿C的学生，我总是说“能在班里排进前一半就是可能的”，这是我的口头禅。当我从学校毕业时，我从大学直接去了哈佛商学院，我很幸运能被录取。

但在我准备毕业时，我以为我会去越南。那是1966年，我们卷入了那场战争。那是一场非常残酷的战争，我们在很多方面对待被征召入伍并被送去冒生命危险的士兵非常糟糕。有些人装在盒子里回来了，有些人比较幸运没有死，但我们对待他们的方式很糟糕。

所以我报名参军了。我可以获得陆军少尉的委任。我以为当少尉比当列兵更安全。结果并非如此，因为少尉要带头冲过铁丝网进入丛林，[哼笑] 很多人因此阵亡。结果在最后一刻，就在毕业前一个月，因为我有完全的扁平足，而他们不收扁平足的人，所以我突然不用去越南了，但我完全没想过我的职业生涯要做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Um, I was, uh, grew up in Massachusetts. Father was a bookkeeper, made $6,000, the best year of his life. Uh, I was a boy scout. I, uh, was a C student. I always made the top half of the class possible is my gagline. And, um, when I was getting out of school, I went from college to business school at Harvard. I was lucky enough to get in. Uh but um when I was ready to graduate, I thought I was going to go to Vietnam partially. We were involved in that war. This was in 1966. A very nasty war in a very nasty ways. Americans treated the troops who we drafted and sent over to risk their lives. Some of them came back in boxes and some were lucky enough and didn't. But we were just treating people terribly. And so I signed up to go. I could get a commission as a second lieutenant in the army. I thought you'd be safer as a second lieutenant than as a private. Turns out not because the second lieutenants led the charge over the barb wire going out into the jungle and [snorts] a lot of them were killed. It turns out at the last minute, one month before graduation, I have perfectly flat feet and they didn't take anybody with flat feet. And so all of a sudden I wasn't going to go to Vietnam and had not thought at all about what I was going to do with my career.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 然后你就进了银行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Oh. And then you went into banking.

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我问了我的一个朋友 Steve Fenster，他是个非常聪明的人，不幸死于癌症。我问 Steve：“我该做什么？”他说：“去华尔街。”我说：“那在哪？他们是做什么的？”他说：“去就是了。”我问：“我该给谁打电话？”他说：“打给 Salomon Brothers 和 **Goldman Sachs**（高盛）。”我说：“那是什么？他们是谁？”他说：“照做就是了。”

所以我给两家都打了电话。一家给我寄了机票，一家给我寄了从波士顿到纽约的火车票。两家都给了我录用通知。一家提供年薪14,000美元，另一家提供9,000美元。我更喜欢那家给9,000美元的公司里的人，仅仅是因为那天我碰巧遇到的人。[哼笑]

我对那里的负责人说：“听着，这是我的预算。每月5美元用于地铁、报纸和食物，125美元用于房租。我没法以9,000美元的薪水为你工作。”他说：“你需要多少，孩子？”我快速算了一下，取了个中间值。我说：“11,500美元。”他说：“行。9,000美元薪水，2,500美元贷款。”然后他起身走出了房间。

我不知道我是否有工作了，但我假设我有。一个月后我毕业入职了。然后在财年结束的9月30日，我拿到了500美元奖金，并且贷款被免除了。第二年，我拿到了2,000美元奖金，贷款也被免除了。最后结果很好。不用为我感到难过。

但我永远不会忘记，人们常犯的一个错误是去薪水最高的地方工作。尤其是当你年轻的时候，那不是生活的重点。你必须获得经验，你必须建立友谊，你必须尝试事物，看看什么行得通，什么行不通。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Um I asked a friend of mine, Steve Fenster, was very smart guy since unfortunately died of cancer. And Steve uh I said, "What should I do?" He said, "Go to Wall Street." I said, "Where is that? What do they do?" Said, "Just do it." I said, "Who do I call?" He said, "Call Solomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs." I said, "What's that? Who are they?" just do it. So I called both. One sent me down with an airplane ticket. One sent me down with a train ticket from Boston to New York. And uh both of them made me an offer. One offered $14,000 a year, the other $9,000 a year. I liked the people at the $9,000 one better, just who I happened to meet that day. [snorts] And I said to the head guy, "Look, here's my budget. $5 for Subway and newspapers and food, $125 for rent every month. I can't afford to go to work for you for $9,000. Um, we said, "How much do you need, kid?" And I did the math quickly and I split the difference. I said, "115." And he said, "Fine. $9,000 salary, $2500 loan." And he got up and he walked out of the room. And I didn't know if I had a job or not, but I assumed I did. And uh came in and uh month later when I finished school and then there was a bonus at the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, I got $500 bonus, forgiveness of the loan. The next year, I got a $2,000 bonus, forgiveness of the loan. Now, in the end, it worked out fine. Don't feel sorry for me. But I'll never forget that people make the mistakes of going to work for a place where they get paid the most. And that's not particularly when you're young. That's not what life's about. You've got to get experience. You've got to build friendships. You've got to try things and see what works and what doesn't.

### 创立彭博社与产品哲学

**Nicolai Tangen**: 现在的年轻人都关注错了重点。他们会问：我的职位是什么？我的头衔是什么？我有职称吗？当你25岁刚毕业时，这不应该是你关注的重点。但你把在 Salomon 获得的所有经验都投入到了彭博社的创业中。你是怎么想出这个点子的？因为在当时这可是相当革命性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: And all these young people just looking at the wrong thing. What is my position? What am I going to be called? Do I have a title or what? when you're 25 years old and you're getting out of school, not where you should focus. No. But you took all the experience you had from Salmon and kind of put that into the the startup of uh Bloomberg. Now, how did you come up with the idea because it was quite revolutionary at the time.

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我曾在交易台工作，我们有几个屏幕。屏幕显示股票或债券的价格，显示最近的交易或估值，以及涨跌箭头或不同的颜色。但桌上没有任何东西能让你利用这些数据做你需要做的事。人们从没想过这一点。比如，我为什么需要这些数据？我想画个图表，我想做个计算，我想发个信息，诸如此类的事情。

计算机可以做到这些，但没人把它们整合在一起。所以我想，为什么我们不造一台计算机来做这件事呢？请记住，我在做这件事的时候，个人电脑（PC）还没发明。没人相信在苹果公司之前还有这段历史。我想拥有一台计算机，但它们不存在。所以我雇了一位工程师 Ron Harris，一个很好、很聪明的人。我会周六去他的谷仓，他在那里设了一个小实验室。我会焊接电容、电阻和电路板，我们制造了自己的计算机。

快进到两年后，PC 被发明了，他们说：“我们要退出 PC 硬件业务。那不是我们擅长的，我们不可能在这里竞争。”所以我们就买了一些最早的 PC，把旧东西扔了，剩下的就是历史了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I had worked on a trading desk and we had a couple of screens. The screen showed the prices of either stocks or bonds and it showed the last sale or the valuation and it showed uh plus or minus an arrow or a different color that but there was nothing on your desk that told you that let you do what you needed that data for. And people never didn't think about that. Well, why would I need the data? I want my draw a graph. I want to do a calculation. uh I want to send a message any of those kinds of things and um the computer could do it but nobody had put it together so I thought why don't we build a computer to do it now keep keep in mind when I was doing this PCs have not been invented then nobody believes that there was there was a date before Apple and they didn't uh we wanted I wanted to have a computer but they didn't exist So I hired an engineer, Ron Harris, nice, very smart guy, and I would go up on Saturdays and work in his barn. He had a little lab set up, and I'd solder in the compa capacitors and resistors and the circuit boards, and we made our own computers. Now, fast forward till two years later when PCs were invented, and they said, "We're getting out of the PC business. That's not what we do well. that's not we could couldn't possibly compete in here and so we just bought some p the first few of the first PCs and junk the other stuff and the rest is history.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 如果你走进我们在纽约的办公室，你会看到到处都是 **Bloomberg Terminal**（彭博终端机）屏幕。为什么你会如此成功？为什么彭博社如此成功？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now uh if you come into our offices in New York you will see uh Bloomberg screens all over the place. Why have you been so successful? Why has Bloomberg been so successful?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我认为我们专注于构建有用的东西。不要试图把它变成它不是的东西。当时确实有需求。没人真的认为在中间放一台我刚才描述的那种计算机是有用的。等到我们做成的时候——那是在我们真正拥有客户之前的三年——别人想追赶已经太晚了。

从那时起，有很多人拥有好的产品，但他们只能做我们能做的10到20件事中的一两件。现实世界是你必须有许多不同的输入，并能够适应不同类型的客户和不同的市场。我们只是专注于构建我们能做的最好的东西，而不一定总是去问客户想要什么。我总是会问，客户的意见也很有价值，但这并不意味着他们能够从“我们可以用计算机做什么”这个角度来思考问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I think we focused on doing building something that was useful. Um, didn't try to make it into something that it wasn't. Um, there was a need. Nobody really thought that having that computer in the middle that I just described uh was useful. And by the time it was done, which was 3 years before we really had a customer, um it was too late for anybody to catch up. Now, since then, there are plenty of people who have good products, but they only do one or two of the 10 20 things that we do. And the real world is you've got to have lots of different inputs and be able to adjust to different kinds of customers and different markets and that sort of thing. and we just focused on building the best thing we could and not necessarily always ask uh listening to what the customers want. Um I've always asked and customers can be very valuable but that doesn't mean they are able to think in the terms of what we could do with a computer for example.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 那么，有哪些东西是你放进计算机里，而他们甚至不知道自己需要的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So so what what are some of the things you put into the computer which which they didn't know that they needed?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 就债券而言，你放入到期日，也许还有赎回日——虽然一开始甚至没有这个——还有票息和今天的日期，然后有一个公式可以用来计算该证券在给定收益率下的价格，反之亦然。我们只是不断增加功能，没有提高价格。我们坚持去和人们坐在一起，问他们想要什么，并观察他们尝试使用我们的产品。

我永远不会忘记一个好故事。Glenn Wallner，我们的员工之一，非常聪明、高大、友善的人。他要去给像你这样领导大机构的人做演示，并让我一起去。好的，我很乐意。我们到了那里，那时候我们还在使用彭博自制的硬件。所以他搬进来一个装有阴极射线管（显示器）的箱子，一个装有计算机主机的箱子，一个装有键盘的箱子，还有一个装有电源的箱子。他插上所有这些电线。大家围坐着看他做这些。

然后他转向我说：“该死，我忘了带电源线。”我当时真想揍他一顿。经过这一切，我们终于得到了这家银行的介绍机会——我忘了是哪家了——他却要搞砸了，因为他没带电源线。

但别担心。我有我的公文包，他拿出了打印好的我们制作的每一个屏幕的副本，展示给他们看。大家都对此大笑了一场。他们买账了，订购了几台计算机，两三台吧，也许不多，就在当时当地。但这个故事的重点是那种准备工作，那种愿意坚持下去、不让小事阻碍的精神。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: You put in the terms of in the case of a bond the maturity date and maybe a call date but at the beginning it wasn't even that and a coupon and uh and and today's date and then there's a formula you can use to calculate the price of that the security at a given yield or vice versa. Um uh we uh uh just kept adding functionality, didn't increase the price. Um kept uh uh going and sitting with people and asking them what they wanted and watching them try to use what we had. I'll never forget there's a it's a good story. There's a Glenn Walner, one of our employees, really smart, tall, nice guy. um he was going to give a demonstration to somebody like you who headed a big organization and asked me to come along. Fine, like to do so. Um we get there and in those days we were still using the Bloomberg built hardware. So he brings in this box with a rate cathode ray tube in it, the the picture thing. And then there was one that had the computer in it. And there was one that had the keyboard in it and one that had the power supply in it. And he plugs in all these wires. And everybody's sitting around watching him doing this. And then he turns to me and he says, "Darn it, I forgot the power cord. I just wanted to take a swing at him." After all of this, we finally got an introduction to this bank. I forget who it was and he was going to blow it because he didn't don't worry about it at all. I've got my openness briefcase and he took out he had printed out copies of every single screen that we produced and could show it to them and everybody had a good laugh about it. They bought in they ordered a couple computers or two or three maybe not more uh right then and there. But the point of the story is it's that kind of preparation, that kind of willingness to keep going and not to let little things get in the way.

### 工作伦理与企业文化

**Nicolai Tangen**: 在你的书中，你谈到了重要的文化方面，其中之一就是要比别人更努力工作（outwork other people）。这就是一个例子，对吧？在实践中，比别人更努力工作意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: And in your book, um, you talk about the important cultural aspects and one of them is to outwork other people. And this is an example of that, right? What does it mean in practice to outwork other people?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 意思是你不说“不”。你不放弃。你在生活中保持平衡。你仍然希望能够出去，拥有生活和家庭。所以这是在努力工作与足够的休息时间之间取得平衡，以免精疲力竭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Well, you don't say no. You don't give up. Um, you put a balance in life. you still want to be able to go out and, you know, have a life, a family. Uh so it it's balancing hard work with enough um time off to not get worn out or that sort of thing.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你现在83岁了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: But you are So when are you now? You are now 83, right?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 83岁，很高兴能到这个岁数，我的目标是活到84岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 83 and happy to be at my ambition is to be 84.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你还在办公室工作吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Are you still in the office?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 大多数日子都在。我最近有些周五会休息，这有点尴尬，但基本上我喜欢来公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Uh, most days I've been taking some Fridays off, which is a little bit embarrassing, but yes, fundamentally I like to come in.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你早上什么时候到这里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: When are you here in the morning?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我自动在5:15起床。即使我不设闹钟，我也可能会醒。我和女朋友都起床。我洗个澡，每周和教练做几次运动，然后去上班，我最晚7点到这里，也许还会早一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I get up at 5:15 automatically. If I didn't even set the alarm, I probably would. Girlfriend and I both get up. Uh, I take a shower, do some exercises with a trainer a couple times a week, and then go to work, and I'm here by 7 at the latest, maybe a little bit earlier.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 这是彭博社每个人都有的工作伦理吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Is this the kind of work ethic which everybody in Bloomberg has?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 很多人都有。这里的人员流失率非常低。这里的人喜欢待在这里。至少他们是这么告诉我的，而且在我看来确实如此。当我去拜访客户时，我总是会带上几个销售人员或者一两个工程师，我会说，我对他们受到的良好训练和专注程度印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: an awful lot do. People here, we have very low attrition rate. Uh, people here like to be here. Um, at least they tell me they do and I think it looks to me like they do. And when I go to visit a customer, I'll always take along a few salesmen or maybe an engineer or two and I will say I am just impressed with how welltrained they are and how focused they are in a nice ways.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你也谈到了承担风险和鼓励人们承担风险的重要性。这是指什么类型的风险？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: You also talk about the importance of taking risks and encouraging people to take risks. What type of

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 你必须尝试事物。你知道，这可能是一个愚蠢的想法，但也可能行得通。当然，你不能做所有愚蠢的想法，也不是所有的想法都会成功。但仅仅因为它不合常规，并不意味着你不应该尝试一下。

当有人来找我，他们想尝试某件事时，我们会尝试。我可能不相信它会成功，我会试着问问题，让他们向我解释发生了什么。但如果他们有一种直觉认为这会成功，你要鼓励他们。即使我是对的，它没有成功，如果你在这里尝试了某件事但失败了，你可以回去，我会确保人们看到我和你走在一起讲笑话。我想让人们明白，如果事情不成功，你不会受到惩罚。恰恰相反，你尝试过这一事实是一个加分项，这将有助于你的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Well, you have to try things. Um, you know, it's a stupid idea, but maybe it might work. Now, you can't do all the stupid ideas and not all of them will work. But just because it's not conventional doesn't mean you shouldn't take the shot and do it. Um, uh, when somebody comes to me and they want to try something, we'll try it. I don't can't believe it's going to work. And I try to ask questions and show explain to me what's going on. But um if they have a gut feeling that that they can that it's going to work, you want to encourage them. Even if I'm right and it doesn't work, if you try something here and it doesn't work, you can go back and I'll make sure that you and I are seen walking together telling a joke to each other. I want people to understand it's not you don't have a penalty if things don't work. Quite the contrary, the fact that you tried is a plus and that's going to help your career.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 有些人为了省钱把办公室设在便宜的地方，而你把它们设在最昂贵的地方，而且你建造了很棒的办公室。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Some people put uh their offices in cheap places to save money whilst you put them in the most expensive places and and you make great offices.

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 这很有趣。我每天在报纸上读到，又有一家公司要用人工智能来摆脱那些薪水不高、负责处理客户事务的人。我上次检查时，真正重要的群体是你的客户，你不想减少对他们的服务。

物理位置也是一样。我希望你来办公室。我永远不会忘记我们第一次在东京开设办公室时。我们雇了一个人，当时我也在那里，但他直到父母来看过办公室并批准后才能开始工作。那是在一家酒店或办公楼里的一个破旧的小地方，名字早就忘了。但我相信你要让人们喜欢他们正在做的事，为他们正在做的事感到自豪。

这家公司最重要的资产是它的员工。因此，你当然希望提供尽可能好的设施。你不必疯狂铺张，但你可以找到让人们为工作地点感到自豪的东西。他们可以带朋友来，带着某种羡慕说：“看，这就是我们，我们与众不同。”

我一直试图提供最好的设施。昨天我们的一名员工遭遇了一场与醉酒司机的正面碰撞。她说断了七根骨头。今天早上我在医院给她打了电话。她的丈夫在那里，我表达了慰问，并向他们保证我们的保险政策——你不可能在保险上花比我们更多的钱，它涵盖了一切。他们不应该为此担心。当然，我们的人力资源部门已经联系过并去过了，他们知道如何照顾员工。

我们有26,000名员工。如果你有26,000人，可能每周都会有人或者他们的配偶、孩子受伤或死亡。这些电话我总是亲自打。有时我必须在电话里用翻译，因为我不碰巧会说他们的语言。这只是向所有人表明，我认为、管理层认为、你的同事也认为你是有价值的，你是一个好人，我们在一起，我们将一起取得成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Well, it's fascinating. I read in the paper every day, another company is going to use AI to get rid of the people who aren't paid very much, who deal with their customers. Last time I checked, the really important group was your customers, and you don't want to pull away from giving as much service to them as you can. Uh, same thing with the loca with the physical location. I want you to come into the office and that sort of thing. I'll never forget the first time we opened an office in Tokyo. We hired one guy and I was there at the time and he couldn't start until his parents came to see the office and approve it. Now, it was a dumpy little thing in a hotel in a an office building or something and long since lost the name, but um I I'm a believer that you want to have people like what they're doing, be proud of what they're doing. Um the most important asset this company has is its employees. So for that reason, you certainly want to provide as good facilities as you can. Now, you don't have to go crazy, but you can find things to make people proud of where they work. Um that they can bring their friends in and some envy saying, "Look, this is what we're we're different." Um, and [clears throat] it's, you know, I've been doing it for 44 years with the exception of 12 years I went to city hall in the middle. And, uh, we've I've always tried to get the best facilities. One of our employees yesterday was in a head-on collision with a drunken driver. Uh, seven broken bones, she said. Um, and I called her this morning in the hospital. her husband was there, expressed my condolences, assured them that our insurance policy, you can't spend more on insurance than we do. It covers everything. Um, and they shouldn't worry about that. They, of course, our HR department had already contacted, been over, and they know how to take care of people. But we have 26,000 employees. Yeah. But so you got 26,000 people and you call somebody who's in an accident. Uh if you have 26,000 people, you're probably going to have somebody that either they or their spouse or their ch child is injured or dies every week. And those calls I always make. Sometimes I have to have a translator on the phone because they I don't happen to speak whatever the language they do. It just says to everybody that I consider and the management considers and your co-workers consider that you're valuable and that you're a nice person and that we're in this together and uh we're going to have success together.

### 市政管理与公共服务

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你还有哪些其他的领导原则？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What are some of the other leadership principles that you have?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 你当然要照顾你的人。你要给他们向上流动的机会。我总是对他们说，当我说“那是谁建的”时，不要说“我”，要说“我们”或者“是他做的，我很幸运能帮助他”。大家都知道你在撒谎，但有两件事：第一，他们会更看重你，因为你把功劳给了别人；第二，那个男人或女人现在欠你一个人情，[笑] 所以这会回报给你的。我认为这就是把人当人看，理解他们也有抱负，也有恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: You certainly take care of your people. You give them a chance to have upward mobility. Um, you know, I'd talk to you and I'd say, uh, you say, you know, you're happy where you are. Great. Uh, you say, you know, but you'd like to move. Okay. Do a good job here and that'll be the end of the road. And they're not going to guarantee you when, but you've got to do the job now. Um, and I always say to them when I say who built that, [clears throat] don't say me, say I or whatever. Say, um, oh, uh, he did it. I was lucky enough to help him. Now, everybody knows you're lying, but two things. One, they think better of you because you've given credit elsewhere. And number two, that other guy or woman owes you something now, [laughter] so you'll get it'll come around. But I just I think it's treating people as human beings and understanding what they that they have aspirations as well and they have fears and

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你为什么决定竞选市长？

<details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Why did you decide to run for mayor?

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我真的很恼火，因为你总是读到关于教育无能为力的报道，孩子们被亏待了。实际上是教师工会的问题，我理解教师工会，他们的存在是为了保护教师，而不是学生。我理解这一点，但必须有人站出来为孩子们说话。民选官员往往不这样做，因为教师工会非常擅长建立联系，让民选官员认为教师工会在他们的连任中拥有很大的发言权，而这才是官员们真正关心的。

考试成绩在下降，每个人都说你对此无能为力。我心想，那不是真的。我认为你可以做点什么。出于这个原因，我决定参选。每个人都以为我疯了，没人认为我有机会。那是当时的运气。你遇到了合适的对手，他不是一个很强的候选人，你就这样幸运地当选了。在那12年里，纽约的平均预期寿命增加了3岁。

**Michael Bloomberg**: I think it somebody asked me that recently and I think it is I was really annoyed that you kept reading that you couldn't do anything about education and the kids were getting short the it was the teachers unions really that which I understand the teachers union they're to defend not the students they're there to they are there to defend the teachers and I understand that but somebody's got to stand up for the kids and the elected officials tend not to because the teachers unions are very good at establishing contacts and making the the the elected officials think that the teachers union has a great deal of say in their reelection which is what they really care about. So um I we the the test scores were going down and everybody said you couldn't do anything about it and I thought to myself that's not that's not true. I think you could do something about it. And out of that, I decided I'd run. Everybody thought I was crazy. Nobody thought I had a chance. Um, it was the luck of the drawer at that point in time. You had the right opponent who wasn't very u much of a candidate or whatever, but uh and and you just got lucky and got elected. So during those 12 years, the average living age in New York increased by three years.

**Nicolai Tangen**: 经营一家公司和管理一座城市的主要区别是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What's the main difference of difference between running a company and running a city?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我认为大多数原则几乎是一样的。如果你是所有者，你可以做任何你想做的事；但在处理公共事务时，你必须明白你不是所有者。但是，如果你向公众解释问题是什么，你打算如何解决它，并且你把你的职业生涯押在上面，随着事情的成功建立信誉，你能改变的事情是惊人的。

我说服了教师工会支持我们，延长了上学时间等等。这并不容易，而且非常昂贵，因为他们希望为此增加工资。但我们做到了。我们派了一名社会工作者和一名警察去找那个睡在门阶上的人，说服他们进来，我们给他们洗澡，给他们一些衣服，给他们一张床睡觉，然后送他们回家。因为很多无家可归的人离家出走是因为争吵，他们不知道如何回去。我认为有这样的解决方案。

我们证明了考试成绩可以提高。这里的黑人和拉丁裔孩子与白人和亚裔孩子之间存在差距。没人能消除这个差距。我们把差距缩小了一半。这不是通过把顶层拉下来，而是通过把底层提上去。

**Michael Bloomberg**: I think most of the principles are pretty much the same. um you uh cannot be as uh free to do anything you want if you're the you can do it if you're the owner. You have to understand you're not the owner in the case of uh the dealing with the public. But the public if you explain to them what the problem is and how you're going to fix it and you put your career on the line for them and then build credibility as things work. Um, it's amazing how you can change things. I convinced the teachers union to go along with us and lengthen the school day and that sort of thing. Wasn't easy and it was very expensive because they wanted to have their salaries grossed up for it. But we went and we got we sent a social worker and a and a police officer to that person sleeping on the doorstep. convinced them to come in and we'll give them a shower, give them some clothing, um give them a bed to sleep in and then take them home because an awful lot of the homeless have left home and they don't in an argument and they don't know how to get back in and I think there's solutions like that um testing and we showed that test scores would go up. There was a gap between black and Latino kids here and white and Asian kids here. And nobody could get rid of that gap. It stayed the same. Went up and down a little bit based on other things. We cut the gap in half. And it wasn't by bringing the top down. It was by bringing the bottom up.

### 慈善事业与社会责任

**Nicolai Tangen**: 这让我们谈到了你对慈善事业的承诺。这源于哪里？因为你现在已经捐赠了超过200亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: And could we have done more after 12 years? Maybe. I don't know. Um, but it brings us to your commitment [clears throat] to philanthropy. Where where did that come from? because you have now given away more than 20 billion.

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我记得我父亲，我们在餐桌上谈论慈善。我母亲为一个帮助以色列人民的组织筹款。我为童子军割草坪来为他们筹款，卖圣诞花环，铲雪。我想这是在家里养成的，我们当然会谈论慈善。

然后，你知道，我处于一个令人羡慕的位置。我不需要另一套高尔夫球杆，但我确实想获得那种满足感——也许是挽救某人的生命，或者帮助一个孩子接受教育，或者治愈一种疾病。那是令人兴奋的事情。如果你坐在那里，在你闭上眼睛睡觉之前，你会想，没有多少人做过这些事，而我想做。

我已经照顾好了我的孩子们。他们都非常热衷于慈善。他们都因为我的前妻——她仍然是我最好的朋友之一——而创办了自己的慈善机构。他们每年都会捐出自己的一部分钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I remember my father we we talked about philanthropy around the dinner table when that that rotation of who was going to do the talking at my house that I talked about. Um my mother collected money for an organization had which helped people in Israel and I I cut lawns for the Boy Scouts to raise money for them. uh sold Christmas wreaths for for them. Um shoveled snow for them. Finally, after a number of bad starts, I realized you got to put know which way the plow's coming and put the snow on the upside, not the [laughter] plow back in. Um but I think it was at home. We talked about charity certainly. And then, you know, I'm in an enviable position. I I don't need another set of golf clubs, but I do want to have the satisfaction of maybe saving somebody's life or uh helping a kid get an education or curing a disease or uh that's heady stuff. If you sit there and you before you close your eyes and go to bed, it's like, you know, aren't very many people have done those things and I'd like to do it. Um [snorts] I've taken care of my children. They are both very philanthropic. They both have charities of their own they've started because of my former wife who's still one of my best friends and I talked about it all the time. Um they give away part of their own money uh every year.

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你如何决定把钱分配到哪里，给谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: How do you decide on where to allocate the money, who to give to?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 有一点取决于谁来问你，或者谁把需求带到你的注意中。我这里有很多朋友，他们捐出了巨额的个人财产。当他们打电话说“我支持这个”时，我们会尝试。或者像 Bill Gates，他说“我们可以消灭脊髓灰质炎”，如果能做到那就太神奇了。他在取得进展，需要一些帮助，所以我很高兴能和他们一起做点什么。我不知道，我们给了1亿美元，又给了1亿美元。

我们还致力于反对非法枪支。John Feinblatt 负责这项工作，他们在通过法律方面发挥了很大作用，比如要求你有许可证，或者不卖给未成年人。我不反对拥有枪支的权利，但让孩子拥有枪支绝对是令人愤慨的。而且，如果你家里有枪，你被那把枪杀死的可能性是家里没枪时的20倍。

我们还资助了一颗新卫星来寻找甲烷。甲烷甚至比煤炭更糟糕。现在你可以看到它从地下冒出来。通常是在钻探石油时。然后我们会打电话说：“看，你可以卖掉那些甲烷并从中赚钱。”大多数人并没有意识到这一点，他们愿意配合。我们已经关闭了欧洲一半以上的燃煤电厂，我想大约是美国75%的燃煤电厂。所以这非常成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: A little bit of it is who asks you or brings the need to your attention. So I have a number of friends here who give away enormous quantities of their their own money and when they call and say I'm supporting this. we're going to try to or Bill Gates for example, I want to we can end polio it if it would be amazing if you could do it and he was making progress and he needed some help and so be happy to do something with them and I don't know we gave $100 million and another $100 million. Um we still there's still polio in a couple of countries and it's why do they do it? because Gates can explain what he's doing and it's a good idea and when I have want to do something that I think is a good idea, I'll call him and he'd be happy to help in the same ways and I have a number of friends like that. But um they just have this belief that you can make the world a better place because I at least in my case I get pleasure out of it. I mean, it's really nice to be able to Yeah. And I don't go around bragging to to people about it. I just uh it's nice to be able to say I did something. There's a woman who's been with me for 30 years, Patty Harris. She runs the foundation and uh we Alli Jaffen with her and there's about 350 people there because when we make a gift, we follow up and make sure you do what you promised. And I just in fact bought another building just down the street because we're going to run out of space where we are now. Uh but it's sitting with them and we talk about, you know, should we do this, should we do that? Uh what's the likelihood of them succeeding? Is it well-run? Uh you they may be a great idea, but if they have absolutely no clue how to make it, you can give them some help. and and we do help a lot of people uh who who are giving away money by training them and uh for example we work against uh uh guns, illegal guns. Uh John Feinblad runs it and they've made a big difference passing laws that um require you to have a permit or don't sell to minors or things like that. And and this I'm not opposed to the the the right to have a gun, but letting kids have guns is absolutely outrage. And also, if you have a gun in your household, your gun, and you hide it away all the time, you're 20 times as likely to get killed by that gun than if if the gun wasn't there. Oh, wow. And it's because the kids, you know what kids will do? you'd look in your mother's pocketbook and you'd look what's on the top shelf up there and that sort of stuff. Um, and with with Patty and Ally, we go over and then we have Anthther Williams works on the environmental stuff and we just paid for a new satellite up there to look for methane. Methane is worse than coal even. You can now, however, see it come out of the ground. Typically, it's when they're drilling for oil. And then we'll call up and say, you know, look, you can sell that methane and get make money out of it. Uh, and you most of them I didn't realize that and they want to go along. We've closed over half of the coal fired power plants in Europe and I think it's about 75% of the coal fired power plants in America and um so it's been very successful. We have a long ways to go. Yes. and the the planet is warming at an a a rate that is going to be cataclysmic for everybody. But you can sit around and say, "Well, I just throw my hands up. I can't do anything." No, we're going to keep working and and see what we can do.

### 终身学习与个人遗产

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你是终身学习的坚定信徒，也是我能想到的最好的榜样。你是如何继续学习的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: You mentioned your shelf, and I appreciate you haven't got a gun on your shelf, but you have some Spanish books on your shelves. You are a diehard believer in lifelong learning, and you are the best example I can think of. So, how do you how do you continue to learn?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 今天早上我在学习西班牙语的不规则动词。如果你问我，你应该花时间学习一门外语吗？我可以告诉你，苹果现在有耳机可以为你翻译，软件就在手机里。所以你可以用任何语言和任何人交谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Well, I mean on this morning I was uh studying irregular verbs um in Spanish and if you said to me should you spend your time learning to a foreign language, I can tell you Apple now has earplugs that will translate for you and that's the software is in the phone but whatever and um you know so you can talk to anybody in any language.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 那你为什么还要试着学不规则动词呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So why do you then try to learn irregular verbs?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 我不是运动员。我来自一个家里从不提体育的家庭。所以我学了一项运动，学了高尔夫，因为这是你可以自己做的事情。我需要一些智力上的东西。我的法语得了D。当我上大学时，有德语要求。那是1960年。为什么是德语？因为二战期间没人翻译科学文献。所以我以为必须学习说德语。在德语课上待了三天后，我转到了工程学院。我永远学不会德语，但那是我一直失败或者没有勇气坚持下去的事情。所以为什么不试试呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: I'm not an athlete. I come from a family where sports was never mentioned in the house. Um and so I picked up a sport, picked up golf because it's something you can do on your own and I needed some intellectual thing. And so I was I got a D in French and I went to school at when I went to college there was a German requirement. This was in 1960. Why German? Because nobody had translated the science during World War II. And so I thought uh there was a requirement to to to learn to speak German. Three days in German class, I changed the engineering school. I was never going to learn German, but that was something I always I failed at it or didn't have the guts to go along with it. And so why not try it, you know?

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Mike，你想留下什么样的遗产？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Mike, what do you want uh your legacy to be?

</details>

**Michael Bloomberg**: 例如，我的母校 **Johns Hopkins University**（约翰斯·霍普金斯大学）是该国最好的大学之一，他们做了大量的研究，帮助大量的人接受教育，挽救生命，还有文化等等。我想确保人们回过头来说：“你知道，他真的是一个有能力的人，一个关心他人并为此付诸行动的人。”

我不认为他们会记得我是个伟大的高尔夫球手。那是我做的最荒谬的事情，但我对此很着迷。但我希望人们能这样想。我也想对那些组织说声谢谢。所以我支持童子军，我也支持博物馆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: um that for example John's Hopkins my alma mater is one of the great universities in the country and they do enormous amount of research and help enormous amount of people get educated and save their lives and culture and all that sort of stuff and I want to make sure that people go back and say you know he really was uh a competent a guy who cared about other people and then did something about it. I don't think they're going to remember me as a great golfer. It's the rid most ridiculous thing I do and I'm obsessed with it. So why don't [laughter] but I'd like to think and I think also my kids like I my parents made a very big difference in my life. Um Museum of Science in Boston made a very big difference in my life. The Boy Scouts made a very big difference in my life. Uh, and I'd like to uh say thank you to those organizations. So, I support the Boy Scouts. I also support the museum.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 嗯，你肯定关心他人，而且你为此所做的比我认识的任何人都多。这真是令人难以置信的善举。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Well, you for sure care about people and you've done more about it than anybody else I know. I mean, what an incredible what an incredible what an incredible act.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bloomberg**: Thank you very much. But you can do it, too. just everybody can do it at a different scale [music] and to you know you volunteer and go in and help and uh [clears throat] put the food in for deliveries for free food and there's things you can do and it it's just so satisfying. I don't understand why people don't do it.
