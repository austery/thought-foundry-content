## Introduction

Hello everybody, welcome. I will try to keep an eye on the chat a little bit, but talking to myself and checking the chat are hard things to do, so welcome everyone. This is the August CEO Connect. For those of you who haven't been to one of these before, the intent is really to be transparent about what we're doing, share some information and thoughts that I have, and in large part, help with clarity and alignment.

大家好，欢迎。我会尽量关注一下聊天区，但自言自语和查看聊天记录是两件很难同时做到的事，所以欢迎大家。这是八月份的 CEO Connect。对于那些以前没有参加过的人来说，我们这么做的目的主要是为了公开我们的工作，分享我的一些信息和想法，在很大程度上，帮助大家建立清晰的认识和统一的目标。

I'll share a little bit today around AI, but mostly on some of the engagement surveys that have come back. Then I'm going to delve into strategy and planning a little bit and just give you an overlay in terms of how I'm thinking about it, and how the team has come together post-board meeting to outline and give us some guidance around how we all plan together.

今天我会分享一些关于**人工智能 (AI)** 的内容，但主要会谈谈已经反馈的一些**敬业度调查**结果。然后我会稍微深入探讨一下**战略和规划**，给大家一个总体概念，讲讲我是如何思考这个问题的，以及董事会会议后，团队是如何共同制定大纲，为我们如何一起规划提供指导的。

That said, I'm sure all of you are feeling this as I am; it does feel like one of the busier summers we've had in a while. It's a little chaotic. There's a lot going on. There's a lot of AI that's driving transformation, and yet it's both an opportunity and a threat. So it's a little chaotic and scary, but exciting at the same time. We're trying to do a lot, trying to keep up with all the work that's going on, and recognize we're a little behind where we wanted to be with the plan. I think we're doing a wonderful job moving back in the right direction, and so all of that is kudos to all of you that have found a way to make that happen. For those that have given up some time to make that a reality for us this summer, I appreciate that. Normally it's a little bit quieter, but it has been anything but that this year.

话虽如此，我相信你们和我的感受一样：这确实是近年来我们经历过的最繁忙的夏天之一。情况有点混乱，事情很多。有大量由 **AI（人工智能：模拟人类智能的理论和技术）** 驱动的转型正在发生，这既是机遇也是威胁。所以，这既有点混乱和可怕，但同时也令人兴奋。我们正在努力做很多事情，努力跟上所有正在进行的工作，并认识到我们的计划进度比预期的要晚一些。但我认为我们做得非常出色，正在重回正轨。这一切都要归功于你们所有人，是你们想办法实现了这一切。对于那些在这个夏天牺牲了一些时间来帮助我们实现目标的人，我深表感谢。通常夏天会安静一些，但今年完全不是这样。

With that, I'll get into it. Thanks, everyone, for attending live and for those that are going to check this out later. If you really want to know what's going on in the business, these are great ways to stay in touch. Even if you can't do it during the middle of the day, depending on where you are, it's a great thing to tune back into. These are the things and the highlights of the conversations I'm having with the leadership team and the folks I'm working with. Cascading them can sometimes be like a Xerox copy of a Xerox copy, and we do try our best to make sure that we're all connected on it, but sometimes they take on a life of their own with great intent. So this is a good opportunity to hear from me and get it directly. I will try to answer some questions, but it's always tough to do without having somebody beside me reading them out.

好了，我们开始吧。感谢每一位现场参与的人，也感谢那些稍后会观看录播的人。如果你真的想了解公司的最新动态，这是一个很好的保持联系的方式。即使你因为地理位置原因无法在白天参加，回看录播也是个不错的选择。这些内容是我与领导团队以及同事们交流的重点和精华。信息层层传达有时会像复印件的复印件一样失真，我们尽力确保大家在信息上保持同步，但有时信息在善意的传递中会演变出自己的生命力。所以，这是一个直接从我这里获取信息的好机会。我会尝试回答一些问题，但如果没有人在旁边帮我读出来，这总是有点困难。

## Engagement Survey Insights

OK, so hopefully it's just that one person. I did read that as it comes to the engagement survey, thank you again for all of you who have participated. The net result is, it does reaffirm the fact that we remain a best-in-class company, which means we are a great place to work and we see that affirmation all over the place.

好的，希望只是那一个人听不到。关于**敬业度调查**，我再次感谢所有参与的人。最终结果再次确认了我们仍然是一家顶级的公司，这意味着我们是一个很棒的工作场所，这一点在各方面都得到了证实。

There are areas to work on, and honestly, there are a few areas that we tried to work on. I think one of them was leadership trust, and there are a few other areas that were called out. A lot of really good things, by the way. I tend to apologize if I spend a little bit of time on the opportunities, but those are some areas where we definitely have to do some work. We did spend some time on them. We did some activities specifically from the engagement survey that obviously didn't have the kind of impact we were hoping for. So the leadership team will take that back and understand at a variety of levels what we can do to help improve that.

当然，也有需要改进的地方。老实说，有几个方面我们已经尝试去努力了。我认为其中之一是**领导力信任**，还有其他几个被指出的领域。顺便说一句，其实有很多非常好的方面。如果我在谈论改进机会上花了一些时间，我倾向于先道歉，但这些领域我们确实需要下功夫。我们确实花了一些时间在上面，根据**敬业度调查**的结果开展了一些活动，但显然没有达到我们期望的效果。因此，领导团队会重新审视这个问题，并在不同层面上研究我们能做些什么来帮助改善。

There are so many other things I'm encouraged about and excited about: the direction, the connection and engagement with managers, holding each other accountable. There are just so many good things. If you read through all of it, and I'm not close to being through it all yet, but it's all very strong, very positive, all the things I'd like to see. And there are some course correction opportunities in there as well, all under the hood of "we're actually doing a lot of really good things and it is a great place to work," and the engagement survey again reaffirms that. So it's very similar to the past one and we'll continue to look for opportunities to make this an even greater place to work for all of you. That's what I want for you, that's what I want for me. We should all feel really good about the mission we're on, the people we work with, and the impact we get to have. So that's what we have to put above all the other things and really get focused on the work part of work and enjoying it.

同时，还有很多其他事情让我感到鼓舞和兴奋：公司的发展方向、与经理的联系和互动、以及相互负责的文化。有很多积极的方面。如果你通读了整个报告——虽然我还没完全读完——但内容都非常有力、非常积极，都是我希望看到的。当然，其中也有一些需要纠正航向的机会，但这一切都建立在一个大前提下，那就是“我们实际上在做很多非常棒的事情，这里是一个很棒的工作场所”，而**敬业度调查**再次证实了这一点。所以这次的结果和上次非常相似，我们将继续寻找机会，为你们所有人把这里打造成一个更棒的工作场所。这是我为你们希望的，也是我为自己希望的。我们都应该为我们正在执行的使命、共事的同事以及我们能产生的影响而感到自豪。所以，我们必须把这一点放在首位，真正专注于工作本身，并享受其中。

All of our leaders have that and they have their dashboard, if they have more than four people, to understand and happily share with their team or understand what they can do differently or better. And as we have some things more corporately that we can drive program-wise to continue to address and improve, we'll do that as well. But yeah, lots there. I'll have Horacio talk a little bit more about that when we do the full town hall in September.

我们所有的领导者都收到了报告和他们的数据仪表盘（如果他们团队超过四人），以便于理解并乐于与团队分享，或者思考他们可以做些什么不同的或更好的事情。同时，如果公司层面有一些我们可以通过项目来推动解决和改进的事情，我们也会去做。总之，内容很多。在九月份的全员大会上，我会让霍拉西奥更详细地谈谈这一点。

## The Critical Imperative of AI

I think you all recognize that the world is changing around us and that as a company... I'll just give you a very interesting number that is kind of weighing on me a little bit as a leader of this business, which is the ultimate outcome for us is driving value to stakeholders. And if we get AI right, both how we deliver commercial products to market and how we operate as a business and driving capability through AI, there's a pretty big swing in the value of our company. If we get it right, we get to like this number. If we get it wrong, we'll be valued more like this number. And ultimately, what that means to us is about a $3 billion swing.

我想你们都认识到，我们周围的世界正在发生变化，作为一家公司……我给你们一个非常有趣的数字，这个数字作为公司领导者，让我感到有些压力。我们的最终目标是为利益相关者创造价值。如果我们能正确运用**AI**——无论是我们向市场交付商业产品的方式，还是我们作为企业运营并通过 **AI** 驱动能力的方式——我们公司的价值将会有巨大的波动。如果我们做对了，我们的价值会达到某个数字；如果我们做错了，我们的价值会更接近另一个数字。最终，这对我们来说意味着大约 **30 亿**美元的价值差距。

It is really meaningful, really impactful. And it has us driving really fast. You probably are feeling some of that. But it's not just about waiting for a training tool to show up. This is really about all of us professionally developing and owning it ourselves. And we as an organization will help as much as possible, but you have to own that because the skill set we need to operate in our profession, in any profession, in this business, in any business, is going to expect something very different. And so retraining, upskilling, and a growth mindset... if you're stuck in your ways and you're going to have the same job doing the same thing for the next number of years, this is not the right place because we can't afford that. We have to help each other up. We have to work together, we have to refine our skills.

这真的意义重大，影响深远。这也促使我们必须快速前进。你们可能已经感受到了其中的一些压力。但这不仅仅是等待一个培训工具的出现。这关系到我们每一个人都要进行专业发展，并自己承担起这个责任。作为一个组织，我们会尽可能提供帮助，但你们必须自己主导，因为我们这个行业、任何行业、这家公司、任何公司所需要的技能组合，都将发生巨大的变化。所以，重新培训、提升技能和拥有**成长心态**……如果你固步自封，打算在未来几年里继续做同样的工作，那么这里不适合你，因为我们承担不起这样的代价。我们必须互相帮助，共同努力，不断提升我们的技能。

And invariably, no matter what you want to do, if you're going to recruit and go somewhere else, they're going to ask for the same things. I just want to go faster and I don't want to lose to somebody who has that capability and has moved faster and has taken the opportunity in front of us because they've decided to embrace it. So that's kind of a call to action for all of us. I'll say it over and over and over again until you get sick and tired of hearing it. But we have to operate differently in terms of our ability to move through a lot of work much faster. That's roughly what it comes down to. And ultimately the end goal is delivering way more value for our customers and our stakeholders.

而且，无论你想做什么，如果你要去其他地方应聘，他们也会要求同样的技能。我只是想走得更快，我不想输给那些已经具备这种能力、行动更快、并且因为决定拥抱变化而抓住机遇的人。所以，这对我们所有人来说都是一个行动号召。我会一遍又一遍地重复，直到你们听烦为止。但我们必须改变我们的运作方式，以更快地完成大量工作。这基本上就是核心所在。最终的目标是为我们的客户和利益相关者创造更大的价值。

So there's a lot to get through. I don't have the perfect program for everybody. There's a lot of great progress going on in our ability to get things out commercially and what we're doing internally in small pockets and bigger things. So what I will tell you is we all have to learn. This isn't an "outsource it to somebody else to figure it out." We all have to do it in our everyday life and all of our work in how we operate. We all have to get better. And if you feel like somebody's on it and you don't need to learn it, that's not the right answer. You all need to up your AI skills.

所以有很多工作要做。我没有一个适合所有人的完美方案。我们在商业化产品推出能力上取得了很大进展，内部也在大大小小的方面有所行动。所以我要告诉你们的是，我们所有人都必须学习。这不是一个可以“外包给别人去解决”的问题。我们每个人都必须在日常生活中、在所有工作中、在我们运营的方方面面去实践它。我们都必须变得更好。如果你觉得已经有人在负责了，你就不需要学了，那这个想法是错误的。你们所有人都需要提升自己的**AI技能**。

I empathize with the fact that there is a lot of work on all of you and it's really tough to move away from production to creating production capacity, meaning the learning side. And so there's time available. I'm not suggesting that your wonderful Friday afternoon is spending four hours on AI, but there is time. And if there isn't time, you need to make some time. My time is probably not during the day, but I have to do what I need to do. And so it's just, we have to own it. I'm not owning it for you, I'm not making you do it, but you have to own it. You have to believe in it and you have to drive, and our roles and our definitions of what everything looks like will change over time. It just has to.

我理解你们每个人都有很多工作，要从日常生产工作中抽身去创造生产能力（也就是学习）真的很难。但时间是有的。我不是建议你用美好的周五下午花四个小时学习**AI**，但时间是存在的。如果没有时间，你就需要挤出一些时间。我的学习时间可能不在白天，但我必须做我需要做的事情。所以，我们必须自己承担起这个责任。我不能替你承担，我也不会强迫你，但你必须自己去主导。你必须相信它，你必须去推动，我们的角色和对所有事物的定义都会随着时间而改变。这是必然的。

I would say we have been pretty far behind as I compared to other CEOs and organizations, like significantly behind. They're in some cases two years ahead and we have to close that gap very quickly. So it's not just about moving at a pace that others might have been moving because their baseline is already ahead of where we're at. I'm seeing a lot of good things, but we've skipped the bleeding edge side of things where there's a lot of tools that didn't work, but we have an opportunity to catch up. So we need to do that and exceed.

与其他 CEO 和组织相比，我想说我们已经落后很多了，是明显落后。在某些情况下，他们领先我们两年，我们必须非常迅速地缩小这个差距。所以，这不仅仅是跟上别人的步伐，因为他们的起点已经领先于我们。我看到了很多好的进展，我们跳过了那些有很多无效工具的“前沿试错”阶段，但我们现在有机会迎头赶上。所以我们需要做到这一点，并且超越他们。

I've said this to a number of folks, but I'm kind of sick and tired of people saying "you should go see this company, you should talk to this company." If I have 55 meetings a week with all the other companies doing great things in AI, I'm kind of tired of being the one that's talking to other companies. I really want my phone to start ringing off the hook about "tell us what you're doing to make PointClickCare so amazing and how you're transforming and how you're growing." So that's going to take us a little bit of work, but that's one of the outcomes I'd like to get to, is people are coming to us to find out how we did it. How did we unlock it? That's kind of an interesting objective or milestone, but that's kind of what I'm queuing in on: how many people are calling me or all of you for that matter.

我已经对很多人说过这话，但我真的厌倦了人们总是说“你应该去看看这家公司，你应该和那家公司谈谈。”如果我每周要开55个会，都是和那些在**AI**领域做得很好的公司交流，我真的厌倦了总是去向别人学习。我真正希望的是，我的电话能被打爆，人们都来问我们：“告诉我们你们是怎么把 PointClickCare 做得这么棒的？你们是如何转型和成长的？”这需要我们付出一些努力，但这是我希望达成的结果之一：人们来找我们，想知道我们是怎么做到的，我们是如何解锁潜力的。这是一个很有趣的目标或者说里程碑，但这也是我关注的重点：有多少人因为这个来找我，或者找你们。

## Introducing the One-Page Strategy

I do want to spend my time on strategy and planning. As you all know, we spent time with the board in June. We digest, understand, and try to put together a company strategy to help the rest of us plan. What we've decided to do this year was move into what is effectively a one-pager. It's in draft, and I'm going to share it with you today. Know that there'll be some adjustments to it, but I just want to give you a sense of where we're headed. It's probably a little longer than 8 by 11, maybe it's 8 and a half by 14 legal, but it's pretty close to on a page. And so it would be a really nice thing to have alongside you as you think about your everyday work.

我确实想花时间谈谈**战略和规划**。大家都知道，我们在六月和董事会进行了交流。我们消化、理解并试图制定一个公司战略，以帮助我们其他人进行规划。今年我们决定采用一种实质上的“**单页战略**”模式。这还是草稿，我今天会和大家分享。请知悉后续还会有一些调整，但我只是想让你们了解我们前进的方向。它可能比一张 A4 纸长一点，也许是法律文件尺寸，但基本上就是一页纸的内容。这样，在你们思考日常工作时，手边能有这样一份文件会非常好。

What we did do is use the "Advantage" format, for anybody who still uses a hardcover book. It's Patrick Lencioni, and it's a great way to think about organizational health and how to create clarity across the organization. I think that's really important right now. And so it's a very easy thing to check in on. It gives everyone an ability to validate that the work they're doing is aligned with the corporate strategy. It's that simple. I use the Southwest example. Their concept was to "democratize air travel." And so that meant they needed to do things at the lowest cost possible. That drove a lot of decisions in their organization, like not putting first class in the plane because that's going to add cost. A number of decisions were based on their core values and their strategic pillars. So that's kind of what we've put together to help. If you have read the book, you recognize that it's a really nice way to articulate your business and how your own team can connect with it.

我们采用了《优势》这本书里的格式，推荐给还在读实体书的人。作者是帕特里克·兰西奥尼（Patrick Lencioni），这本书提供了一种很好的方式来思考组织健康以及如何在整个组织中建立清晰度。我认为这在当前至关重要。这是一个很容易参照检查的工具。它让每个人都能验证自己所做的工作是否与公司战略保持一致。就这么简单。我以西南航空为例，他们的理念是“**让航空旅行大众化**”。这意味着他们需要以尽可能低的成本来运营。这驱动了他们组织内部的许多决策，比如不在飞机上设置头等舱，因为这会增加成本。许多决策都是基于他们的核心价值观和战略支柱。我们所做的，就是类似这样来提供帮助。如果你读过这本书，你会发现这是一种阐述你的业务以及让团队与之建立联系的绝佳方式。

So I'm going to walk you through a little bit of that.

所以，我将带你们简单地过一遍。

## Core Purpose and Behaviors

Here's what I'll tell you. We have that core purpose: Why do we exist? You've heard that before. What we do, we talk about tackling critical challenges in long-term care and transitions of care, largely the intersections of our two businesses. It's in transitions where we really power insights, and all of our business as we come together with powerful technology and insights. And so it's really trying to create some clarity on what we really do.

我告诉你们，我们有那个核心目标：我们为什么存在？你们以前听过。我们的工作是解决**长期护理**和**医护过渡**中的关键挑战，这主要是我们两大业务的交集所在。正是在**医护过渡**中，我们通过强大的技术和洞察力，真正发挥了作用。所以，这实际上是在努力明确我们到底在做什么。

Then I want to be careful on this because it's a bit of a work in progress when you think about some of the values and brand in our HR and culture work and performance. So just know that this needs a little bit of work to bring all the work around values together. But what I really wanted to articulate is, to some extent, a little bit aspirational: How do we want to behave in market? How do we want other people to talk about us?

然后，在这一点上我要谨慎一些，因为当我们思考人力资源、文化工作和绩效中的一些价值观和品牌时，这仍是一个正在进行中的工作。所以请知悉，我们需要做些工作来整合所有围绕价值观的工作。但我真正想阐明的是，在某种程度上，带有一些期望性的：我们希望在市场上如何表现？我们希望别人如何谈论我们？

For example, I met with somebody from Epic last week, and what I found with Epic, and as I've heard about them, they all show up in a very similar way. And I was like, "Well, why is that?" Well, it's because they train on it. "This is how we operate." And so when they meet with you, if you've met with them before, they don't really care about how much money is on the table. What they care about is how are we going to make our customer's lives better and what is the problem we're going to solve, and is it meaningful enough to go after? It's not about "let's go make money together." It never came up in my conversations. It's "do you think there's a really meaningful healthcare problem we could tackle together and make a meaningful difference?" I'm like, "Yes." Very interesting to me.

例如，我上周和 Epic 的人见了面，我发现 Epic 的人，以及我听说的关于他们的事，他们的表现方式都非常相似。我当时想，“嗯，这是为什么？”答案是，因为他们对此进行培训。“这就是我们的行事方式。”所以当你和他们会面时，如果你以前和他们打过交道，你会发现他们并不真正在乎桌上有多少钱。他们关心的是，我们如何能让客户的生活变得更好，我们要解决什么问题，以及这个问题是否足够有意义去追求。这无关“我们一起去赚钱吧”，在我的谈话中从未出现过。他们会问：“你认为我们是否可以共同解决一个真正有意义的医疗保健问题，并产生有意义的影响？”我说：“是的。”这对我来说非常有趣。

As you think about how we want to show up, I really want to show up and listen. I want to make sure that we are recognized for moving fast. We have empathy, we take action, we focus on a win-win relationship, which is, I don't want to win if our partner doesn't win. That's not how I want to be known.

当我们思考我们希望如何表现时，我真心希望我们能够倾听。我希望我们以行动迅速而闻名。我们有**同理心**，我们采取行动，我们专注于**双赢**的关系，也就是说，如果我们的合作伙伴不能赢，我也不想赢。我不想因此而出名。

Generally speaking, our mindset has to be "idea to action." You know, show courage and character, embrace growth, and raise the bar on it. At times, we feel like a lot of people are getting things done because there are so many of us. And in fact, nobody takes ownership and it kind of gets lost. I found that with a number of customer interactions recently: a lot of talk, not a lot of action. And I don't love that. For me, it's like we have to have that responsibility. I don't care what level of the organization you're at. I do things that many other folks multiple levels down from me wouldn't do because I just need to own it and I need to go get it done because I'm committed to it.

总的来说，我们的心态必须是“**从想法到行动**”。要展现勇气和品格，拥抱成长，并不断提高标准。有时候，我们觉得好像很多人都在做事，因为我们人多。但实际上，没有人真正承担起责任，事情就这样不了了之了。我最近在一些客户互动中发现了这个问题：说得多，做得少。我不喜欢这样。对我来说，我们必须要有那种责任感。我不在乎你身处组织的哪个层级。我会做一些比我低好几个级别的人都不会做的事情，因为我需要承担责任，我需要去完成它，因为我对此有承诺。

The other thing is "love the ride." Like, continue to be curious, celebrate wins, have fun, enjoy. You need to enjoy the work we're doing here and people need to feel that too. High energy, lots of fun. And then on the partner side, I do think the "listen first" mindset is a really important one. Oftentimes we talk to people, and it's a real skill to spend time just listening. You learn so much asking the right questions, listening. And it's a skill, but I want to be known for that. We act with a sense of urgency. We deliver extreme value. We care about their success because it's really what determines our success.

另一件事是“**享受过程**”。要保持好奇心，庆祝胜利，享受乐趣。你需要享受我们在这里所做的工作，并且人们也需要感受到这一点。充满活力，充满乐趣。然后在合作伙伴方面，我确实认为“**倾听第一**”的心态非常重要。我们经常与人交谈，而花时间倾听是一项真正的技能。通过问正确的问题和倾听，你能学到很多。这是一项技能，但我希望我们因此而闻名。我们以紧迫感行事，我们提供极致的价值，我们关心他们的成功，因为这真正决定了我们的成功。

So there's a lot in there, but we're going to have to bring this back to our values, how it affects our culture, how it affects our brand. And so they will all come together. This is just throwing it out there to say, here are the things I think about the business we need to be relative to the challenge in front of us.

所以这里面有很多内容，但我们必须将这些与我们的价值观联系起来，思考它如何影响我们的文化和品牌。最终它们会融为一体。我只是把这些想法抛出来，想说，面对我们眼前的挑战，这些是我认为我们的业务需要具备的特质。

## Strategic Anchors

Strategic anchors are the things that as we do work, we kind of connect back to. So when we think about how we're going to succeed as a business, I truly believe we have to win at the point of care. And even more so now as you think about AI, there are lots of people building on top of our capabilities across our whole business. And those are all opportunities for us to come and really influence and be that workflow. With the advent of AI and the ability to screen scrape and use **RPA (Robotic Process Automation: 使用软件机器人自动执行重复性任务的技术)** and other things, others have an ability to kind of bring this data out and create a much better workflow and start to own the end user. And that is the challenge we need to navigate against. There are pockets of that happening and we run the risk of becoming kind of the new version of a database with all of this intelligence on top. And that's where the value is. We need to go there faster. So let's not get caught up working on some of the things where we have to be indispensable to the end user and own the things that they need to do as quickly and as effectively as possible.

**战略支柱**是我们工作时需要回归和参照的基石。所以，当我们思考如何作为一家企业取得成功时，我坚信我们必须在**护理服务点**上取胜。尤其是在现在 **AI** 时代，有很多人在我们整个业务能力的基础上进行构建。这些都是我们去真正施加影响、成为那个工作流程一部分的机会。随着 **AI** 的出现以及屏幕抓取和**RPA（机器人流程自动化）** 等技术的能力，其他人有能力提取这些数据，创造出更好的工作流程，并开始拥有终端用户。这是我们需要应对的挑战。这种情况正在局部发生，我们面临着沦为一种新型数据库的风险，所有智能都建立在我们之上。而价值就在于此，我们需要更快地到达那里。所以，我们不要把精力耗费在那些让我们必须对终端用户不可或缺、并尽可能快、有效地掌握他们所需工作的事情上。

This leads me into #2: more sustainable. Meaning, if we don't add AI automation capability, remove some of the administrative burden, the clinical burden, the ability for them to operate efficiently and effectively very quickly, making great decisions about who they're going to take in, who's transitioning, who they're treating, they're going to struggle to run an effective business given the constraints and the cost constraints around them. And so we want our customers to be really effective with the tooling that we provide.

这引出了第二点：更具**可持续性**。也就是说，如果我们不增加 **AI 自动化**能力，不减轻一些行政负担、临床负担，不让他们能够非常迅速、高效地运营，就接收谁、谁在转诊、治疗谁等问题做出明智的决策，那么在他们面临的限制和成本约束下，他们将难以有效经营。所以我们希望我们的客户能通过我们提供的工具真正实现高效。

The other one is right in the intersection of our two businesses. I think we have a great opportunity to transform transitions of care. This is the ability for us to take our network, our businesses, our intelligence, our instrumentation and allow us to really effectively optimize transitions for all stakeholders. To optimize healthcare, actually get to the right place at the right time with the right data, the right information, and really help them move through and get the care they deserve in the place they can do it at the most reasonable cost possible, at the greatest rate, with obviously thinking about their dignity. And so we have all of this data that we can use very differently than anybody else and have an unparalleled position to make that a reality. I think we need to lead that. That is where the intersections of our business are. That's really the opportunity we haven't delivered on yet in terms of bringing the AMP and senior care businesses together. And we are just at the beginning of doing some really interesting things there.

另一个支柱正处于我们两大业务的交汇点。我认为我们有绝佳的机会来**变革医护过渡**。这是我们利用我们的网络、业务、智能和工具，为所有利益相关者真正有效优化**医护过渡**的能力。为了优化医疗保健，我们实际上要确保患者在正确的时间、正确的地点，获得正确的数据和信息，真正帮助他们顺利完成流程，并在最合理成本、最高效率的地方，获得他们应得的、有尊严的护理。我们拥有所有这些数据，可以以与众不同的方式加以利用，并处于一个无与伦*比的位置来实现这一目标。我认为我们需要引领这一变革。这就是我们业务的交汇点所在，也是我们在整合 AMP 和老年护理业务方面尚未完全实现的机会。我们才刚刚开始在这方面做一些非常有趣的事情。

And then, I have to talk about our strategic anchor of being that trusted partner that innovates, that has a track record that they know, like and trust. And that's been earned over decades. And if you talk to anyone of our customers, their intent and their desire is to buy more from us. And so that means we trust you, we like you, we need more from you. So it's kind of doing all of those things and delivering more capability or delivering on the promises or the value that we've articulated. So it's just continuing to think about that as one of the most meaningful anchors that we have.

然后，我必须谈谈我们的另一个战略支柱：成为那个客户了解、喜爱并信任的、不断创新的**可信赖的合作伙伴**。这是我们几十年积累下来的声誉。如果你和我们的任何一个客户交谈，他们的意图和愿望都是从我们这里购买更多产品。这意味着他们信任我们，喜欢我们，需要我们提供更多。所以，这就是要做所有这些事情，提供更多的能力，兑现我们的承诺或我们所阐述的价值。我们需要继续将此视为我们拥有的最有意义的支柱之一。

## The Rally Cry: Better and Faster with AI

The most important thing we need to think about, the organization-wide rally cry is "better and faster with AI." That's what we need to do. And this is not a 10-year thing. This is not a "we need to do this widget or that." It's like, as a business, it has to be pervasive in everything we do, both internally and externally. It has to. It doesn't define us, but it has to accelerate us. And so that is the rally cry.

我们需要思考的最重要的事情，整个组织的战斗口号是：“**用 AI 变得更好、更快**。” 这就是我们需要做的。这不是一个十年的计划，也不是“我们需要做这个小工具或那个”。作为一家企业，它必须渗透到我们所做的每一件事中，无论是内部还是外部。必须如此。它不定义我们，但它必须加速我们。所以，这就是我们的战斗口号。

As individuals, as teams, as work that we do, as processes that we kill through automating certain things or enhancing, it's creating this environment. The objectives for '26 look like this, but it is really, really meaningful. And this is not something you're going to hear me stop talking about. In fact, you're going to get super sick of it, but it's everything we do. There'll be an assessment in terms of where are you relative to your AI? How empowered are you? How capable are you? How much have you learned? How far down the path are you? What do you need to do in this job to be effective? That's what you need to be thinking about.

作为个人、作为团队、在我们所做的工作中、在我们通过自动化或增强来优化的流程中，我们正在创造这样一个环境。26财年的目标看起来是这样，但这真的非常重要。你们会一直听到我谈论这个，事实上，你们可能会听得非常厌烦，但这关系到我们所做的一切。将会有一个评估，看你在 **AI** 方面处于什么位置？你被赋予了多少能力？你的能力如何？你学了多少？你在这条路上走了多远？你需要在这份工作中做什么才能高效？这些都是你需要思考的问题。

We're recruiting for AI as a core capability, not optional. We shouldn't be recruiting anybody who's not super AI-enabled, right? And so that also means, well, that's a bar we set for people coming in. What bar do we set for our own team? Secondly, we have Navy SEAL teams, I think we have 5 or 6 now, and their core focus is to deliver commercial solutions ASAP. And as a leadership team, we're connecting with them to make sure we unblock everything possible to allow them to go fast and create a capability for all teams to perform with AI-native solutions that power everything we do.

我们在招聘时将 **AI** 作为一项核心能力，而不是可选项。我们不应该招聘任何不具备强大 **AI** 能力的人，对吧？这也意味着，这是我们为新员工设定的标准。那么，我们为自己的团队设定了什么标准呢？其次，我们有“海豹突击队”，我想现在有5到6个，他们的核心任务是尽快交付商业解决方案。作为领导团队，我们正在与他们沟通，确保我们为他们扫清一切障碍，让他们能够快速前进，并为所有团队创造一种能力，让他们能够使用驱动我们一切工作的 **AI** 原生解决方案来执行任务。

My point to you is there's a lot of things we could do. If we don't do this, we put our business at risk. It's not a small thing. It's a really, really big thing. And so if you're not saying "AI" multiple times a day or thinking about it multiple times a day, I failed you. But that is a huge challenge for all of us, and all of us have to do the work. There's no shortcut here.

我想对你们说的是，我们可以做很多事情。但如果我们不这样做，我们的业务就会面临风险。这不是一件小事，这是一件非常非常大的事。所以，如果你不是每天多次提到或思考 **AI**，那就是我的失败。但这对我们所有人来说都是一个巨大的挑战，我们所有人都必须投入工作。这里没有捷径。

## Key Objectives for FY26

This is kind of where we landed on the objectives. The first two are really key focus areas. It's really if you think about taking the solutions we have and powering them with AI, that's like, go fast, embed them, deliver great value in the solutions we offer, and do that as quick as possible. So some will be new solutions, some will be augmenting the solutions we have: Chart Defence, Discharge Reason for Transfer, the eDO SNF Summary. We started to work on an intake solution and may be talking about it later, but just continuing to drive lots of capability with AI into the workflows and look for new opportunities where we can have a solution coming out alongside our current solutions.

这些就是我们最终确定的目标。前两个是真正的关键重点领域。如果你考虑将我们现有的解决方案用 **AI** 来赋能，那就是：快速行动，嵌入 **AI**，在我们提供的解决方案中创造巨大价值，并尽快完成。所以，有些会是新解决方案，有些会是对现有解决方案的增强：比如图表防御（Chart Defence）、转院出院原因、电子出院医嘱（eDO）的专业护理机构（SNF）摘要。我们已经开始着手一个入院解决方案，稍后可能会谈到，但总的来说，就是继续用 **AI** 驱动工作流程中的大量能力，并寻找新的机会，让新解决方案能与我们现有方案并行推出。

The second one is really the internal side: embracing an AI-first mindset to move faster and innovate. How are we helping you get there? What can we do to give you time to upskill, tools, capabilities, opportunities, all of the above. And so that's collectively we're all trying to figure that out, largely looking at Horacio's team to help with that. But we all will have an opportunity to reimagine our functions and how we want them to run in the future.

第二个目标主要是内部方面：**拥抱 AI 优先的心态以更快地行动和创新**。我们如何帮助你们实现这一点？我们能做些什么来给你们时间提升技能、提供工具、能力和机会等等。我们大家都在共同努力解决这个问题，主要依靠霍拉西奥的团队来帮助。但我们所有人都将有机会重新构想我们的职能以及我们希望它们在未来如何运作。

You'll see one at the bottom: "operationalize idea to action." We talk about process and I would say I would prefer progress over process. As you get bigger, as you get to the size we are, there's a lot of process. And I really want to find a way to kind of pull as much of that out as possible and really, really drive towards progress as a priority and process as a supporting role versus the other way around.

你们会看到底部有一条：“**将想法付诸行动并制度化**”。我们谈论流程，但我想说，我更倾向于进步而非流程。随着公司规模变大，达到我们现在的规模，流程会变得很多。我真的想找到一种方法，尽可能地去除那些不必要的流程，真正将进步作为优先事项，而流程则作为支持角色，而不是反过来。

Executing go-to-market transformation is critical for us to deliver on the POV. If you don't know what that acronym means, it's not "point of view," but it is delivering great value for price to our customers and ensuring that we strike a balance there and invest to ensure they get the outcome and optimize that investment. There's a big expectation around that, so it's not optional. I think we've started to move through it; the team's done a really nice job and we're starting to get there. In FY26, this will be almost the only way we operate and we have to figure out the pace that rolls out. But it's really nice talking to customers about packages over what ad hoc solution you want today because in the end, this is going to help them get to value faster.

**执行市场进入转型**对于我们实现 POV 至关重要。如果你不知道这个缩写的意思，它不是“观点”（point of view），而是为我们的客户提供物超所值的服务，并确保我们在其中取得平衡，通过投资来确保他们获得成果并优化该投资。对此有很高的期望，所以这不是可选项。我认为我们已经开始行动了，团队做得非常好，我们正在逐步实现目标。到26财年，这几乎将是我们唯一的运营方式，我们必须确定推出的节奏。但与客户讨论套餐方案，而不是他们今天想要什么临时解决方案，感觉非常好，因为最终这将帮助他们更快地实现价值。

Earning the trust and confidence of senior living. We've gone down a path this last year where we haven't done as well in the pure-play side as we would have liked. In fact, not well at all. I think we know that we generally run well on the diversified side. In the future, I'd like to make sure that we're delivering really well for existing customers that have senior living, but also carving out a way to support as quickly as possible that pure-play market that identifies itself very differently than the diversified market. The challenge there has been the pace at which we're moving relative to running off of the monolith and trying to create pace on what is a pretty heavy way of working. So we need to figure that out. Don't have the answer just yet, but that's something that we need to go do in '26.

**赢得老年生活市场的信任和信心**。去年我们在这条路上走得并不理想，在纯粹的老年生活领域，我们的表现远不及预期。事实上，表现很差。我想我们都知道，在多元化业务方面我们通常运营得很好。未来，我希望确保我们为现有拥有老年生活业务的客户提供优质服务，同时也要尽快找到一种方法来支持那个纯粹的老年生活市场，这个市场与多元化市场有很大的不同。我们面临的挑战是，相对于在庞大的单一系统上运行，我们前进的速度很慢，并且试图在一种相当笨重的工作方式上创造节奏。所以我们需要解决这个问题。目前还没有答案，但这是我们在26财年需要去做的事情。

And then optimize transitions of care, you heard me talk a lot about that. So that's kind of what I will tell you as you get into some of the measures. We tie these initiatives or priorities back to objectives, back to strategic anchors. So we're like, "OK, that does line up. It does make sense. They're really well connected." And then we get into how do we measure them. For example, if I measure whether we're doing things commercially with AI, we need to generate a certain percentage of our new revenue, our bookings, off of AI-powered solutions. That's how we're going to be measured as a business. And so we need to think about that and what are we doing to make that a reality?

然后是**优化医护过渡**，你们听我谈了很多。所以，当你们看到一些衡量标准时，这就是我要告诉你们的。我们将这些举措或优先事项与目标、与战略支柱联系起来。所以我们会说：“好的，这确实是吻合的，说得通，它们联系得很紧密。”然后我们就要考虑如何衡量它们。例如，如果我要衡量我们是否在商业上使用 **AI**，我们需要从 **AI** 驱动的解决方案中产生一定比例的新收入和预订量。这就是我们将作为一项业务被衡量的方式。所以我们需要思考这个问题，以及我们正在做什么来实现它。

That's the one-pager that we're trying to put together for all of you to be able to have and continue your planning from and learn from. We'll adjust as we go. We don't start the year until November, so this is really about helping with the planning and making sure we have the investments and teams aligned with the right work in the right place that connect to those things. And so everything should kind of fall out of that nicely.

这就是我们试图为你们所有人准备的**单页战略**，让你们能够拥有它，并据此继续你们的规划和学习。我们会边做边调整。我们的财年要到11月才开始，所以这主要是为了帮助规划，确保我们的投资和团队与正确的工作、在正确的地方保持一致，并与这些目标相连。这样，一切都应该能顺利地从中衍生出来。

## Conclusion

I know there's a lot of change and a little bit of chaos and lots going on, but I hope that will give you an opportunity to stay focused on what matters, which is delivering value for our customers, running a great business, and staying aligned with the things that we think are the right answers to getting those outcomes. I appreciate the fact that there is a lot of hard work going on and I want to make sure that we get full value out of all of the hard work that you put in. I want to be careful that if we're not really well aligned on the work we're doing, we kind of get caught off and are like, "actually that doesn't matter." No, let's make sure we get full value out of every ounce of effort we put in as a team. So that's really what that's hoping to do. And we should question and leverage those strategic pillars and the one-page strategy to question everything we do and make sure it aligns and it's the right thing, and at all levels, by the way. Me included.

我知道有很多变化，有点混乱，有很多事情在发生，但我希望这能给你们一个机会，专注于重要的事情，那就是为我们的客户创造价值，经营好一个伟大的企业，并与我们认为能带来这些结果的正确方向保持一致。我感谢大家正在付出的辛勤努力，我想确保你们付出的所有辛劳都能得到充分的回报。我希望能谨慎行事，如果我们所做的工作没有很好地对齐，我们可能会半途而废，然后说：“其实那不重要。”不，让我们确保我们团队付出的每一分努力都能产生全部的价值。这就是这个战略希望达成的目标。我们应该利用这些战略支柱和单页战略来审视我们所做的一切，确保它方向一致、是正确的事情——顺便说一句，这适用于所有层级，包括我。

With that, I'm going to close. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully that was informative, helpful. That's kind of what's on my mind, where I'm spending my time, among other things, and what I really, really care about. And there are a lot of people involved in helping craft that, so thank you for that. Keep enjoying the ride. Challenge yourself, challenge each other, keep growing. Try AI. I'm basically a beginner at it myself. I struggle building agents and doing things, and you know, it's hard, so I'm trying. I'm sure all of you are too. Nonetheless, have a great day. Thank you for the time. Keep killing it. Really proud and excited about our business and the fact that we all choose to be here, and excited to work with you all.

就到这里，我准备结束了。感谢你们花时间倾听。希望这次分享信息丰富、有帮助。这些就是我脑子里想的，我花时间在做的事情，以及我真正关心的事情。有很多人参与帮助制定这个战略，所以谢谢你们。继续享受这个过程吧。挑战自己，挑战彼此，不断成长。尝试一下 **AI**。我自己基本上也是个初学者，我在构建代理和做一些事情时也很挣扎，这很难，但我正在努力。我相信你们也一样。尽管如此，祝大家有美好的一天。谢谢你们的时间。继续加油。我为我们的事业和我们都选择在这里感到非常自豪和兴奋，也很高兴能和大家一起工作。
